The European Commission is reportedly planning to  fine Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and the Danish airline Maersk Air for operating a  cartel on the route between Copenhagen, Denmark and Stockholm, Sweden.

The EU first became suspicious of an illegal  agreement between the two airlines when Maersk Air withdrew from the route shortly after signing a 'contract of co-operation' with SAS in 1999. The European Commission launched an investigation in a bid to establish whether Maersk Air ceased operating on the route of its own accord or by mutual  agreement with SAS.

The fine could be as much as 10% of the two companies' total turnover, according to The Copenhagen

BRUSSELS, July 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission will on Wednesday  fine Scandinavian airline SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air over a cooperation agreement that was found to violate European Union antitrust law, an EU source said on Tuesday.
"There will be a  fine," the source said, declining to give the amount.

TD
The Commission said on February it had formally warned  SAS and Maersk Air that their cooperation
agreement had broken EU antitrust law and it was considering imposing fines.

"We are waiting for information from Brussels. When we know what the decision is,  SAS will comment," Marie Ehrling,  SAS executive vice president for airline operations told Reuters by telephone.
She said SAS President and Chief Executive Jorgen Lindegaard was scheduled to comment on the
Commission's ruling on Wednesday at 1100 GMT.

At Maersk Air headquarters in Copenhagen nobody was available for comment. At  Maersk Air's parent company A.P. Moeller, an official said the information department would be open on Wednesday morning.

In March 1999,  SAS and Maersk notified the Commission of details of a cooperation  agreement, which mainly involved code-sharing and frequent-flyer programmes.

But a preliminary inquiry by the Commission found that the cooperation extended beyond that outlined to Brussels.

Last June, the Commission said EU antitrust offficials raided offices of  SAS, Maersk Air and A.P. Moeller.

The Commission said then it was investigating whether  Maersk Air decided unilaterally to stop operations between Stockholm and Copenhagen and on other routes and whether that decision was taken in conjunction with  SAS. (Additional reporting by Peter Starck in Stockholm).

The European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined Scandanavian carrier SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air a total of E52.5m ($45.1m) for colluding in running a monopoly on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, one of the region's busiest.

The findings that the two airlines had reached a secret  agreement came after a year-long investigation into practices adopted by the two airlines after reaching a commercial  agreement in 1998.

TD
Commission officials raided both companies' head offices last June and uncovered the existence of a secret pact that included a non-compete clause on  SAS' routes out of Copenhagen and  Maersk's routes out of Billund in Denmark.

As part of the deal  Maersk pulled off the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, which is used by 1m passengers a year, and in return  SAS pulled off routes from Billund to Venice and Frankfurt.

SAS, which is majority owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, was  fined E39.4m.  Maersk, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Danish energy and shipping group A.P. Moeller Maersk, was told to pay E13.1m.

SAS said it "deeply regretted" the infringement but said it was considering an appeal against the size of the fine.

The Commission said in a statement: "This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers. The Commission is determined to ensure that the liberalisation achieved in
the European air transport in the last decade is not undermined by anti-competitive agreements."

LONDON - European Union competition regulators on Wednesday fined Maersk Air and Scandinavian Airlines System a combined $45 million for operating a secret agreement that led to  SAS                      monopolizing the Copenhagen-Stockholm route. "This is a clear case of two airlines sharing a market illegally, " EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The European Commission said that when the two carriers sought approval for a code-sharing agreement in October 1998, they "carefully omitted what amounts to being a broad market-sharing agreement" that involved  Maersk Air withdrawing from the Copenhagen-Stockholm route and  SAS' exit from routes between Copenhagen and Venice and Frankfurt and Billund, Denmark's second airport.

TD
Maersk Air, a subsidiary of Danish shipowner A.P. Moller, agreed to an overall non-compete clause under which it would not launch any international routes from Copenhagen without approval from  SAS.

The secret agreement is "a very serious violation" of EU competition law and very damaging to Scandinavian passengers who were left with reduced choices or no choice at all, and potential higher prices, the commission said.

SAS was fined the equivalent of $33.86 million and  Maersk Air $11.28 million.

HD     EU fines SAS, Maersk Air over route-fixing

BRUSSELS, July 18 (AFP) - The European Commission slapped SAS and Maersk Air with 52.5 million euros (45.3 million dollars) in heavy fines Wednesday for cutting a secret deal to monopolize air routes in Scandinavia.

Under the agreement, SAS alone flew the Copenhagen-Stockholm route used by one million air travellers a year, while sharing out other routes in and out of Denmark with  Maersk Air.

TD
"This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement.

"I trust that the  fines imposed on SAS and Maersk Air will serve as a deterrent to them and to others," he said.

SAS said in a statement it considered the  fine disproportionate and was weighing whether to appeal the
fine.

"I deeply regret that SAS has infringed the competition rules of the European Union in this case," said Joergen Lindegaard, SAS chief executive, adding that he intended to "ensure that this will never happen again."

But "the decision seems to be politically influenced, and should be looked upon as a signal to the entire airline industry and its market practises," he said.

Maersk Air also said it had "taken note" of the commission decision, and was considering whether to appeal the size of the  fine.

SAS, co-owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, is to pay 39.375 million euros in
fines, with the rest to be borne by  Maersk Air, a unit of Denmark's A.P. Moller shipping group.

Though the two airlines told Brussels in 1998 that they had struck a cooperation  agreement, they "carefully omitted" to explain that  Maersk Air had also agreed to leave the Copenhagen-Stockholm run exclusively to SAS, Monti's statement said.
In return,  SAS dropped out of the Copenhagen-Venice route, as well as stopped flying between Billund, in
Denmark's Jutland region, and Frankfurt, Germany.

Raids by commission officials on the two carriers' offices in June 2000 also revealed a non-competition pact whereby Maersk Air was not to launch any new international services without prior consent from SAS.

HD    European Commission fines SAS and Maersk Air for infringing European competition rules

The European Commission said today (18 July) that it had  fined the pan-Scandinavian airline SAS and the Danish airline Maersk Air A/S, part of the AP Moller group, for operating a secret agreement which gave SAS the monopoly of the route between Copenhagen, Denmark and Stockholm, Sweden.
The fines amount to EUR39.37m for  SAS and EUR13.12m for  Maersk Air.

TD
In inspections carried out at the companies' headquarters in June 2000 the  European Commission found evidence suggesting that the companies had agreed to a secret clause not to compete in connection with a code-sharing deal.

The secret clause meant that Maersk Air agreed not to launch any new international routes from Copenhagen without approval from SAS while SAS agreed not to operate on  Maersk Air routes out of Billund Airport, Denmark.

In addition the European Commission found that the airlines had agreed that Maersk Air would cease competing with SAS on the Copenhagen-Stockholm route in return for which SAS would stop operating between Copenhagen and Venice, Italy and between Billund and Frankfurt, Germany.

The European Commission said in a statement: "This secret  agreement between SAS and Maersk Air is a very serious violation of European Union competition law and very damaging for Scandinavian
passengers which were left with reduced choice or no choice at all, and potentially higher prices. Before the agreement, the Copenhagen-Stockholm route was operated by  SAS, Maersk Air and Finnair.  Maersk's withdrawal from the route caused the exit of Finnair, as the two airlines previously had a code-sharing agreement. Currently,  SAS has close to 100% of the traffic between the Danish and the Swedish capitals."

SAS has admitted to having infringed on the competition rules but said that it regarded the  fine
disproportionate.

"The decision seems to be politically influenced, and should be looked upon as a signal to the entire airline industry and its market practices," SAS said. SAS also indicated that it was considering appealing the decision regarding the level of the fine.

BRUSSELS, July 18 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it  fined Scandinavian airline SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.05 million) and Denmark's  Maersk Air 13.1 million euros for agreeing not to compete on key routes.
The Commission said it imposed the  fines over "a secret  agreement that led to the  monopolisation by
SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers" each year.

TD
SAS President and Chief Executive Jorgen Lindegaard said he "deeply regrets"  SAS's action but the fine was "disproportionate and not at all related to the effects the infringements have had on the market or to previous case law of the  European Commission".

The Scandinavian flag-carrier, jointly owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, said SAS was "seriously considering appealing the decision related to the level of  fine to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, while still accepting the substance of the decision".

A spokeswoman for the Commission said the  fine was high in order to dissuade other firms from considering the possibility of collusion.
"There must be a deterrent effect in a  fine," said Amelia Torres. "We are confident that the
Commission's decision will stand and is legally solid."
SECRET  AGREEMENT

The Commission said the two companies agreed secretly that Maersk would not add any new routes from Copenhagen without approval from  SAS - an illegal agreement not to compete. They also agreed not to compete on another route.

Price fixing and collusion are considered the most serious of antitrust violations because they strike at the heart of competition.

In the United States, for example, they are criminal offences and courts sometimes send chief executives and other executives to prison.

Torres said the violation by  SAS was "considered to be a very serious infringement," noting that it lasted from 1998 to 2001 and extended the market power of  SAS.
Torres said a reduction in the  fine was granted to  Maersk Air, owned by oil and shipping conglomerate
A.P. Moeller, because it cooperated with the Commission early in the process.
The Commission said in February it had formally warned  SAS and Maersk Air their cooperation
agreement had broken EU antitrust law and that it was considering imposing  fines.

The Commission said that last June it had raided offices of  SAS, Maersk Air and A.P. Moeller after a preliminary inquiry found that the cooperation extended beyond the code-sharing and frequent flyer programmes about which the two airlines had notified the EU in March 1999.

STOCKHOLM, July 18 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline SAS admitted guilt but said on Wednesday it might appeal the  European Commission's decision to fine it 39.4 million euros ($33.82 million) for violating EU competition rules.

The Commission said earlier  SAS and Danish carrier Maersk Air, owned by oil and shipping conglomerate A.P. Moeller , had operated a secret agreement that led to the  monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers.

The Commission fined Maersk Air 13.1 million euros.

"I deeply regret that  SAS has infringed the Competition Rules of the European Union in this case,"  SAS President and CEO Jorgen Lindegaard said in a statement, which noted that  SAS had admitted that infringements had been made.

"SAS finds however that the  fine imposed on it is disproportionate and and not at all related to the effects the infringements have had on the market nor to previous case law of the  European                  Commission," Lindegaard said.
The decision appeared to be politically influenced and intended as a signal to the airline industry,  SAS
said.
"SAS is seriously considering appealing the decision related to the level of  fine to the Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg, while still accepting the substance of the decision," the Scandinavian
flag-carrier said.

STOCKHOLM, July 18 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline SAS said on Wednesday it had violated
European Union competition rules but might appeal the European Commission's decision to  fine it
39.4 million euros ($33.82 million).

The Commission said earlier  SAS and Danish carrier Maersk Air, owned by oil and shipping conglomerate A.P. Moeller , had entered into a clandestine agreement that led to the  monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen to Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers.

TD
The Commission fined Maersk Air 13.1 million euros. The Danish airline said it would study the ruling in detail before deciding whether to appeal.

SAS's share was unchanged at 104 Swedish crowns in Stockholm but fell 3.5 percent to 84 Danish crowns in Copenhagen by 1205 GMT. Moeller's two listed shares were down 200 crowns and 900 crowns respectively at 87,000 and 66,100.
"I deeply regret that  SAS has infringed the competition rules of the European Union in this case,"  SAS
President and Chief Executive Jorgen Lindegaard said in a statement.

"SAS finds however that the  fine imposed on it is disproportionate and not at all related to the effects the infringements have had on the market nor to previous case law of the  European Commission," Lindegaard said.

SAS said consumers had not been negatively affected as a consequence of the violations.
SIGNAL TO INDUSTRY
The decision appeared to be politically influenced and intended as a signal to the airline industry,  SAS
said.
"SAS is seriously considering appealing the decision related to the level of  fine to the Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg, while still accepting the substance of the decision," the Scandinavian
flag-carrier, jointly owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, said.

Ole Dietz, managing director of  Maersk Air, said the company would scrutinise the verdict before deciding how to proceed.

"We want to read the EU Commission's actual decision in detail before deciding whether or not to appeal," he said.

Last June, the Commission said EU antitrust officials raided offices of  SAS, Maersk Air and A.P. Moeller after a preliminary inquiry found that the  SAS-Maersk cooperation extended beyond the code-sharing and frequent flyer programmes of which the two airlines had notified the EU in March
1999. (Additional reporting by Chris Follett in Copenhagen).

HD        WRAPUP 1-EU fines SAS, Maersk over no-competition pact. BY        By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, July 18 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it  fined Scandinavian airline SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.05 million) and Denmark's  Maersk Air 13.1 million euros for agreeing not to compete on key routes.
The Commission said it imposed the  fines over "a secret  agreement that led to the  monopolisation by
SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers" each year.

TD
SAS President and Chief Executive Jorgen Lindegaard said he "deeply regrets"  SAS's action but the fine was "disproportionate and not at all related to the effects the infringements have had on the market or to previous case law of the  European Commission".

The Scandinavian flag-carrier, jointly owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, said SAS was "seriously considering appealing the decision related to the level of  fine to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, while still accepting the substance of the decision".

A spokeswoman for the Commission said the  fine was high in order to dissuade other firms from considering the possibility of collusion.
"There must be a deterrent effect in a  fine," said Amelia Torres. "We are confident that the
Commission's decision will stand and is legally solid."
SECRET  AGREEMENT

The Commission said the two companies agreed secretly that Maersk would not add any new routes from Copenhagen without approval from  SAS - an illegal agreement not to compete. They also agreed not to compete on another route.

Price fixing and collusion are considered the most serious of antitrust violations because they strike at the heart of competition.

In the United States, for example, they are criminal offences and courts sometimes send chief executives and other executives to prison.

Torres said the violation by  SAS was "considered to be a very serious infringement," noting that it lasted from 1998 to 2001 and extended the market power of  SAS.
Torres said a reduction in the  fine was granted to  Maersk Air, owned by oil and shipping conglomerate
A.P. Moeller , because it cooperated with the Commission early in the process.
The Commission said in February it had formally warned  SAS and Maersk Air their cooperation
agreement had broken EU antitrust law and that it was considering imposing  fines.

The Commission said that last June it had raided offices of  SAS, Maersk Air and A.P. Moeller after a preliminary inquiry found that the cooperation extended beyond the code-sharing and frequent flyer programmes about which the two airlines had notified the EU in March 1999.

HD    European Commission fines SAS and Maersk Air for infringing European competition rules

The European Commission said today (18 July) that it had  fined the pan-Scandinavian airline SAS and the Danish airline Maersk Air A/S, part of the AP Moller group, for operating a secret agreement which gave SAS the monopoly of the route between Copenhagen, Denmark and Stockholm, Sweden.
The fines amount to EUR39.37m for  SAS and EUR13.12m for  Maersk Air.

TD
In inspections carried out at the companies' headquarters in June 2000 the  European Commission found evidence suggesting that the companies had agreed to a secret clause not to compete in connection with a code-sharing deal.

The secret clause meant that Maersk Air agreed not to launch any new international routes from Copenhagen without approval from SAS while SAS agreed not to operate on  Maersk Air routes out of Billund Airport, Denmark.

In addition the European Commission found that the airlines had agreed that Maersk Air would cease competing with SAS on the Copenhagen-Stockholm route in return for which SAS would stop operating between Copenhagen and Venice, Italy and between Billund and Frankfurt, Germany.

The European Commission said in a statement: "This secret  agreement between SAS and Maersk Air is a very serious violation of European Union competition law and very damaging for Scandinavian
passengers which were left with reduced choice or no choice at all, and potentially higher prices. Before the agreement, the Copenhagen-Stockholm route was operated by  SAS, Maersk Air and Finnair.  Maersk's withdrawal from the route caused the exit of Finnair, as the two airlines previously had a code-sharing agreement. Currently,  SAS has close to 100% of the traffic between the Danish and the Swedish capitals."

SAS has admitted to having infringed on the competition rules but said that it regarded the  fine
disproportionate.

"The decision seems to be politically influenced, and should be looked upon as a signal to the entire airline industry and its market practices," SAS said. SAS also indicated that it was considering appealing the decision regarding the level of the fine.

ESTONIA CAN HOPE FOR BILLIONS FROM EUROPEAN REGIONAL FUNDS Estonia can ask for about
3 billion kroons a year from regional policy funds af ter it has joined the EU. "The EU regional policy will be
of great help in decreasing the disparities bet ween Estonia and the richer European countries," Estonian
PM Mart Laar said aft er he had met the EU regional aid commissioner Michel Barnier. According to Laar,
Estonia should be ready to submit enterprise and employment enhancing, transport network and energy
projects as successfully as Ireland has done it. "If we can do it, the living standard would rise here as fast
as in I reland," Anne Osvet, PM's press adviser reported to ETA. In the joining talks, Estonia strives for
including all its territory under the area of the EU regional policy aims and becoming a state benefiting from
the E U Cohesion Fund. As such a region we get monetary aid to fulfil the aims of the EU regional policy,
which is stimulating the development in less-favoured regi ons. The Cohesion Fund provides money for
environmental and transport projects.

Laar said that although the chapter of regional policy is among the last ones a t the joining talks, the meeting with the regional aid commissioner assured, th at Estonia can hope on the aid in the amount of a least 4 percent of our GDP. (ETA)

THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE IN ESTONIA; DAMAGE REACHES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS All Estonian newspapers report further on the storm damage on Monday and Tuesda y. The worst damage by Tuesday evening had been caused in Lne-Viru and Jgeva counties, where the local governments formed crisis commissions. Their prime t ask is to take care for the restoration of power supply and telephone connecti ons, but also to estimate the approximate damage caused by the thunderstorms a nd whirlwinds. Lne-Viru commission chairman Jaan Kulver described the sight of the worst-hit a rea as depressing - the storm has broken trees and destroyed crops on an area of 1,500 square kilometres. Ida-Viru county has also formed a crisis commission f or the restoration of power and telephone lines. Postimees speculated that the damage may well reach hundreds of millions of kr oons. A number of farmers hope on government help, but a statement released ye sterday declared that the government will not compensate for the
damage to cro ps. Justice Minister Mrt Rask said that support may be extended to those, who need shelter, but compensation is out of the question. The storm claimed another victim in Valga on Tuesday, where an
11-year-old boy died having touched a power cable after the storm broke the post. Estonian Energy Co. PR manager Kristina Shanin said that 1,300 substations wer e out of action by Tuesday evening and warned that the restoration of all powe r lines will take several weeks. Telephone communications have suffered as wel l, particularly in Viljandi and Jgeva counties. (ETA)

PROSECUTION TO DECIDE NEXT WEEK ON ESTONIAN RAILWAY PRIVATISATION CASE The Tallinn prosecuting office will decide next week, whether to bring charges against the Estonian Privatisation
Agency and government officials for the ir regularities in the sale of the Estonian Railway shares, Pevaleht reports. Prosecutor Kristel Siitam said that her decision will be based solely on the report of the State Audit Office as a more detailed study of documents would require the starting of an investigation. If the prosecuting office should start a criminal investigation, the security police is to investigate the responsibility of the Privatisation Agency and government officials. The European Bank for reconstruction and Development is to decide next Tuesday, whether to grant a 205 million kroon loan to the railway buyer firm BRS. The prime minister's press advisor Anne Osvet said that Premier Mart Laar has not studied the audit results and will not make any official statement on the issue. According to the State Audit Office decision, the Privatisation Agency director general Jaak Liivik had concluded the railway privatisation  agreement illegally and had approved dozens of millions kroons worth of state obligations in connection with the sale. The Privatisation Agency in turn claims that the criticism is unfounded, since the audit result does not specify the concrete violations. The agency also clams that the State Audit Office has been inconsistent in judging the legality of the privatisation agreements and has exceeded its competence. (ETA)

SAS-ESTONIAN AIR AGREEMENTS LIMIT COMPETITION The daily ripev studies the Estonian Air (EA) pricing policy, where the owner firm  Maersk Air has a cartel agreement with SAS concerning the ticket prices o n flights from Tallinn to Sweden and Denmark. The EU will fine Maersk for price agreements on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route and ripev suspects that similar arrangements are used on the
Tallinn-Stockholm and Tallinn-Copenhagen lines. ripev quoted a travel agency official, who pointed out that EA has introduced a class structure of tickets analogous to that of  SAS, whereby tickets purchased immediately before the flight are much more expensive. As a result, Finnair flight to Stockholm costs 3,800 kroons as compared to 6,680 kroon in case of EA. The daily also quoted Valdo Randpere, IBM sales manager, who cited another price rise method used by  SAS and EA, whereby cheaper tickets require overnight stay at the destination. According to him, Tallinn-Stockholm flight tickets cost as much as 11,000 kroons. Jorn Eriksen, the Danish president of Estonian Air, claimed that the cooperation between  Maersk Air and SAS is not aimed at price raising, but at providing easier transfer opportunities to  SAS clients. He explained the price rise with more expensive fuel. Eriksen admitted that EA management suspended the flights to Helsinki so as not to cooperate with Finnair, which belongs to another airline alliance. But EA has also terminated flights to Amsterdam, Minsk and Hamburg, turning them over to  SAS. (ETA)

KREENHOLM CLOTHES FACTORY OPENS NEW SEWING WORKSHOP Estonian biggest textile industry Kreenholm will open a new sewing workshop in August.

The enterprise earned 38 mln of profit on turnover of
1.2 billion kroons last year. 90 percent of the production is exported. Kreenholm forms a half of all t he turnover and profit of its single owner - Swedish quoted company Boras Wfver. (ETA)

BROKERS SAY PRICE WILL BE HIGH AT AUCTION OF LG SHARES TOMORROW Brokers questioned by LETA forecast a high price for state-owned 2 percent shar es in the joint-stock gas company "Latvijas gaze" (LG) that will be auctioned a t the bourse tomorrow. Viktors Vasiljevs, analyst at the joint-stock company "Hansabanka", told LETA t hat tomorrow, the price for LG shares will definitely be higher than at the bou rse where it currently stands at about LVL 4.10 per share. "Judging by activiti es at the bourse about LG shares and results of previous auctions, there will b e a great interest in the auction of LG shares," said Vasiljevs. Vasiljevs said that the remaining state-owned 6 percent interest in LG will als o be sold in the near future and is expected to arouse even a greater interest in the auction, since an 8 percent interest (together with 2 percent) would giv e one seat at the LG council. Janis Neimanis, securities
specialist at the joint-stock company "Baltijas Tran zitu banka", said that there would be a greater interest in the sale of the 2 p ercent interest in LG if it had not been known that the Latvian Privatization A gency
(LPA) council will be advised to sell the 6 percent interest at one aucti on. "The purchaser would be more circumspect and give a higher price," said Nei manis. At the previous auction of state-owned shares in LG, bidders already showed a c onsiderable interest, and the price reached LVL 4.72 per share. Neimanis admitt ed that the price could be similar this time. Margers Pocs, broker at "Saules investicijas", also said that the share price a t the auction will exceed the minimum price set by LPA, and will be above LVL 4 per share. Pocs underlined that all major LG shareholders will definitely part icipate in the auction, and it is very likely that the most part of shares will be bought by "Itera Latvija Ltd." 798,000 shares of LG or 2 percent of the company's share capital will be auctio ned at the Riga Stock Exchange tomorrow. LPA has set the minimum price at LVL 3 .58 per share. Two previous auctions of state-owned shares in LG were held on March 27 and Dec ember 18 of 2000. Then, 26.85 percent and 2 percent of the company's share capi tal, respectively, were sold. At these auctions the price was LVL 2.63 and LVL 4.72 per share, respectively. (LETA)

TRADEMARK COUNTERFEITING COSTS $100 MILLION FOR BALTICS ANNUALLY The leading companies in the Baltics complain that trademark and patent counter feiting is a major stumblingblock for doing business in Lithuania, Latvia and E stonia. The Coalition for Intellectual Property Rights (CPIR), referring to its condu cted study, estimated that this problem causes $100 million losses to the busi nessmen and state institutions of all three countries annually. "Uncollected taxes and customs duties and diverted police resources are major direct costs to Baltic governments. Lost sales, diminished consumer confidenc e in well-known brands hit the private sector hardest," the president of coali tion Peter Necarsulmer said. The leader of copyright protection body stated that, consequently, internation al prestige of Baltic states is deteriorating, depriving them of foreign investments. The study conducted in December
2000 through March 2001 included 102 firms of which 49 represented Latvia and, 29 - Lithuania, and 24 - Estonia. Among respondents was Estonian Hansapank, now holder of a Lithuanian privatis ed Taupomasis Bankas, Kalev confectionery, Lithuanian Alita wine-making plant, Sanitas pharmaceutical firm, Latvian Aldaris brewery, Latvijas Balzams and ot her. The group of international featured Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola, GlaxoSmithKli ne, Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble. One of five business executives believe that counterfeit products are mostly produced in the Baltics and, owing to a convenient geographical situation,

thi s production goes beyond the boundaries of the region. Rating low the intellectual property rights levels in the Baltics, the compan ies admitted partly their fault as well - in recent 12 months, less than half of them were registered with the trademark patent authorities.

LITHUANIAN AIRLINES LIKELY TO OVERHAUL ITS BOARD NEXT WEEK The board of state-owned Lithuanian Airlines (LAL), the leading air company in Lithuania, is likely to undergo reshuffle next week in the wake of national gov ernment change. According to ELTA sources, the absolute holder of LAL interest State Property Fund has not arrived at consensus with transport ministry, which holds majority of seats in the company board (4 of 5), on the subject yet. Transport Minister Zigmantas Balcytis told ELTA Wednesday he saw no need to re - distribute the board seats. "It is normal because the ministry is the founder of company, so let it be as it is," Balcytis spoke in favour of bigger ministry influence over LAL. The existing rules require that overhauled LAL board be approved by the Fund's board which has powers to revise the management of the company. The sway in favour of transport ministry within the LAL board was re-distribut ed early this year after a centre-right New Policy coalition formed the nationa l government. Previously, the Fund held 3 seats and transport ministry - 2 seat s. Lithuanian Airlines has been practically operating without the board chairman since the end of previous week after dismissal of chairman Kazimieras Savinis f rom the post of transport vice-minister. Transport Minister Balcytis commented that a would-be vice-minister could take over as board chairman after appointme nt next week. LAL has announced an international tender on selecting next autumn the advisor for the company privatisation. Lithuanian Airlines, with a 57-percent share of domestic market, must be priva tised before the end-Q1
2002. Nordic SAS and Finnair, Dutch Royal KLM air company and LOT of neighbouring Po land have

OIL IMPORTERS COMPLAIN ABOUT UNFAIR COMPETITION CLIMATE Oil importers complain about unequal terms for import of base and engine oil en shrined in Lithuanian laws as violating the anti-trust law, the public relation s agency Viesuju Rysiu Partneriai reported. "We seek to have oil import terms made uniform for all importers and producers," director of Soliris oil importing firm Vaidas Minkevicius said. There are 10 companies dealing with oil import in Lithuania. The importers have to pay a 20-percent customs duty when importing oil from Ru ssia. But a base oil is exempt from customs duty though it is the major compone nt in engine oil (95 percent). "The current customs duty clears the way to "manufacture" of engine oil from a duty free base oil by companies in Lithuania. It reminds us of a well-know rul e that everybody is equal but some are more equal than others," Minkevicius sai d bitterly. Ramunas Vilpisauskas, an expert of
Lithuanian Free Market Institute, said 20-p ercent conventional customs duties for imported engine oil cause the heaviest d amage the end users. "An end user is forced to pay more, which constrains competition," Vilpisauska s said. The expert argued that in EU bid Lithuania would have to harmonise its duties with European duties which are maximum 3.7 percent. The inflated oil prices affect mainly Lithuanian farmers who are the key users of engine oil. (ELTA)

The European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined Scandanavian carrier SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air a total of E52.5m ($45.1m) for colluding in running a monopoly on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, one of the region's busiest.

The findings that the two airlines had reached a secret  agreement came after a year-long investigation into practices adopted by the two airlines after reaching a commercial  agreement in 1998.

TD
Commission officials raided both companies' head offices last June and uncovered the existence of a secret pact that included a non-compete clause on  SAS' routes out of Copenhagen and  Maersk's routes out of Billund in Denmark.

As part of the deal  Maersk pulled off the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, which is used by 1m passengers a year, and in return  SAS pulled off routes from Billund to Venice and Frankfurt.

SAS, which is majority owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, was  fined E39.4m.  Maersk, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Danish energy and shipping group A.P. Moeller Maersk, was told to pay E13.1m.

SAS said it "deeply regretted" the infringement but said it was considering an appeal against the size of the fine.

The Commission said in a statement: "This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers. The Commission is determined to ensure that the liberalisation achieved in
the European air transport in the last decade is not undermined by anti-competitive agreements."

BRUSSELS, July 18 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European           Commission on Wednesday:

ANNOUNCEMENTS
The Commission made no announcements on Wednesday. - - - - TAX-SAVINGS
Spokesman Jonathan Todd said the Commission had on Wednesday adopted a new proposal for taxing cross-border savings income, reflecting the conclusions reached at a meeting of EU finance ministers in November last year.
- - - -
STATE AID-BANKS-GERMANY
Spokesman Michael Tscherny said Germany had on Wednesday accepted "unconditionally" the
Commission's demand that it scrap special state guarantees to German regional and savings banks.

Under an accord hammered out after seven hours of talks between the Commission and representatives of the German government and banks, Germany would phase out the guarantees over four years, Tscherny said.
The state guarantees allow the banks, some of which are large market players such as Westdeutsche
Landesbank, to borrow more cheaply then their private competitors on capital markets.

The Commission had warned Germany it was ready to take legal action this month if the banks failed to bring the system into line with European Union rules on state aid.

Tsherny said the German authorities had agreed to take appropriate legislative measures to implement the agreement before the end of 2002.
- - - -
AIRLINES-SAS-MAERSK

In response to a question, spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the Commission had on Wednesday decided to fine Scandinavian airlines  SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air for operating a secret  agreement that was found to violate antitrust law.

She said the Commission had imposed the  fines because the companies had been operating an agreement effectively  monopolising the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers that use that major route every year.

The Commission said in February it had formally warned  SAS and Maersk Air their cooperation
agreement had broken EU antitrust law and it was considering imposing fines.

In March 1999 the two airlines notified the Commission of details of a cooperation  agreement, which mainly involved code-sharing and frequent-flyer programmes.

But a preliminary inquiry by the Commission found the cooperation extended beyond that outlined to Brussels. Last June, the Commission said EU antitrust offficials raided offices of  SAS and Maersk Air and its parent company A.P. Moeller.
- - - -
AIRLINES-SABENA

In response to a question, spokesman Gilles Gantelet said an  agreement between the Belgian state and Swissair to inject new capital in Belgian national airline Sabena did not change its intention to look at a previous Belgian cash injection for Sabena.

Sabena shareholders Swissair and the Belgian state, which owns 50.5 percent of Sabena, agreed late on Tuesday to inject a final 430 million euros in the airline.

Gantelet said on Monday that the Commission was considering opening a formal state aid probe into an earlier 100 million euro cash injection by the Belgian state into Sabena because of uncertainty whether Swissair Group, which owns 49.5 percent of Sabena, would respect commitments it made in January.

"Formally, it does not change anything for two reasons. The first thing is that we have not been notified until now so in any case we cannot ... say anything without having this notification," Gantelet said.
Gantelet said Tuesday's  agreement concerned new investment added to January's capital injection. "In any case, we will have to see both of them," he said.
"I don't think it's going to change a lot," he added.

* Moscow Il-76 Cargo Plane Crash Blamed on Overloading

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A commission investigating the crash of an Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane outside Moscow at the weekend has decided the accident, in which 10 people died, was due to overloading, Interfax news agency said on Tuesday. The Il-76 cargo plane, which was reported to be carrying construction materials, crashed on takeoff on Saturday, plowing into a neighbouring forest and killing all on board.

Interfax quoted a report by the commission as saying the airplane was carrying 50 percent more cargo than its design specifications allowed. The Il-76's original parametres dictate it can carry up to 52 tonnes.
* EU Fines SAS, Maersk for Violating Antitrust Law

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined Scandinavian airlines SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air for operating a secret  agreement that was found to violate antitrust law.  SAS was fined 39.375 million euros and  Maersk 13.125 million euros, the Commission said in a statement.

The Commission said it had imposed the fines because the companies had been "operating a secret agreement that led to the monolpolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million passengers that use that major route every year."
* Spain Sets Decision Day for Aerolineas Argentinas

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish state holding company SEPI, majority-owner of Aerolineas Argentinas, has set a deadline of July 23 for bids to save the struggling airline, SEPI's chairman was quoted as saying on Wednesday. If none of the offers received by that date is sufficient the State Industrial Holdings Company (SEPI) would then start to liquidate the company, Pedro Ferreras said in an interview published in the
daily ABC.

"There are five offers, although I don't know whether we should class them as offers or not very concrete expressions of interest," Ferreras said. "Our schedule is to study the offers until the 23rd and, if none of them convinces us, we will start bankruptcy proceedings at the shareholders meeting that day," he added.
* Belgium, Swissair Reach Deal to Save Sabena

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's government and the Swiss aviation group Swissair said on Tuesday they had reached a deal to secure the future of Sabena, ending months of acrimony over how to finance the ailing Belgian airline. The government and Swissair - the airline's main shareholders - said in a joint statement that the deal also freed Swissair of its obligation to raise its stake in Sabena to 85 percent from
49.5 percent.

They said they had agreed to inject 430 million euros into the airline over the next two years, 60 percent of which would come from Swissair and 40 percent from the government.
* Alitalia Can't Have New Capital Increase

ROME (Reuters) - A  European Commission decision involving the recapitalisation of Italian airline Alitalia prevents the Italian Treasury from injecting new capital into the airline, an industry source said Wednesday. The Eu Commission's decision confirmed a previous ruling which cleared the recapitalisation of Alitalia carried out in 1997.

"The sense of today's decision is that the Treasury will only be able to give the 750 billion lire ($332.3 million) it decided not to give to Alitalia in 1997," the source told Reuters. "Under EU norms, state aid can be granted only once. Therefore, any capital increases will have to be carried out through the market, either banks or a partner like Air France," the source said.
* US Airways Weighs Options if UAL Deal Collapses

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - US Airways will present to its board on Wednesday a slate of survival options in case United Airlines' planned $4.3 billion takeover of the smaller airline falls through, according to the Washington Post. The long-term survival proposals for US Airways Group Inc. include a possible alliance with an international airline, cutting unprofitable routes and cutting cost, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the plans.

Quoting the sources, the report said there were no plans for the board to act on Wednesday on the acquisition alternatives, called plans B, C and D. The Post said US Airways declined to comment on the options.
* Oman Air to Go More Often to Major Destination India

DUBAI (Reuters) - Oman Air, the Gulf's smallest commercial airline, is set to boost capacity to key destination India with thrice-weekly stops to Cochin later this year. The carrier which flies to Trivandarum, Bombay and Madras will start flying to Cochin by October pending final talks with the authorities, Commercial and Strategic Planning Director Edward Grauvogl told Reuters.

"With the increase in number of aircraft in our jet fleet, we anticipate operating more frequencies, especially to India," he said in an interview. "We initially plan for three weekly flights to Cochin, which would raise our services to 18 flights a week to India."
* Alitalia Cargo Plans Sky Team Synergies

ROME (Reuters) - Alitalia is planning cooperation in cargo operations with Air France, Delta and other airlines in the Sky Team alliance, Alitalia's cargo division said. Possible cooperation could cover flight networks, sales operations and facilities usage, Alitalia Cargo said.

Last week Alitalia announced it had signed memorandums of understanding with Air France and Delta to negotiate agreements covering forms of cooperation such as code sharing, with a view to Alitalia eventually joining the Sky Team alliance of airlines.
* S.African Eagle Air Plans Hahn Freighter Operation in August


Page 35 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - South African airline Eagle Air is planning to start a European freighter service from the beginning of August, an airline executive told Reuters. Phase one of the start-up operation will start with a DC10-40 freighter which will intiially operate four times a week from Johannesburg to Hahn airport in Germany, Louis van Deventer, Eagle Air director said.

Van Deventer was formerly commercial director of Hydro Air Cargo, which started a cargo service between South Africa and Europe end-2000 with a B747-200. Eagle Air will serve Windhoek, Cape Town, Harare, Zaragoza and possibly Port Elizabeth.

Fish exporters from the Cape Town area are likely to use the first flights of the week and the weekend flights, when the airline plans to operate via Windhoek.
* Cargolux to Launch 3rd Shanghai Flight, Aug 14

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Cargolux is set to introduce a third frequency to Shanghai's Pudong airport, Rebecca Mok, the airline's Netherlands cargo manager told Reuters. With a stop over in Baku, the additional frequency will start on August 14. In addition, the Luxembourg all-cargo airline will add a third frequency to Johannesburg.
To be introduced in mid-September, the service will route
Luxembourg-Abidjan-Johannesburg-Nairobi-Maastricht, in the Netherlands. End-July, the carrier will also
start its first flight to Sharjah, oprating via Kuwait on Saturdays.
* BA Concorde Completes First Test Flight Since Crash

LONDON (Reuters) - A British Airways Concorde roared out over the Atlantic on Tuesday, completing its first test flight since it was grounded after last year's Air France crash in which 113 people died. Afterburners blazing, the sleek supersonic airliner accelerated along the runway at London's Heathrow airport, reaching its take-off speed of more than 300 km/h (190 mph) in about 30 seconds.

Unlike the ill-fated Air France Concorde, the British Airways plane took off smoothly and climbed safely away - to the cheers of plane spotters who had gathered for the event. More than three hours later the Concorde landed at the Royal Air Force's Brize Norton base west of London, where it will not interfere with commercial traffic.

The pilot, Captain Mike Bannister, said the flight had been "absolutely fantastic" and the aircraft had performed "really brilliantly".
* FAA Overhauls Airport, Airline Security Rules

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal regulators completed on Tuesday an overhaul of airport and airline security rules five years to the day after the crash of TWA Flight 800, a disaster that dramatically heightened awareness of aviation security. The updated guidelines, which take effect in November, have been in the works for a number of years and build on previous standards for airline and airport operations. A focus of the initiative is to guard against terrorism.

"This final rule more clearly defines the areas of the airport in which security interests are the most critical and where security measures should be the most stringent," the FAA said in the newly published regulation.

HD        Brussels fines steel furnace cartel $186m. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY IN BRUSSELS.

The European Commission on Wednesday signalled a crackdown on cartels when it handed down
fines of E219m ($186m) for price-fixing in the steel mini-mill industry.

It also slapped a E39m  fine on the Scandinavian airline  SAS, and proposed new rules to make informing on malpractice easier.

TD
The fines for the steel furnace  cartel, which involved eight companies led by Germany's SGL Carbon and UCAR International of the US, are the second biggest delivered by the Commission for restrictive practices, after a 1998 E273m  fine on a group of maritime freight companies.

Brussels says its cartels policy is converging with US practice, where punishments can be severe but where plea bargaining is also well established. "The idea is to have a bigger stick and a bigger carrot to deal with them," said a Commission official.
SGL and UCAR were  fined $135m and $110m respectively by US authorities in 1999 for their role in the
cartel, which lasted from 1992 until 1998.

The Commission said that SGL and UCAR organised regular gatherings of chief executives to orchestrate price rises. Hotels and flights were paid for in cash and the companies involved were referred to by code names.

The biggest penalty was on SGL, which was  fined E80.2m. It said it would appeal to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that the US had dealt with the  cartel, meaning it was being punished twice.

The Commission reduced the  fine for UCAR by 40 per cent to E50.4m to reward it for co-operating with the investigation. The  fine for the Japanese company Showa Denko was slashed by 70 per cent to E17.4m because it gave the Commission clear evidence of the  cartel.

Separately, the Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air, the Scandinavian airlines, a total of E52.5m for an agreement under which SAS rewarded Maersk Air for withdrawing from the Copenhagen-Stockholm route. Jorgen Lindegard, SAS chief executive, said he "deeply regretted"  SAS's action. But he added
that the airline was considering appealing against the size of the  fine. Montedison deadline.

HD        EUROPE - Brussels fines steel cartel #133m. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY.

The European Commission yesterday signalled a crackdown on cartels when it handed down near-record fines of Euros 219m ( #133m) for price-fixing in the steel mini-mill industry.

It also slapped a Euros 39m  fine on the Scandinavian airline  SAS, as well proposing a new set of rules to make easier "whistle-blowing" - or informing on malpractice.

TD
The fines for the steel furnace  cartel, which involved eight companies led by Germany's SGL Carbon and UCAR International of the US, are the second biggest delivered by the Commission for restrictive practices, after a 1998 Euros 273m  fine on a group of maritime freight companies.

In the aftermath of differences with the US over the Commission's blocking of the proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell, Brussels says its cartels policy is converging with US practice, where punishments can be severe but where plea bargaining is also well established. "Cartels are one
of the very worst ways of distorting competition," said a Commission official.
"The idea is to have a bigger stick and a bigger carrot to deal with them."

SGL and UCAR were  fined $135m ( #96m) and $110m respectively by US authorities in 1999 for their role in the cartel, which lasted from 1992 until 1998. Two former UCAR executives were briefly imprisoned.

The Commission said that SGL and UCAR began the  cartel by organising regular gatherings of chief executives to orchestrate price rises for components used in mini-mills, which melt down steel scrap.

The biggest penalty imposed by Brussels was on SGL, which was  fined Euros 80.2m. It said it would appeal before the European Court of Justice and that since the US case dealt with the same  cartel, it was being punished twice for the same offence.

However, the Commission reduced the  fine for UCAR by 40 per cent to Euros 50.4m to reward it for co-operating with the investigation.

The fine for the Japanese company, Showa Denko, was slashed by 70 per cent to Euros 17.4m, since it had given the Commission decisive evidence of the  cartel. All the companies involved were German, American or Japanese.
Separately, the Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air, the Scandinavian airlines, a total of Euros
52.5m for an  agreement under which SAS rewarded Maersk Air for withdrawing from the
Copenhagen-Stockholm flight route.

Jorgen Lindegard, the  SAS chief executive, said he "deeply regretted"  SAS's action and would "ensure that this will never ever happen again". But he added that the airline was considering appealing against the size of the  fine.

The Commission's proposed revision of its rules for whistle-blowing yesterday also emphasised the benefits of co-operation.

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - Commission slaps fines on SAS and Maersk Air for market-sharing agreement.

Brussels, 18/07/2001 (Agence Europe) - The  European Commission has decided to slap 39.375 million euro and 13.125 million euro  fines, respectively, on the Scandinavian airline companies  SAS and Maersk Air for having implemented a secret  agreement leading to a monopoly on the Copenhagen-Stockholm route by SAS to the detriment of passengers (over a million) that use that route each year, and for having shared out other routes to and from Denmark.

TD
SAS and Maersk Air concluded a cooperation  agreement in 1998 which they notified to the  European      Commission. The notification highlighted the provisions relating to code-sharing (SAS could market Maersk Air's flights as SAS flights) and the extension of  SAS's frequent flyer programme to  Maersk Air. Suspecting that the agreement covered a much larger field, the Commission proceeded, in June 2000,
with inspections at the headquarters of the two companies. These operations enabled it to gather information proving that  SAS and Maersk Air had agreed on a general clause by which  Maersk air would not launch any new international routes from Copenhagen without  SAS's consent. Conversely, the parties agreed that  SAS would not operate on  Maersk air's routes out of Jutland's Billund. The parties also agreed to respect the share-pout of domestic routes. In addition to the overall non-compete clause,  SAS and Maersk air agreed specifically that: -  Maersk Air would cease competing with SAS on the
Copenhagen-Stockholm route as from 28 March 1999; - as compensation, SAS would stop operating between Copenhagen and Venice at the end of 1999 and  Maersk air started operations on that route at the same moment; -  SAS would stop flying the Billund-Frankfurt route in January 1999, leaving  Maersk Air as the only airline on the route (the two companies had been competing on this route).

Commenting on the decision, Mario Monti, Commissioner responsible for competition, declared that it was a question of "a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally (...) to the detriment of passengers". "I trust that the  fines imposed (...) will serve as a deterrent to the two airlines concerned and others", he added.

Riigikogu calls for wage rise

TD
Postimees reported that the salary system of the parliamentarians will cost the taxpayers more than two million kroons extra as their wage goes up with the average salary. The parliament wage estimate for 2002 has increased from 30.1 million to 32.3.

Kalle Jrgenson, chairman of the Riigikogu financial commission, told the daily that the rise is purely the result of the linking of the MPs salary to the average national salary. He admitted that the planned
7.1-percent rise is optimistic, considering the likelihood of slowing economic growth.

However, the existing budget act does not enable to use surplus wage fund for any other purpose, even if the rise of the average salary should slow down.
Yet the parliament's wage estimate is quite modest as compared to the claims submitted by most
ministries, which would like to boost the officials' salaries several dozen percent. The Justice Ministry is the
sole exception as it does not plan any increase of its wage fund.
(from Postimees, page 1)
Estonian Air will continue operating Fokkers

Estonian Air (EA) will continue operating the Fokker 50 airliners, despite a number of incidents with the type. There have been approximately a dozen serious failures of systems within the last couple of years.

The most recent incident took place on Monday, when the brakes' anti-blocking system failed, resulting in the bursting of port main gear tires during the landing. The initial reports stated that the aircraft had overshot the touchdown point and the tires had failed during emergency braking.

Maido Veebel, the EA senior pilot of Fokker airliners, said that the aircraft was back in operation on Wednesday, after the tires had been replaced and the electronics system repaired. The anti-blocking systems of all EA aircraft will be tested in the near future, he added.

Veebel admitted that the electronics have failed in the latest incidents with Fokkers, but he rated the aircraft as a generally safe one.

EA has also come under fire for its pricing policy and suspected cartelagreement with SAS, following the European Commission 52 million euro fine imposed on the aviation firms Maersk Air and SAS. Maersk is also majority shareholder of EA.

Postimees pointed out that  Maersk and SAS have an agreement similar to the one punished by the EU, concerning the Tallinn-Stockholm and Tallinn-Copenhagen lines. Mersk has also turned over to  SAS the direct flights to Amsterdam, Hamburg and Minsk.

Estonian Air president Jon Eriksen argued that the EU rulings do not apply to Estonia and that their pricing policy does not contradict the local laws as the  Maersk-SAS cooperation agreement does not concern pricing. But Competition Board director general Peeter Tammistu states that the Esotnian laws are almost analogous to the EU ones and enable to  fine the airlines if necessary. The Competition Board will investigate the Estonian Air activities in the autumn.

Storm damage reports continue

All newspapers continue to publish reports of the storm damage and start to release the first estimates of the loss caused by the storms.
According to specialists, that the three days of thunderstorms and whirlwinds have already killed two
people and caused 50 million kroons worth of damage. The State Forests Centre estimates that the storms
have destroyed approximately 2,500 hectares of state-owned forests at a cost of 35 million kroons.

Estonian Energy reported that 1,300 power grid substations out of a total of 15,000 were still out of action yesterday evening. Ordinary and cellular telephone communications were also disturbed due to line damage or loss of power to the relaying stations.

Thunderstorm warning has been issued for Thursday as well and the weather specialists predict that storms and whirlwinds can be expected until the end of the week

The weekly Maaleht also dedicated several articles to the storm damage, pointing out that private forest owners will have to accept their loss, since the state will not compensate the damage.
(from Eesti Pevaleht, page 2-3; Postimees, page 3; Maaleht, page 2-3, 4) Tallinn Stock Exchange suspects Preatoni of insider trading
The Tallinn Stock Exchange has started to investigate the activities of the Pro Kapital group of the Italian investor Ernesto Preatoni, suspecting insider trading. The stock exchange manager Gert Tiivas did not state, whether any evidence has been found so far. "We are interested in Pro Kapital's activities and will scrutiny all claims made in the media," Tiivas said.

Eesti Pevaleht speculates that the Stock Exchange may suspect insider trading, which may have harmed the interests of small stockholders.

Andrus Laurits, Estonian director general of Pro Kapital, described the accusations and speculations as groundless. He also explained the connections between Pro Kapital and the offshore firm Baltic Investments Ltd., which has had real estate deals with it. Laurits stated that the transactions were totally legal and well below the limit established by the stock exchange regulations.

The central criminal police are investigating the suspected violations of former Pro Kapital board member Ilona Saari. The police searched Saari's residence last week, seizing a computer and documents. Saari is suspected of having abused her position in the firm.
(from Eesti Pevaleht, page 1) In brief
President Lennart Meri appointed Kaja Tael Estonia's new ambassador to the UK yesterday. Tael (40) was the president's foreign policy advisor in 1995-1998 and has worked in the Foreign Ministry since. She will replace the current ambassador Raul Mlk.

French Armed Forces Commander General Jean Pierre Kelche, whose Estonian visit ended yesterday, linked the EU expansion and NATO enlargement, stating that a country's success in the EU direction will improve its credibility for NATO.

The Estonian Railway intends to buy five more locomotives from Ukraine to replace worn-out ones. The supply of US locomotives as planned by the company BRS, which will privatise ER, will be delayed. BRS has protested against the leasing of the Ukrainian locomotives.

The volume of TV broadcasts in Estonia increased 28 percent last year and the volume of radio broadcasts six percent as compared to 1999. The volume of ETV broadcasts went down four percent and its share of total declined from 20 to 15 pwrcent.

The cyclist run over by the drunk commissar of Viljandi traffic police died in hospital in Tuesday. Investigation of the accident is in progress.
Postimees discussed the ban on underwater fishing with spear guns and harpoons, imposed by the
Environment Ministry. The ban was apparently a result of lobby work by amateur fishermen.

A longer article in the weekly Maaleht described the efforts made by Soviet-period agricultural managers to improve Estonia's economy and defended them against recent accusations of having been tools of the Soviet regime.

HD        Brussels fines steel furnace cartel $186m. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY IN BRUSSELS.

The European Commission on Wednesday signalled a crackdown on cartels when it handed down
fines of E219m ($186m) for price-fixing in the steel mini-mill industry.

It also slapped a E39m  fine on the Scandinavian airline  SAS, and proposed new rules to make informing on malpractice easier.

TD
The fines for the steel furnace  cartel, which involved eight companies led by Germany's SGL Carbon and UCAR International of the US, are the second biggest delivered by the Commission for restrictive practices, after a 1998 E273m  fine on a group of maritime freight companies.

Brussels says its cartels policy is converging with US practice, where punishments can be severe but where plea bargaining is also well established. "The idea is to have a bigger stick and a bigger carrot to deal with them," said a Commission official.
SGL and UCAR were  fined $135m and $110m respectively by US authorities in 1999 for their role in the
cartel, which lasted from 1992 until 1998.

The Commission said that SGL and UCAR organised regular gatherings of chief executives to orchestrate price rises. Hotels and flights were paid for in cash and the companies involved were referred to by code names.

The biggest penalty was on SGL, which was  fined E80.2m. It said it would appeal to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that the US had dealt with the  cartel, meaning it was being punished twice.

The Commission reduced the  fine for UCAR by 40 per cent to E50.4m to reward it for co-operating with the investigation. The  fine for the Japanese company Showa Denko was slashed by 70 per cent to E17.4m because it gave the Commission clear evidence of the  cartel.

Separately, the Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air, the Scandinavian airlines, a total of E52.5m for an agreement under which SAS rewarded Maersk Air for withdrawing from the Copenhagen-Stockholm route. Jorgen Lindegard, SAS chief executive, said he "deeply regretted"  SAS's action. But he added
that the airline was considering appealing against the size of the  fine. Montedison deadline.

HD        EUROPE - Brussels fines steel cartel #133m. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY.

The European Commission yesterday signalled a crackdown on cartels when it handed down near-record fines of Euros 219m ( #133m) for price-fixing in the steel mini-mill industry.

It also slapped a Euros 39m  fine on the Scandinavian airline  SAS, as well proposing a new set of rules to make easier "whistle-blowing" - or informing on malpractice.

TD
The fines for the steel furnace  cartel, which involved eight companies led by Germany's SGL Carbon and UCAR International of the US, are the second biggest delivered by the Commission for restrictive practices, after a 1998 Euros 273m  fine on a group of maritime freight companies.

In the aftermath of differences with the US over the Commission's blocking of the proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell, Brussels says its cartels policy is converging with US practice, where punishments can be severe but where plea bargaining is also well established. "Cartels are one
of the very worst ways of distorting competition," said a Commission official.
"The idea is to have a bigger stick and a bigger carrot to deal with them."

SGL and UCAR were  fined $135m ( #96m) and $110m respectively by US authorities in 1999 for their role in the cartel, which lasted from 1992 until 1998. Two former UCAR executives were briefly imprisoned.

The Commission said that SGL and UCAR began the  cartel by organising regular gatherings of chief executives to orchestrate price rises for components used in mini-mills, which melt down steel scrap.

The biggest penalty imposed by Brussels was on SGL, which was  fined Euros 80.2m. It said it would appeal before the European Court of Justice and that since the US case dealt with the same  cartel, it was being punished twice for the same offence.

However, the Commission reduced the  fine for UCAR by 40 per cent to Euros 50.4m to reward it for co-operating with the investigation.

HD        Commission gives whistleblowers a cash reason to talk. BY         By Andrew Osborn in Brussels.

A new front in Europe's increasingly bitter war against price-fixing cartels was opened yesterday after the European Commission announced radical proposals to grant corporate whistleblowers immunity from its often crippling punitive  fines.

The move is highly significant as Brussels has the power to  fine corporate wrong-doers up to 10% of their annual turnover. If firms needed a reminder of this they got one yesterday when the commission handed down fines totalling a cool #164m. `The challenge in attacking hard-core cartels is to penetrate their cloak of secrecy, which is all the greater when the profits and risk of stiff penalties are significant,' said Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner.

TD
`This fight can produce better results if companies are given a greater incentive to de nounce this kind of collusion.'

To qualify for immunity companies must be the first to alert Brussels to undetected cartels, and will also need to provide commission investigators with enough evidence to warrant a series of dawn raids.

Companies which cooperate once an investigation is underway, providing extra `value-added' evidence of wrongdoing, will be rewarded by reductions in their  fines of up to 50%.

Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Maersk Air felt the full weight of the commission's price-fixing wrath yesterday when they were hit with fines of #24m and #8m apiece for illegally carving up the lucrative Copenhagen to Stockholm route for the last two years.

Brussels said they had made a secret pact not to compete on the route which had operated since 1998, to the detriment of 1m passengers a year. Denmark's Maersk Air had, it claimed, agreed to withdraw from the Copenhagen-Stockholm route in exchange for SAS pulling the plug on its Copenhagen-Venice and Frankfurt-Billund runs.
`This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers,' said Mr
Monti. `I trust that the  fines imposed...will serve as a deterrent.'
Separately eight German, Japanese and US makers of graphite electrodes were yesterday  fined
#132m for oper ating an illegal  cartel during the 1990s, which resulted in higher prices for the product.

In the last five years firms have chosen to cooperate with the commission in over 20  cartel cases, and since 1998 Brussels has handed down  fines totalling over #600m for various price-fixing offences.

Officials said yesterday they hoped the new rules on whistleblowers will come into force by the end of this year, after a statutory consultation period.

TALLINN, Jul 19, BNS - Toomas Peterson, general director of the Estonian Aviation Administration, admitted that air routes between Estonia and Scandinavia are controlled by one  monopoly but the Aviation Administration has no opportunity to forcibly change the situation.

Peterson told BNS that strategic cooperation between  SAS and Estonian Air on Scandinavian air routes does mean the monoply of an aviation alliance, but this is simply the market situation at the moment
and the Aviation Administration cannot coerce competitors fly on those routes.

"We have signed very liberal aviation agreements with the Nordic countries and if someone emerged to put up competition on the Stockholm and Copenhagen routes, we would only welcome it," he said.

Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) and Estonian Air together with its Danish owner  Maersk Air belong to the international Star Alliance, while Finnair belongs to another leading aviation alliance, One World.

On Wednesday, the European Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air with respectively 39.4 million and 13.1 million euros for forming a cartel.

The commission said that a secret supplement to the two firms' cooperation  agreement made it possible for SAS to monopolize the lucrative Copenhagen-Stockholm route, thus damaging the interests of millions of people flying on the route.  Maersk Air ceased flying on the
Copenhagen-Stockholm route as of March 28, 1999, when it gave  monopoly on the route to  SAS.

Estonian Air became member of Star Alliance and signed a long-term cooperation  agreement with SAS at the end of December 1998. From March 28, 1999 a code-sharing  agreement between Estonian Air and SAS came into effect, applied to air routes from Tallinn to Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo.

In summer seaons,  SAS witherew from flying on the Tallinn-Copenhagen route and flights were only carried out by Estonian Air. For a similar agreement on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, the Danish competition board complained against Maersk and SAS to the European Union's competition board.

TUBE FACES BIG CANARY WHARF CLAIM

Following its failure to provide promised service levels on the new Jubilee Line, London Underground is facing a huge claim for compensation from Canary Wharf group, owner of the Docklands development. Canary Wharf has pledged to contribute 500 million stg over 24 years to the 3.4 billion stg cost of building the line and is involved in a formal arbitration process to recover part of its investment. London
Underground has promised to provide 24 trains an hour in each direction during the rush hour. However, the maximum provided is thought to be around 20.
BYERS REJECTS BOTH BIDS FOR EAST COAST INTERCITY FRANCHISE.

The transport secretary Stephen Byers has thrown out both bids for the east coast intercity mainline after a controversial two-year contest. He rejected the Strategic Railway Authority recommendation to award a
20-year franchise and will instead extend the contract with GNER by just two years from 2003 to 2005. The minister said he was forced to act because of uncertainty over the cost of the infrastructure upgrade plans. SRA chairman Sir Alastair Morton refused to attend a media briefing with Mr Byers.
CANADIAN GROUP SET TO WIN 1.7 BILLION STG ARMY RADIOS DEAL

Computing Devices of Canada, a subsidiary of General Dynamics of the US, is expected on Thursday to be awarded a 1.7 billion stg contract to supply new radios to the army. The defence secretary Geoff
Hoon is expected to award the Bowman battlefield communications contract to CDC. Under the terms of the contract, CDC would start the provision of new radios in 2004, a delivery date nine years later than the Ministry of Defence had originally envisaged. Competing bidder Thales of France is thought to have conceded the contest. However, the French prime minister Lionel Jospin is expected to do some
last-minute lobbying on behalf of the company when he has dinner with Tony Blair at Downing Street.
EURONEWS WINS DEAL TO DELIVER NEWS IN RUSSIA

Following a deal with the Russian broadcaster RTR, the ITN-controlled broadcaster, Euronews, is set to become the first western media organisation to deliver news through Moscow's terrestrial television network. News of the alliance is expected to be announced at the G8 summit in Genoa. The deal gives Euronews a foothold in the notoriously impenetrable Russian TV market. The Russian president Vladimir Putin hailed the deal as 'an important step toward integrating Russia with the European and international information space'. The alliance has been under negotiation for two years.
BRUSSELS  FINES STEEL  CARTEL 133 MILLION STG

The European Commission, signalling a crackdown on cartels, has handed down fines of 219 million euros for price-fixing in the steel mini-mill industry. The  fines for the steel furnace cartel, involving 8 companies including SGL Carbon of Germany and UCAR International of the US, are the second biggest delivered by the Commission for restrictive practices. It also  fined the Scandinavian airline  SAS 39
million euros and proposed a new set of rules to make it easier to inform on malpractice. BOOST FOR EUROZONE AS INFLATION SHOWS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED FALL.

The eurozone was given a boost on Wednesday when official figures showed a sharper-than-expected fall in inflation and France reported a rise in industrial output. Annual inflation in the region fell from 3.4 percent in May to 3 percent in June. The fall was largely because of lower energy prices and a slowdown in the rising cost of food. The  European Commission welcomed the fall and said it expected inflation to fall below the European Central Bank's target ceiling of 2 percent early in 2002. Economists said the prospect of lower inflation was unlikely to persuade the ECB's governing council to cut interest rates on Thursday or in the two forthcoming sessions. France reported that industrial output had risen at a
month-on-month rate of 0.3 percent in May.
HAVAS SET TO BUY UK AGENCY OWNER.

The French group Havas Advertising i s set to announce an  agreement to buy Tempus , the British owner of the CIA media buying agency, in a 400 million stg cash deal that would create the world's fourth biggest media buying group. The purchase price values Tempus at a premium of nearly 50 percent to its market capitalisation of 268 million stg. Havas is buying at a high premium because of the benefits it expects to get from merging Tempus's media buying interests with those of its own subsidiary, Media Planning Group. Havas needs to secure the  agreement of Tempus's shareholders, one of which is the advertising and marketing group WPP.
NTL SHARES TUMBLE ON FEARS OVER DEBT

The UK's biggest cable operator NTL became the focus of investor concern on Wednesday over mounting debt as a crisis of confidence hit the UK cable sector. The Nasdaq-listed shares fell to about
$5, nearly 38 percent down on Friday's close and 85 percent off a recent high of $32.40. NTL's debt is at
$17.4 billion, against a market capitalisation of $3.3 billion. Ted Barac of Moody's Investors Service, said
'We are concerned about the debt levels at NTL compared to the cash levels the company generates'.
Analysts believe NTL may require an additional $1 billion in 2003.
BT PAY VOTE PUT ON ICE AT FROSTY AGM

Attempts by BT to push through controversial directors' remuneration packages have been stalled by private shareholders at its annual meeting. The move was instead put on ice after a band of disgruntled shareholders garnered enough support to put the proposal to a poll. The resolution will nevertheless be passed in a few days since it is understood that four out of every five proxy votes received before the meeting were in favour of the remuneration packages. Despite 1,300 attendees at the meeting, observers say it failed to turn into the expected heated battle over directors' pay.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION -  SAS considers appealing against Commission decision to impose  fine - Maersk
Air "takes stock".

Brussels, 19/07/2001 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the Scandinavian airline  SAS announced that it is seriously considering appealing against the European Commission's decision to impose a  fine of EUR
39.375 million for having implemented a secret agreement with its Danish partner  Maersk Air notably covering the connection Copenhagen-Stockholm (see EUROPE of 19 July, p.14). For its part,  Maersk Air will content itself with "taking stock" of the decision by the European executive concerning it.

TD
If SAS recognises the decision by the Commission covering the violation of EU competition rules, it challenges the size of the  fine, which it considers "disproportionate". This is why it is considering bringing the case before the Court of First Instance. In a press release, Joergen Lindegaard,  SAS President, underlined that this decision must be seen as a political signal to all the industry in the aviation sector and the market practices. (...) We think that it is crucial to take this decision with a higher body. For the  SAS President, the  agreement did not lead to prejudices for customers and the prices from the connections concerned were not higher than for other routes served by  SAS and other "significant" European airlines. The Danish and Scandinavian markets even obtained, according to him, a greater supply of connections than previously. It is a fact (...) that the connections Copenhagen-Stockholm and Billund-Frankfurt had experienced such great losses for  Maersk Air and SAS that they would have been closed,  agreement or not, added Mr Lindegaard. If the latter notes that the violations of competition rules are totally unacceptable, he feels on the other hand that the greatest barrier to free competition in the European aviation industry has until now been the State support given to this industry and which we have been unable to prevent.

Ole Dietz, President of  Maersk Air, as for him, adopted a lower profile, stating that his airline now looks forward, by maintaining a good dialogue with the Commission over the continuation of our cooperation with SAS in order to avoid problems in the future.

- Danish central bank warns commercial banks against excessive greed in trying to win new loan customers in the present economic downturn. Banks should beware of lending more funds to customers in relation to their net capital than before, so that they have economic reserves to bolster them in more difficult times ahead, the central bank advises.

- Human Rights Watch puts pressure on Foreign Minister Mogens Lykketoft in the Carmi Gillon case, pointing out that his appointment as next Israeli ambassador to Denmark represents a breach of new European Union guidelines against countries conducting torture. The Danish government has so far rejected calls to withdraw approval for Gillon as ambassador and launch legal proceedings against him for violating international conventions banning the use of torture.

- Gillon, who takes up his post in September, has admitted using torture on Palestinians when he was Israeli intelligence chief in the mid-1990s. Controversially he recently advocated the use of "moderate physical pressure" on Arab dissidents in the intifada, sparking a major debate in the Danish media. BORSEN

- Far-left opposition Socialist People's Party is to ask the government what it plans to to do to neutralise the gains made by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Denmark's Maersk Air in illegal cartel operations. The two airlines were  fined almost 400 million crowns ($47 million) by the European Commission for entering a clandestine cartelagreement earlier this week.

- The Danish Competition Authority is to work for a refund to passengers of excessively-priced air tickets due to the  SAS-Maersk deal, particularly on the lucrative Copenhagen-Stockholm route.

President of Switzerland visits Estonia

TD
President of Switzerland Moritz Leuenberger is on a visit to Estonia. He met Estonian president Lennart Meri yesterday and stated that Switzerland considers Estonia's accession to the EU important, although Switzerland is not a member of the union. Switzerland is interested in increasing its participation in the developing of the new Europe, the president said.

President Leuenberger also met Prime Minister Mart Laar and was impressed by the emphasis placed on the use of the Internet and IT in the working of the government institutions - the so-called e-government. Estonia could serve as an example to Europe for a number of solutions realised here, the president said.
(from Postimees, page 3; Eesti Pevaleht, page 2)
EU commissioner promises billions of regional support

Estonian officials reassured the EU commissioner Michel Barnier about their administrative capacity. Barnier had previously criticised Estonian officials for inability to draft documents necessary for appealing for EU aid funds.

The commissioner for regional affairs and intergovernmental conference arrived in Estonia yesterday to discuss regional development programmes, EU aid and improvement of efficiency of the Estonian government institutions.
Estonia can receive support amounting to four percent of GDP or up to three billion kroons from the EU
regional policy funds after accession, Barnier explained.

The commissioner commented that he had expressed his concern with Estonia's administrative capacity as more than 60 million euros had been allocated for environment and road construction projects for the
2000-2001 period, but none of the projects has been started as yet. Barnier is responsible for the ISPA
fund, which handles the environmental and road projects.

According to an earlier article in Postimees, the ISPA funding for the road construction had not been received due to a faulty organisation of the tender by the Road Administration and suspicions of the European Commission delegation about the objectivity of the criteria.

The major ISPA projects in Estonia in the 2000-2001 period concern the Via Baltica motorway, the Tallinn landfill and water works projects in Tartu and Narva.

Prime Minister Mart Laar said after his meeting with Barnier that the EU regional policy will be an efficient mechanism for Estonia to reduce the gap with the advanced countries. Estonia is negotiating to have its entire territory included in the EU regional programme target area and to be included in the recipients of aid from the EU cohesion fund.

Preatoni's real estate business suspected of fraud

The trading of shares of the Italian investor Ernesto Preatoni's Pro Kapital Grupp has been suspended pending the investigation of real estate deals, which may have harmed the interests of the shareholders

Page 61 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and caused some 100 million kroon loss. The Pro Kapital management has refused to commend on the suspicions.

Tallinn Stock Exchange director general Gert Tiivas said that the stock exchange is relying on the law enforcement agencies to investigate the suspicions.

Press reports speculate that Pro Kapital is surrounded by a network of offshore firms, from which it buys real estate at prices higher than the market price. The circle of individuals,inked to the offshore firms is approximately 50, according to the Pro Kapital manager Andrus Laurits. The total number of shareholders is approximately 300.

ripev claims that Preatoni has drained the group's profits of several hundred million kroons. The weekly Eesti Ekspress also investigated the transactions between Pro Kapital and the offshore firms, citing the case, where Pro Kapital sold a land plot in Tallinn to Preatoni's firm Baltic Investments for 900,000 kroons; Baltic Investments sold the same plot back a year later for 82 million kroons. There are several other cases, where Pro Kapital has purchased land at a price significantly above the current market price and most of the real estate is undeveloped and does not earn profit.

The interest in Preatoni's real estate business began last week as the company sued its former top official Ilona Saari for having concluded a harmful transaction, resulting in 16 million kroon loss. Saari in turn has accused Preatoni of having threatened to kill her.
(from Postimees, page 1, 3; ripev, page 7, 21) New traffic act is harsh on young drivers
The newspapers report that the new traffic act, which came in force from February, is harsh on the young drivers, who have temporary or primary licenses. According to the traffic act, these licenses will be cancelled in case of certain violations, including speeding and drunken driving, forcing the owners to pass all driving tests again.

The police have already invalidated some 700 primary licenses. In more than half of the cases, speeding (36 percent) and drunkenness (20.5 percent) have been the reasons. Other cases include traffic accidents, hazardous driving and minor violations, but also absence of insurance. Tallinn traffic police Commissar
Villu Vane admitted that the law has been excessively harsh in some cases like driving without insurance or number plates.
(from Postimees, page 1, 12; Eesti Pevaleht, page 4) In brief
Postimees reported that the main reasons of death in Estonia in 2000 were cardiovascular diseases,
cancer and accidents. Cardiovascular problems have been the main cause of deaths for the last five years,
the figure for 2000 being 9,988 individuals. Cancer killed 3,390 and accidents 2,100 people.

The Finance Ministry treasury department has addressed a letter to the Estonian Air management concerning its possible agreement with SAS on the limiting of competition. The majority shareholder of EA, Maersk Air, has been fined by the EU for a cartel agreement with SAS.

The daily Postimees reviewed cases, when the Tallinn traffic control centre has illegally exacted parking fines. In one case, a car owner had received five parking tickets for nonexistent violations and had to prove his innocence in court.
Estonia's representative at the Council of Europe Ants Frosch signed yesterday the European convention
of supervision of criminals with suspended sentences or on parole, which enables such individuals to leave
Estonia in the future.

The head of the Moscow-subordinated Russian Orthodox church Cornelius has sent a letter to president Lennart Meri, accusing the Estonia authorities of interfering with internal affairs of the church. The conflict concerns the name of the church, which cannot be registered due to similarity to the
Constantinople-registered Orthodox church.

The Electric Railway Co. plans to increase its network and to introduce goods transport, which would provide considerable economy. But the Estonian Railway management considers the necessary investments too high.

The profit of the Estonian Telecom in the second quarter declined 25 percent as compared to same period in 2000, thanks to the opening of the market to competition. However, the competition mainly concerns the international calls, since Estonian Telephone has the  monopoly of fixed networks in Estonia.

HD   COMPETITION/AIR TRANSPORT - SAS AND MAERSK AIR FINED FOR MARKET-SHARING PACT. WC  714 words

The European Commission decided on July 18 to  fine Scandinavian airlines SAS and Maersk Air Euro
39.375 million and Euro 13.125 million respectively for operating a secret agreement that led to the
monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route to the detriment of over one million
passengers that use that major route every year, as well as to the sharing out of other routes to and from
Denmark. SAS was fined Euro 39.375 million and  Maersk Air 13.125 million for breach of EU competition
rules. While the Danish airline has simply "taken note" of the Commission's Decision,  SAS has already said
it will appeal against the  fine, which it reckons is far too high.

TD
SAS and Maersk Air are the two main airlines to fly routes to and from Denmark, the country on which the Commission's inquiry was concentrated. The two companies concluded a co-operation  agreement in October 1998 which they notified to the European Commission for regulatory approval. The notification, however, focused on code-sharing provisions, under which SAS could market Maersk Air's flights as  SAS flights, and the extension of  SAS's frequent flyer programme to Maersk's clients. The airlines carefully omitted what amounts to being a broad market-sharing agreement, the most visible part of which led to the withdrawal by Maersk Air from the Copenhagen-Stockholm and SAS's exit from the Copenhagen-Venice and Frankfurt-Billund routes. Billund is Denmark's second airport in the Western province of Jutland.Suspecting that the co-operation  agreement was of a greater and restrictive scope, the
Commission inspected the companies' headquarters in June 2000, gathering evidence that  SAS and Maersk Air had agreed an overall non-competitive clause, according to which  Maersk Air would not launch any new international routes from Copenhagen without approval from  SAS. Conversely, the parties agreed that SAS would not operate on  Maersk Air's routes out of Jutland's Billund. The parties also agreed to respect the share-out of the domestic routes.According to the Commission, the secret  agreement between SAS and Maersk Air was "very damaging" for Scandinavian passengers which were left with reduced
choice or no choice at all, and potentially higher prices. Before the  agreement, the Copenhagen-Stockholm route was operated by  SAS, Maersk Air and Finnair. Maersk's withdrawal from the route caused the exit of Finnair, as the two airlines previously had a code-sharing agreement. This left  SAS controlling virtually
100% of the traffic between the Danish and the Swedish capitals. The Commission said "the anti-trust violation at stake is a very serious one because of its nature, the size of the relevant geographic market and the actual impact on the market". On top of that, "the companies were also fully aware that the
agreement was illegal as they deliberately tried to conceal it". The Commission referred to a meeting of the project managers' group of in June 1998, which had "ordered" the airlines "to maintain strict confidentiality and not to keep documents in the office".Reactions.Neither  SAS nor Maersk Air are questioning the Commission's verdict on the offence of violating EU competition rules. SAS is nevertheless planning to appeal against the Decision over the size of the  fine, which it feels is "disproportionate". In a statement, SAS Chairman Joergen Lindegaard denies the alleged prejudice for the company's clients, arguing that the fares charged on the routes covered by the investigation were no higher than other comparable routes. While acknowledging that breach of EU competition rules was "totally unacceptable", he also stressed that "the main obstacle to free competition in the European aviation industry in the past has been widespread state support which we have been unable to prevent". Mario Monti, the EU's Competition Commissioner, said: "This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers. The Commission is determined to ensure that the liberalisation achieved in the European air transport in the last decade is not undermined by anti-competitive agreements. I trust that the  fines imposed to SAS and to Maersk Air will serve as a deterrent to the two airlines concerned and to others."

Toomas Peterson, general director of the Estonian Aviation Administration, admitted that air routes between Estonia and Scandinavia are controlled by one  monopoly but the Aviation Administration has no opportunity to forcibly change the situation.

Peterson told BNS that strategic cooperation between  SAS and Estonian Air on Scandinavian air routes does mean the monoply of an aviation alliance, but this is simply the market situation at the moment and the Aviation Administration cannot coerce competitors fly on those routes.

TD
"We have signed very liberal aviation agreements with the Nordic countries and if someone emerged to put up competition on the Stockholm and Copenhagen routes, we would only welcome it," he said.

Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) and Estonian Air together with its Danish owner  Maersk Air belong to the international Star Alliance, while Finnair belongs to another leading aviation alliance, One World.
The European Commission Wednesday fined SAS and Maersk Air with respectively 39.4 million and
13.1 million euros for forming a  cartel. The commission said that a secret supplement to the two firms'
cooperation agreement made it possible for  SAS to monopolize the lucrative Copenhagen-Stockholm
route, thus damaging the interests of millions of people flying on the route. Maersk Air ceased flying on
the Copenhagen-Stockholm route as of March 28, 1999, when it gave monopoly on the route to  SAS.

Estonian Air became member of Star Alliance and signed a long-term cooperation  agreement with SAS at the end of December 1998. From March 28, 1999 a code-sharing  agreement between Estonian Air and SAS came into effect, applied to air routes from Tallinn to Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo.

In summer seaons,  SAS witherew from flying on the Tallinn-Copenhagen route and flights were only carried out by Estonian Air. For a similar agreement on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, the Danish competition board complained against Maersk and SAS to the European Union's competition board.

Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS and Denmark's Maersk Air face risk of compensation claims for up to 400 million crowns ($46.7 million) from passengers for excessively-priced air tickets due to an illegal cartel deal. The two airlines
were last week fined almost 400 million crowns by the European Commission for entering a clandestine

- The Danish Competition Authority urges leading bank Danske Bank to speed up disvestments of stakes in various financial institutions including the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The watchdog last year approved Danske's takeover of third biggest financial group RealDanmark on the condition that the bank reduced its holdings in other financial firms, a sell-off which could yield up 1.2 billion crowns to Danske, analysts say. - Looking for more information from local sources?

Condit says strategy is paying off, but Wall Street believes projections are over-optimistic as slump begins to bite

The European Commission has fined SAS Scandinavian Airlines and  Maersk Air a total of over f52 million ($44 million) for collusion.

TD
The two airlines breached European competition rules and colluded to create an illegal  cartel on several routes, significantly Copenhagen to Stockholm, says the EC's competition authority.

SAS describes its f39.375 million share of the  fine "politically motivated" and the company's chief executive Jo.rgen Lindegaard says "We accept we have to be punished, but this sum is totally disproportional and is designed to warn alliances from doing similar deals across Europe."

Mario Monti, the EC's competition commissioner says in a statement: "The Commission is determined to ensure that the liberalisation achieved in European air transport in the last decade is not undermined by anti-competitive agreements. I trust that the  fines imposed on SAS and Maersk will serve as a deterrent."

The fines are the largest the EC has ever levied against airlines and are only matched by a penalty given to a two-decade shipping  cartel, which the EC found had effectively doubled costs on the routes it controlled.  SAS says that it is likely to appeal against the censure after next month's board meeting. The company's vice president government affairs Hans Ollongren says that the size of the  fine is totally dislocated from any possible market advantage that the collusion could have given the airlines. "This is a very strong signal that the EC will not tolerate this kind of collusion," he says.

The EC found that the two airlines had secretly agreed to carve up select pieces of their market, separate from an official code-sharing and frequent flyer collaboration plan submitted to the Commission. This illegal market-sharing led to  Maersk's withdrawal from the route between the Danish and Swedish capitals in March 1999, leaving the Star Alliance with almost 100% of the capacity on this lucrative service.

The EC judged this "very damaging for Scandinavian passengers" and likely to lead to price rises.  SAS says that fares did not rise on the route and fares actually fell on some other routes, due to operational savings.

The EC raided both airlines' offices in April to recover documents outlining the secret deal, concluded in October 1998, which saw  Maersk receiving SAS's Copenhagen to Venice route as a reward for pulling off the intra-capital service. The route between Denmark's second airport, Billund and Norway's capital Oslo was also affected by the collusion, with  SAS pulling off the route with its own aircraft, leaving  Maersk to operate the service for the Scandinavian carrier. It was their tactics on this route that led to the original complaint, brought by British Airways' Danish franchise partner, Sun-Air of Scandinavia, which competes on the route using BA livery.

Sun-Air's founder and chief executive Niels Sundberg says that "SAS has used its monopolistic position to force smaller airlines off various routes across Scandinavia."

Sun-Air is to launch a Stockholm to Copenhagen route early next year, using a 70-seater regional jet, and says that it is now the standard bearer for independent airlines in a region "totally lacking competition". BA says that the decision could lead to advancing its brand in Scandinavia.

Despite slowing commercial aircraft sales, Boeing has raised its revenue forecast for the year, and confirmed its outlook for 2002, saying its six-year strategy of diversification is starting to pay off.
Page 68 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nevertheless, the company is under pressure fromWall Street analysts who believe the projections are over-optimistic in the face of the losses announced by airlines hit by the slowing US economy.

Boeing has reported second-quarter net earnings of $840 million, up 35% over the same period last year. Revenues were up 4% to almost $15.4 billion. Chairman Phil Condit says the strong performance was the result of "running healthy core businesses". Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Military Aircraft & Missiles (A&M) and Space &Communications (S&C) all reported improvedperformances.
The company has increased its revenue forecast for the year by$1 billion, to $58 billion, largely because 32
MD-80s on lease to TWA have been converted to sales following the merger with AmericanAirlines. Boeing
also expects to deliver 538 commercial aircraft this year, eight more than planned.

More importantly, the company has reaffirmed its revenue forecast for 2002 of more than $62 billion, despite revising projected commercial aircraft deliveries downwards from 530 to "between 510 and 520", says Condit. The drop in deliveries will be offset by further improvements in performance at S&C, he says. Production of 717 and 737 narrowbodies is expected to fall next year, he says.
Boeing still anticipates selling 400 commercial aircraft this year, despite having booked gross orders for just
180 in the first half. Meeting the 400-aircraft target depends on securing orders for30-40 from China.

In 2003 Condit anticipates a "modest decrease" in commercial aircraft deliveries although overall earnings are forecast to increase because of improvements atA&M and S&C. The only reductions in gross orders so far this year, Condit says, are the result of the TWA take-over and an airline swapping one type for another. But theproportion of options converted to orders has dropped from a typical 70% to 50%, says Boeing.
Next year's reduced delivery target of 510-520 aircraft is 85% sold out, the company says.
BCA reported revenues of $9.3 billion in the second quarter, 6% down, but operating earnings increased
8% to $955 million and operating margins rose from 8.9% to 10.3%. A&M saw revenues rise 6% to $3.3
billion, operating earnings 67% to $410 million and margins to 12.5%. S&C reported revenues up 40% at
$2.5 billion, operating earnings of $130 million and margins of 5.2%, compared with a loss and negative
margins for the same period last year.

The Scandinavian airline  SAS is facing mounting pressure to find out who was responsible for the airline's illegal no-competition pact with Denmark's  Maersk Air. Both operators were  fined by the European           Commission last week for agreeing not to compete on key routes. The Commission said the pact had led to the monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen-Stockholm route.

There is now broad political support for an investigation into the deal, not least because it is felt in some quarters that  SAS's senior management must have known about the pact. However,  SAS's chairman Harald Norvik said the airline had decided not to hold individuals personally responsible.

TD
Nicolas Fischer, a deputy employee representative on  SAS's board, said he believed the airline's former chief executive Jan Stenberg must have known about the pact. "I refuse to believe that such an important agreement...would be entrusted to ordinary employees," he said.

However, senior SAS shop steward Helmuth Jacobsen said he doubted whether Stenberg had known about the deal. "I think Stenberg is too honest for that. He just put his trust in those around him."

The European Commission fined Swedish carrier Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Maersk Air
53 million euros ($46.08 million) on July 17 for a cooperation  agreement that led to price fixing on the
Copenhagen-Stockholm route.

Some Estonians fear that  Maersk Air, which owns 49 percent of Estonian Air, may have had similar agreements with  SAS in Estonia.

TD
SAS and Maersk Air, both of which belong to the international Star Alliance, signed a cooperation agreement on March 1999 under which Maersk ceased flying on the Copenhagen-Stockholm route, giving SAS a monopoly on that route. Maersk Air also promised not to start on the routes occupied by SAS.

Jorn Eriksen, president of Estonian Air, denied accusations of a cartelagreement in Estonia, saying that there was a normal program of cooperation between Estonian Air and SAS in Estonia, which is common among aviation companies worldwide.

"Estonian Air, like many other airlines, has agreements with a number of companies. The market size decides how many companies can fly on one route," said Eriksen. "On some routes there is room for one carrier, on others, like Riga, Vilnius or Stockholm, there is room for two."

He said that flights on different routes are also competing with each other, because people would change planes in Helsinki, Stockholm or Copenhagen for a flight that would take them to the destination country.
Estonian Air operates two 107-seat Boeing 737-500 aircraft and two 46-seat Fokker 50 aircraft, and it
has flights to nine destinations: Stockholm, Copenhagen, London, Hamburg, Moscow, Kiev, Riga, Vilnius
and Frankfurt.
Raimond Made, spokesman for Estonian Air, said that the company operates alone on such routes as
Copenhagen, Hamburg, Frankfurt, London, Moscow and Kiev.

He said that on the Tallinn-Amsterdam route Estonian Air is in a "code share" program with  SAS. Estonian Air takes people to Copenhagen or Stockholm, and  SAS then transfers them to Amsterdam.

"In the past we flew to Amsterdam, but it was an unprofitable route, because the Boeing aircraft was too big for this and the Fokker would not fly so far. There is no  monopoly. If we find that it is economically viable to fly to Amsterdam and we have the right plane, we'll open the line again," said Made.

According to the daily newspaper Postimees,Estonian Air doubled its prices recently on Stockholm flights from 3,900 kroons ($210) to 6,680 kroons.

"I am impressed with how many mistakes the papers make. They compare totally different prices. Our lowest price to Stockholm is 3,700 kroons," Eriksen said.

Inge Koppel, product manager at Estonian Holidays, said that Estonian Air's prices have not risen any more than those of other airlines.
According to Eriksen, the company is increasing the prices due to inflation.

"We cannot charge the same prices we did five years ago, because the dollar rating, airport charges and fuel prices have gone up. Of course it is expensive to fly, but airlines do not make big profits," he said.

Eriksen said that Lithuanian Airlines, which is known for its cheap tickets, posts enormous losses. Estonian Air had 9.8 million kroon losses last year, but expects to end this year in the black. The company's turnover reached 777 million kroons in 2000.
"We are a private enterprise and our shareholders cannot afford losses," said Eriksen.
The Estonian Competition Board will start investigating the possible agreements between  SAS, Estonian
Air and the entire aviation market in the fall.

"The consolidations that take place on international aviation markets and their influence on the Estonian market, as well as investigations carried out by the  European Commission, have given us a signal that this sector needs more attention," said Peeter Tammistu, head of the Competition Board.

He said that infringing on the competition law might bring a  fine that could reach up to 5 percent of the company's sales last year.

Toomas Peterson, general director of the Estonian Aviation Administration, admitted that Estonian Air controls some of the routes. But there are not many companies willing to compete with them on the small Estonian market.

"They have a  monopoly not because we do not enable anyone to come. It is because no one else wants to come," he said. "We do not have the ability nor the wish to interfere in the tariff policies of aviation companies. The European market is already very liberal in this regard."

Jukka Narakka, Vice President of Finnair, said that the cooperation between two airlines does not enable the Estonian Air to raise fares. "But if this kind of cooperation creates a  monopoly in any particular market, the fares are likely to go up," he added.

Narakka said that Finnair is very interested in the Estonian market because of its closeness to Helsinki and because Finnair already has services to all major markets in Europe.

"The competition in Estonia is increasing as the market matures. One has to understand that the market for air travel in Estonia is both very young and relatively small," said Narakka. According to Narakka the market is basically divided between the Star-Alliance (SAS, Lufthansa, Estonian Air etc.) and Oneworld (Finnair, British Airways etc.).

BELGIUM: Each week, our reporters and correspondents across the member states report on how the EU
is seen outside

TD
Brussels and Strasbourg. While not exhaustive, we hope What the Papers Say will provide a flavour of how our fellow EU-watchers are covering the news and issues of the day. Countries featured will vary from week to week. King Albert, in his annual address to the Belgians on the country's national day, 21
July, focused entirely on Europe and the EU presidency. In the King's view, reported De Standaard, "the regional, the national and the European identity are in fact complementary realities".In business daily De Tijd, Geert Noels, chief economist at stockbrokers Petercam, called on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates. However, this could take nine months to have an effect, he warned. The Bonn/Kyoto deal and the role played by Belgian Green minister Olivier Deleuze on behalf of the EU, attracted a lot of comment. "Kyoto light" was the title of the commentary in De Standaard by Axel Buyse, who said claims of a victory for "multilateralism...should be taken with a grain of salt". Xavier Ducarme in La Libre Belgique saw the agreement as "a good beginning, certainly, but a drop in the ocean of CO2. To effectively combat global warming, at least ten times more needs to be done".

ITALY: Italy's dynamic northeast region would become hostile to the EU if it curbed its development by delaying enlargement or by failing to adopt growth-boosting rules, warns Rome's daily la Repubblica. Contrary to the rest of Italy, the role of the EU is not particularly appreciated in this region. The area has alre

ady achieved economic Integration with Hungary, Slovenia and Romania and changes to the accession process of these countries "could turn euro-disappointment into euro-hostility," the paper said.

In an area where non-EU workers reach up to 15-20% of the population, the Commission's rules on immigrant workers will be scrutinised to see if they satisfy the region's economic back-bone: small and medium enterprises. Proposals by EU justice chief António Vitorino to give permits for workers coming from candid

ate states and to increase the number of immigrants with scientific and technological skills should be welcome in a region whose development is dependent on non-EU workers.

HUNGARY: Having troubles in the accession talks? Grow olive trees, then lobby and bribe in Brussels, according to advice given in NÈpszabads·g, Hungary's largest daily. While the 110 million people in the fast-track accession states are budgeted to receive h3 billion this year, two million olive seed farmers in southern Europe

will get h2.25 billion in subsidies. "Be honest: what's nicer, almond-filled olives or the improvement in state administration in Eastern Europe? The answer is obvious," NÈpszabads·g concludes sarcastically.
Though the law forbids subsidies on olives from trees planted after 1998, it's hard to tell where seeds on a truck came from. "The result: little cheating, huge income," the paper claims. The tangled system leaves much room for manoeuvre, with just a tiny chance of getting caught: only 6% of the ille
gally collected subsidies have been claimed back by Brussels in the past 11 years.

Despite calls for reform, change has been pushed back by three years thanks to lobbying and"some bribes if the arguments need to be backed up," NÈpszabads·g quotes Brussels sources.

FRANCE: In an interview with Le Monde Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel warned that the EU is suffering from a "political crisis" and that citizens felt excluded from the debate over Europe's future. The centre-left daily also r

an a piece on Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's visit to Romania - part of a Paris effort to build bridges with applicant states after last year's lacklustre French presidency. Meanwhile, Southern French daily La DÈpÍche du Midi reported that French hunters contesting the opening date of the season want Brussels to let them start eliminating fauna from early August but the Commission argues they should wait until September. National news agency AFP reported that Jospin has asked EU environment supremo Margot
Wallström to give the hunters a break. Next year is, coincidentally, an election year in France. SLOVAKIA: Slovak dailies report the Commission decision to stop the transfer of 10% of EU financial
support to Slovakia because of a case of misuse of the "euromoney". The press also points out that the
ability of EU investigation unit OLAF and Slovak police to investigate the case refute suspicions of corrupt
ties between officials in Bratislava and Brussels. Daily Sme announced Slovakia's support fo

r a Union proposal at the UN Conference on light weapons. According to Jan Figel, the Slovak foreign ministry state secretary, the measure is close to the approach of Slovakia. Daily Nrodn·Obroda highlights the benefits enlargement will bring to old and new EU members. "New members will get more from the enlargement than old ones" - basing this claim on a study by the Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) which predicts 8-9% gross domestic product growth in new member countries in the ten years a
fter enlargement.

SPAIN: Euroscepticism is on the rise in Spain, one of the EU's most europhile states. El Pais cites the Eurobarometer poll in reporting that the number of Spaniards who support the country's Union membership fell this spring to 57% from 63% last autumn. Those who think that membership is benefiting
Spain posted an even bigger drop, down to 54% from a previous 64%. Trust in the  European                    Commission is also falling to 54% from 62%. The only indicator posting a positive result is s
upport for the Common Security and Foreign Policy, up to 72% from 68%.

SWEDEN: SAS, the Swedish airline, accepted the Commission's decision on price-fixing between  SAS and Maersk Air. SAS was fined h39 million and Maersk Air h13 million for breaching EU anti-trust laws. Legal consequences after the violence at the Union summit in Göteborg include six years imprisonment for a 20-year-old man who was a leader during the disturbances and five to eight months for six Danish people. About 70% of Afton

bladet readers believe radiation from mobile phones could be dangerous to humans. The Union proposal for standardised methods to measure radiation was received positively by both users and producers. The benchmark, which was proposed by the European committee Cenelec, will be in effect from 1 March
2002. However, Nokia and Ericsson will start radiation classification from October.

TURKEY: Karen Fogg, the head of the Commission's representation in Turkey, received a public tongue-lashing from on

e of the country's leading social democrat politicians for calling the Turkish left "elitist and isolated from the people". Fogg told daily Milliyet the Turkish left-wing parties, unlike their European counterparts, "represented the status quo rather than change". "What's missing in those parties are links with people. They are essentially elitist and pro-establishment," said Fogg; stressing that she was speaking as a
political scientist, rather than as an EU official. But this explanation failed to calm t

he rage of Deniz Baykal, the leader of Turkey's oldest left-wing party and a political scientist himself. "For the first time, the Turkish left, which has suffered much pain, has a chance to carry its policies to power. We cannot let this chance be destroyed by an EU diplomat who cannot control her tone," Baykal told news-channel NTV.

USA: President Bush's second sojourn to Europe got most of the attention, with most editorial boards venting noxious fumes at his continued hard-line against the K

yoto protocol. The New York Times was but one example, calling Bush's claim that Kyoto will be a global economic drag "shortsighted". Taking dead aim at Brussels' democratic deficit in the Washington Post on Sunday was David Ignatius, who is also the executive editor of the International Herald Tribune. Ignatius argued that efforts to forge ahead with enlargement and the single currency despite growing evidence that European citizens do not support them are "undemocratic". Concluded Ignatius: "The right cou

* Air Canada to Cut Jobs, Fleet after Q2 Loss

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Air Canada plans to cut 4,000 more jobs, or almost 10 percent of its workforce, and scale back its fleet after reporting a much deeper than expected second-quarter loss, the company said on Wednesday. Air Canada, the country's dominant airline accounting for at least 70 percent of domestic scheduled air travel, said it lost C$108 million or 90 Canadian cents a share in the second quarter, compared with a profit of C$124 million or 88 Canadian cents a share in the year earlier period. Revenues were C$2.56 billion versus C$2 billion.
* Cathay Imposes Controversial Terms on Pilots

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways imposed a controversial new rostering system on its pilots on Wednesday, but pilots refrained from escalating a labour dispute now in its fifth week. Local media had speculated about a possible showdown on the first day of the new system. But the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association said it had told pilots to report as usual while continuing to work to rule.

"It should be business as normal. We advised our pilots yesterday evening to go to work as normal and to operate in accordance with the manuals," union general secretary John Findlay told Reuters. The union represents more than 85 percent of Cathay's pilots. Cathay spokeswoman Lisa Wong said five flights
were delayed more than 15 minutes on Wednesday, but otherwise "it is business as usual".
* US Airways Heads into Stormy Patch with Pilots


Page 78 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. appears headed into a confrontation with its pilots as the airline tries to expand its regional jet fleet to staunch financial losses after the recent collapse of UAL Corp.'s $4.3 billion takeover bid. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents US Air pilots, on Tuesday said the airline's failure to negotiate could sabotage an  agreement over the plan the No. 6 U.S. carrier hopes will rejuvenate its profits.

"The path to confrontation was paved very smoothly and very cleanly by this management team," said Roy Freundlich, a US Airways pilot spokesman. Regional jets, which carry about 30 to 70 passengers, are increasingly viewed as a more efficient alternative to turbo-prop aircraft on shorter and medium-haul routes. Airline unions have often negotiated contracts limiting the use of regional jets because pilots are paid less than for flying larger aircraft.
* Six Dead in Plane Crash on Alaskan Glacier

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Six people died when a small airplane in which they were traveling crashed on an Alaskan glacier during a sightseeing trip, the Alaska State Troopers said on Tuesday. Four of the passengers were German, one was Canadian and the pilot was a U.S. citizen, troopers spokesman Greg Wilkinson said. Wreckage of the plane, a Cherokee Six owned by regional air carrier LAB Flying Service, was spotted on Monday night about 10 miles (16 km) south of Haines, a town 80 miles (130 km) north of Juneau.

A search began on Monday afternoon when the plane failed to return to Skagway at its scheduled time, the troopers said. The flight was scheduled for an hourlong sightseeing tour of Glacier Bay National Park.
* Sri Lankan Air Looks to Shed More Staff

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Crisis-hit SriLankan Airlines will offer employees another voluntary retirement plan in a bid to slash costs after a devastating rebel attack last week grounded half its fleet, an official said on Tuesday. That comes after the partially state-owned airline announced a retirement scheme just last month that was accepted by 600 of its more than 5,000 workers.
"We will be announcing another retirement scheme tomorrow," the airline official said. He did not
elaborate on the number of people likely to accept the early retirement package. A massive suicide attack
by separatist rebels on the country's only international airport last week left the airline struggling, with
three new Airbus aircraft destroyed and three more planes grounded.
* Insurance Surcharge Hits Flights to Sri Lanka

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Insurance companies on Tuesday imposed a massive surcharge on airlines flying to Sri Lanka after three commercial jetliners were destroyed in a rebel attack last week on the country's only international airport. The move was accompanied by an immediate increase in air fares to Sri Lanka, something that could throttle a tourist industry already bracing for deep recession after the raid left aircraft burning on the tarmac and sent scores of tourists scrambling for cover.

"There is a surcharge that will go up to $115,000 per flight, depending on the category of the aircraft," a senior industry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Several foreign airlines put their flights to Sri Lanka under review after the attack on the Bandaranaike International Airport by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam destroyed or damaged half the fleet of national carrier SriLankan Airlines.
* Qantas Puts 14 Oldest Boeings Up For Sale

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd is looking for buyers for seven Boeing 767-200s and seven old-model 747s as it prepares to take delivery of new aircraft. On the Boeing Aircraft Trading Website the Australian airline has listed two 747SPs available in November 2001, seven 767-200ERs available from May 2003 to June 2004, and six 747-200s available from August 2004 to November 2007.

Qantas is unlikely to get much for the planes, which were built in the late 1970s and 1980s. At the beginning of the year, specialist magazine Aircraft Value News valued 20-year-old 747-200s at $15 million, but the already weak market has slumped further since then. Two of the 747-200s are converted
747 Combis, which can carry freight and passengers on their main decks and might attract a higher price.
* Atlas Air has Q2 Loss of $49 Million

PURCHASE, N.Y. (Reuters) - Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., feeling the effects of a difficult air cargo market, said on Tuesday it had a loss of $49.0 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter. That compared with net income of $19.o million, or 53 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.



Page 79 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Atlas Air's second quarter financial performance, while consistent with our expectations, reflects the very difficult air freight environment the industry currently faces," said Richard Shuyler, chief executive officer.
* FAA Proposes Fining American for Security Breaches

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday proposed fining the world's biggest air carrier, American Airlines, $99,000 for security breaches involving six flights last year. FAA special agents found on June 25, 2000, that the airline improperly carried unaccompanied bags on five flights, failed to perform passenger identification checks on two flights and failed to ask security questions regarding checked bags on two flights.

American, owned by AMR Corp., took immediate action to correct the problems at the airports where violations were found, the FAA said. The discoveries were made during an assessment of the airline's passenger pre-screening and checked baggage security.
* Denmark's Maersk Air won't Appeal Against EU  Fine

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish carrier Maersk Air, owned by shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller, said on Wednesday it would not appeal against a European Commission fine for breach of EU competition rules with Scandinavian airline  SAS. In July, the Commission said Maersk Air and SAS had entered into a clandestine  agreement that led to the  monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen to Stockholm route, to the detriment of over one million passengers.

"The factual findings are not contested, and  Maersk Air has taken note of the decision and decided not to bring the size of the  fine before the European Court of Justice," A.P. Moeller said in a statement.
* Florida West and Ladeco to Share 767-300 Freighter

MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida West International Airways expects in August to start sharing the use of a new Boeing 767-300F freighter aircraft with Ladeco, a carrier owned by airline company Lan Chile, the president of Florida West told Reuters. "We are going to fly it about 40 percent of the time," Florida West President Richard Haberly said in an interview on Tuesday.

Miami-based Florida West, an all-cargo carrier, and Ladeco, expect to begin this week sharing the use of the freighter under an interchange  agreement, Haberly added. While the Florida West route structure for the shared freighter was still being developed, likely destinations include Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Haberly said.
* FAA's Garvey says Flight Delays Down in July

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. flight delays declined in July compared to last year, continuing the year to date's encouraging trend toward lower traveler frustration, Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey said on Tuesday. "On average when we look at the last four months we've seen about a 10 percent decrease in delays, and our preliminary numbers for July show a continued decline in delays as well," Garvey told a congressional oversight panel.

Garvey, who credited improved airline cooperation and better weather than last year for the decrease, did not give any figures in her testimony to the House Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs.

COPENHAGEN, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline  SAS said on Wednesday a decision on whether to appeal against a  European Commission fine for breach of EU competition rules with Danish carrier Maersk Air would be taken at a board meeting next week.

Maersk Air, owned by Danish shipping and oil group A.P.

"The decision on whether  SAS will appeal or not and whatever consequenses the case might get within
SAS will be taken at the board meeting on August 8,"  SAS spokesman Troels Rasmussen told Reuters.

The European Commission, EU's executive body, last month  fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.7 million) and Maersk Air 13.1 million euros.

A.P. Moeller said on Wednesday it did not contest the findings of the Commission and decided not to bring the size of the  fine before the European Court of Justice.

STOCKHOLM, Aug 2 (AFP) - The Swedish government said Thursday it planned to question management of state-owned Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) over its involvement in a route-fixing deal that resulted in an EU  fine of 52.5 million euros (45.3 million dollars).

SAS, co-owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, and Danish carrier Maersk Air
were fined by the European Commission on July 18 for cutting a secret deal to monopolize air routes in
Scandinavia.

"We want to know how this could have happened, how  SAS could violate competition laws this way," a spokesman for Consumer Policies Minister Britta Lejon told AFP.

The spokemsan said it was as yet unclear whether a formal investigation would be carried out, but said the Trade Ministry would be in charge of questioning  SAS.

In comments to the Swedish news agency TT, Lejon said: "SAS's job is to provide safe, effective, and accessible services to Nordic travellers.  SAS has apparently not understood its mandate."

"Like other companies,  SAS should obey the law and consumers' interests must be looked after," she said, adding: "I think one should direct sharp criticism against  SAS."

Her comments came one day after the Swedish Competition Authority announced that it was investigating whether SAS and Swedish carrier Skyways had also secretly agreed on price-fixing on Swedish domestic routes.

The authority seized documents from the two companies in a raid on their offices in August last year, and a decision to conduct a full investigation was taken in May.
A ruling in that case is expected sometime during the autumn. po/hd

Heads roll at AP Mller after Brussels  fine for Maersk AirBy Janet PorterAPwas forced into a top management reshuffle yesterday after the European Commission fined Maersk Air E13.1m (US$11.43m) last month for anti-competitive behaviour.

The airline was found guilty of operating a secret  agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System that primarily affected the Copenhagen-Stockholm route.

TD
The biggest head to roll is Bjarne Hansen, one of just six partners in the huge conglomerate. Mr Hansen, who was chairman of  Maersk Air as well as an APpartner, has resigned from both positions and will be moving to Singapore to take charge of the group's activities across much of Asia, mostly shipping related.

He replaces Flemming Ipsen who will be moving back to Copenhagen to take over as managing director of Maersk Air.
The former managing director of the airline, Ole Dietz, has resigned because of the Brussels ruling. Troels Dilling, the former chairman of  Maersk Air from 1990 to 1996, will resume that position as
chairman following Mr Hansen's resignation.

No new partner has been appointed at this stage to replace Mr Hansen, who joined APin 1957 and worked for Maersk Air since it was formed in 1969.

However, two new APpartners joined the top team at the beginning of July, Tommy Thomsen and Kjeld Fjeldgaard. The other partners are Jess Sderberg, APchief executive; Knud Stubkjaer, head of  Maersk Sealand; and chairman  Maersk Mc-Kinney Mller.

Maersk Air has been fined E13.1m while a  fine of E39.3m has been levied on  SAS.

SAS has admitted breaking the law but is considering appealing the  fine.

However, Mr Mc-Kinney Mller said in a statement yesterday that neither the factual findings of the case nor the fine would be contested.

"APis not always in  agreement with the commission's interpretation of EUbut a deliberate infringement is not acceptable and is deeply regretted," he said.

The fall-out from the Scandinavian airline price fixing scandal claimed another management victim on
Friday as one of  SAS' most senior managers quit.

The resignation of Vagn Sorensen,  SAS deputy chief executive and head of the commercial department, comes just days after the two top managers at Denmark-based  Maersk Air, a unit of shipping group A P Moller, were dismissed for their part in the affair.

TD
Two weeks ago, the European Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air a total of E52.5m ($46.4m)
for colluding to run a monopoly on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, one of the region's busiest.

The pressure increased on  SAS, the region's dominant airline, this week when the Swedish competition watchdog said it had launched an investigation into the airline's pricing practices on Swedish domestic routes with another partner, Skyways.

Politicians have also called on  SAS, which is still majority owned by the government's of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, to discipline all those responsible in the  Maersk Air scandal.
Mr Sorensen was also chief executive of  SAS Denmark at the time that the price fixing with  Maersk
was agreed.

STOCKHOLM -- A senior executive with Scandinavian Airlines System resigned from his post Friday following a heavy  fine by the European Union over an illegal pact with  Maersk Air AS.

TD
SAS Executive Vice President Vagn Soerensen said he felt obliged to leave his post to help alleviate the pressure faced by the Nordic airline over the  fine. Analysts said the EU  fine had been expected to claim an SAS executive, but Mr. Soerensen's departure is a blow for the management team.

"The cartel affair is very unfortunate and burdening for  SAS. Personally, I have not been an integral part of the illegal agreements, but they were made in my part of the organization," Mr. Soerensen said in a statement. "Therefore I feel a moral responsibility for what has happened and I hope that my decision will help decrease the present negative pressure on  SAS."
Mr. Soerensen, 41 years old, joined  SAS in 1984 and has been head of the Business Systems
Division since 1993. He will seek other opportunities within the  SAS group.

Last month, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, slapped a 39.4 million-euro ($34.8 million) fine on SAS and a 13.1 million-euro  fine on Maersk Air following an investigation into a 1999 agreement. Under this pact,  Maersk Air pulled out of operations between Stockholm and Copenhagen, leaving the route solely to  SAS.

The commission said this was tantamount to letting  SAS have a monopoly on the route. An  SAS spokeswoman said the company will decide at a board meeting on Wednesday whether it will appeal or pay the fine.

Earlier this week, two officials within the A.P. Moller Group -- which owns Maersk Air -- resigned in the wake of the  fine. Maersk Air doesn't intend to appeal the amount of the fine.

SAS deputy chief resigns

The fall-out from the Scandinavian airline price-fixing scandal claimed another management victim today as one of the most senior managers at  SAS quit.

TD
The resignation of Vagn Sorensen, one of  SAS's three deputy chief executives and head of the commercial department, comes just days after the two top managers at Denmark-based  Maersk Air, a unit of shipping group A P Moller, were dismissed for their part in the affair.

Two weeks ago, the European Commission fined SAS and Maersk Air a total of E52.5m ($46.4m) for colluding to run a monopoly on the Stockholm-Copenhagen route, one of the region's busiest.

Corus names industry veteran as its chief

Corus, the Anglo-Dutch metals group planning to cut more than 10,000 UK jobs over the next two years, on Thursday named Tony Pedd er as its new chief executive.

Pedder, a 29-year steel industry veteran and head of Corus' core carbon steel business since 1999, will replace Sir Brian Moffat, who remains chairman.

Analysts said the appointment had been widely expected, although some remained sceptical about its underlying message.

"The fact that they have been unable to attract outside talent for the top job is a symptom of the group's plight," said one analyst.

Hit by the strength of sterling and the global oversupply of steel, the group announced a tough restructuring programme - including an initial 6,000 UK job cuts - in February, prompting fierce criticism from union leaders and politicians.

Michael Shillaker of UBS Warburg said Pedder is facing two big challenges: "To continue with the UK
restructuring programme and to restore the Dutch operation to former profitability levels."

Page 87 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Pedder said the restructuring programme "was performing well", praising the "support" from Corus's workforce. He promised to divulge further details about the state of programme at the interim results in September.

The group, which is one of the top three European steel producers, said it was aiming to reduce its dependence on carbon steel exports.

However, analysts said the group would continue to face problems in its carbon steel business, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of sales.

"With world steel prices at historical lows and given the rapidly deteriorating state of UK manufacturing, the current restructuring programme may not go far enough," said one analyst.

Corus, created by the 1999 merger between British Steel and Hoogovens of the Netherlands, made an operating loss of GBP1.2bn last year, after restructuring charges of GBP1bn.
Its UK carbon steel operation accounted for the bulk of the losses.
Analysts expect the company to make an operating loss of GBP200m in the year to December.

Pedder, 52, held a number of positions at British Steel, which he joined in 1972. Sir Brian took the helm at Corus in December 2000, following the resignation of John Bryant and Fokko van Duyne, the group's joint chief executives.

Sir Brian claimed Bryant's and van Duyne's lack of progress in dealing with the problems of the carbon steel division had been the main reason for their departure.
Pedder will be replaced by Stuart Pettifor as head of the carbon steel business. Florian Gimbel
Banca di Roma appoints number two

Banca di Roma, Italy's fourth-largest bank, on Thursday named Matteo Arpe, head of Lehman Brothers' European equity strategy and a memb er of its European executive committee, to be its number-two executive.

Arpe will be director-general of the overall banking group, which is burdened with a large portfolio of bad loans, and also chief executive of Mediocredito Centrale, the Rome lender's poorly performing merchant and investment banking unit.

Arpe, 36, spent 13 years at Mediobanca, the influential Milan investment bank, where he was briefly head of corporate finance before a much publicised falling out with its chief executive in 1999.
Arpe, who will remain on Lehman's advisory board, is expected to bring in Lehman to help restructure
Mediocredito.

His key task will be to improve Banca di Roma's 4 per cent return on equity so that it can merge with other banks, analysts say.
Among the most likely partners is San Paolo IMI, the much healthier and larger Turin bank.
The Agnelli family, which controls carmaker Fiat, is a key shareholder of both San Paolo and Banca di
Roma and has had longstanding ties with Mediobanca and Mr Arpe until a recent fallout.

Another leading shareholder of Banca di Roma is ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, which owns 10 per cent and whose chairman earlier this year called for the Rome bank to improve its profitability rapidly.

Arpe's appointment comes two months after Carlo Salvatori resigned as Banca di Roma's chief executive only five months after having joined.
Salvatori clashed with Cesare Geronzi, the bank's politically influential chairman and a close friend of
Antonio Fazio, the Bank of Italy governor.
Banca di Roma last month named its director-general, Giorgio Brambilla, 62, as chief executive. "Arpe is the man of the future for the bank but he certainly has his work cut out for him," said one
analyst in Milan.
In particular, Arpe must accelerate the clean-up of Banca di Roma's troubled loans, which amount to
8.2 per cent of the total despite a massive securitisation programme that had already sold nearly
E2.5bn ($2.2bn) of such loans over the past two years.

The bank received a boost this week when it made estimated pre-tax profits of E175m from the takeover of Olivetti by Pirelli.

It also made a gain of about E175m from Thursday's sale of Banca Mediterranea to a southern regional bank. Fred Kapner, Milan
Boardroom shuffle at Jarvis

Jarvis, the support services group, has appointed Kevin Hyde, head of its infrastructure services division, to the newly-created role of chief operating officer.

The company also announced that Henry Lafferty, former finance director and head of its accommodation services division, had left following Thursday's annual meeting, after resigning from the group.

Paris Moayedi, chief executive, said the management changes reflected the group's increased scale and expansion of its markets.

Insiders indicated that Lafferty had resigned following Hyde's appointment. He is expected to receive a year's salary. Last year, his remuneration package totalled GBP272,000 ($390,266).

Tony Cunningham, managing director of Jarvis's road and rail services division, will become chief executive of the infrastructure services division, while Andrew Sutton, legal and commercial director, will lead accommodation services.

Bob Clarke, engineering and development director, and head of operational safety, will be seconded to the Tube Lines consortium, the preferred bidder for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly PPP franchise, in which Jarvis is a shareholder. Andrea Felsted, London.

STOCKHOLM, Aug 3 (AFP) - The deputy chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Vagn Soerensen, resigned from management on Friday after the carrier was found guilty of route- fixing and fined 52.5 million euros (45.3 million dollars) by the EU.

Soerensen, who stays with the company, said that he had done nothing wrong but was taking moral responsibility for errors in his department

SAS, co-owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, and Danish carrier Maersk Air were fined by the European Commission on July 18 for cutting a secret deal to monopolize air routes in Scandinavia.

"The current  cartel affair is very regrettable and a burden for  SAS. I have not personally been involved in the illegal agreements, but they occurred within my part of the organisation," Soerensen said in a statement.
Soerensen was responsible for the airline's activities in Denmark as chief executive officer for  SAS
Danmark AS.

"Therefore, I feel a strong sense of moral joint responsibility for what has happened and I hope that my decision results in less of a burden on  SAS," he said.
Soerensen will be transferred to another area of responsibility, according to the statement.

The Swedish government said on Thursday it planned to question  SAS management over the route-fixing deal to find out "how this could have happened."

STOCKHOLM, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The deputy CEO of  SAS resigned on Friday over a price-pact scandal in the latest blow to the Nordic airline as it strives to streamline its ownership and cope with fiercer competition and a sagging world economy.

The Scandinavian airline, which will present its first-half results next Wednesday, said Vagn Sorensen was stepping down as deputy CEO but would remain in the company, as the scandal claimed another head.

TD
"The ongoing  cartel affair is deeply regrettable and burdening for  SAS," Sorensen said in a statement. "I have not personally taken part in any illegal agreements, but it took place in my part of the organisation."
Later the airline unveiled a management shakeup including the appointment of Marie Ehrling as Chief
Operating Officer and the new Deputy CEO.

"I am pleased that we could quickly agree on a favourable and expedient distribution of responsibilities," said CEO Jorgen Lindegaard in a statement.

Last month the EU Commission  fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.71 million) for agreeing with Danish airline Maersk - a subsidiary of Danish shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller Group - not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region.

Maersk has said it will not appeal against the EU ruling, which imposed a  fine of 13.1 million euros on the Danish firm, but two of its top executives left their positions this week.

SAS shares were trading in Stockholm five crowns lower at 92 crowns at 1715 GMT, below their lowest closing level this year.
The company said earlier this week it will decide next week whether it will appeal against the  European
Commission fine.
Sweden's competition watchdog has also said it had launched a separate investigation into whether
SAS operated in an anticompetitive way with its domestic Swedish partner Skyways.

SAS - half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway - has suffered negative publicity in recent weeks from a spate of technical problems. Nordic media reported on Friday an  SAS plane had been in a near miss last month in Norway.
TOUGHER MARKET

SAS, which is restructuring its triple shares into a single stock to boost liquidity and transparency, once enjoyed a near monopoly in the Nordic region, but in recent years has faced increased competition from rivals such as Finnair and budget airlines like Ireland's Ryanair .



Page 93 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It is also suffering from falling margins as higher-fare business class passenger volumes decline and analysts expect sales growth, as at other airlines, to weaken. Business class accounts for about one third of SAS passengers.

Last month Merrill Lynch downgraded  SAS from "Neutral" to "Reduce" on expectations that full-year profits would fall by 35 percent to 1.14 billion Swedish crowns because of dwindling passenger demand.

"My gut feeling is that should traffic development continue downwards at the same speed as the last months then I see earnings per share for the first half broadly flat at best," said Lars Heindorff, analyst at Danske Securities.
Full-year earnings will be hit by the EU  fine, he said.

First-half pre-tax profits are expected to fall to 580 million Swedish crowns ($55.77 million) from 739 million a year ago, while sales rise to 24.8 billion from 23.03 billion, said Enskilda analyst Peter Qvist.
But Qvist said he was relatively optimistic about the stock.
"SAS is the last standing of an army of falling soldiers," he said.

The new share structure was supporting prices, and  SAS, which unlike European peers has not issued a profit warning, is less exposed to the flagging U.S. economy. At the same time the  cartel and technical problems do not seem to have seriously undermined investor confidence.
"Of course it does not help the share but I don't think it will have a long-term effect," he said.

SAS, Scandinavia's dominant airline, suffered a severe blow yesterday with the resignation of Vagn
Sorensen, senior vice-president and right-hand man of Jorgen Lindegaard, the chief executive.

The resignation of Mr Sorensen, nicknamed "the comet" for his rapid rise among the ranks, followed the European Commission's imposition last month of a Euros 52.5m ( #32.3m) fine on SAS and Maersk Air, another Danish airline, for breaching competition rules by operating a monopoly on the
Stockholm-Copenhagen route.

TD
SAS shares fell 5 per cent to SKr92 (636p) in response to the loss of an experienced figure who had been with the company since 1984.

Mr Lindegaard, who joined SAS only four months ago from a technology and communications group, said yesterday that the monopoly affair was extremely damaging.

"Our image has been hurt tremendously," he said. Earlier this week, the scandal claimed two top executives at  Maersk Air, who resigned in an effort to prevent the affair from damaging the reputation of AP Moller, their parent company. Yesterday, Mr Sorensen cited similar reasons for his departure and said he felt a "moral responsibility" to resign. However, he also denied having played "an integral role in the illegal agreements".

This observation sparked concern among analysts yesterday and triggered worries about the chain of command within the  SAS organisation and the spectre of further resignations by key personnel. The possibility of additional resignations or dismissals will be clarified at a board meeting on Wednesday.

HD          COMPANIES &FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - SAS cries Mayday after falling  foul of state regulators.

Clare MacCarthy, Nicholas George and Valeria Criscione find its image dented.

For an airline that likes to think of itself as the best friend of the business traveller and the epitome of cool Scandinavian efficiency,  SAS is having an uncomfortably hot summer.

TD
The airline announced on Friday that Vagn Sorensen, one of three deputy managing directors, had resigned in the wake of a price-fixing probe. His departure also removed an executive tipped as a future head of the Scandinavian carrier.

SAS is due to report second-quarter results this week which are likely to reflect a sharp fall-off in the premium business traffic on which the airline relies.

The European Commission probe into an illegal deal between  SAS and its Danish rival,  Maersk Air, has landed the airline with a Euros 39.4m ( $34.8m)  fine and inflicted deep scars on its previously pristine public image.

The two airlines agreed a standard industry code-sharing arrangement to sell seats on each other's flights in 1998. However, the pair also made a secret deal to carve up the market between them by selective withdrawals from lucrative routes.

The deal pushed the cost of abusiness-class ticket between Copenhagen and Stockholm, the region's busiest route, upfrom around DKr3,500 ( $416) to DKr5,300.

Since news of the scandal broke just over a fortnight ago,  SAS has hardly been off the front pages of newspapers across Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the airline's executives are acutely aware of the damage done to its image.

"This is a terrible situation and very, very harmful for  SAS," said Jorgen Lindegaard,  SAS president and chief executive officer.

Mr Lindegaard joined SAS in May from the telecoms sector and his relatively recent tenure insulated him from calls to step down. However, pressure is intensifying with demands for a thorough investigation..

The departure of Mr Sorensen promises to offer only limited relief, and strikes a blow at Mr Lindegaard as his younger deputy was seen as offering key airline experience.
"I think it's wrong to point only at Vagn Sorensen as the only sinner if others were involved," said Svend
Heiselberg, transport spokesman for Denmark's main opposition party.
But the  Maersk debacle is not SAS's only problem with competition officials.

In Sweden, its relationship with Skyways, a regional feeder airline, is the subject of a separate investigation by the Swedish competition authority.



Page 96 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SAS owns 25 per cent of Skyways and controls well over 70 per cent of the domestic airline market. Competition officials have already made clear their dissatisfaction with several parts of the  agreement between the two airlines.
Earlier this year the authority banned  SAS from using its EuroBonus loyalty card scheme on domestic
Swedish routes wherever it faces a rival.
To the dismay of  SAS, the authority ruled the bonus system allowed it to abuse its dominant position. However, the authority's move was warmly welcomed by Swedish business travel organisations which
have long complained about high costs and lack of competition on domestic routes.
In Norway,  SAS is anxiously awaiting for the Norwegian competition authorities to approve its
NKr1.1bn ( $122m) take-over bid for Braathens, Norway's largest domestic carrier.

Surprisingly, in a nation renowned for its touchiness about foreign takeovers, there was no public uproar.

But the competition authorities launched a thorough investigation and even contacted British Airways, KLM and Air France to see if they had any interest in acquiring Braathens.

None showed interest, according to a Norwegian competition case manager, though this does not imply success for SAS.
A preliminary decision on the bid may come before August 22, but the authorities have until November
21 to give their final decision.

A ruling against  SAS would be a severe embarrassment as well as generate financial fall-out from the airline's inability to tighten its grip on one of Scandinavia's key markets.
In the clamour following the  Maersk ruling, Swedish ministers and their colleagues in Denmark and
Norway have been quick to voice their resentment over the price of domestic flights.
Yet as owner, regulator and, indeed, a major customer, the state's role is complex.

Like any other shareholder, the respective governments of the three countries - which together hold 50 per cent of the airline's shares - have a natural interest in seeing a maximum return on their capital by way of strong earnings and high dividends.
But they also have a duty to consumers whose chief concern is value for money and fair ticket prices. The expansion of the European Union and other bodies of international co-operation in recent years
has upped the flying frequency of politicians and civil servants and transformed governments into
valuable clients.

But state procurement officers, like anybody else, need to keep down costs. The Danish government books between 10,000 and 12,000 tickets on the Copenhagen-Brussels route every year, and recently ordered civil servants to use Virgin Express instead of  SAS.

If this is a harbinger of future purchasing trends,  SAS, heavily dependent on the business traveller, could face a bigger problem than the wrath of competition authorities.

Text of report by Swedish radio Ekot web site on 3 August

The deputy managing director of the  SAS airline, Vagn Soerensen, left the management of the group with immediate effect on Friday as a result of an EU judgment on a price cartel with Danish company Maersk Air. Swede Marie Ehrling has been appointed new acting manager of SAS in succession to Soerensen.

TD
The notification of the departure follows sharp criticism of  SAS from the Swedish government and others after the  European Commission ordered SAS and Danish Maersk Air to pay  fines of half a billion kronor [about 48 million dollars], for operating a  cartel and thereby charging high ticket prices on the Stockholm-Copenhagen service.
Yesterday two of the most senior managers of  Maersk Air resigned as a result of the judgment. Source: Sveriges Radio Ekot web site, Stockholm, in Swedish 3 Aug 01.

HD          SAS plane makes unscheduled landing  on tech glitch. WC         363 words

STOCKHOLM, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Scandianvian airline  SAS came under media criticism over the weekend when one of its aircraft was forced to make an unscheduled landing but the troubled carrier said it was satisfied with its security system.

SAS has been in the media spotlight recently over price-fixing allegations and technical problems, although Sweden's aviation safety watchdog said the company reported fewer safety incidents last month than average.

TD
A SAS plane carrying 140 passengers from Nice to Oslo was forced to land in Geneva on Saturday, after its front wheel failed to retract on take-off. That created wind resistance which led to higher fuel consumption.
"We are not worried about this and have full confidence in our security system,"  SAS spokesman Bertil
Ternert told Reuters.
"It had to land because of fuel shortage. This was not a dangerous incident," Tenert said.

The unscheduled landing follows Friday's near collision between an  SAS aircraft and a Braathens plane in Norway, which was widely reported in Nordic media.
The Swedish aviation safety watchdog, Luftfartsverket, played down recent media criticism of  SAS
security and said the 53 safety incidents last month was below a  SAS monthly average of 60.

"There are somewhat fewer cases than normal and only one of them has been classified as dangerous," said Bo Eckerbert, spokesman at the watchdog.
Industry group FlightSafe Consultants last year named  SAS as one of the world's 20 safest airlines. The company, which will report its first half-year results on Wednesday, is struggling with shrinking
profit margins from tougher competition, a slowing world economy and price pact allegations.

In July the European Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.71 million) for breaching EU competition rules in an agreement with Danish airline  Maersk - a subsidiary of Danish oil and shipping group A.P. Moeller Group - not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region.
On Friday,  SAS Deputy Chief Executive Vagn Sorensen resigned over the price pact affair.
Sweden's competition watchdog also said last week it was launching a probe into the air fares of  SAS
and its Swedish partner Skyways.

Elbit becomes majority shareholder in AEL

ACQUISITION Elbit Systems has gained control of Brazilian company Aeroelectronica Industria de Componentes Avionicos (AEL). The deal, which is believed to have cost the Israeli company around $2.3 million for the majority of the shares, enables Elbit to use AEL's facilities for the systems upgrade of Brazilian air force Northrop F-5s. Israel has already had success with upgrade programmes in countries such as Argentina and Chile. The acquisition will help further expand its activities in Latin America.

American accelerates 727 retirements

GROUNDING American Airlines will speed up retirement of its Boeing 727 fleet with the grounding of five more aircraft by the end of the year instead of in 2003, as previously scheduled. American's retirement roster for 2001 now stands at 58 aircraft, 21 of them 727s, 18 more in the BoeingMD-80/90 family, 11
DC-9s, seven MD-11s and one Fokker 100. American said in July it would cut capacity in the face of the
US economic downturn.
Partnerships set on the horizon
SATELLITES

PanAmSat and Japan's JSAT have formed a $100 million joint venture, Horizons, to operate a communications satellite at 127iW, providing internet and other digital services in North America. A Boeing
601HP satellite has been ordered for launch late next year. The companies will jointly own the spacecraft's
24-transponder Ku-band payload, while PanAmSat will own the 24-transponder C-band payload. The
Horizons spacecraft will replace PanAmSat's Galaxy IX satellite, which will be moved.
Virgin MoU with Midwest

CODESHARE Virgin Atlantic Airways has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to codeshare with US carrier Midwest Express Airlines. Under the  agreement, which requires regulatory approval, Midwest will provide non-stop services from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Kansas City, Missouri, to Boston Logan, from where Virgin will provide services to London Gatwick. Codesharing is to begin by year-end.
American and BA put their trust in antitrust

ANTITRUST American Airways and British Airways have renewed their attempt to gain US antitrust immunity for their alliance by filing for clearance of the deal with the US, UK and  European Commission. The airlines formed their alliance in 1996 but walked away from the clearance process after the USA tied the deal to "open skies" negotiations and the EC requested the relinquishment of nearly 300 slots at Heathrow and Gatwick. The Oneworld alliance partners say changes have since taken place in the transatlantic marketplace and  agreement would set the stage for a UK-US open skies  agreement. Approval would bring the airlines in line with other competing transatlantic alliances.

SAS and Maersk executives quit

RESIGNATION Vagn Sorenson, head of Scandinavian Airlines' (SAS) commercial division, has stepped down after the  European Commission's (EC) decision to  fine the Scandinavian flag carrier more than e39 million ($34 million) for its involvement in an illegal anti-competitive pact with  Maersk Air. The Danish carrier's chairman Bjarne Hansen and managing director, Ole Dietz, have also resigned following the ruling,

Page 101 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
with a fine of e13 million imposed on  Maersk by EC regulators.  SAS has set a board meeting for 8 August at which a replacement could be appointed.
Boeing expands with SBS purchase

ACQUISITION Boeing has snapped up airline crew scheduling systems supplier, SBS International, for an undisclosed sum. The sale expands Boeing's integrated services portfolio and complements its recent acquisitions including traffic management and scheduling specialist.

HD        UPDATE 1-SAS tries to curb scandal by deputy CEO exit. BY         By Per Bech Thomsen

COPENHAGEN, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline  SAS , seeking to limit the damage from an embarrassing price-fixing scandal, said on Tuesday its deputy chief executive was leaving.

The move was seen as an attempt to draw a line under the affair which has kept SAS in the media spotlight since the  European Commission in July fined it and Danish airline Maersk Air for breaching EU competition rules by agreeing not to compete on key Nordic routes.

TD
"Vagn Soerensen has today taken full responsibility for the illegal deal with  Maersk Air on market sharing,"  SAS said in statement.

"Soerensen has apologised and said that he only now realises the consequences of the  agreement and the damage it has caused  SAS and its employees,"  SAS said.

Soerensen stepped down as deputy chief executive last week but said he would take another post within the airline as he had "not personally taken part in any illegal agreements".
THE END OF THE AFFAIR?
One analyst said this would not be the end of the affair.

"SAS management is trying to stop the witch-hunt and the political pressure on the company by taking the appropriate consequences of the scandal," a Copenhagen-based analyst said on condition of anonymity.

"But they still have a problem explaining why Soerensen on Friday said he was not personally involved in the deal with  Maersk," he said.
The governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway own half of the Scandinavian flag carrier and
Danish politicians in particular have been calling for  SAS to assign responsibility for the  cartel scandal.

In a comment on Soerensen's resignation, Danish Transport Minister Jacob Buksti said he noted the latest development but underlined that he still expected an "adequate explanation" from  SAS's board of directors on Wednesday, when the company is due to release its first-half 2001 results.

Last week Maersk Air - a subsidiary of Danish oil and shipping group A.P. Moeller Group - said it would not appeal against the EU ruling. This said the two carriers had entered into a clandestine  agreement that led to the  monopolisation by SAS of the Copenhagen to Stockholm route, to the detriment of over one million passengers.
As a consequence of the case,  Maersk Air's chairman and managing director both stepped down.

"By having moved first,  Maersk Air now appear as heroes, while  SAS has remained under pressure," another analyst said.

SAS was fined 39.4 million euros ($34.5 million) by the EU while  Maersk Air was fined 13.1 million euros.

Page 105 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
On top of the price fixing case,  SAS has been fighting a slew of technical problems which have grounded SAS share prices at record lows.

"The share price was already in turbulence due to tough market conditions and this scandal only makes it worse," one analyst said.

SAS, the Scandinavian airline, said on Wednesday it would not appeal against the fine imposed on it by the European Commission for its role in the price fixing scandal with Denmark's Maersk Air.
The airline said it would also launch an "independent" investigation into the board's role in the secret
cartel agreement.

TD
The attempt by management to relieve the pressure on itself came as the embattled carrier unveiled a slump in second quarter profits and cut its forecast for the full year.

SAS shares fell 5.5 per cent to SKr85 in Stockholm.

SAS, which is still majority owned by the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, has come under intense pressure in recent weeks since it was  fined just under E40m ($35m) by the Commission in mid-July for breaking European competition rules.

Vagn Sorensen, one of the three  SAS deputy chief executives, resigned his management role last week and said on Tuesday that he would quit the airline, after finally accepting full responsibility for entering into the illegal  agreement with Maersk.
But politicians have asked for a full inquiry into the affair.

SAS joined the other major global carriers in the doldrums as the global economic slowdown hit profits hard.

Second quarter pre-tax profits nose-dived to SKr180m in the three months to the end of June from SKr1.055bn in the same period last year on a 13 per cent rise in revenues to SKr13.8bn. Earnings per share fell to SKr0.78 from SKr4.75 last time.
The sharp decline in profits in the three months to the end of June left first half pre-tax profit at
SKr220m, compared with SKr765m last time.

The poor state of the air travel market in Scandinavia was underlined by  SAS' July traffic figures also released on Wednesday, showing the more profitable business traffic continuing its decline after a small rise in June.

The Stockholm-based carrier said traffic fell 1.6 per cent in business class last month, pulled down by weak demand on the North Atlantic and within Europe.

Overall traffic rose rose 5.8 per cent but that was still well below an 11.1 per cent rise in capacity. Load factor, the measure of occupancy across the fleet, fell by 3.6 percentage points to 72.2 per cent.

HD           Former SAS chief admits 'illegal  verbal agreement'  with Maersk: Building cartel

STOCKHOLM - The turmoil surrounding  SAS continued to weigh on the Scandinavian airline yesterday when the former deputy chief executive resigned from the company, and accepted responsibility for the building of a  cartel with Danish rival Maersk Air.

Last Friday, Vagn Sorensen stepped down from the company's management board but said he had not been an integral part of the illegal  agreement. However, yesterday he admitted to Jorgen Lindegaard, SAS's chief executive, that he had full responsibility for "entering into an illegal verbal agreement with Maersk Air concerning market division."

TD
The deal came to light after a European Commission probe into the  agreement between the two airlines. The Commission fined SAS US$34.6- million for secretly dividing up the market covering the Stockholm-Copenhagen route and internal Danish routes.

Mr. Sorensen was nicknamed "the comet" for his rapid rise in  SAS where he was seen as a future CEO. Yesterday, SAS said that it was only now that Mr. Sorensen had "been able to see the consequences of this agreement and the injury it has caused  SAS and colleagues."

However it remains to be seen whether the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, which among them own a majority stake in the airline, will be satisfied with a single scapegoat for the entire affair.

The SAS board is to meet this morning to discuss the situation and there is pressure for more wide-reaching measures, with question marks over the role of the previous chief executive, Jan Stenberg, and the board.
Last week, both  Maersk Air's chairman and chief executive resigned because of the scandal. Following the board meeting,  SAS is also due to present its second-quarter results, which are
expected to show a marked deterioration compared with last year, reflecting the downturn in business
travel.

COPENHAGEN -(Dow Jones)- Scandinavian Airlines System's (S.SAI) image has been tarnished by management's slow and clumsy handling of the secret deal with Maersk Air A/S, writes Berlingske Tidende. SAS and Maersk were fined recently by the European Commission for an anticompetitive agreement, which gave SAS monopoly over the Copenhagen to Stockholm route.
Public relations consultants said to the newspaper that  SAS' procrastination in dismissing a senior  SAS
manager in connection with the scandal is likely to remain in customers' minds.

* Belgium's Sabena Cancels More European Flights

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sabena said on Wednesday it had cancelled 44 flights after thousands of workers went on strike to protest against the Belgian airline's refusal to discuss a restructuring plan earlier than scheduled. Sabena cancelled the flights to European destinations as a preventive measure after workers in cleaning, maintenance, catering, and baggage control went on strike at 0600 GMT at Brussels international Zaventem airport, spokesman Olivier Gillis told Reuters.

The flights, which had been scheduled to depart before noon, included the initial eight cancelled flights that the airline had announced earlier in the day.
* Electrical System Probed in Colorado Plane Crash

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A plane that crashed this year killing two members of the Oklahoma State University men's basketball team and eight others may have experienced a serious electrical problem or even have lost power before slamming into a field in Colorado, documents showed on Tuesday. National Transportation Safety Board investigators noted cockpit instrument readings that could be consistent with electrical failure aboard the twin-engine Beechcraft King Air 200 that crashed in January about 20 miles (32 km) east of Denver.

The safety board documents made no finding of probable cause, which investigators said was not likely to be determined for several months. Investigators are focusing on several factors, including the plane's
Page 112 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
maintenance history, weather, crew performance, flight-control components and the possibility of an electrical problem.
* India Says May Delay Satellite Launch

BANGALORE, India (Reuters) - India's launch of its INSAT-3C communications satellite intended for September or October may be postponed in view of problems faced by launch firm Arianspace, a spokesman for the space agency said on Tuesday. The European satellite launch firm suffered a serious blow last month when its Ariane-5 rocket sent two satellites into a flawed orbit after a launch from French Guiana. Details of a probe on the malfunction will be made public next week.

"September is now not possible," the spokesman for state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), told Reuters. "They (Arianspace)) have to reschedule the whole thing and talk to their customers," he said. He said the talks had not taken place yet with ISRO, a regular customer.
* Sweden Mulls Asking  SAS to Compensate Passengers
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Industry Minister said on Wednesday he wanted Scandinavian airline
SAS to consider compensating passengers who had suffered from a price pact between the company
and Danish airline Maersk. "The  SAS board should try the issue of compensating customers for the
consequences of the cartel," Bjorn Rosengren was quoted as saying in Swedish daily Finanstidningen.
His office said he had been accurately quoted.

SAS, which is half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, has suffered several blows in the last month because of technical problems and price-fixing allegations, forcing its deputy chief executive, Vagn Sorensen, to resign. Last month the  European Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.50 million) for agreeing not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region with  Maersk, a subsidiary of oil and shipping group A.P. Moeller Group.
* Leucadia Signs Letter of Intent to Acquire  Fine Air

MIAMI (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Leucadia National Corp. signed a letter of intent to acquire  Fine Air Services Corp., a cargo airline holding company reorganizing in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, an attorney for  Fine Air told Reuters. "We have a letter of intent,"  Fine Air attorney Brian Gart said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

Copies of the Leucadia letter have been distributed to creditors of  Fine Air, which were expected to meet "very shortly" to discuss a possible sale of  Fine Air to Leucadia, Gart said. Leucadia is a publicly traded company based in New York City with diverse business interests, from insurance and banking to manufacturing, real estate and mining. The letter of intent to acquire  Fine Air was signed by a subsidiary called Leucadia International Corp., Gart said.
* Emirates Orders Two More Airbus A330-200s

PARIS (Reuters) - European plane maker Airbus said on Wednesday it had received a firm order from United Arab Emirates airline Emirates for two more A330-200 aircraft for delivery in July/August 2002. The new order brings the total number of firm orders for the wide-body A330-200 jets by Emirates, Airbus's biggest Middle East client, to 23, 18 of which are already in service, Airbus said in a statement.
The aircraft have a catalogue price of $125 million each, which would make the new order worth around
$250 million. Emirates, part of the Emirates air transport group owned by the Dubai government, also has
orders for six A340-500s, of which deliveries begin next year, and seven superjumbo A380s, including
two freighters, for delivery from 2006, Airbus said.
* China Airlines Expect Big Boeing Deal Soon

BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. plane maker Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had received no official word from China on approval of a huge order for more than 30 aircraft, but Chinese airlines said they expected the sale to go through soon. A visit by U.S. President George Bush to China in October amid improved bilateral ties had cleared the way for the deal, industry executives said.

Boeing China spokesman Tom McLean said the company could only confirm an order after the industry regulator - the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) - made an announcement. "The CAAC has not made a public announcement about any orders," he told Reuters.
* Boeing Sees Freighters Doubling in 20 Years

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's freighter airplane fleet will more than double over the next 20 years to 3,523 aircraft from 1,742, the Boeing Co said in its Current Market Outlook for 2001. Freighters as a
Page 113 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
share of the total airplane fleet will remain stable at 11 percent to 12 percent, Boeing said. Taking 1,238 retirements into account, 3,019 airplanes will be added to the freighter fleet by 2020.

Widebody freighters, now 37 percent of the fleet, will supply nearly two-thirds of these additions and will end the period making up 61 percent of the fleet, Boeing said. The shift toward widebody freighters will result in a fleet wide increase of 25 percent in average freighter airplane payload.
* Barcelona Airport Introduces Anti Fog System

MADRID (Reuters) - New equipment allowing Barcelona airport to operate more effectively in fog will go into service in October, Spanish airports authority AENA said. Installation of the system is now complete and it only remains for operators to be acquainted with new procedures, said an AENA statement. A new approach system, runway lighting and cameras will enable the airport to adapt to category II/III weather conditions.
* Dallas Airport Begins Planning $840 Mln Terminal

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport officials have begun the first phase of plans to build a sixth terminal for domestic travel costing $840 million, an official said Tuesday. The airport is in the planning stages of creating another terminal to centralize and increase space for all non-hub airlines.

It also wants to provide room for new carriers and existing hub airlines such as AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc., said Kevin Cox, senior executive vice president of the airport system. "We believe we need to move forward with this terminal in a fairly expeditious manner," Cox said.
* US Airlines Get Code-Share Access to Vietnam

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. federal government tentatively granted rights on Tuesday to three U.S. airlines to provide service to Vietnam through code-sharing arrangements with third-country airlines. It is the second high-profile development within a month that will draw major U.S. business interests closer to communist Vietnam a quarter century after the end of the Vietnam War.

The Transportation Department awarded U.S. rights to Delta Air Lines Inc., Northwest Airlines Corp. and United Airlines, pending the outcome of a brief comment period. The United States and Vietnam agreed in March 2000 to allow code-share services.

Code-sharing is a common industry practice in which one airline offers service in its own name to a destination, but some or all of the transportation is provided by another carrier.
* AFX Seeks Scheduled Service to Osaka and Tel Aviv

LONDON (Reuters) - British carrier Air Freight Express (AFX) Ltd has applied to operate scheduled services to Osaka and Tel Aviv, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said. The applications are for services from the three London airports as well as Manchester, Glasgow and Prestwick, the CAA added in its weekly bulletin. AFX launched a three times a week Boeing 747-200 freighter service from
London-Heathrow to Hong Kong in late July.
* HK's Dragonair to Boost Freighter Flights

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd (Dragonair) said on Wednesday it would boost its all-cargo services, adding two flights per week to Europe and the Middle East and one flight per week to Shanghai. Dragonair said in a statement that from September 8, following the delivery of its first purchased Boeing 747-300 freighter, it would increase the number of all-cargo flights from Hong Kong to Dubai, Manchester and Amsterdam to five per week from three.
The airline, 43.3 percent-owned by China-backed China National Aviation Co, will double its frequency to
Shanghai to two freighter flights per week.

ATTENTION - RECASTS, ADDS quarterly earnings, quotes, details

LP
STOCKHOLM, Aug 8 (AFP) - Scandinavian Airlines System's woes worsened Wednesday as the company posted a dramatic drop in profits in the second quarter amid growing criticism over the state-owned airline's role in two route-fixing scandals.

SAS attributed the 80-percent fall in pre-tax profit to 180 million kronor (19 million euros, 16.7 million dollars) to lower demand in passenger traffic. As a result, the company revised downwards its earnings forecast for the full-year.

TD
The airline said it had made a provision for the 39.4-million- euro (34.5-million-dollar)  fine levied by the
European Commission for route-fixing, which also weighed on first-half results.

The price of  SAS shares plunged on the bad news, and were down 6.11 percent in late afternoon trading in Stockholm to 84.5 kronor.

SAS, co-owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, and Danish carrier Maersk Air were fined by the European Commission on July 18 for cutting a secret deal to monopolize air routes in Scandinavia.

Maersk Air was fined 13 million euros by the Commission.
In an act of contrition,  SAS said Wednesday it would not appeal its  fine.

"The board of directors notes that SAS reached an accord which violated rules of competition and it is planning not to appeal the European Commission fine of 39.375 million euros," a statement from the airline said.

SAS admitted in a separate report published Wednesday that a number of company directors had been informed of the illicit deal, and said an internal investigation would be carried out in order to determine responsibility in the matter.

The SAS board of directors stressed in the report that it "did not know about the illegal agreements" until it was contacted by the  European Commission in February, at which point the board "decided to take measures."

The board also criticised former chief executive officer Jan Stenberg, who left his post in May, for "toning down the severity of the matter" to the board and said he had "failed to take sufficient measures."

Deputy chief executive Vagn Soerensen has admitted his responsibility in the matter and resigned from his post last week. He will leave the company.

The Swedish, Norwegian and Danish governments and  SAS's shareholders have repeatedly urged the company to shed light on the  cartel agreement and assign responsibility.



Page 117 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In an interview with the Swedish daily Finanstidningen on Wednesday, Swedish Trade and Industry Minister Bjoern Rosengren said  SAS ought to compensate passengers who paid higher prices for their airline tickets as a result of the deal with  Maersk Air.
"The SAS board has to consider the question of compensating its customers for the consequences of the
cartel. The company has, after all, cheated its customers," Rosengren was quoted as saying.

Rosengren has ordered the Swedish Air Traffic Authority to conduct an investigation into competition within the Swedish airline sector.

"There is no competition in the airline sector in Sweden," he told Swedish news agency TT, describing the situation as "catastrophic."

"The centre-right coalition government (in power 1991-1994) deregulated the sector but ... it has not led to greater competition," he said.
The minister has however expressed his support for the  SAS board.
Meanwhile, SAS is also under investigation for another price- fixing  cartel, this time in Sweden.

The Swedish Competition Authority announced August 1 that it was investigating whether  SAS and Swedish carrier Skyways, of which  SAS owns 25 percent, secretly agreed on price-fixing on Swedish domestic routes.

SAS, which is half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, has suffered several blows in the last month because of technical problems and price-fixing allegations, forcing its deputy chief executive, Vagn Sorensen, to resign.

Last month the European Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($34.50 million) for agreeing not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region with Maersk, a subsidiary of oil and shipping group A.P. Moeller Group .

Maersk said last week it would not appeal against the ruling and a  fine of 13.1 million euros.  SAS has said it will announce whether it will appeal against the  fine when it presents its half-year results later
on Wednesday.

Rosengren also said the government intended to investigate the price  cartel thoroughly and that more heads may roll.

"Should it be revealed that the board knew anything about this or has been involved in any other way it could be appropriate to change the  SAS board," he said.

Sweden holds 21 percent in the company and Rosengren said he would consult with the governments of Denmark and Norway on how to proceed with the matter.

Swedish competition watchdog Konkurrensverket said last week it had started an investigation into allegations that  SAS had collaborated with its Swedish partner Skyways to fix prices and divide up Swedish domestic traffic.

SAS, like its peers, is struggling with dwindling business class travel demand as a slowdown in the world economy has companies scrambling to save money.

The turmoil surrounding  SAS continued to weigh on the Scandinavian airline yesterday when the former deputy chief executive resigned from the company, and accepted responsibility for the building of a cartel with Danish rival  Maersk Air.

Last Friday, Vagn Sorensen stepped down from the company's management board but said he had not been an integral part of the illegal  agreement. However, yesterday he admitted to Jorgen Lindegaard, SAS's chief executive, that he had full responsibility for "entering into an illegal verbal  agreement with Maersk Air concerning market division".

TD
The deal came to light after a European Commission probe into the  agreement between the two airlines. The Commission fined SAS Euros 39.4m ( $34.6m) for secretly dividing up the market covering the Stockholm-Copenhagen route and internal Danish routes.

Mr Sorensen was nicknamed "the comet" for his rapid rise in  SAS where he was seen as a future CEO. Yesterday SAS said that it was only now that Mr Sorensen had "been able to see the consequences of this agreement and the injury it has caused  SAS and colleagues".

However it remains to be seen whether the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, who between them own a majority stake in the airline, will be satisfied with a single scapegoat for the entire affair.
The SAS board is to meet this morning to discuss the situation and there is pressure for more
wide-reaching measures, with question marks over the role of the previous chief executive Jan Stenberg
and the board.
Last week both  Maersk Air's chairman and chief executive resigned because of the scandal.

Following the board meeting,  SAS is also due to present its second-quarter results which are expected to show a marked deterioration compared with last year, reflecting the downturn in business travel.

HD         Sorry SAS refuses cartel compensation. BY          By NICHOLAS GEORGE IN STOCKHOLM.

SAS, the Scandinavian airline, on Wednesday made a public apology to its customers, staff and owners for involvement in an illegal  cartel with Danish rival Maersk Air but refused to bow to demands to compensate travellers affected by the secret deal.

The statements came on a day when the Nordic region's largest airline announced a sharp fall in second-quarter profit and warned it would not meet its earlier forecast of improved profit in 2001.

TD
Following what Jorgen Lindegaard, chief executive, described as a "terrible quarter", the company is now expecting a result in line with last year's pre-tax profit before capital gains of SKr1.2bn ($115m).

SAS shares fell 6 per cent to SKr84.50 in late trade in Stockholm.
In the three months to June, pre-tax profit fell more than 80 per cent to SKr180m compared with
SKr1.06bn a year earlier.
Sales rose to 12.5 per cent to SKr13.8bn. The figures include a SKr359m charge for the EU  fine. Harald Norvik, SAS chairman, said the company would not appeal against the E39.4m ($34.6m)  fine
imposed by the European Commission in July after the EU uncovered the illegal  agreement between
the two airlines.
Under the terms of the secret  agreement, Maersk and SAS divided routes between them, notably
Stockholm-Copenhagen but also internal Danish routes.

On Tuesday, Vagn Sorensen,  SAS deputy chief executive, resigned from the company, accepting responsibility for the deal.

Mr Norvik said the board had not been aware of the illegal  agreement until February this year and therefore had no reason to resign. An independent investigation would be set up to look at the board's role, he said.

Mr Lindegaard, who took up his position in May said the company was "apologising to our shareholders because we now have to spend their money on a stupid thing and we are apologising to our customers because we have lost their confidence".

However, he rejected the idea that passengers had to pay higher fares because of the  agreement which led to Maersk Air pulling out of the Stockholm-Copenhagen route. Fares were unrealistically low on the route at the time because of the price war, Mr Lindegaard said.

SAS is majority owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, and senior politicians in
Scandinavia have called for the company to compensate passengers.

Vagn Sorensen, the former deputy chief executive of the Scandinavian airline  SAS, will receive a SKr 7m golden parachute package giving him three times his average salary.
Sorensen was forced to step down in the aftermath of the SAS cartel scandal. SAS had a secret
no-competition pact with its Danish rival  Maersk Air which the European Commission deemed unlawful.
Both airlines were  fined.

OIL & GAS *International Energy Agency Says OECD Oil Demand Dips, Will Rebound in Fourth Quarter

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil demand in the industrialized world fell from May to July versus 2000 as industrial production contracted, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. In its monthly oil market, the
Paris-based energy watchdog said it still expected a strong rebound in global demand growth in the fourth quarter, leading to an annual growth forecast of 510,000 barrels a day, 50,000 barrels a day higher than last month's estimate.

The IEA expects global oil demand to jump 0.7%, or 500,000 barrels a day, in the fourth quarter this year versus 2000. This rebound is expected to continue through to 2002, when its demand growth estimate was 790,000 barrels a day, just 10,000 barrels a day higher than last month's forecast.

Having contracted 0.5% in May, oil demand in the industrialized world was estimated to have fallen even faster in June and July, according to preliminary data. "Early reports suggest that oil demand fell in June by 3.8% and 2.0% in the largest two OECD markets, the U.S. and Japan," the report said.
*International Energy Agency Wakes Up to Greater Reliance on OPEC Oil



Page 124 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LONDON (Reuters) - An upwards revision to world oil demand means the West will need more oil from the OPEC  cartel this year and next than previously thought, the industrialized world's energy watchdog said on Friday.

In its monthly oil market report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that the "call on OPEC oil" would be 400,000 barrels a day greater this year than it previously forecast, at 27 million barrels a day. Next year the call on OPEC oil will be 300,000 barrels a day more than earlier estimates, although the absolute level is expected to sink to 26.8 million barrels a day in 2002 because of more production expected outside the  cartel.

The big revision paints a more bullish picture for global oil markets, particularly after OPEC's recent decision to slash output by one million barrels a day from September 1.
*Chevron Blames Merger Statement on Clerical Error

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. on Thursday said it had handed antitrust regulators a plan to sell Texaco Inc.'s U.S. refining business and some other assets as it seeks approval to acquire Texaco, but then withdrew the statement and blamed it on a clerical error. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, San Francisco-based Chevron said it had "executed a consent  agreement" to sell the Texaco businesses and handed it to the staff of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Chevron pulled the document 53 minutes later, issuing a new version that did not include any reference to the agreement.

In a statement, the San Francisco oil company said it "erroneously reported in filing ... with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that Chevron and Texaco had signed an  agreement for U.S Federal Trade Commission approval connected with the pending merger with Texaco." The oil company went on to say it, "regrets any confusion caused by the earlier incorrect statement."

Still, industry analysts and anti-trust lawyers said the inadvertent filing signaled that Chevron was on the brink of reaching an  agreement with regulators allowing it to complete the takeover of Texaco, creating the world's fifth-largest oil company. Expectations are that FTC approval could come within two or three weeks, setting the stage for the deal to be completed by October, a year after it was first announced.
*Saddam Denounces Saudi, Kuwaiti Oil Policies

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - President Saddam Hussein denounced on Thursday the oil policies of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, claiming they aimed to steal Iraq's share of the market and harm the country's interests. Saddam, who has been raising the ante of defiant rhetoric against the West, gave the same reason for invading Kuwait in August 1990, when he accused its ruling family of being behind a fall in prices that hurt the Iraqi economy.

"A while ago they (the United States) invented what is called smart sanctions. What was the Kuwaiti response? They announced a hike in oil production and there have been similar statements from Saudi Arabia," Saddam told a group of top army officers. "They announced their decision to compensate for Iraqi oil. Doesn't this constitute aggression? It represents the rape of an inalienable right of Baghdad," Saddam said in remarks carried on state television. The Iraqi president appeared to be referring to Saudi
and Kuwaiti statements in June expressing readiness to cover a supply gap arising from Iraq's decision to halt oil exports
*Russia Sees More Talks as Iran Differs on Caspian

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A top Russian diplomat was quoted on Friday as saying differences with Iran over the division of the oil-rich Caspian Sea remained, but that more talks would be held to thrash out a solution. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Ahani was in Moscow for discussions this week against a background of flaring tempers in the region over how to divide the Caspian and its oil wealth.

Itar-Tass news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and Caspian envoy, Viktor Kalyuzhny, as saying there were signs all sides were moving closer on how to carve up the sea. But he added that Iran's demand for an equal 20% split of the sea with the four other littoral states of Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan remained problematic.
"This is different from the position of Moscow, Astana and Baku," Kalyuzhny said of Iran's stance. He said
Turkmenistan was also coming round to the idea of splitting the sea in a different way, one that would
give Iran less than 20%. Kalyuzhny, who met Ahani on Wednesday, said the Iranian had shown he was
aware of the importance of regular dialogue. Kalyuzhny also confirmed a summit between all five Caspian
states would take place in the port of Turkmenbashi in Turmenistan sometime in the autumn.
*Japan Report Urges Privatizing of Crude Stockpile

Page 125 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
TOKYO (Reuters) - A government report on Friday recommended that management of Japan's crude oil stockpile be moved to the private sector, although it said the state should still determine policy. The recommendation was contained in a report scrutinizing Japan's 77 semi-government agencies, which critics denigrate as money pits for taxpayers, cushy nests for retired bureaucrats and instruments of
pork-barrel politics.

The report urges that Japan's crude stockpiling come under the direct jurisdiction of the government, a Trade Ministry official said. "The report says the private sector should manage the stockpile under the direction of government-drafted policy," she said. While it would be up to the government to decide whether to increase the stockpile, steps to do so would be taken by the private sector, she said.
*Mexico's Pemex Mulls Using Coffee for Oil Spills

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is experimenting with pulverized coffee as a means of soaking up oil spills on land, Mexico's top coffee official told Reuters in an interview. "They have learned that pulverized coffee absorbs oil spills on land in a very effective way," Mexican Coffee Council President Roberto Giesemann said late on Wednesday.

The news comes as Mexico moves to implement a plan to withdraw 5% of its lowest-quality coffees from export coffers, pulverize it, and put it to other uses, most likely as fertilizer, alternative fuel or as an animal feed supplement. The destruction plan, as it is known, has been adopted by Mexico, Colombia and
Central American coffee producers and is set to be implemented when the 2001/02 coffee season begins on Oct. 1.

*U.S. Government Offices Shut Off Lights Amid Heat Wave

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal government on Thursday urged workers throughout the eastern United States to turn off unneeded lights and office equipment to conserve electricity as a heat wave scorches the region. A record temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.33 Celsius) was set in New York City and Newark, New Jersey, while triple-digit readings were logged in many other cities from Maine to Virginia.

Power grid operators in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic states expected heavy air conditioning use to push electricity demand to a record peak for the third day in a row.

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the government was monitoring power demand and supplies of utilities. "We will continue to look for ways to reduce demand on the transmission grid and encourage businesses and individuals to do the same," Abraham said in a statement. The federal government, the largest consumer of energy in the nation, took similar steps to conserve power on the West Coast several months ago.
*Third of U.K.'s Gas Customers Switch Supplier

LONDON (Reuters) - Following liberalization, a third of Britain's gas customers have switched from the old British Gas  monopoly to new suppliers in order to cut bills, energy regulator Ofgem said on Friday. The watchdog said that as of June 2001, 6.34 million customers had changed supplier from Centrica, the retail arm of BG, equivalent to 32% of the U.K. total and representing an average 109,000 switches a week. However, fewer households have changed electricity supplier. As of June 2001, 27.4% of the U.K. total had switched, equivalent to 230,000 a month.
*Swedish Prime Minister Says Will Never Privatize Vattenfall

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden will never privatize national power utility Vattenfall, Prime Minister Goran Persson was quoted as saying on Friday. "We will never sell out Vattenfall," Goran Persson told Swedish daily Finanstidningen in an interview. He also predicted the issue would become one of the big questions ahead of national elections next year.

Persson's comments follow controversy involving Scandinavian airline  SAS and its Danish competitor Maersk which prompted Sweden's Industry Minister Bjorn Rosengren to express concerns about future privatization plans of state-owned companies in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. The  European    Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros for agreeing not to compete on key routes in the Nordic
region with Maersk - a subsidiary of Danish oil and shipping group A.P. Moeller. Sweden's competition watchdog has also said it is investigating possible price links between  SAS and Swedish airline Skyways in which SAS has a 25% investment.

In the interview, Rosengren said the price pact between the airlines proved that Nordic airline deregulation had failed. He also expressed reservations about how successful the opening up of the region's electricity markets had been and that the government may slow down its privatization plans.

*U.S. Environmental Agency Panel to Review New Diesel Sulfur Rules

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration will convene a panel of automakers, oil refiners, environmental groups and other experts to reexamine Clean Air Act standards that limit sulfur content in diesel fuel, the Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday.

Green groups criticized the move as a step to weaken environmental protection and public health at a time when the EPA is taking a second look at several other anti-pollution regulations deemed costly and excessive by industry.

The EPA said the planned review of diesel sulfur would not alter the pollution limit of the rule, but would instead tweak the current implementation schedule that requires a 20-fold sulfur reduction by 2006. "As far as I know we are not delaying (and) 2006 is the deadline" for reducing sulfur levels in diesel fuel, an EPA spokeswoman said Thursday.

HD       Feathers fly after EC fines AP Moller. BY        By Geoff Garfield London.

Shipping giant AP Moller is thought to have pulled off a clever damage limitation coup after being  fined
EUR 13.125m ($11.7m) by the  European Commission (EC).

The penalty was against  Maersk Air A/S for breaching European Union competition rules and trying to conceal its actions.

TD
Within days Moller announced a top-level management shake-up including the transfer of  Maersk Air's chairman Bjarne Hans en. He took over the AP Moller-Maersk Group's operation in Singapore, which covers extensive shipping interests in Asia.

Observers say it is very much a "sideways" move for Hansen, but it portrays Moller as holding someone responsible.
Hansen quit after  Maersk Air was found to have colluded with Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS).
SAS is reportedly considering an appeal.

"Is it only one person in each of these companies that knew about it," asked one source sceptically about Hansen's resignation and move to Singapore.

In a statement AP Moller describes the matter as "an unfortunate and an isolated incident". It also said: "AP Moller is not always in  agreement with the commission's interpretation of the EU rules, but a deliberate infringement is not acceptable and is deeply regretted." Hansen also resigned as a shipowner in Moller, one of only six such partners. Fleming Ipsen will move from heading up Singapore to replace Ole Dietz who quit as managing director of  Maersk Air. No one else at the airline will be affected.

Troels Dilling, chairman of  Maersk Air from 1990 to 1996, will resume as chairman following Hansen's departure.

Outsiders say the changes are typically Moller-style because they do not differentiate at management level between companies. They claim that managers are expected to move between them whether or not they have detailed day-to-day knowledge.

One Dutch shipping source said: "They are very clever in what they are doing. Its counterpart  SAS has done nothing and it gets a very negative PR.

Maersk and AP Moller are now standing there as the good guys, even though they broke the law." Although Hansen's Singapore responsibilities will be wide-ranging, Moller also has major offices with senior managers in mainland China and Hong Kong. The company has several ships under the Singapore flag.

HD           SAS cartel sparks fury among private shareholders. BY          By Eva Sohlman

LP
STOCKHOLM, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Angry private shareholders and customers of Scandinavian airline SAS raised the heat on the company's board on Friday to deliver a full and speedy investigation into a cartel scandal.

"This is not acceptable. I demand a fast investigation into the affair," Jacob Wallenberg, spokesman for the Wallenberg foundations, told Reuters. The foundations hold eight percent of  SAS, the biggest
non-government shareholding.

TD
Nordic governments and media also lambasted the airline after the European Commission fined SAS
39.4 million euro ($35.2 million) for agreeing not to compete on key routes with its Danish peer Maersk,
a unit of A.P. Moeller .

A SAS deputy chief executive and two top managers at  Maersk, have resigned over the affair, but media have called for more heads to roll, arguing that other board members must have been involved.

SAS had said on Wednesday it would order an independent investigation into the  Maersk cartel
starting next week.

Wallenberg had the same response to the announced investigation as Bjorn Rosengren, Sweden's Industry Minister, who told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he had had no choice but to assert confidence in the board until the probe result was published.

"I must trust them for now and wish to see the outcome of the investigation as soon as possible," Wallenberg said, adding he was appalled by the EU ruling. "This just must not happen."
PROFITS DROP TOO

SAS also abandoned its rosy outlook for the full year on Wednesday, when it posted an 84 percent fall in pre-tax profits for the second quarter and apologised to customers who had suffered from the  cartel.

Its shares fell more than six percent on the day of the results and extended the decline to as low as 79 crowns, a year low, on Thursday. The share was unchanged at 82 crowns at midsession on Friday.

SAS is half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Sweden holds 21 percent and its Nordic neighbours have said they will also await the outcome of the investigation into the  cartel before they would consider asking the board to resign.

Meanwhile, the Swedish competition watchdog, which launched a new probe into price-fixing allegations between  SAS and its Swedish partner Skyways last week, said on Friday it may  fine the companies for anti-competitive behaviour should it find them guilty.
The agency has said it plans to announce a ruling in the autumn.  SAS and Skyways together control
90 percent of the Swedish market.
SHAREHOLDERS PROTEST, INVESTORS SELL

Smaller shareholders, concerned that the probe would not be thorough enough, have contacted campaigner Folke Hojmar, who has defended minority interests in big companies, such as
part-privatised telecoms firm Telia and broadcaster TV4 .

"The credibility of the board and top management is reflected in the share. The latest incidents have provoked the share fall and there's a risk it may fall even more," Hojmar was quoted as saying in daily newspaper Finanstidningen.
Swedish investment group Etix said on Friday it had sold its small stake in  SAS because of the  cartel
scandal.

"We sold all our  SAS shares today because we've lost our confidence in the board over this affair," Henrik Bonde, fund manager at Etix, told Reuters.

Sweden's largest workers' union LO, which owns 1.3 million shares in  SAS, also expressed doubts, saying its was unusual that the board should have been unaware of the price pact.

"The board has the ultimate responsibility. They should have been aware of such an important issue," LO Financial Manager Kurt Norberg was quoted as saying in daily Expressen.

The chief executive of Sweden's Federation of Private Enterprise criticised  SAS's decision not to compensate overcharged customers, despite its public apology.

"We think it is sad that they won't pay back anything as they said they were sorry and have admitted that they did something wrong," Ake Fagelberg told Reuters.

ATTENTION - RECASTS

LP
COPENHAGEN, Aug 13 (AFP) - Scandinavian airline  SAS faced a growing crisis Monday after it said a price-fixing violation had damaged its image and that British Airways was considering attacking its dominant position in the Nordic countries.

The president of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Joergen Lindegaard, said in its company newspaper Inside that it would not be easy "to re-establish the image" of the company after it was  fined by the European Commission for a price-fixing scheme with rival  Maersk Air.

TD
Lindegaard was also quoted in financial newspaper Boersen as saying he was ready to compete with
British Airways (BA).

Boersen had also reported Monday that BA was thinking of penetrating the Scandinavian market, dominated until now by  SAS.

BA is considering offering at least 10 flights per day between Oslo and Copenhagen, and as many between Stockholm and Copenhagen, as well as Oslo and Stockholm, the report said.

It quoted the BA director in Denmark, Same Heine, as saying that the cost of penetrating the market would be high and that an offensive would not make a profit for two years.
"But if we decide to go in, we will do so with determination."
"We are quite happy to have competition," Lindegaard said in response.

"It will then be clear to everyone that with current prices, flying to the three capitals is not so lucrative as people think."
But, acknowledging that  SAS had to have a strong base in Scandinavia, he said: "If the  SAS monopoly in
Scandinavia is attacked, there is a risk of reducing  SAS by degrees, and of affecting its profitability."

With SAS facing a slump in the airline industry, a damaged image and increased competition, Lindegaard rallied employees in the company newspaper by calling them "to unite their efforts and go forward in order to restore trust in the company, which has been seriously shaken."

He also said: "We must secure our expansion. The market expects a vision and I see, as for as I am concerned, a growing  SAS in the next 10 years," with 35 million passengers compared with 23 million now.

He said that 30 billion Swedish kronor (3.26 billion euros, 2.93 billion dollars) was to be invested in the next 10 years to make Copenhagen airport the company's hub and to buy new aircraft.

However, although the company seeks new aircraft, he said that  SAS has made no firm orders in case the renewal programme has to be revised.

STOCKHOLM, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Sweden is preparing a new law to allow customers who have suffered from cartels to sue companies collectively, which could lead to a flurry of lawsuits against embattled airline  SAS.
"This proposal allows customers to sue companies retroactively as a group," Justice Ministry
Spokesman Bjorn Andersson told Reuters.

TD
"If this proposal is accepted by parliament then  SAS customers could sue the airline retroactively," he said.

Last month, the  European Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($35.30 million) for agreeing not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region with Danish airline  Maersk, a subsidiary of A.P. Moeller Group.

SAS is also being investigated by the Swedish competition watchdog over separate price fixing allegations in Sweden.

The new law, which would come into force in July 2002, would make it easier for individuals to sue cartel companies because by grouping together they will be able to reduce legal fees and bureaucracy.

(recasts, adds Ericsson considers action paragraphs 6-7, updates share)

STOCKHOLM, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Sweden is preparing a new law to allow customers who have suffered from cartels to sue companies collectively, which could lead to a flurry of lawsuits against embattled airline  SAS .

TD
The proposal would help cut legal costs for groups of customers filing lawsuits and allows them to bring legal action retroactively, a Justice Ministry spokesman said.

SAS shares have lost 23 percent since July 18, when the European Commissionfined SAS 39.4 million euros ($35.30 million) for agreeing not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region with Danish airline Maersk, a subsidiary of A.P. Moeller Group .

SAS is also being investigated by the Swedish competition watchdog over price-fixing allegations with its Swedish partner Skyways.  SAS owns 25 percent of Skyways and the airlines jointly hold 90 percent of the Swedish market. The watchdog has said it would  fine SAS should it find that the companies formed a price pact.

"This shouldn't affect the share price in the short term but if we see a big group of customers suing then it may have a negative effect on the stock," an analyst said, declining to be identified.

Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson , Sweden's largest company and a major  SAS customer, said it did not rule out a court case but that it would prefer to settle any case outside the court.

"We are looking at how much money this involves to assess if we should make any demands on  SAS," Ericsson Spokeswoman Ase Lindskog told Reuters.

The share was trading at 81.50 Swedish crowns at 1655 GMT, off 0.5 crowns from Monday's closing price, compared with a year-low of 79.0 crowns on August 9.
The new law, which would come into force in July 2002, would make it easier for individuals to sue
cartel companies because by grouping together they will be able to reduce legal fees and bureaucracy.
"This law is created to improve the conditions for customers who may be right in practice but refrain
from suing because of the high legal costs they risk," Sweden's Justice Minister, Thomas Bodstrom, told
Reuters in an interview.

Last week SAS apologised to customers but said it would not compensate those who had suffered from the cartel.

SAS Deputy Chief Executive Vagn Sorensen took full responsibility and resigned, but pressure has increased for more heads to roll. The board has said it will launch an independent investigation into the affair this week.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2001--At a Board meeting on August 8, 2001, the Board of Directors of SAS decided to assign an independent external commission to review the Board's role in the SAS/Maersk affair.

Today, August 15, 2001, the  SAS Board of Directors decided that this review will be conducted by the following three persons, in accordance with the enclosed assignment description/commissorium:

TD
-- Jorgen B. Elmer (Denmark), lawyer, born 1943.
-- Gudmund Knudsen (Norway), lawyer, born 1946.
-- Johan Munck (Sweden), Justice of the Supreme Court, born 1943.

These appointments have been made after nominations from the five major shareholders which jointly control 60 percent of the total number of shares and votes in  SAS AB (the three government owners, the Wallenberg Foundations and Odin Fund Management). These shareholders have also presented the contents of the assignment description/Commissorium.

In a joint press release on August 13, 2001, the stock exchanges in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm stated that they have no objections to the approach described above.

The assignment must be conducted urgently and should be completed, at the latest, 2-3 weeks after the review commission has convened. The review report will be made public.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF  SAS
Attachment: Mandate
1. Scandinavian Airlines System Denmark-Norway-Sweden (hereinafter called SAS) is a consortium consisting of  SAS Danmark A/S, Denmark,  SAS Norge ASA, Norway, and SAS Sverige AB (publ), Sweden, the objects of which are to carry out commercial air traffic and any other business connected therewith.

The consortium  agreement between the parties was amended most recently on 8 May 2001 and before that on 29 May 1997.

Until the summer of 2001 each of  SAS Danmark A/S,  SAS Norge ASA and  SAS Sverige AB (publ) was an independent company, listed in its home country on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Stockholm Stock Exchange, respectively. A conversion of shares has taken place in the summer of 2001 with the effect that more than 90% of the shares of the three companies are now owned
by SAS AB, Sweden, the shares of which are listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Stockholm Stock Exchange from where the shares of the three consortium partners have been delisted or are in the process of delisting.

The management structure of  SAS is outlined in detail in the consortium  agreement and, based on the consortium agreement of 29 May 1997, consisted of an assembly of representatives, a board of directors
Page 137 of 148 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and a managing director. The scope of the rights and obligations of these bodies is outlined in the consortium agreement.

2. On 18 July 2001 the European Commission published its decision to impose a  fine on SAS in the amount of EURO 39,375,000 and on Maersk Air A/S in the amount of EURO 13,125,000 for having established a secret market sharing agreement.

Having considered the decision of the European Commission and the grounds thereof, the board of directors of SAS has resolved to accept the fine. The matter has also brought about certain restructurings within the SAS organisation.

In light of the course of events the board of directors has resolved to request outside, independent investigators to assess the role of the board of directors in relation to the co-operation with  Maersk Air held illegal by the Commission along the following guidelines:

a. Scrutiny of whether the  SAS board of directors and the members at any time sitting on the board of directors in the period from January 1998 and until August 2001 within the scope of such rights and obligations of the board of directors as may be assumed to apply to a company such as  SAS have fulfilled their obligations, or whether grounds exist for individual or collective criticism and in such event the severity of such criticism.
Particular emphasis should be given to:
-- whether the board of directors and its individual members received timely, relevant and sufficient information on the elements of the  SAS/Maersk co-operation agreement;
-- whether the board of directors and its individual members individually based on the information received in a relevant
manner sought to gain knowledge of the detailed content of the

SAS/Maersk co-operation agreement; and
-- whether the board of directors and its individual members acted appropriately in relation to the information the particular individual(s) had or ought to have obtained concerning the SAS/Maersk co-operation.
b. The investigation board will be given unrestricted access to all documents either originals or copies, including minutes of board meetings, memoranda, letters, etc., which the investigation board requests disclosed, and access to request information from existing or former employees and board members of SAS as the board of directors hereby relieves such persons from their duty of secrecy towards the investigation board and directs them to disclose any information requested by the investigation board.
c. The investigation board shall at its own discretion and as it finds appropriate arrange its reply hereto.
The investigation board shall be organised as it finds appropriate. If not agreed otherwise, the first meeting
of the investigation board shall be convened by the eldest of the investigators.

d. The investigation board shall submit a written report of its findings to the board of directors of  SAS. The report will be published.

e. It is submitted that the scrutiny be completed speedily and that the report be concluded at the latest 2-3 weeks after the investigation board has commenced its scrutiny.

STOCKHOLM, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline  SAS stood firm on Wednesday against rising pressure to compensate customers who had suffered from a  cartel, saying it would soon present an independent probe into the affair.
"(Compensation) is not on the agenda for now but we are following the debate about whether  SAS
should repay customers closely,"  SAS spokesman Bertil Ternert told Reuters.

TD
Media, clients, politicians and some investors have demanded that SAS compensate customers who were overcharged due to an  agreement with Danish airline Maersk not to compete on key Nordic routes.

A proposed new law which would allow customers to sue cartels collectively has put extra pressure on the airline as it could lead to a flurry of lawsuits.

Ternert denied a report in a Swedish newspaper on Wednesday that  SAS was considering compensation. He added that to calculate the sums involved would be very complex.

Last month the  European Commission fined SAS 39.4 million euros ($35.69 million). Its deputy chief executive took full responsibility for the affair and resigned last week.

SAS apologised to customers but said it would not compensate them. It said it would order an independent investigation into the  cartel, as demands rose for more heads to roll.

Ternert said he expected the company to announce who would lead the probe later on Wednesday. SAS - half owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark - has already appointed two of three investigators and is still looking to recruit a third, from Denmark.

HD    Authorities probe SAS's withdrawal from Kristiansand-Copenhagen route in 1994. WC   134 words

The competition authorities of Denmark and Norway are looking into the circumstances surrounding the Scandinavian airline  SAS's withdrawal from the Kristiansand-Copenhagen route in 1994. SAS ceased operating services on 26 March; on the following day, the route was taken over by Denmark's Maersk Air.

The European Commission recently fined both SAS and Maersk Air for entering into an unlawful no-competition pact on key Nordic routes. That agreement, however, dated from October 1998.

TD
Both SAS and Maersk Air have denied that they collaborated in any way over the transfer of the Kristiansand-Copenhagen route.  SAS spokeswoman Siv Meisingseth said  SAS had shut down the route without being aware that another operator would be taking over.

STOCKHOLM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline  SAS invited shareholders on Thursday to an extraordinary meeting to present the outcome of an independent investigation into a price-fixing scandal involving the airline.

SAS announced on Wednesday that it had appointed a panel of two lawyers from Denmark and
Norway and a Swedish supreme court judge to investigate the role of  SAS's board in the scandal.

SAS has been under fire in the last weeks after the European Commissionfined the company 39.4 million euros ($35.88 million) for agreeing with its Danish competitor Maersk not to compete on key routes in the Nordic region.

SAS spokesman Johan Eriksson told Reuters that the company had not yet fixed a date or place for the meeting.

TALLINN, Aug 17, BNS - The Estonian Competition Board will start surveying the country's aviation market this fall to find out how grounded are the prices set by operators.

The head of the competition watchdog, Peeter Tammistu, told BNS on Friday the scheduled checks would target the entire market, not particular companies.

TD
"The airline market is rather complex and intriguing. We have been keeping an eye on it to a certain extent, but due to other works we haven't come to a closer scrutiny yet," Tammistu said.

He observed that one of the characteristic features of the market here was the lack of competition on several lines.

The Competition Board is going to find out how justified are the prices established by companies that operate the  monopoly routes.

The European Commission in July fined Scandinavia's  SAS and the Danish carrier  Maersk Air, majority owner of Estonian Air, for a cartel deal on the Copenhagen-Stockholm line.
Estonian Air is engaged in similar cooperation with  SAS in operations departing from Tallinn.
