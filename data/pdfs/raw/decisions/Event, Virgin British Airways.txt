BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected on Wednesday to  fine          British Airways  for a system of commissions paid to travel agents which Virgin Atlantic Airways complained unfairly restricted its own sales, a Commission spokesman said on Tuesday.

British Airways  stopped its system of fidelity  rebates - which rewarded travel agents for increasing monthly sales of BA products - in January.

TD
But the Commission, the EU's executive, is planning to  fine BA for earlier use of the scheme and as a warning to other companies operating similar systems, the official said.

He said rebates of this type cannot be allowed when a company enjoys a dominant position, unless they are based on quality of service, a view which has been upheld by the European Court of Justice in the past.

"The relevance of this is that it's the first time the Commission will rule on fidelity  rebates in the services field," the spokesman said. "We're expecting to levy a  fine, as long as the whole Commission agrees."
Virgin first complained to the Commission in 1997. (C) Reuters Limited 1999.

HD       BA FINED Pounds 4m FOR 'DIRTY TRICKS' PAYOUTS BY       ROSS DAVIES; JAMES MCLEAN

RICHARD BRANSON today won the latest round in his battle with British Airways  as the European     Commission fined BA Pounds 4.42 million for giving travel agents rebates to sell its tickets instead of Virgin Atlantic's.

The decision follows a complaint by Branson about "fidelity  rebates" which BA stopped in January. These rebates, the Commission said today, "make travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines". It added: "This has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the UK markets for air transport."

TD
Virgin first complained about "fidelity schemes" in 1997. Initial reactions to today's  fines are that BA got off lightly, because Virgin and BA had thought BA could be penalised by up to Pounds 25 million.

BA was found guilty under EU  competition law, which makes fidelity programmes unlawful if they serve to boost the prospects of a company that already dominates a market. BA recently cut its top
commission rate to 7 per cent from 9.5 per cent. At the same time, it introduced a "performance reward scheme", encouraging agents to increase BA's market share at competitors' expense.

The airline discontinued the added bonus scheme under pressure from Brussels, although claiming that it was doing no more than other major carriers in Europe.
Richard Branson said today: "This is fantastic news, a complete vindication of Virgin's complaint that BA
has been abusing its dominant position.

"This ruling signs the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and will lead to lower fares as Virgin is given the chance to compete with BA on a route by route basis.

"The travel trade will now be free to give truly independent, impartial advice to travellers and offer them the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressure of BA's anti-competitive targets."
Mr Branson is pursuing a similar case in America, where, if he is successful, BA could be forced to pay
Virgin hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.
This is the latest episode in a saga which has run for most of the decade.
BA, which is expected to appeal, has argued that it is being targeted  unfairly.

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Reuters) -  European Commission anti-trust officials raided Belgium's Interbrew on Wednesday on suspicion the privately-owned brewer, one of the world's five largest, was abusing its dominant position in the domestic market, Belga news agency reported.

Belga cited a Commission spokesman as saying the raids were conducted because of suspicions Interbrew was using its strong position to close off the Belgian beer market to  competition by offering discounts to loyal customers and selling below market prices.

TD
Clients were allegedly also forced to buy certain products.

Belga cited an Interbrew spokesman as saying the company did not know the reasons for the raid, which the inspectors used to collect documents, but would cooperate fully.
No-one at Interbrew was immediately available to comment.
A Commission spokesman could also not immediately be reached to confirm the information.

Under EU competition rules, companies can be  fined up to 10 percent of their turnover if found guilty of anti-competitive market practices.

Outgoing EU  antitrust commissioner Karel Van Miert, himself a Belgian, has been using his last days in office to tackle a number of suspected anti-competitive business practices.

The Commission announced earlier on Wednesday that it had  fined British Airways  6.8 million euros for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the U.K. travel market by offering travel agents incentives to sell BA tickets.
BA said it would appeal the decision.
EU investigations into suspected anti-competitive practices take months to conclude, meaning Van
Miert, due to step down in September, is unlikely to oversee the end of any Interbrew probe.

Van Miert is due to be replaced by fellow commissioner Mario Monti, an Italian who is currently in charge of the EU's financial services and tax policies. ((Brussels newsroom, tel +322 287 6830, fax

LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Shares in British Airways  Plc dipped 2.3 percent ahead of a decision - expected imminently - from the European Commission on fining the company for a system of commissions paid to travel agents which Virgin complained  unfairly restricted its own sales.
The stock slipped 9-3/4 pence to 415-1/4p by 1000 GMT.

TD
At 1007 GMT the EU said it  fined BA 6.8 million euros but BA shares barely shaved their losses - trading two percent off by 1015 GMT.

"The fear was that the  fine was going to be significant, but really it's the principle that counts long-term and the two-fold question is what BA's response will be and whether this is exclusive to BA or whether it's endemic in the industry as has been suggested," said one airline industry analyst.
The EU said it was investigating similar schemes operated by a number of other airlines. ((Louise Ireland, London newsroom +44 171 542 8712, fax +44 171 542 2120,

LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - British Airways  said on Wednesday it would launch an immediate appeal against a European Commission decision to fine the airline 6.8 million euros over a system of commissions paid to travel agents.

British Airways  said in a statement that EU decision was "wrong in fact and in law" and that it strongly believed the ruling would be overturned.

TD
The EU's decision followed a complaint from Virgin Atlantic Airways about a system of fidelity  rebates which BA stopped in January. The Commission said the system made travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling agency services to other airlines.
"The airline believes that its business practices satisfy all the various  competition rules that apply in the
European Community and around the world," BA's statement said.

"Today's pronouncement by the EC is wrong in fact and in law. BA will appeal against the ruling and strongly believes it will be overturned," it added.
Director of Sales Dale Moss said BA's travel agency arrangements were similar to those of other major
European and world airlines.

BA's policy to give travel agents the chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets was normal business practice and allowed agents to sell more cheaply to consumers, he said.

LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic Airways said on Wednesday it felt vindicated by a
European Union ruling to  fine British Airways  for a system of commissions paid to travel agents.

"It is fantastic news and a complete vindication of Virgin's complaints to the  European Commission that BA have been abusing their dominant position," Virgin chairman Richard Branson said in a statement.

"This ruling sounds the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangement," he said.

Branson said that the ruling would also lead to lower fares for both business and leisure travellers because Virgin could compete through travel agents' services route-by-route.
Virgin had complained to the European Union about BA's system of "fidelity  rebates" which BA
stopped in January.

In its ruling, the  European Commission said the scheme made travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other agencies. The EU body  fined BA 6.8 million euros.
BA said it would appeal immediately and that it believed its decision would be overturned.
But Virgin said its battle against BA was not over, noting that it had also filed a complaint in 1993 in the
United States over BA's sales deals in that country.

HD         FOCUS-EU fines BA in latest skirmish with Virgin. BY          By Michael Mann

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined British Airways  6.8 million euros ($6.92 million) on Wednesday over rewards to travel agents, in a decision hailed as a victory by archrival Virgin Atlantic Airways.

The European Union executive also warned it may  fine other carriers over similar allegations that they abuse their dominant position through an  unfair system of commissions to travel agents who increase sales of tickets on their planes.

TD
The decision followed a complaint by Virgin and is the latest episode in the long-running feud between the two British airlines. BA, which stopped its system of "fidelity  rebates" in January, said it would appeal against the  fine at Europe's highest court.

Virgin Atlantic Airways hailed the Commission's decision. "It is fantastic news and a complete vindication of Virgin's complaints to the  European Commission that BA have been abusing their dominant position," Virgin chairman Richard Branson said in a statement.

In 1993, Virgin won 610,000 pounds ($951,000) plus costs from BA in settlement of a libel case for alleged "dirty tricks" and the two companies have had repeated legal skirmishes since then.

The Commission said in a statement that for at least seven years, BA had offered travel agents extra payments in return for upping their sales of BA tickets.

"This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines and has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the UK markets for air transport," it added.

The Commission said it and  British Airways  had cooperated on working out a set of principles for payments to travel agents, which would prevent BA from transgressing in the future and give clear guidance to other airlines in a similar situation.

The Commission said it was investigating similar schemes operated by a number of other airlines. Outgoing European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said other carriers may also be punished but any fines would probably be lower.

"All similar situations will have to face similar consequences," Van Miert told a news conference. He did not name any other airline.
The European Commission can fine firms up to 10 percent of annual sales in a market where it finds
competition rules are broken.

Shares in British Airways  lost two percent on Wednesday to close down 8-1/2 pence at 416-1/2p, having dipped to 415-1/4p shortly before the Commission's announcement.

British Airways  said in a statement issued in London that the EU decision was "wrong in fact and in law" and that it strongly believed the ruling would be overturned.

BA director of communications, Simon Walker, told Reuters the airline had been  unfairly singled out for criticism, and so had filed its own complaints with the Commission against other European airlines, including Air France, Alitalia, Sabena, Lufthansa and Scandinavian Airlines System.

Virgin complained after BA introduced a scheme for larger travel agents to earn more if they increased their sales of BA tickets.

Another carrier, British Midland, complained when BA in 1997 reduced its standard rate of commission to seven percent for all sales, and introduced a scheme enabling travel agents to increase this rate by meeting sales targets based on their previous year's sales of BA tickets.

HD           UK Shares Firmer At Midday On Banks; FTSE 100 +0.8% WC          607 words

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Renewed interest in retail banks and strength in oils have helped U.K. shares higher by midday Wednesday, despite weakness in telecoms.
At 1141 GMT, the FTSE 100 index was up 46.0 points, or 0.7%, at 6491.6, having eased gently off a
6505.9 high.

TD
Reports that Cable & Wireless has been unable to find a bidder for its jointly owned One-2-One mobile phone group have rattled the sector, with C&W share down 27.5 pence, or 3.3%, at 806 pence. Tracking the move were Orange and Telewest Communications, which both lost around 0.6%.

"Cable & Wireless has also suffered because of its significant earnings in Hong Kong," said Eric Hathorn, a trader at Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell almost 3% overnight amid tensions between China and Taiwan and fears that China may devalue the yuan.
"It is a real possibility that can't be ignored," Hathorn said.

But the overall trend in London was positive as buying interest in heavyweight retail banks and oil majors shored up the index.

Banks had come in for a pasting Tuesday as the focus switched to economic strife in Latin American markets, and many had suffered profit-taking over the past 10 days since the FTSE 100 set its record closing high of 6620.6. But Wednesday a clutch of High Street banks have reversed those losses.

NatWest Bank shares were up 44 pence, or 3.5%, at 1300 pence, after a 22 pence fall Tuesday. NatWest shares traded at 1478 pence at the end of June.

Abbey National shares were up 30 pence, or 2.6%, at 1184 pence, after a fall of 8 pence Tuesday. At the start of this month, Abbey National was trading at 1216.

Oils were also higher after dwindling U.S. crude stocks inflated Brent prices. BP Amoco shares were up 24 pence at 1263 pence.

Elsewhere, Dixons continues to derive support from expectations that its Freeserve Internet service will trade at a sharp premium to the flotation price. Dixons shares were up 68 pence, or 5.1%, at 1393 pence to lead the FTSE 100 risers. All this after a 3.5% advance Tuesday.

Publisher EMAP held its gains from opening deals, trading up 47 pence, or 4%, at 1207 pence. Dealers said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rates the shares as a buy and the cheapest European media stock in the market.
Hilton Group's shares were up 8.5 pence, or 3.4%, at 254.25 pence on the back of press reports that
Hilton Hotels Corp. of the U.S. is preparing a reverse takeover of the U.K. hotel and betting group.

British Airways  featured among the fallers, down 8.5 pence, or 2%, at 416.5 pence. The company
has been hit by a GBP4 million  fine from the European Commission for breaching E.U.  competition
rules. BA were accused of illegally providing cash incentives to travel agents to boost ticket sales at
the expense of rivals.

Wall Street provides the next marker for U.K. traders. Early indications from the futures market are for a slightly firmer start, with technology shares seen rising after an upbeat outlook from Intel.

But first U.S. producer prices and retail sales data will have to be negotiated at 1230 GMT. These could well provide further clues over the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.

HD           E.U. Warns Other Airlines Over Rewards After BA Fine

LONDON (Dow Jones)--European airlines operating reward programs for travel agents could face similar fines to the one imposed on  British Airways  PLC (BAB) Wednesday, European  Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert warned.

The European Union Commission imposed a  fine of EUR6.8 million, or approximately GBP4 million, on British Airways  for abusing its dominant position as a buyer of air travel services from U.K. travel agents.

TD
The extra commissions paid by British Airways  over the past seven years to travel agents in order to encourage them to boost their sales of British Airways  tickets have created a barrier for other airlines wishing to compete with the company in the U.K. market, the E.U. said Wednesday.

"This kind of system is clearly illegal," Van Miert said at a news conference in Brussels, although he noted most big airlines operate such programs.

British Airways  said it intends to launch an immediate appeal against the ruling. The company denies it has a monopoly of sales through travel agents and claims its share of total scheduled airline sales through U.K. agents is less than 40%.

"If we are to be restricted, then we look forward to the  European Commission establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied equitably to all airlines," said Dale Moss, director of sales for British Airways.

"All similar situations (to that of  British Airways)  will have to face similar cases," Van Miert said. It will be up to new Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to track down such practices when he takes over from Van Miert in September.
Other airlines likely to come under fire for reward schemes for travel agents are Air France Group
(F.AFG), Lufthansa AG (G.LHA) or Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A (E.ILA), sector followers said.

But British Airways  is the airline that has been resorting to this type of incentives for the longest period of time, Van Miert said.
Airline industry observers were unfazed by the  fine levied on British Airways.

"This fine is irritating and that is why the share price is down, but it is immaterial in size," said Andrew Darke, transport analyst with Williams de Broe. "British Airways  has got other things to worry about," he added.
Shares in British Airways  PLC (BAB) limited their losses Wednesday afternoon.

Shortly before the close of trade Wednesday, shares in  British Airways  were down 2.0% or 8.5 pence at 416.5 pence with 4.85 million shares changing hands. Shares in Lufthansa closed down
0.3% at EUR18.70.

Virgin Atlantic, which filed the complaint with the E.U. against arch-rival  British Airways  in the first place in 1994, said the small size of the  fine imposed on the company is irrelevant.

Page 16 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"What matters is that it is an historic decision for the industry," said Paul Moore, spokesman for Virgin
Atlantic.

"It is a clear and unambiguous ruling by the  European Commission that British Airways  has a dominant position in the U.K. market and that its sales practices are anti-competitive," he added.
Virgin Atlantic has a similar case against  British Airways  pending in the U.S.

Wednesday's ruling by the  European Commission increased Virgin's confidence over the outcome of its complaint in the U.S., Moore added.
If Virgin were to win before U.S. courts,  British Airways  could end up paying up to US$1 billion to
Branson's airline for aggravated damages, Moore said.

BRITISH Airways  was today fined #4 million for breaching EU  competition rules.

The European Commission said that BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to boost the carrier's ticket sales at the expense of rivals.

TD
The retiring commissioner for  competition policy, Karel Van Miert, imposed the penalty to make an example of BA and jolt other EU flag-carrying airlines operating similar incentive schemes.

But he stopped short of imposing the maximum  fine of #13 million for "serious" breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant position in the marketplace.

The ruling is the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints from BA's long-haul arch-rival Virgin Atlantic.

Virgin said that BA was offering travel agents extra commission if they could demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.

British Airways  is expected to appeal.

By Carl Mortished international business editor.

British Airways  will be fined millions of pounds by the  European Commission today for illegal sales practices and abusing its dominant position in the market.

TD
BA has lost a three-year legal battle with the EC, Europe's  competition authority, over the payment of fidelity bonuses to travel agents who funnelled large numbers of passengers onto its flights.

The EC was alerted after a complaint from Virgin in 1993. A Virgin spokesman said: "They were offering kickbacks and cash bonuses to travel agents. If you are the dominant airline it is a way of wiping out competitors."

A source within the Commission confirmed that it would issue a "negative finding" that BA had abused its dominant position, contrary to article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.
The airline is likely to appeal against the  fine, which some believe could be between #15 million and
#25 million.

HD       EU Decides to Fine British Airways  For Monopoly. WC       283 words

Brussels, July 14 (Xinhua) - The  European Commission said here Wednesday it has decided to
impose a fine of 6.8 million euros (6. 94 million U.S. dollars) on  British Airways  (BA) for its monopoly in
competition of travel agency services on the British markets.

The European Union (EU) executive said BA has been for at the past seven years offering travel agents extra commission payments in return for their meeting or exceeding their previous year's sales of BA tickets.

TD
"This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines and has created an illegal barriers to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the United Kingdom markets for air transport," the EU executive said in a statement.

The Commission and BA have therefore reached a set of principles for the future, which will prevent BA from abusing a dominant position. "These principles will also establish clear guidance for any other airline in a similar situation".

The EU executive said it will take all steps necessary to ensure that these principles are applied to other airlines EU-wide in the same situations.

According to the seven-point principles, travel agents are free to sell the tickets of any other airlines and the goods or services supplied by any third party, among others.

This case arose from a complaint from Britain's Virgin airliner against BA, the British flag carrier. Virgin complained about BA's system of commissions for travel, saying these had the effect of excluding it and other competitors to BA from the air transport markets in Britain.

The European Commission is today expected to  fine British Airways  a hefty sum for operating a sales system that rewarded travel agents who promoted BA flights over rivals, an official confirmed yesterday.
The penalty follows a two-year investigation into the British airline's system of fidelity  rebates which
Brussels says breaches European Union  competition rules.

TD
BA said it would challenge the  fine which it accepted could be substantial.
"We expect legal action to continue for many years," the airline said.

Under EU rules, the Commission can  fine BA up to 10 per cent of its turnover but the final figure is unlikely to come anywhere near such a sum.

The Commission intends to levy the  fine even though BA changed its sales techniques last year. Officials hope the  fine will serve as a warning to other airlines that operate similar systems.

"This decision is relevant as a policy precedent in the airline sector," said a Commission official. "We know several other carriers have implemented similar fidelity  rebate schemes."

Brussels launched its inquiry into BA's ticketing policies after receiving a complaint from Virgin Atlantic in 1997.

The rival airline alleged that BA was  unfairly persuading companies to use its services by offering a combination of discounts.

BA said its commission structure was standard practice throughout the industry. It involved paying travel agents higher commissions if they sold more tickets.
However, BA earlier this year changed its system of paying travel agents to one it said "the
Commission would find more acceptable".
BA told travel agents it would pay them a flat rate of 7 per cent.

Agents who were successful in selling the airline's tickets would not receive more commission but could be given extra payments in the form of "marketing support".

BA said it had asked Brussels why it had been singled out when other airlines were using its old commission system. The Commission said it had only received complaints about BA.

The airline then submitted its own complaints to the Commission about other European carriers, including Lufthansa of Germany and Sabena of Belgium.

LONDON, July 14 (AFP) - The European Commission is to impose a hefty  fine Wednesday on British   Airways  for breaching EU competition rules, the Financial Times reported.

The ruling follows a two-year investigation into the British flag carrier's system of paying travel agents to promote its flights at the expense of rival carriers.

TD
The European Union's executive arm is intent on making an example of BA to jolt other EU flag-carrying airlines operating identical incentive schemes, said the London business daily.
The inquiry was triggered by a formal complaint from BA's long- haul arch-rival, Virgin Atlantic, in 1997. Tycoon Richard Branson's airline alleged that the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum
pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price,
quality of service or scheduling.

The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a dominant market position.Y# BA's response was a new scheme -- the "performance rewards scheme" -- which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.
BA said it would challenge the  fine, which could run into millions of pounds (dollars). "We expect legal action to continue for many years," the airline told the FT.

BRITISH AIRWAYS was today fined #4 million for paying travel agents to steer passengers onto its flights at the expense of rivals.

The European Commission - which ruled the company had breached  competition laws - made an example of BA to jolt other European airlines which run identical incentive schemes.

TD
The airline immediately said that it would appeal the ruling.

The maximum fine of #13m, which can be imposed for "serious" breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant position in the market-place, was not imposed.

The ruling is the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints from BA's long-haul arch-rival, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.

Virgin said BA was offering travel agents extra commission if they could demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.

Virgin alleged the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.

The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained the required annual sales growth target for tickets.

The commission sent a letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a dominant market position.

BA's response was a new scheme - the "performance rewards scheme" - which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.

BA has argued that it is being targeted  unfairly, as other leading European airlines operate similar incentive schemes.
But the EU commissioner for  competition policy, Karel Van Miert, was intent on making an example of
BA to jolt other EU flag-carrying airlines operating identical incentive schemes, although Brussels says
it has no plans at the moment to launch new inquiries into the activities of the rest.
Today's ruling was welcomed by Mr Branson, who said: "This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that
BA has been abusing its dominant position.

"This will mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive and should lead to lower fares, provided Virgin can in future compete with BA on a route-by-route basis.
"For a long time, BA has had the travel trade trapped in the bearhug of its monopolistic control of the
British airline markets."


Page 24 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He added: "The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets."
Confirming it would appeal,  British Airways  branded the ruling "wrong in fact and in law".

BA's director for sales, Mr Dale Moss, said: "Our commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the world.

"This company's policy is simply to give travel agents a chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets."

He added: "This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish."

The European Commission is looking into other complaints about cash incentives to travel agents to favour one airline over another.

But a commission spokesman said Brussels and BA had "identified a set of principles" which will prevent the airline from continuing its preferential treatment of travel agents promoting its ticket sales to the detriment of others.

The commission also called on other airlines to voluntarily adopt the same standards - a clear warning of more fines to follow if they do not.

BRITISH Airways  was fined Pounds 4million yesterday for paying travel agents to encourage customers to book its flights.
The European Commission said the bonus scheme broke  competition laws.

TD
The ruling follows a two-year probe triggered by complaints from rival Virgin Atlantic.

Virgin said it was  unfair of BA to offer agents extra commission if they could show ticket sales were up compared to those of rival airlines.
Virgin boss Richard Branson said the  fine was good news for smaller airlines and travellers. But BA
said it would appeal and blasted the ruling as "wrong in fact and law."
Sales director Dale Moss said: "This is normal business practice." (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 1999

COMMISSION ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR COMMISSIONS PAID BY AIRLINE COMPANIES TO TRAVEL AGENTS - A 6.8 MILLION EURO  FINE IMPOSED ON  BRITISH AIRWAYS.

Brussels, 14/07/1999 (Agence Europe) - The  European Commission is currently examining several complaints relating to commissions paid by airline companies to travel agents. These complaints concern the abuse of dominant positions that certain companies are said to exercise by applying loyalty  rebate schemes that have the effect of tying travel agents to certain companies and discourage, as far as they are concerned, the sale of tickets on other airlines.

TD
Acting on the complaint filed by Virgin, the Commission initially examined the loyalty systems used by travel agents set up by  British Airways.  The Commission noted that, during the last seven years, BA hindered competition by paying additional commissions to travel agents that maintained or exceeded their previous sales levels. The Commission therefore decided to impose a  fine of EUR 6.8 million on  British   Airways for abuse of dominant position.

On the basis of the practices noted in  British Airways,  the Commission identified a certain number of principles that should be respected by airline companies in their relations with travel agents. These principles stress that all travel agents should remain free to sell the tickets of another airline company. The calculation of commissions should never be linked to sales targets expressed by reference to the sales made by the travel agent in a preceding period.

Immediately after the announcement of this decision,  British Airways  announced its intention to appeal before the Court of First Instance. The company considers that this decision is perfectly without foundation. "The policy of the company, which consists in giving travel agents the possibility of earning more by selling more tickets is a normal commercial practice", states a press release which specifies that this also allows a tour operator to make consumer discounts if it so wishes.

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Reuters) -
European  Commission anti-trust officials raided Belgium's Interbrew    on Wednesday on suspicion the privately-owned brewer, one of the world's five largest, was abusing its dominant position in the domestic market, Belga news agency reported.

Belga cited a Commission spokesman as saying the raids were conducted because of suspicions Interbrew was using its strong position to close off the Belgian beer market to  competition by offering discounts to loyal customers and selling below market prices.

TD
Clients were allegedly also forced to buy certain products.

Belga cited an Interbrew spokesman as saying the company did not know the reasons for the raid, which the inspectors used to collect documents, but would cooperate fully.
No-one at Interbrew was immediately available to comment.
A Commission spokesman could also not immediately be reached to confirm the information.

Under EU competition rules, companies can be  fined up to 10 percent of their turnover if found guilty of anti-competitive market practices.

Outgoing EU  antitrust commissioner Karel Van Miert, himself a Belgian, has been using his last days in office to tackle a number of suspected anti-competitive business practices.

The Commission announced earlier on Wednesday that it had  fined British Airways  6.8 million euros for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the U.K. travel market by offering travel agents incentives to sell BA tickets.
BA said it would appeal the decision.
EU investigations into suspected anti-competitive practices take months to conclude, meaning Van
Miert, due to step down in September, is unlikely to oversee the end of any Interbrew probe.

Van Miert is due to be replaced by fellow commissioner Mario Monti, an Italian who is currently in charge of the EU's financial services and tax policies. ((Brussels newsroom, tel +322 287 6830, fax

LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) -  British Airways  said on Thursday it was disappointed by a French court's decision to uphold an order that the airline pay compensation to passengers taken hostage in occupied Kuwait at the start of the Gulf War.

France's top court confirmed earlier that  British Airways  had to pay $4 million to 61 French nationals and foreign residents of France who were aboard a BA flight which landed at Kuwait airport on August
2, 1992 - four hours after Iraqi invaders entered the emirate.

TD
After Iraqi soldiers seized the Boeing 747, its passengers were held hostage for up to three months. Some were used as human shields against allied bombing of strategic Iraqi sites.

"We are disappointed with today's decision, which differs from the interpretation of courts in other countries," a spokesman for  British Airways  said.

"While we have every sympathy with those taken hostage, what happened...was the result of an act of war by Iraq which took the whole world by surprise. We could not have foreseen it and we should not be held responsbile for its consequences."

British Airways  said it had won similar cases in England, Scotland and the United States.

In a different case, the  European Commission fined British Airways  on Wednesday 6.8 million euros ($7 million) over payments the airline made to travel agents deemed to violate  competition rules, in a decision hailed as a victory by archrival Virgin Atlantic Airways.

- CABLE SECTOR SET FOR 8BN STG MOVE

TD
France Telecom is reported to be in talks with NTL over backing the UK cable operator in a bid for the residential cable assets of Cable & Wireless Communications . Such a move would threaten a proposed deal between CWC and Telewest , the third UK cable operator, which has been under discussion since April. NTL then made no secret of its wish to be involved in this further phase of consolidation, but it lacks the financial clout to mount a bid on its own. A stake in NTL would be France Telecom's first major expansion out of its home market.
- BRUSSELS GETS TOUGH WITH  BRITISH AIRWAYS

European competition commissioner Karel van Miert has  fined British Airways  6.8 million euros for operating anti-competitive loyalty schemes with travel agents. He said British customers had been robbed of the full benefits of air transport liberalisation by BA's abuse of its dominant position. The  fine was welcomed by rival group Virgin , which made the initial complaint to Brussels in 1997. BA said it would appeal and was confident that the verdict would be overturned. The Commission indicated that following BA's complaint against other airlines for operating similar schemes, it would investigate rival operators.
- MONTI VOWS TO END BOOK PRICE-FIXING

Mario Monti, the incoming EU  competition commissioner, on Wednesday vowed to continue his predecessor Karel van Miert's attempt to scrap a 110-year-old book price-fixing agreement in Germany and Austria. German publishers argue the measure, which allows them to fix prices and prevents retailers from discounting, preserves the diversity of German-language books. Van Miert claimed the system was illegal as it did not have an exemption from EU restrictive practices rules. Monti described it as a 'cartel' masquerading as the promotion of culture.
- EMPLOYMENT TOTAL RISES AS PAY PRESSURES EASE

The UK Labour Force Survey published on Wednesday showed that employment rose by 20,000 in the three months to May, while the number of jobless claiming benefits fell by 0.1 percent to 4.4 percent. Despite a record number of people now being in work, wage inflation has remained under control. According to the Office for National Statistics, the growth in average earnings over the same period was
4.3 percent, compared to 4.6 percent in the three months to April. Employment minister Andrew Smith said 'wages growth...is a key requirement for sustainable growth'.
- BRUSSELS TO LIFT BRITISH BEEF BAN IN AUGUST

The European Commission has ruled that Britain may resume beef exports from August 1, following a three-year ban due to the BSE epidemic. The government and National Farmers Union welcomed the decision, which ends an embargo that has cost the country at least 1.5 billion stg in lost sales. It came after EU veterinary inspectors approved the UK's planned operation of a date-based scheme that will allow the export of animals born after August 1 1996 and aged between six and 30 months. The

recapture of the country's former overseas beef markets is expected to take many years, due to consumer resistance and the high sterling exchange rate.
- MINISTERS COUNT COST OF SCRAPPED PFI PROJECT

Ministers admitted to the Commons on Wednesday that scrapping the original plan to computerise the Post Office through the private finance initiative (PFI) had proven costly. Treasury minister Alan Milburn said the government and computer services group ICL had underestimated the complexity of the proposal to introduce benefits payments swipe cards. The government will now provide 480 million stg through conventional procurement to automate the Post Office. Social security secretary Alistair Darling told MPs that 320 million stg in fraud savings would not now be made. The Treasury taskforce on Wednesday published its definitive guidelines for future PFI projects.
- BELFAST RETAIL SCHEME WILL BE IRELAND'S BIGGEST
Property companies Dunloe Ewart Northern Ireland, MEPC and John Laing are linking to develop a
750,000 sq ft retail site in the Belfast city centre, creating what is expected to be the biggest retail
development in Ireland. The city's chamber of commerce welcomed the plan as the first major
development in the city for 10 years. Research by Ewart identified 30 retailers who needed more space
and another 80 companies with a presence in other major cities but not Belfast.
- DOW JONES LAUNCHES INDEX OF 'TITANS'
Dow Jones Indexes on Wednesday launched its Global Titans index, comprising the shares of the world's
50 biggest multinationals. The move anticipates plans by rival provider FTSE International for a similar
global equity benchmark index, and is being seen by fund managers as an attempt by Dow Jones to
create an index with the worldwide standing among retail investors of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in
the US. The company insisted it was targeting both institutional and retail investors. Dow Jones , FTSE
International and MCSI are all seeking to capture more business from fund managers who no longer
invest on traditional national criteria.
- FREESERVE VALUATION QUESTIONED

IT mergers and acquisitions specialists Broadview have questioned the 1.3-1.5 billion stg valuation of Freeserve, the subscription-free internet service being floated by retailer Dixons Group . Broadview's Victor Basta argued that all subscription-free ISP's would have to turn themselves into internet portals to attract and retain users, and should therefore be compared with publicly-quoted companies of this nature. Basta said that based on its 1.32 million active users, Freeserve was being valued at $1,500 per active user, which was above all US companies except for America Online.
- DUTCH GROUP TO BUY CRESSIER

Dutch oil refining and distribution group Petroplus is in advanced talks with Royal Dutch/Shell over the purchase of the latter's Cressier refinery in Switzerland. Analysts estimate a price tag of up to $150 million. The sale is an attempt by Shell to improve its downstream portfolio, following on from the closure of the Shell Haven refinery on the Thames estuary and the expected closure of its Norwegian Sola site next year. Petroplus said it expected to improve returns by reducing overheads and increasing the plant's flexibility.

By Carl Mortished international business editor.

British Airways  is to challenge a fine of #4million imposed by the  European Commission, which yesterday found the airline guilty of making illegal payments to travel agents who encouraged passengers to take BA flights.

TD
BA acccused the Commission of being wrong in fact and in law and claimed that most big European airlines ran similar schemes. The company is appealing to the European Court against the decision and fine of 6.8million.

The case was originally brought by Virgin, Richard Branson's airline, which complained in 1994 that BA was paying big kickbacks to travel agents for putting passengers on BA flights. Virgin said yesterday that it was pursuing a similar case against its rival in the US.

Mr Branson said that Virgin would have expanded more quickly in the US had the BA sales practice not been in place. "If we are successful BA could be ordered to pay Virgin Atlantic up to $1billion (
#640 million) damages," he said.

The Commission's case is that BA has abused its dominant position by operating a loyalty  rebate scheme that tied agents to a dominant airline. BA said: "This is a judgment of officials, not of any legal entity." The decision will cause turmoil in the travel industry, where agents are angry at BA's decision to cut its basic commission rate from 9 to 7 per cent.

Keith Betton of the travel agents' association said that in January BA had been forced to abandon the performance reward scheme, which enabled agents to raise their commission to 9 per cent and more if they increased BA ticket sales by 15 per cent per year. Mr Betton said that agents had rejected the scheme, preferring independence. BA is talking to agents about new ways of rewarding them.

Virgin admitted that it also pays bonuses to agents for increased sales. Virgin is paying 10 per cent, one of the highest rates in the industry, but a Virgin spokesman said that this was not illegal because it was not the dominant airline.

British Airways  was yesterday fined #4 million for breaching European  competition rules after complaints from Richard Branson's airline, Virgin Atlantic.

The European Commission said BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to boost ticket sales at the expense of rivals. Mr Branson said the ruling would "mark the death-knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower Bfares."ut BA said it would appeal against the decision, which it branded "wrong in fact and in law".

TD
EC competition commissioner Karel van Miert stopped short of imposing a maximum  fine of #13 million for what were described as "serious" breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant position in the marketplace.

Virgin had accused BA of offering travel agents extra commission if they could demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients. Virgin alleged the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.
The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was illegal.

BA's response was a new scheme - the "performance rewards scheme" - which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.

The Commission said yesterday the incentives were "clearly illegal" and had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe.

BA and Brussels have now sorted out a way forward to prevent the airline continuing any preferential treatment for travel agents.

Airline gave travel agents bonuses to do down rivals.

British Airways  has been fined #4m for breaching European  competition rules after complaints from
Richard Branson's airline, Virgin Atlantic.

TD
The European Commission said yesterday that BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to boost ticket sales at the expense of rivals.

Mr Branson said the ruling would "mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares".
But BA said it would appeal against the decision, which it branded "wrong in fact and in law". Imposing the penalty, EC  competition commissioner Karel van Miert stopped short of imposing a
maximum fine of #13m for what were described as "serious" breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant
position in the marketplace.
The ruling was the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints from Virgin.

Virgin had accused BA of offering travel agents extra commission if they could demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.

Virgin alleged the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.

The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained the required annual sales growth target for tickets.
The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was illegal.

BA's response was a new scheme - the "performance rewards scheme" - which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.

The EC discovered that for at least seven years BA had been offering travel agents extra commission payments if they met or exceeded their previous year's sales of BA tickets.

The Commission said yesterday the incentives were "clearly illegal" and that the practices BA engaged in had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe.

BA and Brussels have now sorted out a way forward to prevent the airline continuing any preferential treatment for travel agents and the Commission called on other airlines to voluntarily adopt the same standards - a clear warning of more  fines to follow if they do not.

BA director for sales Dale Moss said: "Our commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the world.
"This company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets."


Page 43 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He went on: "This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish.

"The airline industry is fiercely competitive. Passengers have more choice than ever before. If we are to be restricted then we look forward to the EC establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied equitably to all airlines."

Mr Branson said: "This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has been abusing its dominant position.
"For a long time, BA has had the travel trade trapped in the bearhug of their monopolistic control of the
British airline markets.

"The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets."
The Consumers' Association welcomed the EC decision.

HD         BA vows to fight Pounds 4m fine for bribing agents

RICHARD BRANSON notched up another stunning victory against arch-rival  British Airways
yesterday.

Britain's flagship airline was  fined Pounds 4million for breaching Brussels  competition rules after European Commission watchdogs found it guilty of bribing travel agents to boost BA ticket sales at the expense of smaller carriers.

TD
Their ruling followed complaints from Mr Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which claimed incentive payments to the agents, in the form of extra commission from BA, were illegal under European law.
BA vowed to fight the decision by appealing to the European Court of First Instance, which handles
competition matters.

Sales director Dale Moss insisted: 'Our commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines . . . the policy is to give travel agents the chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets. This is normal business practice.' But yesterday's Brussels verdict was: 'It is
well-established community law that a dominant supplier cannot give incentives to its customers and distributors to be loyal to it, so foreclosing the market from competitiors.' The practice, it said, was
'clearly illegal'.

A jubilant Mr Branson declared: 'This really will mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements. For a long time, BA have had the travel trade trapped in the bear hug of their monopolistic control of British airline markets.' His latest triumph follows the epic 1992 onslaught against BA when he accused the airline of a 'dirty tricks' campaign during which it hacked into Virgin computers to lure away passengers.
In January 1993 BA apologised in the High Court and paid Pounds 610,000 damages for saying Mr
Branson was making his allegations purely for publicity reasons.
After yesterday's verdict, Brussels will now be under pressure to take similar action against other big
European airlines using the same tactics on travel agents.

For Mr Branson, the battle goes on with a U.S. legal action claiming that BA has used its huge power there to dominate  unfairly Virgin's American operations.

THE European Commission has imposed a 6.8-million euro  fine on British Airways  for a controversial system for paying commission to travel agents designed to encourage them to favour BA flights over those of other rivals. The Commission launched an inquiry last year in response to complaints from Virgin Atlantic Airways, which claimed the 'fidelity  rebates' scheme unfairly restricted its own sales. The
Commission said the system had "created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the UK markets for air transport". It added that it was investigating similar schemes operated by a number of other airlines and that more  fines could follow. BA said it would launch an immediate appeal against
the penalty.

A DECISION on whether to outlaw Germany and Austria's system of cross-border minimum book-pricing agreements was postponed by the full Commission this week. A spokesman said there had been a long discussion but no vote was taken and it was unclear when the case would be decided.

PORTUGAL has accused the Commission of putting undue pressure on Lisbon over its opposition to a proposed share-swap deal between Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) and the Champalimaud Group. Van Miert wrote to the Portuguese government last month warning that he believed its opposition to the deal breached EU rules and gave Lisbon until this week to reply.

THE Commission has officially warned France that the system used to calculate the charges which telecoms providers have to pay France Telecom as compensation for its legal requirement to provide universal phone service at reasonable prices violates EU law. Paris has been given two months to reply and make the necessary changes.
THE Commission has extended the deadline for a decision on whether to clear US telecoms giant
AT&T's proposed purchase of cable and mobile phone operator MediaOne Group until next Friday (23
July). AT&T, the top US long-distance phone company and number two cable operator, plans to buy
MediaOne for about 59 billion euro.

THE European Court of Justice this week confirmed  fines totalling more than 40 million euro imposed on several large chemical companies by the Commission, upholding a lower Court judgement which found evidence of a price-fixing cartel for polypropylene among Hercules Chemicals, Huels, Imperial Chemical Industries, Hoechst, Shell, Montecatini, Chemie Linz and DSM NV.

The European Commission yesterday fined British Airways  EUR6.8m ( #4.5m) for operating
anti-competitive loyalty schemes with travel agents and warned other airlines they would face similar
penalties if they did not stop such practices.

In one of his last acts as Europe's  competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert said  British Airways had robbed British travellers of the full benefits of air transport liberalisation by abusing its dominant position in the UK market.

TD
The company did this by running a system of commissions that discouraged travel agents from selling the tickets of rival airlines. "It is well established Community law that a dominant supplier cannot give incentives to its customers and distributors to be loyal to it, so foreclosing the market from the dominant firm's competitors," said the Commission.

BA said it would launch an immediate appeal against the  fine and was confident it would be overturned. Dale Moss, BA's sales director, said: "Our commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the world. The company's policy is to give travel agents the chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets. This is normal business practice."

Virgin, which triggered the investigation in 1997 by complaining to Brussels that BA's ticketing schemes were excluding it from the UK market, welcomed the  fine. Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said the ruling sounded "the death knell" for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and would lead to lower fares.

"For too long BA has had its corporate customers and the travel trade trapped in the bear hug of its monopolistic control of the British airline market. The travel trade will now be free to give truly independent, impartial advice to travellers and offer them the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive targets."

The Commission said this case and "fruitful co-operation" with BA had allowed officials to draw up a set of principles that would give guidance to other airlines on the proper use of commissions.  Competition officials are examining similar schemes operated by other big airlines. These were brought to its attention by BA, which felt it was being  unfairly picked on.

"We will have to see which ones need to be pursued," said Mr Van Miert, adding that as the airlines had not operated the schemes for as long as BA,  fines were likely to be lower.

Under BA's scheme, larger travel agents were able to earn extra income if they increased their sales of BA tickets. A second complaint was lodged when BA reduced its standard rate of commission to 7 per cent for all sales, and introduced a scheme for all travel agents under which they could increase the rate of commission by meeting sales targets expressed as a percentage of their previous year's sale of BA tickets.

HD       BA's punishment - It's no longer the world's favourite airline. WC      326 words

British Airways  revels in its reputation as the tough kid on the airline block. It has lived up to this image on numerous occasions in recent years, notably in its scraps with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, and there seems little doubt that it will continue to behave in this way. Yesterday it was  fined #4m by the European Commission for breaching EU competition rules. Broadly, it had offered financial incentives to travel agents to increase sales of British Airways  tickets. BA is astounded by what has happened and, reluctant though we are to admit it, the airline probably has a point of sorts.

TD
There are very few areas of commercial enterprise where financial rewards are not available for sales success and the airline is not the only one to employ such tactics. But  British Airways  must recognise that the competition rules are in place to stop dominant airlines from tying travel agents by so-called "loyalty rebates", thereby reducing passenger choice. For that reason alone, the Commission was right to fine BA and the airline should be glad that the  fine was not more than three times higher, as it could have been.

But this latest row raises further questions about BA's image. It is not the world's favourite airline, or anything like it. It treats staff badly and economy passengers little better, particularly on seat-spacing on long-haul flights. It persists in regarding the bulk of its passengers, who are economy fares, as little
better than back-packers and its latest plan to squeeze more revenue is to increase space for "business" class at the expense of economy. This is not the way to make friends or grow your business, as BA's latest results illustrate. Here is an airline that needs to think seriously about more than the colour of its tailfins.

Airline fined #4.5m by EU

BRITISH Airways,  the UK's largest airline, was yesterday  fined #4.5m for operating a bonus scheme with travel agents which kept potential competitors out of the market.

TD
The fine is the first to be levied by the  European Commission as it sets out to unravel the system of loyalty rebate schemes which effectively ties travel agents to a dominant airline and discourages them from selling customers tickets for a rival company.

EU lawyers have decided to clamp down on the practice (one which is understood to be followed by a number of other European airlines) since it is seen to be undermining the more fundamental policy of liberalising the industry to allow in more competitors able to offer passengers cheaper flights and more varied routes.

BA's ticketing policy became the Commission's first target after it received a complaint in 1997 from Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which has been involved in several dogfights with its larger competitor as it tries to shake up the airline industry.

It emerged during the lengthy investigation that, for several years, BA had offered larger travel agents extra commission if they increased their sales of the company's tickets.

The Commission, which yesterday agreed with Virgin Atlantic that the practice excluded Mr Branson's airline and others from the UK market, subsequently investigated a second complaint against BA.

Under this second scheme, the UK flag carrier reduced its standard rate of commission to 7% for all sales, but introduced the possibility of travel agents earning more if they increased their ticket sales by a certain percentage over the previous year.

"This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines, and has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the UK markets for air transport," said a Commission statement.

The institution's lawyers maintain that the commissions were equivalent to a loyalty discount whereby the discount is a result not of cost savings but of the type of loyalty which has been repeatedly condemned as violating EU rules because one company has a dominant position in the market.

"The effect of this abuse is to try to counteract the effect of market liberalisation by maintaining the dominant airline's market share at its old levels and by penalising travel agents who divert some of their customers to relatively new competitors.
"Incentives of this type given by a dominant firm are clearly illegal," said the Commission.

BA is expected to appeal against the decision and the  fine, although the penalty will make hardly any dent in the company's budget. The Commission could have imposed a  fine of up to 10% of BA's annual turnover. But it appears to have opted for relative leniency since the airline has agreed a new set of

Page 51 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
principles on travel agents' bonuses which will not prevent other airlines from competing for passengers.

Mr Branson said the ruling would "mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares".

The Consumers' Association welcomed the decision. Patricia Yates, editor of the association's Holiday Which? magazine, said BA's actions had "hit at the heart of a competitive aviation market". But she added: "The size of the  fine indicates BA is not the only dominant carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out smaller carriers.

"We trust that the Commission will, as BA itself has suggested, take similar action against other big European carriers. "We would also like to see the Commission extend this approach on directed selling to include the package travel sector."

HD          BA fined #4m for illegal trading. BY           By Keith Harper and Stephen Bates.

British Airways  was yesterday fined #4m for breaching European  competition rules in the culmination of its latest battle with arch rival Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic.

The European commission said that BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to steer passengers to buy the airlines' tickets. BA described the decision as `wrong in fact and in law" and said it would appeal.

TD
This marks the start of a protracted European legal battle which could go on for years.
This is not the first time BA and Mr Branson have been involved in a lengthy legal fight. In the famous
`dirty tricks" campaign it waged against Virgin five years ago, BA was  fined #600,000 and forced to
pay legal costs of #1.5m.

Mr Branson said that yesterday's ruling would mark the `death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentives arrangements and should lead to lower fares."

The ruling by the outgoing European  competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, followed two complaints from Virgin. He stopped short of imposing a maximum  fine of #13m for `serious' breaches of EU rules in abusing a domi nant position in the market place.

Virgin had accused BA of offering extra commission to travel agents if they could demonstrate that BA's ticket sales were increasing compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.

Virgin said that the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market. The pressure was stepped up every year, according to Virgin, and the agents were concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained their annual sales growth target for tickets.

The commission told BA last year that the scheme was ille gal. It said it had discovered that for at least seven years BA had adopted the practice.

The commission said that the incentives were `clearly illegal" and that the practices BA had engaged in had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe.

BA and Brussels have now sorted out a way forward to prevent the airline continuing any preferential treatment for travel agents, and the EU called on other airlines to voluntarily adopt the same standards. The other airlines under investigation include Air France, Lufthansa, KLM and SAS.

BA sales director Dale Moss said: `Our commission payments for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the world. The company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets."



Page 53 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr Moss said: `This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish. If BA is to be restricted than we look forward to the EU establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied equitably to all airlines."

Mr Branson said: `This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has been abusing its dominant position. For a long time, BA has had the travel trade trapped in the bear hug of its monopolistic control of the British airline markets."

He said that the travel trade would now be free to give independent advice and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets.
Patricia Yates, editor of Which? consumer magazine, said that the size of the  fine indicated that BA
was not the only dominant carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out small carriers.
She added that the EU should act against other European carriers.

British Airways  yesterday vowed to appeal after being  fined #4.4m for rewarding travel agents that sold seats on BA flights at the expense of rival carriers.

The European Commission imposed the penalty after a two-year investigation into BA's sales operations, triggered by complaints from Virgin Atlantic.

TD
The ruling that BA breached  competition rules by providing cash incentives to travel agents marks the latest chapter in a series of "dirty tricks" allegations against the airline.

Brussels' decision also fired a warning shot against other European airlines that operate similar schemes with travel agents across the EU.
Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, hailed the decision as vindication of his long-running claims "that BA
have been abusing their dominant position".

BA immediately announced that it would appeal against the ruling, which it branded "wrong in fact and in law". Dale Moss, BA's director for worldwide sales, said: "We are disappointed and there is a sense of puzzlement. Our commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines."

Karel Van Miert, acting European commissioner for  competition, who imposed the penalty, stopped short of levying the maximum  fine of #13m for "serious" breaches of EU rules on abuse of dominant position in the market place.

Brussels said for "at least seven years" travel agents have been offered extra commission payments for either equalling or bettering, the previous year's sales of BA tickets. It added: "This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines, and has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA."

BA's practices prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe, Brussels said.

Outlining a new set of principles to govern payments to travel agents, Brussels said a company like BA should only offer supplementary commissions if they reflected extra services to the airline provided by the agent.

Although Brussels has taken similar steps in other sectors, yesterday's decision was the first of its kind in the service industry. Brussels sent two legal warnings to BA, the second one in 1998, insisting the scheme was illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a dominant market position. BA's response to the first warning was to introduce a new "performance rewards scheme" - which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.

When it initially argued that it had been  unfairly singled out,Brussels told BA that it was the only airline against which a direct complaint had been made. Since then BA has filed its own complaints against eight European airlines on similar grounds.

STEPHEN BREEN.

BRITISH Airways  was fined #4million yesterday, for breaching European Union  competition laws by illegally providing cash incentives to travel agents to sell its tickets rather than those of rivals.

TD
The European Commission decision was welcomed by BA's bitter rival, Virgin Atlantic, whose complaint resulted in the ruling.

Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, said the ruling should signal the "death knell" for BA's anti-competitive sales tactics and he predicted cheaper fares as a result.

BA said it will challenge the ruling, which it claimed was "wrong in fact and in law". The airline said its commission arrangements for travel agents were similar to those operated by most major airlines.

The Consumers Association also applauded the ruling, but said BA was not the only airline giving incentives to agents to squeeze out smaller rivals.

Patricia Yates, the editor of the association's magazine Holiday Which?, said the commission should also investigate the package holiday firms which offer commission to travel agents to sell their products rather than that of their rivals.

The retiring commissioner for  competition, Karl Van Miert, did not  fine BA the maximum #13 million for a "serious" abuse of a dominant marketplace position. But he warned that other airlines who operated similar systems to BA faced being  fined if they did not adapt their incentive schemes.

Yesterday's ruling is the result of two formal complaints Virgin made about BA's commission policy for travel agents.

Virgin alleged that BA offered travel agents extra commission if they could prove that BA ticket sales were going up compared with other carriers. Mr Branson said the scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on the travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service and scheduling.

He said the pressure was stepped up and travel agents were worried their commission would fall if they did not hit their sales targets for BA ticket sales.

Last year, the  European Commission sent a letter to BA warning it that the scheme broke EU law, which prohibits restrictive contracts to reinforce a dominant market position. When BA responded with a new "performance rewards scheme", Virgin made a second formal complaint.

The commission report said: "It is well established community law that a dominant supplier cannot give incentives to its customers and distributors to be loyal to it, so foreclosing the market from the dominant firm's competitors.

"The effect of this abuse is to try to counteract the effect of market liberalisation by maintaining the dominant airline's market share at its old levels and by penalising travel agents who divert some of their


Page 59 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
customers to relatively new competitors. Incentives of this type given by a dominant firm are clearly illegal."
Later, Mr Van Miert warned that other airlines operating similar schemes also faced being  fined.

"All similar situations will have to face similar consequences. We will see to what extent the others have to be pursued a [but] because for the other airlines the duration of the schemes was not as long as in the case of BA, any  fines will probably be less," he said.

Mr Branson said: "This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has been abusing their dominant position.

"This really will mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares, provided Virgin can in future compete with BA on a route-by-route basis.
"For a long time, BA have had the travel trade trapped in the bearhug of their monopolistic control of the
British airline markets.

"The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets."
Dale Moss, BA's director of sales, said the airline would be appealing against the ruling. "Our
commission arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and
across the world.

"This company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets. This is normal business practice.

"It also means that agents can sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish. The airline industry is fiercely competitive. Passengers have more choice than ever before.

"If we are to be restricted then we look forward to the  European Commission establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied equitably to all airlines."

Ms Yates welcomed the commission ruling. "The practice of dominant players rewarding travel agents for pushing their tickets ahead of other airlines hits at the heart of a competitive aviation market," she said.

"However, as the size of the  fine indicates, BA is not the only dominant carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out smaller carriers.
"We trust that the commission will, as BA itself has suggested, take similar action against other big
European carriers."

She added: "We would also like to see the commission extend this approach on directed selling to include the package travel sector.

"Consumers of package holidays are very often directed toward the product that the firm wants to sell rather than the product that the consumer wants to buy. We look forward to action in this area."

BRITISH Airways  were fined #4million yesterday for breaching European  competition rules after complaints from Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.

The European Commission said BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to boost ticket sales at the expense of rivals.

TD
Mr Branson said the ruling would "mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares".
But BA said it would appeal against the decision, which it branded "wrong in fact and in law".

EC competition commissioner Karel van Miert stopped short of imposing a maximum #13million  fine for what he described as "serious" breaches of EU rules.

The finding was the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints from Virgin. Mr Branson had accused BA of offering travel agents extra commission if they could demonstrate their ticket sales were going up compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.

Virgin alleged the scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market, regardless of price, service or scheduling.

The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents concerned commissions would fall unless they maintained the required annual sales growth target for tickets.

The EC sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting it was illegal, after which BA's new rewards scheme triggered a second Virgin complaint.

The commission said BA had kept UK flyers from benefiting fully from EU efforts to liberalise air transport.

THERE may be further trouble ahead for  British Airways  boss Bob Ayling, 52, whose beleaguered company, capitalised at around Pounds 4.5 billion, was this week  fined Pounds 4.42 million by the European Commission for dirty tricks against Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
Now 100 BA pilots have called a meeting to complain about solicitor Ayling's attempts to merge the
'world's favourite airline's' two staff pension funds.

TD
According to the pilots, who will meet on August 19 to demand that the pension fund trustees reject the idea, the merger may lead to a reduction in BA's pension contributions over the next few years of around Pounds 90 million.
They assert the onetime glamour company needs the money because profits have slumped by Pounds
355 million in 12 months, thanks to  competition from other airlines - and they believe the Pounds 90
million saving would be used to help pay for new aircraft.

Says George Bell, chairman of the BA Pensioners Association: 'The pilots are anxious to express their point of view, but I gather they are not permitted by the

'The company asserts that merging the two multibillion-pound funds will mean that the money can be better invested for its members - but it also means that one of the funds will be far less secure than in the past, and the members of that fund are very worried about it.' The pension trustees are expected to ask the High Court for a ruling on the issue and legal fees are expected to top Pounds 1 million.
Adds a retired staff member: 'What they are trying to do is morally wrong.

Worse, the pension funds may have to pay for the court case, not BA, which is outrageous.' company to speak to the Press.

UNITED Kingdom flag carrier  British Airways  Plc will appeal against a ruling by the  European      Commission that it operated a sales system which rewarded travel agents who promoted its flights over those of rivals with commission payments.
The decision cost BA $6.8 million ($A7 million) in  fines.

TD
BA said it had done nothing illegal and argued it had been singled out for engaging in a practice common in the European travel industry.

The commission cited  unfair competition practices, or abuse of a dominant position, in accounting for its decision, which it said was intended as a message to the entire airline industry.
The commission could have  fined BA up to 10 percent of sales. BA shares fell 2 percent, or 8.5 pence, to close at 4.165 ($6.51).
"For at least the last seven years, BA has been offering travel agents extra commission payments in return for meeting or exceeding their previous year's sales of BA tickets," the commission said in its ruling.

"This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services of other airlines."

Dale Moss, BA's director of sales said he hoped the appeal would be resolved in months, but said the process was more likely to take years.

"We're obviously very disappointed with the news, but we're confident the decision will be overturned on appeal," he said.

At issue, according to Mr Moss, was not the  fine, but rather the fact that BA had been singled out for offering commission incentives to travel agents - a common practice across the industry in Europe, he said.

As a result, the commission needed to "make sure the playing field is level for all participants", he argued.

The commission said it had established a set of principles in co-operation with BA to prevent the airline from engaging in further abuse of European Union  competition laws, and also for the benefit of other carriers.
Those guidelines include conditions that permit commissions under EU law.

Overall, however, a dominant airline can provide additional commissions to travel agents only when they reflect extra services provided by the agents.

Mr Moss said BA would "start a dialogue" with travel agents to assess how the airline can work better with them.
The fine is a victory for BA rival Virgin Atlantic Airways.

Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, stole the show by referring Whitbread's proposed
#2.78 billion purchase of Allied Domecq's pub estate to the  Competition Commission. His decision was
entirely unexpected and left Whitbread with little option but to withdraw from the fray. Allied Domecq
promptly entered into talks with Punch Taverns, the privately owned company whose rival offer of #2.95
billion had previously been shunned by the Allied board.

Fresh gloom descended on the shareholders of Marks & Spencer after the former high street favourite reported that clothing and general merchandise sales had fallen almost 13 per cent in the three months to the end of June. City analysts responded by cutting profit forecasts for the current year by about #75 million.

BP Amoco embarked on a huge restructuring that will reduce its refining capacity greatly and rid the company of #6.5 billion of underperforming assets. Sir John Browne, chief executive, wants to cut costs by #2.6 billion a year by the end of 2001.

BOC, the industrial gases group, succumbed to a #7.2 billion break-up bid by Air Liquide, of France, and America's Air Products and Chemicals. The UK company will be dismantled, with operations split between the bidding partners, bringing to an end its 113-year history. Danny Rosenkranz, chief executive, will receive almost #7 million, including a severance package and the sale of shares and options. Mr Rosenkranz had opposed the takeover, favouring an alliance with Praxair, an American rival.

BOC's place in the FTSE 100 share index may well be taken by Old Mutual, the South African financial services company that secured a London share listing this week. Priced at 120p on flotation, the shares traded at 137p yesterday, valuing the business at more than #4 billion. This leaves it well placed to join its fellow South Africans Billiton, Anglo-American and South African Breweries in the top 100 later this year.

British Airways  was fined #4 million by the European Commission for making illegal payments to travel agents who encouraged passengers to take BA flights. The airline is to appeal against the  fine.

In a confidential report to European finance ministers the European Central Bank (ECB) gave warning that governments risked fatally undermining the single currency by failing to curb their huge budget deficits. The euro touched a new low against the dollar, but avoided falling to parity against the greenback, lifted by the ECB's suggestion that European interest rates may rise sooner than expected.

The Government launched its first partial privatisation with plans for a #1.5 billion stock market flotation for BNFL, the nuclear reprocessor and generator.

The battle to win control of the media rights of football took a new twist when Granada paid #22 million for a 9.9 per cent stake in Liverpool FC.

France Telecom took a $1 billion ( #640 million) stake in NTL, one of Britain's three big cable TV and telephone operators. The investment will underpin NTL's attempt to acquire the bulk of the assets of Cable & Wireless Communications, which have been valued at about #8 billion.

HD    COMPETITION/AIRLINES - BRITISH AIRWAYS FINED OVER TRAVEL AGENTS' INCENTIVE SCHEME. WC   942 words
PD    17 July 1999
SN    European Report
SC    EURREP
LA    English
CY    (c) 1999 European Report.

LP
British Airways,  one of the most successful European airlines and often one of the first to denounce
anti-competitive practices in the civil aviation industry, has been fined Euro 6.8 million by the European    
Commission for abusing its dominant position as a buyer of air travel agency services. For at least the
past seven years, BA has been offering travel agents extra commission payments in return for their
meeting or exceeding their previous year's sales of BA tickets. This makes the travel agents loyal to BA,
the Commission says, discouraging them from selling their services to other airlines and has put up an
illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA on the UK air transport market. The  fine comes as
part of a current investigation following a series of complaints received in relation to commission paid by
airlines to travel agents.

TD
These complaints concern a possible abuse of a dominant position by airlines operating loyalty  rebate schemes which effectively tie travel agents to a dominant airline, discouraging the agent from selling tickets for other airlines to their customers, the Commission claims.

By taking the first step to  fine BA through measures announced on July 14 by the Commission, its Competition Directorate-General, DG IV, appears to be preparing for other similar cases. In a press release issued on the same day, it hinted that other airlines might also receive the same treatment - although declined to say at this stage which other airlines are also practising the same  rebate schemes. For the time being, the Commission is simply saying that it has acted on a complaint received from
long-time rival airline Virgin and has investigated BA's incentives schemes to travel agents. For the future, the Commission and BA have worked out a set of principles which it says are the result of fruitful cooperation between BA and the EU executive. Applying these principles will prevent BA from engaging in the type of behaviour criticised in this decision, says the EU's  competition watchdog: "These 'principles' will also establish clear guidance for any other airline in a similar situation. The Commission claims that it aims to take all measures necessary to ensure that the principles in this Decision are applied to other EC airlines in equivalent situations" - a point that BA questions.

British Airways  has immediately spoken out against the Commission's decision, particularly, as it says the ruling was made following a complaint which "the Commission has taken six years to consider". Furthermore, in a statement, it adds: "The judgement today pronounced by the EC is wrong in fact and law. The Commission decided to stop (the 'rebates') on an interim basis and has come to this view in the last weeks of its existence".. BA added that it was confident that it will be overturned in due course during an appeal which it says it will immediately pursue in the EU Court of First Instance.
Complaint.

Virgin Airways had complained to Brussels about BA's system of commission for travel agents as it believed that such incentive schemes had the effect of excluding it and other competitors to BA from the
UK market for air transport. The initial complaint in this case was provoked by BA introducing a scheme for larger travel agents to earn extra income if they boosted their sales of BA tickets. A further complaint was lodged when BA reduced its standard rate of commission to 7% for all sales, and introduced a scheme for all travel agents whereby they could increase this commission rate by meeting sales targets expressed as
a percentage of their previous year's sales of BA tickets. Such commission payments are equivalent to a "loyalty discount" i.e. a discount based not on cost savings but on loyalty of the type consistently condemned as an exclusionary abuse of a dominant position in the past. On this point the Commission is clear: "It is well established Community law that a dominant supplier cannot give incentives to its customers and distributors to be loyal to it, so foreclosing the market from the dominant firm's competitors.

Page 69 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The effect of this abuse is to try and counteract the effect of market liberalisation by maintaining the dominant airline's market share at its old levels and by penalising travel agents who divert some of their customers to relatively new competitors. Incentives of this type given by a dominant firm are clearly illegal".
Airlines victims of monopolies, too.

Ironically, the day before it was  fined, BA spoke out against "monopolistic suppliers" of services to airlines, such as air traffic control, airport and ground-handling services, who continue to raise their prices despite low profitability rates on passenger traffic. BA's Chairman Bob Ayling is reported to have told the
company's AGM in London on July 13 that there are still too many monopolistic suppliers who have not adapted to the realities of a deregulated market. He said he hoped that suppliers would reduce their rates to reflect the drop in passenger yields. To back up his case, Mr Ayling said air traffic control rates had recently risen by 35% in Portugal, 15% in Turkey and Hungary, 9% in Romania and 6% in Spain. Airports are increasing their prices, too, with a recent 15% rise in Copenhagen, 25% in Toronto and 7% in several Italian airports. The demise of duty-free sales on intra-EU travel is also expected to encourage airports to try and offset their losses by passing on some of the burden to the airlines.

British Airways  has been fined #4m by the EC for abusing its `dom inant'market position, but Simon
Calder finds incentives are the norm in the travel trade

FOUR MILLION pounds is one heck of a  fine: British Airways  will need to fill around 500 Jumbos with fare-paying passengers from London to New York in order to pay off the  European Commission's penalty. The  competition authorities in Brussels imposed the  fine on BA on Wednesday. Arch-rival Virgin Atlantic had complained that, by increasing commission rates according to how many tickets travel agents' sold, Britain's largest airline was abusing "its dominant position in the market place".

TD
Every big industry has some way of rewarding increased sales; the key phrase behind BA's offence is to be found in the last seven words. As  British Airways  has around 40 per cent of the UK's scheduled airline business, it is held to have a dominant position. So its incentives to travel agents, ruled the Commission, comprise bullying tactics. For other travel firms, though, incentives - or "bribes," as some agents bluntly describe them - are becoming more widespread as  competition gets ever tighter.

"If someone phones you between 1 February and 30 April with a business class flight enquiry," ran an ad aimed at travel agents this year, "it could be the Virgin Atlantic Mystery Caller. If the first airline you mention is Virgin Atlantic, and you refer to one of our special Upper Class features, you will win #100 cash."

The airline's managing director, Steve Ridgeway, says that such advertisements are part of normal commercial practice. "We all have an armoury of promotional tools, and this is just one of them.

"Many agents work very hard for us, and this is another way of making sure, in a very competitive market, that we're maintaining our strength and our lead." Some travel agent bosses are angry at the way incentives are being offered to their staff. Stephen Bath, joint MD of the Bournemouth-based chain of travel agents, Bath Travel, says: "It really is a form of bribery."

The 300 staff at his company's agencies are not allowed to participate in such promotions - for what Mr Bath says are good commercial reasons. "It's great in the short term, but in the long term we want customers to come back because they've had the holiday that they want, rather than what we want to sell them."

Almost every UK travel agent, though, has links with particular suppliers - airlines, tour operators, car rental companies - that earn it extra commission. Each of the four main tour operators has a chain of High Street agents through which it sells its products. (You might think you're choosing a holiday, but you're not: from the travel trade's point of view, you're buying a product.)

"If an Airtours holiday is right for you, then that's what we'll offer you," says Going Places. A similar experience awaits you at Lunn Poly (owned by Thomson), Travel Choice (part of First Choice) and Thomas Cook (which promotes its own-brand holidays, plus those of sister firm, Sunworld).

Life for travel agents these days is positively bubbling with excitement. Airtours this week launched two upmarket brochures, and is giving away a bottle of champagne to each of the agents that books one of the first 1,000 holidays sold.
Page 71 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A glimpse through the travel trade press reveals plenty of incentives from other companies.
Gibraltar-based Cadogan Holidays has a full-page advertisement in the current Travel Weekly promising:
"To you, the travel agent, we offer #20 discount vouchers on every booking to be used against your own
Cadogan holiday."
The hottest  competition is to be found among car rental companies. If you are a travel agent and
happen to need a new television, Hire for Lower can help. "After just five faxed bookings this month, we'll
send You a Free Sony Colour TV", yells its advertisement. Hertz is only a little more subdued: "When you
make a pre-paid Hertz car rental booking for America, we'll give you a #10 voucher to spend in almost
any High Street store."

A careful study of the freebies on offer can even reveal when an airline's planes are emptiest. Icelandair, for example, gives agents a #10 Marks & Spencer voucher for selling a package on the daily afternoon flight to Reykjavik, but twice as much for steering customers towards the hard-to-fill evening departures.

And those are only the deals that are made public. Plenty of "over-ride" commission agreements are worked out privately between suppliers and agents. These require certain targets to be exceeded for bonuses to be earned. Sometimes agents will spilt the extra commission with the customer, in the form of reduced fares.

But often the passenger's blissfully unaware that the reason the agent was so keen to recommend a flight to Nirvana on Get You Thereways was as he or she was just one booking away from hitting the magical 15 per cent mark, applied retrospectively to earlier bookings.

The latest trend in incentivisation is for entire countries to offer cash to travel companies. Croatia subsidised holiday prices in 1997, and this winter Greece gets in on the action: "The Hellenic Tourism Organisation will offer financial support to UK tour operators looking to extend their programmes into Greece during the winter months," says Panos Argyros, the UK boss of the Greek tourist office.

Meanwhile, the old adversaries are still at it;  British Airways  Holidays takes a double-page spread in Travel Weekly to publicise a scratchcard promotion offering a week in Barbados. And Virgin Atlantic is promising "bigger cheque-in" by giving agents 10 per cent commission on flights, compared with the 7 per cent that is becoming prevalent among its competitors (notably BA).

"We've got to make sure we're out there," says Steve Ridgeway, of Virgin Atlantic, "and that people are looking after us - and that we're looking after them."

British Airways  says it intends to appeal against its #4m  fine by the EC.

HD       City & Business - Halo slips from Richard Branson. BY       By PETER KOENIG.

LP
Is Richard Branson a man of the people? A true friend to the consumer? That, over a long and successful career, is how he has positioned himself. Reading the news last week about his latest victory over British Airways,  that was clearly the story line the media was running with.

"BA  Fined #4m For `Dirty Tricks' Payouts" splashed the Evening Standard. "EU penalty is culmination of battle with Virgin," said The Guardian.

TD
The details go like this: until January, BA paid travel agents "fidelity  rebates" for steering customers to buy tickets for its flights. Two years ago, Branson complained about this practice to Brussels. On Tuesday, the  European Commission ruled that BA's fidelity  rebates violated EU  competition law, because they helped BA bolster its already dominant position in the market.

A cursory reading of this story would seem to make it open and shut. Virgin wears a white hat, BA a black. The news was great publicity for Virgin. It reminded readers of how BA stole customers from Virgin in the 1980s; how BA drove Freddie Laker out of business in the 1970s.

It polished Branson's image as a counter-culture icon - Virgin's as the airline of choice for right-on travellers. It reaffirmed Virgin's take on BA as a stodgy national carrier run by uptight stiffs in lingering thrall to batty Maggie Thatcher.

As we all know, however, you can't believe everything you read in the papers. The complexity of modern life is outstripping the resources of news organisations to get to grips with this complexity. Spin swamps not only the truth, but often even the pursuit of truth.

Branson is a case in point. The image is outdated. A closer approximation to the truth is that he started out as the genuine article - a 1960s counter-culture entrepreneur. Over the years, however, he has become a stylised version of his former self - a zillionaire businessman with lingering counter-culture values and tastes pressed by his ambitions to put his stale media profile into the service of hyping his ventures.

Forget David and Goliath. The real story about Virgin and BA is the story of two members of a dysfunctional family who continue to slag each other off in the misbegotten belief that the rest of us are still interested.

Evidence that Branson's posture and image in the world lags reality comes from the negotiations between London and Washington to update the Bermuda II treaty setting the framework for UK-US transatlantic air travel.

In recent years, Washington has prodded governments around the world to enter into "Open Skies" agreements in the name of free trade - which also just happen to serve the interests of US air carriers.

Some months back, the European Union's Transport Commissioner, Neil Kinnock, pushed for the EU to negotiate with Washington en bloc to maximise European leverage in the battle to reallocate routes and airport landing slots on either side of the Atlantic. Germany and several other continental European

Page 73 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
nations said no to Kinnock. They chose to enter into bilateral talks with Washington. A number of
European airlines also thought bilateral negotiations were the best route.

So the US concluded an Open Skies agreement with Bonn. It is now in a protracted game of bluff, feint, thrust and parry with London. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and Tony Baker, the senior civil servant at the Department of Transport, Environment and the Regions leading the UK delegation, have held on-again/off-again talks with their counterparts in Washington.

The Government's objectives are complex and partially contradictory. It wants to advance the interests of air travellers, push the commercial interests of UK airlines, and protect Heathrow's position as a key global aviation hub.

This boils down to raising the number of UK and US airlines with reciprocal rights to fly between the UK and US from two to three each. The sticking point has been the finite number of landing slots at Heathrow - and BA's reluctance to give up the large number of Heathrow slots it holds.

Linked to this issue is the issue of BA's strategic partnership with American Airlines - important if BA is to remain in the premier league of a consolidating global airlines industry. Washington is blocking a BA/AA alliance until it gets an Open Skies agreement with London that it likes.

As these complex negotiations have stuttered forward, Branson has used them to market Virgin. He has publicly called for an Open Skies treaty in the name of consumers. But he has also thrown sand in the talks by pressing for the right of Virgin planes to fly domestically in the US. He knows Washington will not accept this.

This is not just my opinion. One US negotiator told me there is no way Branson has the resources to compete in the domestic US market. "Virgin is the biggest opponent of Open Skies," the negotiator said. "It has nothing to gain - just more  competition. BA is not a big fan of Open Skies, either. But at least they get the alliance with AA out of a deal."

Prescott and BA chief executive Robert Ayling have held talks about how many Heathrow slots BA must give up in order for London to conclude Open Skies talks. But now, to complicate matters further, the Office of Fair Trading has weighed in. The quasi-independent OFT apparently has its own views on the competitive ramifications of an Open Skies agreement and a BA/AA strategic alliance.

So where's the truth, as opposed to the spin, in all of this? If BA wants to score against Branson, it can call his bluff. It could make the necessary concessions to the OFT, Prescott, and Washington to make an Open Skies deal happen before the US presidential election cranks up and the window of opportunity closes.

BA might even form an alliance with the real hero in this sorry saga - British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop. Ten days ago, Bishop blew a gasket. Frustrated by the shenanigans of Virgin and BA, he declared a pox on both their houses. He announced he was launching a media campaign to let the public know what was going on.

In full-page newspaper ads it will buy in the run-up to party conferences in September, BM plans to tell consumers that the price of a business-class return from Heath-row to New York could be cut by up to
#1,000 if an Open Skies agreement is concluded.

Will BA do it - call Branson's bluff? Sadly, members of dysfunctional families often choose the false safety of remaining in screwed up relationships to the risks of breaking free and starting over.

And Branson? There's trouble ahead. Tom Bower, the journalist who took on Maxwell and Fayed, is now taking on the Virgin chief. Last year, the Economist published a telling investigation into his brand-linked empire questioning its cash flow. Maybe it's time for Branson to extricate himself from the
dysfunctionality of his war with BA, and move on, too.

Angry agents claim they have been unjustly slurred following last week's Brussels ruling against  British    Airways  over its incentive payments to the trade.

TD
Retailers hit out at suggestions that the flag-carrier's override commission made them more likely to sell
BA than other airlines.

The reaction followed the  European Commission's decision to fine the airline #4.4 million for anti-competitive incentive schemes , which fell foul of EU competition law.
The ruling followed a complaint from Virgin Atlantic in 1994.
Virgin alleged that BA was  unfairly persuading agents to sell its products by offering discounts. Maersk DFDS Travel managing director Mike Carrivick said: The comments about agents not being
independent are absolute hogwash.

If that was the case,  British Airways  would have been filling its planes with high-yield passengers, not struggling as it is widely recognised to have been doing.
We have to deliver what the clients want, or they do not stay with us.

ABTA aviation committee chairman Sandy MacPherson (Voyager Travel) said: Comments which infer that we are likely to sell directionally based solely on commission are unfortunate to say the least.

Agents are a lot more professional than that, and it would be a very short-sighted way of running a business.

Following the EC ruling,  British Airways  leisure sales general manager Robin Hayes wrote to agents explaining that current marketing agreements excluding individual corporate deals would end on August
31.

Most business travel agents admitted the ruling had not been unexpected and they would simply have to find a new way of working with BA.

The general view was that small to medium-sized agencies which relied on overrides would be the worst affected.

American Express UK and Europe head of supplier relations Alan Coles said: We are going to have to look again at the way airlines remunerate agents in their home markets.

The new set of principles means there are still opportunities of getting rewards or revenues from BA on top of basic commission.

British Airways'  appeal against its #4.4 million  fine for operating its loyalty schemes over the past seven years will not be upheld, according to Brussels.

The European Commission told TTG that such a move by BA would be unsuccessful, despite the carrier's strong belief that it can win.

TD
BA worldwide sales director Dale Moss said: The airline believes that its business practices satisfy all the
competition rules that apply in the Europe and around the world.
The EC's pronouncement is wrong in fact and in law. Mr Moss is confident the decision will be overturned. But an EC spokesman said the ruling was irrevocable.
If we thought the decision would not hold in court, we would not have adopted it in the first place, he said. We do not take decisions if we are not convinced that they will hold water.
But travel industry lawyer Tim Robinson of Nicholson, Graham & Jones said the EC ruling was not cut and dried.
I would like to see the views of a competent court of appeal on this matter, he said.

BA has already lodged a complaint against eight carriers which it claims operate similar commission schemes.
Mr Moss said: Although we have been singled out, we are not the only ones who have to comply.

British Airways  was dealt another blow by the courts when it lost its fight against an order to pay #2.5 million to 65 French passengers held hostage by Iraq in 1990.

The French nationals were among 310 passengers on a flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur via Kuwait and Madras and were used as human shields by Iraqi forces.

After a tough annual general meeting and the EC ruling on commissions, it's safe to say that  British          Airways  has had better weeks.

What an interesting week it's been for  British Airways.  First, bosses had to face shareholders at the annual general meeting, having a go at BAA in the process.

TD
Then up pops the  European Commission to slap BA's wrist and dock its pocket money to the delight of
Richard Branson.

BA chief executive Bob Ayling took the opportunity at the agm to detail what he described as the toughest trading conditions for the airline for years.

He attacked suppliers, including BAA, for continuing with a cost-plus policy on charges when BA itself was facing passenger yield reductions and therefore expected suppliers' charges to follow suit.

As if that wasn't enough tough talk, with exquisite timing the EC announced the following morning the preliminary result of its investigation into alleged breaches of  competition law.
Following a three-year investigation and, in BA's case, in response to a complaint registered by Virgin
Atlantic in 1997, BA was ruled to have abused its dominant position over the last seven years.
The ruling stated that BA's use of loyalty bonus schemes good, old-fashioned override deals to you and I
persuaded travel agents to remain loyal to the carrier to the disadvantage of rivals.
BA has been a bit miffed over the whole affair, feeling that it has been singled out  unfairly.

It considers that other national carriers in a similar dominant home-market position have been doing exactly the same thing and cited Sabena in Belgium and Lufthansa in Germany.

The EC's response was basically that it had to start somewhere and the only complaint on the table was the one from Virgin.
So BA has submitted its own complaints and is to appeal against the EC ruling and  fine. Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the  fine.
It's 6.8 million euros, which is about #4 million.

Now you might consider that a pretty substantial wallet-emptying slap on the wrist except that the maximum fine under EC legislation is a staggering 10 per cent of turnover.
Even I can work out that in BA's case this would be ever so slightly more than #4 million.

Even the industry analysts who predicted that 10 per cent was obviously out of reasonable consideration were suggesting between #15-#25 million.

Perhaps someone from Brussels was at BA's agm and fell for the hard times bit because, in the scale of things, #4 million is half a decent footballer's transfer fee.

I can understand the Virgin Atlantic reaction, which is to bask in the justification it provides for its referral to the EC.
Page 78 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
At the same time Richard Branson continues to score more moral brownie points.
But I just cannot ignore the irony of the whole thing.
BA had all these performance-related bonus commission deals running for years and we agents loved it. Aware of the pending investigation, the carrier amended the schemes to what it imagined would be more
acceptable within the legislation.

But this upset all the agents who then switch-sold like mad to other airlines on premium traffic which has certainly not helped those yield figures that Bob Ayling is so concerned about.
It's an expensive loyalty scheme that not only alienates the participants but produces a negative benefit. One more thought.
Despite the leisure travel market changes of the last 12 months or so, we don't have a single similarly dominant leisure travel player.

But a complex monopoly may exist, producing the same dominant position in the market by a few major players rather than one.

So if the EC doesn't like airlines retaining business from agents by means of aggressive override commissions, how will it eventually, when it gets round to it, view exactly the same practice in the inclusive holiday market?
Of course if you own or part-own your agency or they are franchisees, then you don't have a problem. Where do I sign?

HD      British Airways' Ayling  Confirms BA is Ailing  and Demands Cost Cuts from Suppliers
WC    1,581 words

While British Airways  [BAB] is blaming slumbering "monopoly service suppliers" for increasing its costs
to provide global air service, some analysts question whether the airline's bottom-line problem was caused
by poor management decisions by its top officers.

BA's cost reduction demands came during its annual meeting July 13. Several analysts said management's comments only confirmed the already dismal outlook they have on BA's future.

TD
"We had been assuming things were awful, and they are," said Anthony Bor, a London-based analyst with Merrill Lynch. "BA's executives could have used the meeting to announce they had seen the light at the end of the tunnel. But they said the opposite, which only confirms most analyst's view that BA's situation is dire."

Analysts said bad ideas, such as management's decision to create a low-cost, no-frills subsidiary airline called "Go," which has failed to catch on in Europe, and actually competes with BA in a couple of markets, hasn't helped BA's bottom line.

Nor did the one-year-old marketing campaign to lighten up BA's stodgy image by, among other things, repainting cabins in vibrant colors and putting artwork and designs from around the world on its jets' tails, do anything but confuse the otherwise impeccable image BA had for providing high-quality service, said Holly Hegeman, an analyst with Plane Business. The campaign prompted some otherwise loyal BA passengers to opt for other carriers, she said.

BA announced in May it was altering its "multi-ethnic marketing campaign," and would once again adorn tails of its new airlines with paintings of Britain's Union Jack flag. The decision was applauded not only by BA passengers, but by harried air traffic controllers who found identifying BA's many unique tail designs a hassle, Hegeman said.

BA, which calls itself "the world's favorite airline," based on its carrying the most passengers on international routes, lays the blame for its current fiscal problems squarely on the cash registers of its suppliers and "monopoly service providers," such as airports and air traffic control operators. Whatever the reason, the ongoing financial struggle at BA has caused major brokerage houses to revise their forecasts of BA's profitability.

While admitting that the "problems buffeting  British Airways  are being experienced by most airlines in the world, not just us," BA Chief Executive Robert Ayling then called for suppliers to cut costs, even though most other major airlines have not as yet publicly issued such calls.

Ayling called for cost cutting with a reduction in capacity, rather than modest growth, in mind. Though BA has cut its original forecast of a 2 percent rise in capacity this year to a .6 percent increase, company chairman Lord Marshall has indicated a further reduction is possible, a move Bor said is necessary.

Having blasted the airline's suppliers and service providers for not having "woken up to the reality of the deregulating world," in a BA annual meeting address given July 13, Ayling called for cost cuts from the airline's suppliers and fee rollbacks from airport operators. Ayling's comments were headlined by BA as a "blistering attack on monopoly suppliers."
Suppliers must cut costs

Ayling bluntly told suppliers they will have to match the fall in passenger yields BA is experiencing. He told shareholders "we cannot allow a cost-plus mentality, now abandoned by the airlines themselves, to
Page 85 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
destroy our shareholder returns and to reduce consumer benefits ... From now on, we must see supplier cost reductions ... If the airline's yields fall by 10 percent, then our costs must also fall by ten percent."

While BA can pressure its suppliers and possibly achieve some cost reductions, by itself, most analysts believe it cannot expect to win major concessions from airports unless other airlines and/or governments unite in a concerted effort to rollback steadily increasing fees. The loss of duty free business in Europe is spurring a rise in charges, including a 35 percent jump in air traffic control fees in Portugal, six percent in Spain and 15 percent in Turkey and Hungary. Airport charges in Toronto have increased 25 percent.

"Getting suppliers and service providers to decrease their rates just isn't a realistic plan for cutting costs within an airline," Hegeman said. "Combine this strategy with his on-again off-again bizarre multi-ethnic marketing scheme and it seems Ayling is intent on destroying either BA or his career," she said.
Ayling's job appears safe

"Yet when asked by the press and investors about Ayling's job security, Marshall insists he has no intention of ridding BA of Ayling," Hegeman said. "It prompts many to wonder how far off course will BA fly before Marshall replaces the pilot?"

In its fiscal year 1998-99, ending March 31, BA reported an operating profit of US $707 million, down 12.3 percent from $806 million in fiscal year 1997-1998. Earnings per share nose dived 56 percent to US 31 cents, compared to US 71 cents the year before.

Clive Anderson, an air transport analyst also at the London office of Merrill Lynch, on July 1 issued his revised forecast on the airline, reducing his outlook on BA's pretax profit forecast from US $494 million to US $280 million for the airline's current fiscal year. In the same report, Anderson also reduced his expectations for BA's pretax profits for the 2000/2001 fiscal year from US $720 million to US $550 million.

"North Atlantic remains tough," Anderson wrote, referring to the increased  competition, higher costs, expanded capacity and lower fares for airlines flying North Atlantic routes. Anderson said he believes "near-term news flow" on BA is "likely to remain negative," but that the "longer term potential of BA's new
strategy and the scope of recovery" remains generally positive in Merrill Lynch's view. Anderson issued an overall "neutral" rating on BA stock.

"Notwithstanding BA's significant reduction in capacity growth in the current financial year, conditions remain very challenging in the short term, with ongoing yield pressure," Anderson reported. "With significant capacity increases from other carriers, the North Atlantic remains highly price competitive in both cabins. As seen in recent traffic statistics, European premium traffic remains weak. As a consequence, its negative impact upon mix is another depressant of yields."

Nonetheless, Marshall has said he expects BA's current fiscal year to be "defining" for the company. In his year-end report, Marshall said "having to report substantially reduced profit is tempered by the fact that significant progress has been made with our plans for long-term development." BA, Marshall wrote, "is embarked on a strategic path which is scheduled to lead, over time, to improved financial performance."

That improvement, however, probably won't begin until BA returns several of its jets to Asian routes from which they were taken after the Asian financial crisis decreased demand, Bor said. Like most other major airlines, BA rerouted some of its Asian planes to the North Atlantic as the European economy, while down, was still in better health than the crumbling financial systems in Asia. Now, with most Asian economies on the mend, Bor said airlines should immediately begin switching planes back. "But we don't see that beginning to happen until sometime in 2000."

One management decision that hasn't gone well is the creation of the discount airline "Go," which actually competes with British Air in some markets. Bor said that while he cannot prove "no cannibalization of BA's product has occurred due to Go, the impact has to be very small indeed."

"Go, after all, isn't doing well, and only competes with BA in a couple of markets, such as London," Bor said. "But even there, it operates from an airport on the other side of the city," in more of a middle to working class area, whose residents tend to fly only on discount airlines.

Discount tickets and discount airlines are the reason for the current pox on major air carriers plying the North Atlantic trade routes. Because airlines relocated so many jets from Asia, they had to lower prices, sometimes dramatically, to increase ridership to meet the vastly expanded capacity.
BA to Appeal  European Commission Anti-competition Ruling

British Airways  [BAB] is to file an appeal against a July 13 precedent-setting ruling by the  European       Commission over the airline's policy of rewarding travel agents for increasing sales of its tickets, according to sister publication World Airline News.

The decision, which resulted in a E6.8 million (US $6.9 million)  fine for the airline, had established a new set of industry principles that were expected to change European airline practices.

The latest step in a seven year investigation - initiated against BA by Virgin Atlantic - is a confusing tangent to the story. The Commission is under the impression that its ruling was made in agreement with BA. The British carrier, maintains that "the judgment is wrong in fact and law."
The appeal has surprised the EC Commissioner for  Competition Policy. A spokesman said even the  fine
was symbolic. But BA does not agree with the decision or the amount of the  fine. The case began in
1992, following a complaint by Virgin against BA for the flag carrier's commission structure, which
rewarded supposedly independent travel agents for selling its tickets.

From Mr Richard Branson.

Sir, Following David Marchick's article "Clearing the air" (July 14), I would like to point out that Virgin wholeheartedly supports genuine "open skies" across the Atlantic. Everybody would stand to benefit from more choice of destinations, greater  competition and lower fares.

TD
This prospect has been held hostage to  British Airways'  demand that no deal should be done unless it receives permission effectively to merge with American Airlines, an outcome that would restrict choice, reduce competition and increase fares. From the first day the BA/AA deal was announced, Virgin has urged successive British governments to keep it separate from "open skies" negotiations. We welcome the fact that the US government has obviously now reached the same conclusion.

Not only has every competition authority found the alliance to be anti-competitive, but last week the European Commission fined BA for abusing the dominant position it already enjoys. To allow an already dominant airline to increase its dominance would be folly.

Mr Marchick attacks the "archaic and antiquated rules" that restrict air services between the UK and US. We agree with him. But the impression he appears to create is that the UK is uniquely standing behind a barrier. Yet currently Virgin is trying to exercise its existing right to launch a new service to Chicago, but risks being blocked by the hysterical protests of United Airlines, which would face real  competition on the route for the first time. Furthermore, it is the US (not the UK) government that has a "Fly America" policy for its employees and contractors. It also bans UK companies from owning more then 25 per cent of a US airline, and restricts UK cargo carriers.

In John Prescott, Britain has a formidable negotiator. The UK is, after the US, the world's strongest aviation nation. It does not have to accept the unfavourable terms which the US has traditionally forced upon other less powerful nations. So let's make a fresh start and create genuine "open skies", not the one-sided US version.

The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that it had approved plans by  British Airways (BA) to buy its franchisee airline Cityflyer Express, subject to BA limiting its holding of take-off and landing slots at London's Gatwick airport.

season 2004.

The Government referred the deal to the  Competition Commission in January after BA had agreed to buy CityFlyer Express from a group of institutional shareholders, led by 3i Group, for #75m.

Stephen Byers, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, said that he had not yet reached a view on the precise level of slots to be limited after consulting with the  Competition Commission and the director general of Fair Trading (DGFT).

The Minister rejected imposition of an overall cap on BA's slot-holding at Gatwick, which was recommended by the Commission but not the DGFT, but has asked the DGFT to consult on the right level for the hourly cap and report back.

n THE European Commission yesterday fined German airline Lufthansa e10,000 for offering incentives to clients who use a specific computer reservation system (CRS), of which the airline is a major shareholder.

The Commission said this practice discriminated against users who subscribe to other booking systems.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union investigators have raided the offices of Coca-Cola Co. in four European nations on suspicion the company abused its position as the world's leading soft-drinks maker by offering retailers  unfair incentives to shut out competitors.

Coke on Thursday confirmed the EU had made "unannounced visits" to its offices Britain, Germany, Austria and Denmark over the past two days and had seized documents.

TD
"We were naturally very surprised by the raid. But we opened up our files and the materials the commission wanted to see and tried to corporate," said the chief director of Nordic Coca Cola beverages, Svend Ivan Petersen.
"But we do not understand the charges ... we have not done anything wrong," Petersen said.

A statement from Coke's London office aid, "We are cooperating fully with the investigation. We strongly believe the investigation will prove we are very much compliance with the spirit and letter of all competition laws."

The raids are a fresh blow to Coca-Cola in Europe as the company recovers from a health scare that led to its drinks being removed from stores in several nations after Belgian schoolchildren complained they fell sick from drinking Coke.

European Commission competition regulators will examine evidence gathered in the raids and could decide to launch a full-scale investigation into the suspicions that Coke was illegally offering retailers perks to boost its market share. Such an investigation would likely last at least a year.

Under EU rules, companies found guilty of infringing regulations governing fair business  competition can face fines of up to 10 percent of their turnover, although in practice  fines have been much smaller.
The European Commission made no immediate comment.

Commission was apparently looking for evidence Coke offered retailers incentives to increase sales and stop selling competing drinks. It was unclear if the EU executive acted on complains from one of Coke's competitors or from disgruntled retailers

The Commission last week  fined British Airways  6.8 million euros (dlrs 7 million) for offering similar incentives to travel agents. The EU executive also raided Belgium's Interbrew, the world's fourth largest brewer, last week to find out if it is using its dominance of the Belgian market to muscle out competitors.

Coke's position as the world's biggest soft drinks supplier has already brought it into conflict with European regulators.

The company scaled down plans to acquire operations from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes PLC after complaints from the EU Commission. French authorities have blocked Coke's attempts to purchase the Orangina soda brand from Pernod Ricard SA.

Regulation of business  competition is one of the few fields where national governments in the 15 EU
nations have handed over authority to EU head office.

The EU's outgoing  Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has raised the profile of his  antitrust regulators in a series of headline cases in recent years, including the imposition of conditions on Boeing's dlrs 15 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and handing down a record 200 million marks (102 million euros/dlrs 106 million)  fine on Volkswagen last year for restrictive sales practices.

Van Miert is due to step down in September after seven years in the job and has been pushing through pending cases before he hands over to Italian Mario Monti.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Just when Coca-Cola thought its European troubles were over, the European Union on Thursday confirmed it had raided Coke offices to learn if the world's biggest soft-drink maker was muscling competitors out of the market.

The raids are a fresh blow to Coca-Cola as it recovers from a contamination scare that led to its biggest product recall in history after more than 200 Belgian schoolchildren complained that Coke gave them headaches and nausea.

TD
Coke's second-quarter earnings dropped 21 percent, largely as a result of that recall.

European Union  Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert confirmed Thursday, "I have ordered my services to carry out dawn raids" at Coke offices in Britain, Germany, Austria and Denmark over the past two days to seize documents.
The investigators also seized records from three Coca-Cola bottling partners, Coca-Cola Beverages PLC in
London, Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages in Denmark and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke in Germany.

They were seeking evidence that Coca-Cola exploited its market dominance by offering retailers  rebates to shut out competitors.

Coke, and its Sprite and Fanta products account for about half of the soft-drink market in Europe, with PepsiCo a distant second. In many small neighborhood shops, Coke is omnipresent, and Pepsi and other competitors are hard to find.

"A dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the competitors' products," Van Miert said.

He said he suspected Coca-Cola had offered retailers  rebates for expanding sales and for stocking the whole range of Coke beverages.

The chief director of Coca-Cola Nordic beverages, Svend Ivan Petersen, said: "We were naturally very surprised by the raid. But we opened up our files and the materials the commission wanted to see, and tried to cooperate."
"But we do not understand the charges ... we have not done anything wrong," Petersen said.

Coca-Cola Germany said EU investigators searched its offices in Essen and Berlin "to look at internal records relating to business with retail distributors and other customers."
"As far as we are concerned, all  competition laws and guidelines have been observed," Coke spokesman
Klaus Hillebrand said in Essen.
Coca-Cola executives will be meeting on Thursday with beverage industry analysts in New York to discuss
Coke's global problems.

HD         ANALYSIS-Coca-Cola  faces lengthy  battle in EU. BY         By Amelia Torres

LP
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Reuters) - The investigation of Coca-Cola sales practices in the European Union is likely to lead to one of the most difficult and lengthy  antitrust battles ever fought by the U.S. beverages giant in the 15-nation bloc.

It also highlights the determination of the EU's  competition watchdog, the  European Commission, to hand back routine work to national authorities and focus on what it sees as serious breaches of fair business competition rules.

TD
EU regulators on Tuesday raided British-based Coca-Cola Beverages Plc, one of the U.S. company's bottlers, its Austrian subsidiary and two other bottlers in Germany and Denmark, on suspicion they were unlawfully tying up customers through attractive  rebates.
If conclusive, the probe could result in hefty  fines for the Atlanta-based company.

But Coca-Cola is expected to mobilise its armada of lawyers and fight hard to avoid a statement of objections - the Commission's next step, probably six months to one year down the road if it gets its way. Coca-Cola denied any violations.

"Coca-Cola is hugely profitable in a simple consumer product and some people may charge this is due to unfair tricks... There are many practices which might turn out anti-competitive, but it is hard to prove whether they do," said Bill Bischop, an economist with Lexecon Ltd, which specialises in  competition policy.
Coca-Cola had been in the Commission's sights for some time.

Earlier this year, outgoing  antitrust chief Karel Van Miert, who has been fearless in tackling big multinational companies, warned it against trying to bypass the EU executive in its attempt to take over parts of Cadbury Scheweppes.

The move would have added such popular brands as Seven Up and Dr Pepper to Coca-Cola's namesake brand, Sprite and Fanta.

Surrounded by antitrust regulators from around the world Coca-Cola gave in and settled for a less ambitious deal, but the new twist has left some legal sources wondering whether the Commission may have gathered some evidence against it during its preliminary Cadbury probe.

"I don't know whether this is just bravado to remind Coca-Cola who is the boss. But it is possible that in connection with the merger they came up against info (on sales)," a lawyer said.

The Commission would not say whether it had received complaints or whether it was acting on its own initiative.

Rebates are a normal practice accross the retail sector to reward brand loyalty and target sales. They can be illegal if a company is dominant and offers price discounts to dissuade distributors from selling a rival's products.

Page 98 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In practice this means it may make economic sense to charge a retailer that buys 1,000 units of a given product less than another who only buys 100 units, but there could be a problem if a company grants an extra discount to prevent the same retailer from buying any further quantities from other competitors.

"When you are dominant you have to move carefully. You have to be sure the discounts are justified by cost savings, not an attempt to lock up customers," Steven Kinsella, a lawyer with British law firm Herbert Smith, told Reuters.

The Commission last week  fined British Airways  6.8 million euro ($7.15 million) for abusing its position in Britain and offering extra commissions to travel agents.
Coca-Cola rebates have also been a target before.
In 1997, the company was found guilty of  unfair practices by French  competition authorities and  fined
10 million French francs ($1.60 million) after a six-year battle with France's Pernod Ricard.
Pernod Ricard tried earlier this decade to launch its own cola-flavoured drink after it was dumped by
Coca-Cola as its main partner in France.

The two companies have since made up and Pernod Ricard has tried to sell its popular Orangina brand to the U.S. company, but the deal also met resistance from the French authorities, adding to
Coca-Cola's recent list of regulatory problems. ($1=.9515 Euro) ($1=6.240 French Franc).

Move marks start of investigation into whether group is abusing position.

European Commission inspectors have conducted dawn raids at Coca-Cola premises over the last two days in a probe into whether the world's largest soft drinks maker is abusing its dominant position in
three European Union markets.

TD
The officials, investigating practices in Germany, Austria and Denmark, raided Coca-Cola offices in those countries and in the UK, where the company's main bottler for Austria has its headquarters.

The raids are the prelude to an investigation into whether the world's biggest brand name abused its position in those markets by offering retailers incentives to increase sales volumes, carry the full range of Coca-Cola products or stop selling competitors' drinks.

News of the probe is another blow to Coca-Cola in Europe, where it is recovering from a health scare that originated in Belgium last month and saw its drinks swept from the shelves in four EU countries. In May it was forced to drop plans to acquire the Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business in most of the EU after Karel Van Miert,  competition commissioner, sharply criticised it for failing to notify Brussels of its plans.

The probe marks an increasing interest by the Commission in the relationship between large suppliers and their distributors. The Brussels executive  fined British Airways  EUR6.8m ( #4.4m) last week for operating anti-competitive loyalty schemes with travel agents, and warned other airlines they could face similar penalties.

The Commission carried out similar dawn raids on Interbrew, the world's fifth largest brewer, last week as part of an investigation into whether the Stella Artois brewer was abusing its dominant position in Belgium.

Coca-Cola confirmed that the raids - which it described as "unannounced visits" - had taken place and said it was co-operating fully.

Commission officials yesterday stressed that the Brussels executive was only at the beginning of its investigation to establish whether there was sufficient evidence to launch a full case. If it did, and found Coca-Cola guilty of abuses, it could mean  fines of up to 10 per cent of the turnover of the businesses involved.

In addition to the Coca-Cola premises, Commission officials entered offices belonging to three anchor bottlers - companies that bottle its products and in which it has stakes.

These were Coca-Cola Beverages, the London-based bottler for central and eastern Europe, Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages, which is controlled by Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetraenke, the German bottler.
The Commission has also written to retailers and distributors to seek their views.

BRUSSELS, July 22 (AFP) -  European Commission inspectors carried out raids this week at Coca-Cola offices in Germany, Austria and Denmark and a bottling plant in Britain seeking evidence the world's largest soft-drink maker may be guilty of anti-trust violations, a European source said Thursday.

The object was to find proof the US group was abusing its dominant position in the carbonated beverage sector to steam-roll the  competition, said the source.

TD
Karel Van Miert, commissioner in charge of the  competition section, suspects Coca-Cola of using its market position to grant discounts to lock in distributors, said the source.
Such practices are contrary to European  competition regulations and Coke would be liable to heavy
fines if found guilty.

A Coca-Cola spokesman told the European Wall Street Journal: "We believe we are within full compliance of all competition laws and regulations and we are cooperating fully with the authorities."

Last week, the  European Commission fined British Airways  6.8 million euros (dollars) for offering discounts to travel agencies in abuse of its market position.

The European source said no infraction proceedings have yet been launched in the Coca-Cola case, but if the commission's suspicions are confirmed, a "statement of objections" would be sent to the company detailing the alleged violations, said the source.

The commission's inspections of Coca-Cola came six weeks after thousands of cans of the soft drink and others of the same group were recalled from retails shelves in several European countries after about 100 persons complained of illness after consuming the drinks.

HD       EU Raids Coca-Cola Bottlers Commission Says Sales Practices  May Have Hurt Rivals

Karel van Miert, one of the most active members of the departing  European Commission, is punctuating his career as its top  antitrust official with an investigation of the sales practices of Coca-Cola Co. bottlers.

Mr. van Miert confirmed Thursday that he had ordered raids this week at Coca-Cola bottlers in three countries, and he suggested the company had bullied its rivals.

TD
It was the latest of several investigations by the  European Commission, the EU's executive, into the operation of the Atlanta multinational, which still is reeling from the effects of a health scare in Europe last month, when about 250 consumers became ill after drinking its products.

"I have ordered my services to carry out dawn raids," Mr. van Miert said, adding that he was looking for "supporting evidence" that Coca-Cola and the bottlers in Europe were using illegal incentives and rebates to help their sales.

"Let me make it quite clear that a dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the competitors' products," Mr. van Miert said.

Meanwhile, the European Parliament took aim at one of Mr. van Miert's colleagues, the former EU commissioner for industry and technology, Martin Bangemann. The Parliament demanded that he reverse his decision to accept a board-level post with Telefonica SA, the Spanish telecommunications monopoly, which Mr. Bangemann was in charge of regulating.

Many members of the Parliament deplored his acceptance of the post when the commission's reputation was at its lowest ebb as a result of allegations of corruption that resulted in the commission's mass resignation. The Parliament also demanded that Mr. Bangemann be stripped of his pension and other benefits deriving from his office. The European Court of Justice was already investigating whether Mr. Bangemann should retain his pension.

The Parliament also called on the  European Commission to tighten food legislation to protect consumers after the Belgian dioxin affair. Members called for a law specifying minimum quality standards for animal feed.

As for Mr. van Miert, he appeared to be attempting a high-profile move before taking up an academic post in the Netherlands in September. He will be succeeded by the present commissioner for the single market and taxation, Mario Monti of Italy, who is expected by many to be equally tough on regulatory issues.

Last week, the commission  fined British Airways  PLC 6.8 million ($7.2 million) for offering illegal incentives to travel agents. It also raided Interbrew NV of Belgium to determine whether it was using its dominance of the Belgian market to muscle out  competition from rival beer brewers. The commission has challenged Coca-Cola several times. In May, the company dropped a decision to acquire the soft-


Page 103 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
drinks business of Cadbury Schweppes PLC in continental Europe after the commission warned that the deal could run afoul of EU  antitrust rules.

This time, Mr. van Miert said that the commission suspected Coca- Cola and key bottlers of "generally" offering illegal  rebates based on sales growth and on promises by retailers to stock the entire range of soft drinks produced by the company. He said customers were pressured not to stock the products of rival companies and added, "We have had indications that Coca-Cola is granting very significant promotional rebates in the form of price reductions or free products."

The raids were directed at so-called anchor bottlers, four of which are in the EU. Coca-Cola Co. holds a significant stake in the bottlers, which have exclusive rights to distribute the company's products in a given region. Officials visited the head offices in London of the Austrian bottler as well as premises in Germany and Denmark.

"We were naturally very surprised by the raid," the chief director of Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages in Denmark, Svend Ivan Petersen, was quoted as saying by The Associated Press. "But we opened up our files and the materials the commission wanted to see and tried to cooperate." He added: "We do not understand the charges. We have not done anything wrong."

A statement issued by the London office said: "We are cooperating fully with the investigation. We strongly believe the investigation will prove we are very much in compliance with the spirit and letter of all competition laws."

If Coca-Cola is found guilty of breaching  antitrust rules, it could be  fined 10 percent of its sales. The company's shares were down 25 cents at $62.3750 in late trading in New York

The European Commission has fined British Airways  $US4 million for breaching European Union competition rules, claiming the carrier had illegally given travel agents cash incentives to boost ticket sales. Complaints about the practice were brought to the EU by BA's arch-rival Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which said the payment system  unfairly restricted its sales. The EC said the penalty would be a warning to other companies operating similar systems.
... and BA  fined another $4million

TD
The French Court of Appeal has upheld a lower court order that  British Airways  pay $US4 million in compensation to 61 French passengers taken hostage after being flown into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait from London in August, 1990, just four hours after Iraq invaded the country. The lower court earlier ordered BA to pay the hostages varying amounts according to the time they spent in captivity. The French nationals
and foreign residents were among 364 passengers aboard the aircraft. BA argued it had no way of knowing the invasion was under way but the court said the carrier "laid its passengers open to the risk of war".

BRUSSELS, July 23 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. and three of its bottlers could face record  fines if the European Commission finds fault with their sales practices, but lawyers and analysts struggled on Friday to quantify potential damage.

"Fines could become very high. The maximum is 10 percent of turnover," European  Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, whose agents raided Coke offices earlier this week and seized internal files as part of a probe into suspected abuses of the company's dominant market position, said on Thursday.

TD
With Coca-Cola revenues forecast to exceed $20 billion this year, a maximum levy of 10 percent would far surpass previous fines imposed by European, or even U.S., regulators in cases of anti-competitive market behaviour.

Paying out $2 billion or more could cut Coke's projected 1999 profits of $3.5 billion by more than half, but analysts said such a devastating penalty was very unlikely.

"The normal European rule is that they can be  fined up to 10 percent of the turnover of the business...but no one has ever been hit anywhere near that," said a London beverage industry analyst at a major investment bank who asked not to be named.
Lawyers in Brussels called the 10 percent ceiling a theoretical limit only.
"The commission doesn't calculate the figure by reference to the maximum possible," one said.

He added that a more likely reference point could be Coke's European sales, which represented 21 percent of the firm's 1998 global turnover of $18.8 billion.
A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.
In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Coke stock, a component of the Dow industrials, finished
$1 lower at $62.

On Wednesday and Tuesday, agents for the commission raided the offices of three Coke bottlers in Germany, Britain, Denmark and Austria, adding to a series of European mishaps for the world's largest soft drink firm.

On Thursday, Atlanta-based Coke said it would cooperate with the commission but said it had not violated any competition law.

"We believe we are within full compliance of all  competition laws and regulations and we are cooperating fully with the authorities," the company said.

According to EU guidelines, 20 million euros ($21 million) is the basic  fine a company can expect when committing "very serious infringements," a term denoting horizontal price cartels and clear-cut abuses
of dominant market positions.

Page 107 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Yet British Airways  was fined only 6.8 million euros ($7.1 million) earlier this month for tying UK travel agents to its services, something that one Brussels lawyer called "a pretty flagrant abuse."
In comparison, German car maker Volkswagen was  fined 102 million euros ($107 million) in January
1998 - a record in the EU for a single company - in another sales practices case.

Many lawyers agreed that Coca-Cola could be in for a bigger shock, because it sells a popular consumer product and the probe into its activities covers several EU countries.
They also said fines could get much higher as the commission moves to unload more routine work on
competition authorities in the 15 EU states and concentrates increasingly on big cases.

"Brussels wants to be seen as an agency that looks after the big cases and pressures big fish as opposed to the national authorities that would pursue smaller fry," said Brian Hartnett, a lawyer with Squire Sanders and Dempsey.
While lawyers warned it was pure speculation to conclude that the Coke bottler raids would lead to
fines, they said that, if the commission had a case, the punishment would be severe.

Still, said Morgan Stanley industry analyst Michael Smith: "I don't think that any sort of  fine they could impose is going to be a meaningful change in the business" of Coca-Cola Beverages, one of the three bottlers hit by the raids.

CCB, based in London but active primarily in Eastern Europe, posted 1998 revenues of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.9 billion). The company referred calls to Coca-Cola, its majority owner.

The other bottlers visited by commission agents this week were Germany's Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke and Scandinavia's Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages, a joint venture between Coca-Cola and Danish brewer Carlsberg.

DRINKS giant Coca-Cola was yesterday at the centre of claims that it carried out a "dirty tricks" campaign to boost sales.
It is accused of offering retailers perks to sell its world-famous fizzy drink in preference to rival brands.

TD
European Commission inspectors carried out dawn raids on Coca-Cola offices in Britain and three other countries on Tuesday and Wednesday.

If the EC can back up its claims, the company could face a multi-million pound  fine - up to 10 per cent of its annual turnover.

The probe is another blow to the world's most famous brand name after millions of its cans were shelved in Belgium and France after contaminated drink was blamed for poisoning hundreds of schoolchildren.

"We suspect that Coca-Cola has offered three types of incentives, all of which are unlawful for dominant companies on any market," explained Karel Van Miert, the Commissioner in charge of enforcing European laws on  competition.

"Let me make it quite clear that a dominant company cannot indirectly bully competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the competitors' products. Fidelity bonuses are simply not on."
Commission officials seized files at bottling plants in Austria, Germany and Denmark as well as
Coke's London headquarters.

An EC spokeswoman stressed that Coca-Cola in Britain had promised not to give  unfair incentives two years ago.

Coke is accused of granting big price reductions or free products for supermarkets, the Commission claimed.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which controls half the world's soft drink markets, confirmed it had had
"unannounced visits" from the Commission, but denied it had not broken any law.

"We believe we are within full compliance of all  competition laws and regulations and we are co-operating fully with the authorities," a spokesman said.

Coca-Cola apparently takes rivalry seriously. A Manhattan office building owned by the corporation hands out Coke to anyone walking in with drinks by the competitors.

Brussels refused to say whether the investigation was sparked by a complaint by a rival company. But Virgin Cola spokesman Mike Berrisford said: "We have complained. They have lots of these complaints and from time to time they pick one up and run with it."

The probe is the latest in a series into illegal practices to stifle  competition. Last week  British            Airways were fined GBP4million for  unfairly encouraging travel agents to sell seats on its planes at the expense of Virgin Atlantic. There is also an investigation into the makers of Belgian beer Stella Artois.

TIP-OFFS from Virgin Cola and PepsiCo prompted the  European Commission to investigate allegations that Coca-Cola is "bullying" competitors.

TD
A complaint by its main rival, PepsiCo, sparked the dawn raids at Coke's anchor bottlers in Austria, the
UK, Germany and Denmark. A spokesman for PepsiCo in New York said: "Late last year we
expressed our concern about certain Coca Cola trade practices."

The Commission suspects that Coca-Cola is offering illegal volume and exclusivity incentives to retailers, aimed at pushing rival products off the shelves.

Karel Van Miert, Europe's  Competition Commissioner, ordered the raids, which targeted the London office of Coca-Cola Beverages. He said the company could face "very high"  fines - potentially up to 10 per cent of turnover.

Although the Commission must first prove the abusive practices, he added: "A dominant company cannot indirectly bully competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the competitor's products."

Richard Branson's Virgin Cola company told the Commission in 1996 that Coca-Cola was using its dominant position to expand shelf space in stores and eliminate competitors in the UK. Mike Berisford, Virgin Cola finance director, said the alleged illegal practices had parallels with the fidelity bonus scheme operated by British Airways  for travel agents.
Coca-Cola Beverages said it believed it was complying with  competition laws. Dawn raid, page 30

Successive governments have failed to strike the right balance between fostering  competition and setting workable rules to protect the consumer.

Over the past year the question of whether the UK economy is over-regulated has arisen repeatedly. High food and grocery prices have been blamed on over-restrictive planning rules, while the management consultancy McKinsey has linked the UK's low sustainable growth rate with regulation.

TD
Meanwhile the Competition Commission has suggested that a number of problems in markets as disparate as milk supply, offcourse betting and underwriting services stem from regulation, rather than the behaviour of companies. This leaves a nagging worry in more restless minds that something is wrong.

Well, something is wrong. All of this is the absolutely predictable result of decades of failure to strike the right balance between  competition and regulation. I use  competition as shorthand for the outcome: innovation, low prices, better service, investment, jobs and growth.

I do not mean that rules are somehow bad in themselves. Far from it. Some of them protect the very things we most value: clean air, privacy, confidence in our financial system, high quality broadcasting and social inclusion. The problem lies in where the balance has been struck.

What is needed if the balance is to be struck more wisely? The first step is to sharpen up  competition law itself. That has been done in the 1998  Competition Act, which will be fully in force from March 2000. The likely impact of this is already becoming clear.

The comments of John Bridgeman, the director-general of fair trading, on sanctions in the recent Volvo pricing case are illuminating. Today, Volvo has got off with a promise to do better. But from next year a company in a similar case could face a fine based on turnover - similar to the  fine imposed on British    Airways  in the Virgin case by the European Commission.

This is a huge difference in incentives that will help the UK economy enormously. But it is not enough. Throughout the land, hundreds of bodies with rule-making powers - including the government itself - sit down every day to make rules or enforce rules.

Very few have a duty to consider the effect of their decisions on  competition - in other words, the potential benefits or costs for consumers. Even fewer have their rule-making activities subject to effective scrutiny for their impact on  competition. And some - notably the professions - can have the new competition law disapplied altogether.

Left to themselves, these bodies deliver their statutory duties through regulation. What is the result? First is the dead-weight cost on the sector that is subject to the rules. More important is the differential impact. Often the costs of the rules weigh more heavily on the smaller and newer companies.

These are exactly the firms from whom we expect innovation, new ideas and improved levels of efficiency. It is easy to lose the beneficial effect of the threat of  competition on bigger companies if we disadvantage new entrants and smaller, nimbler companies. The number of suppliers of goods and services may be reduced by restrictions on who is allowed to supply.

I was asked by the chancellor to report on this issue in relation to financial services. In its proposed legislation, the government is correctly trying to expose the rule of the Financial Services Authority to competition scrutiny. My recommendations are about doing so better. In short, they are to give the FSA the task of striking the balance between competitive markets and prudential regulation.

The FSA is the body best equipped to exercise this difficult judgment. This means giving it an additional primary objective in relation to  competition. But we should keep Office of Fair Trading scrutiny in place and make the Competition Commission the final arbiter, rather than ministers. The government should not disapply the new Competition Act for financial services any more than is strictly necessary. Finally, it should allow the OFT and the Competition Commission to take account of the impact of the FSA's regulation when investigating or reporting on scale or complex monopolies.

But what about the rest of the economy? Are there too many, too wide disapplications of the new Competition law? How can we put in place appropriate scrutiny of the many rule-making bodies around the country? Indeed, how should we scrutinise the activities of the government itself? There is a terrible circularity in successive governments railing against the poor service in the UK compared to other countries, while making it inevitable through their policies.
There are a number of useful initiatives the government could take:

First, it should review which regulators should be asked - like the FSA - to take account of the trade-off between maximising  competition and achieving other regulatory objectives.

Second, it should challenge much of the disapplication of general  competition law contained in the schedules to the  Competition Act 1998. The status of the professions merits particular attention here.

Third, the government should focus on how regulation affects the dynamics of  competition, rather than simply looking at the static administrative costs of regulation.

Fourth, it should create a mechanism through the competition authorities for scrutinising statutory bodies that have the potential to distort competition by implementing new regulations. This would closely mirror the role of the competition authorities in the US, Australia and Canada and at European level.

Finally, independent  competition scrutiny should be extended to the activities of government itself. Proposed legislation and statutory instruments should be published in advance so the OFT's view would be available. This would inform parliamentary scrutiny, and the final decisions of ministers.

Much of this could be implemented quickly, at no great cost, and to good effect. It would take some time to work through the economy, and its success would depend as much on the incentives to change behaviour as on law. But if the objective is a higher sustainable growth rate for the UK, then this effort ranks in importance just behind securing a stable, low inflation, macro economic climate.

VIRGIN Atlantic chairman Richard Branson, characteristically leading from the front, promised unashamedly to "paint the town red" during the two-day party in Shanghai to christen the airline's new direct return flights between London and China's fastest growing city.

With more than a little help from 120 reporters, travel trade and tourism representatives, friends, Virgin staff, Branson's parents and son, they did just that in style and may have done more than any politician could to improve Anglo-Chinese relations after Nato's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade earlier this year.

TD
Indirectly bestowing his blessing on proceedings and the new route, Bank of England governor Eddie George showed his support by sampling the delights of the Upper Class cabin on both outward and inward flights carrying the partygoers.

Other paying passengers unexpectedly caught up in the fun included two Lloyd's Register systems trainers flying out to provide support to 140 staff in Shanghai.

On arrival at Shanghai airport on one of Virgin's newest Airbuses, named Diana, and a welcome from the secretary-general of Shanghai's municipal government Dao Shuming and British consul-general Warren Townend, Mr Branson spoke of Virgin Atlantic's excitement at serving Shanghai, "easily the world's most inspiring and dynamic city".

Its non-stop service would "allow us to introduce our unique approach to excellence and innovation in air travel and play a role in supporting and enhancing trade and tourism between our two great countries".
The team spirit was underlined when the party was greeted on the tarmac by Chinese football stars Fan
Zhiyi and Sun Jihai along with the Crystal Palace squad on tour in this football-mad country.

Over the next two days Mr Branson hosted high-profile celebratory events including a press conference in the world's tallest hotel, the Grand Hyatt, a spectacular rickshaw and mass cyclist arrival for dinner in Yuyuan Garden and Teahouse followed by Beijing Opera and acrobatics performances by children in the nearby theatre, lunch at the stylish M on the Bund restaurant, a pro-celebrity soccer match in the
Shanghai Stadium, a "Paint the town red" party in the Ruijin Guest House grounds, featuring a modelling
competition and live rock music, and late-night trips to the latest bars and discos.

The direct London-Shanghai scheduled service is the first between the two cities. Virgin Atlantic was awarded the route last December by the Civil Aviation Authority in preference to  British Airways.

With other leading carriers already running direct services from mainland Europe to Shanghai, it was not before time the Chinese and British authorities agreed to a successful British airline like Virgin operating this potentially lucrative route from Heathrow, Europe's busiest international airport.

Mr Branson allegedly first heard the news by fax while flying over Shanghai in a balloon. British transport secretary John Prescott rejected  British Airways'  appeal and Virgin Atlantic launched the twice-weekly service from Heathrow to Hongqiao Airport on May 22.

The planned celebratory inaugural party was delayed for seven weeks following the Nato incident, finally taking place during the week  British Airways  was fined millions of pounds by the  European                   Commission for illegal sales practices.

Brussels was alerted, after a complaint made by Virgin back in 1993 to the way BA abused its dominant position by offering travel agents kickbacks and cash bonuses to favour its flights.

Virgin's non-stop London-Shanghai flights, operated by a 255-seat Airbus 340-300 series capable of carrying 20 tons of freight, depart at 16.00 on Tuesdays and Saturdays, arriving next day.

Return flights depart at 12.15 on Tuesdays and Sundays, arriving the same day. Journeys take 10.5 to 11 hours depending on weather conditions.

Even though it spans five time zones, China uses one (Beijing) time right across the country, eight hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and seven ahead of British Summer Time.

Headline return fares are upper class #2,402 ($3,760), premium economy #1,324 and economy #549, plus #27.30 taxes.

Virgin says flights on average since May 22 have been 70% full and growing, with 30% of passengers travelling on business.

Passengers have not been predominately European or American. Virgin estimates that 50% are Chinese, and the number is increasing, with the airline promoting Britain as a leisure and business destination.
The Chinese perception of Virgin's operation is positive and, although the market is different from the
United Kingdom's, local agents are enthusiastic about Virgin's presence.

The airline is hiring several Shanghai cabin crew after a spirited response to its recruitment advertisements in the city and is encouraging businesses in the area to send their products to Britain on its planes.

These moves have helped to raise awareness of Virgin, demonstrate its partnership credentials and highlight its potential to offer opportunities to local people.

Pursuing its philosophy of starting first with the airline and record stores, then following with the rest, Virgin believes there is a big market in Shanghai.

With 13 million people, Shanghai is China's largest and most affluent port city, a temporary home and place of work for thousands of foreign nationals and fast becoming a global tourist attraction.
Beijing may make the rules, but Shanghai makes the money.

Virgin hopes to run daily flights soon and use the new airport, open this autumn, next year when four more slots could be awarded to British carriers, with  British Airways  likely to bid for two.

The recent agreement lets Chinese airlines fly to London direct, with China Eastern probably the first to do so. Virgin is discussing potential alliances, including loss-making Air China.

Virgin also flies London to Hong Kong direct.  British Airways  covers London-Beijing and Hong Kong direct.
Virgin and Shanghai were not the only ones to tie the knot. First officer Rick Hill and in-flight supervisor
Debbie Mason announced their engagement during the return flight.

BRUSSELS - Coca-Cola and three of its bottlers could be hit by record  fines if the European            Commission finds fault with their sales practices, but lawyers and analysts struggled yesterday to quantify potential damage.

"Fines could become very high. The maximum is 10% of turnover," said Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner. Commission agents raided Coke offices earlier this week and seized internal files as part of a probe into suspected abuses of the firm's dominant market position.

TD
With Coca-Cola revenue forecast to exceed $20-billion (all figures in U.S. dollars) this year, a maximum levy of 10% would far surpass previous  fines imposed by European, or even U.S., regulators in cases of anti-competitive market behaviour.

Paying $2-billion or more could cut Coke's projected 1999 profit of $3.5-billion by more than half, but analysts said such a devastating penalty was very unlikely.

"The normal European rule is that they can be  fined up to 10% of the turnover of the business, but no one has ever been hit anywhere near that," said a London beverage analyst who asked not to be identified.

Lawyers in Brussels called the 10% ceiling a theoretical limit only. One said a more likely reference point could be Coke's European sales, which represented 21% of the firm's 1998 global turnover of
$18.8-billion.
A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

On Wednesday and Tuesday, agents for the commission raided the offices of three Coke bottlers in Germany, Britain, Denmark and Austria, extending a series of European mishaps for the world's largest soft drink firm.

According to EU guidelines, 20 million euros ($21-million) is the basic  fine a company can expect when committing "very serious infringements," a term denoting horizontal price cartels and clear-cut abuses of dominant market positions.

Yet British Airways  was fined only 6.8 million euros earlier this month for tying British travel agents to its services, something that one Brussels lawyer called "a pretty flagrant abuse."

In comparison, Volkswagen was  fined 102 million euros in January, 1998 -- a record in the EU for a single company -- in another sales practices case.

Many lawyers agreed Coca-Cola could be in for a bigger shock, because it sells a popular consumer product and the probe into its activities covers several EU countries.

They said fines could get much higher as the commission moves to unload more routine work on
competition authorities in the 15 EU states and concentrates on big cases.

"Brussels wants to be seen as an agency that looks after the big cases and pressures big fish as opposed to the national authorities that would pursue smaller fry," said Brian Hartnett, a lawyer with Squire Sanders and Dempsey.

While lawyers warned it was pure speculation to conclude the bottler raids would lead to  fines, they said if the commission had a case, the punishment would be severe.

"I don't think that any sort of  fine they could impose is going to be a meaningful change in the business" of Coca-Cola Beverages, one of the three bottlers hit by the raids, said Michael Smith, Morgan Stanley analyst.

It was also revealed yesterday it was PepsiCo Inc. and Virgin Group Ltd.'s Virgin Cola unit that filed complaints with the EU and led to the investigation of rival Coca-Cola Co.'s dealings with retailers.

"This is a problem throughout Europe," Virgin Cola spokesman Jonathan Cutler said. "Coke's been strong-arming retailers, saying if they want to carry Coke [Classic], they also have to carry products that aren't strong sellers."

PepsiCo filed a complaint on June 1, said spokesman Richard Detwiler. He declined to provide further details. Virgin said its complaint was filed in 1996.

HD   SOFT DRINKS - EUROPEAN COMMISSION SUSPECTS COCA-COLA OF DISTORTING COMPETITION.

European Commission regulators seized some 10,000 pages of documents during raids on Coca-Cola Co offices in Europe on July 20. The company is suspected of offering  rebates to retailers to deliberately squeeze competitors out of the market in the UK, Austria, Denmark and Germany. The European Union's competition watchdog on July 22 also sent some 150 requests for information to interested parties, including distributors, retailers and distributors. There is no deadline to complete the investigation into Coca-Cola's sales practices in Europe but the next step is for the Commission to send a formal Statement of Objections if it concluded there were anti-trust violations after reviewing all the material and other evidence gathered. However, so far the Commission is being very tight-lipped about the value of the information seized.
The real thing!

TD
"I have ordered my services to carry out dawn raids in Austria, the UK, Germany and Denmark at the premises of the Coca-Cola Company's (TCCC) anchor bottlers", said Karel Van Miert, Acting European Commissioner for Competition. "The raids carried out on July 20 and 21 concern alleged infringements of Articles 81 and 82 of the EU Treaty (concerted practices and abuse of dominant positions - Ed.). We suspect that Coca-Cola, which has a share in these bottlers, might be dominant in the Austrian, Danish
and German markets respectively and might have abused its dominant position there. We suspect that Coca-Cola has in these EU Member States offered three types of incentives, all of which are unlawful for dominant companies on any market. Coca-Cola even committed two years ago to not using any of these in the UK market".
The Commissioner was referring to the following incentives:
- target/growth  rebates;
- full range/assortment  rebates; and
- exclusivity/de-listing payments.

In particular, the Commission suspects the first two types of scheme to be applied generally. The Commission said it also had indications that Coca-Cola is granting very significant promotional  rebates in the form of price reductions or free products which are sold by participating buyers, like for instance supermarkets, during promotions.

- For most Member States, TCCC has appointed a so-called "anchor-bottler"', who is often the only bottler for the entire territory in question and in which TCCC holds a significant stake. At present there are four anchor bottlers in the EU. Officials from the Commission's Directorate-General for  Competition (DG IV) visited the anchor bottlers for Austria (whose head office is located in the UK), Germany and Denmark. Coca-Cola produces not just Coke but such products as Fanta and Sprite. The relevant product market is either cola-flavoured drinks or carbonated soft drinks. -
Allegations.

The Commission must be able to prove any alleged abuses before taking a decision. The purpose of the dawn raids was to find supporting evidence. Following the  fine imposed on July 14 by the  European          Commission on British Airways  for abuse of a dominant position, the Commission is adamant that a dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully competitors by pushing its customers to buy less
Page 118 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of the competitors' products. According to European Court of Justice case-law, the only  rebates or incentives which a dominant company may grant are rebates which pass specific savings on to its customers. The most common example of an acceptable rebate to a dominant company's customer is a volume discount if indeed greater volumes are cheaper to supply to that customer. In fact, Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages (CCNB), which produces and markets Coke products in the Nordic region, acknowledged on July 22 that it engaged in certain retailer incentive practices, but said they were not in breach of EU  competition rules. Carlsberg, the largest brewer in Denmark, and a company which has made acquisitions in the brewing sector throughout the world, and Coca-Cola, set up CCNB as a joint venture in 1997. Carlsberg owns 51% of the venture and Coca-Cola 49%.

Virgin Atlantic boss Richard Branson has hit back at critics who accused his airline of hypocrisy over
British Airways'  fine from the European Commission (TTG July 26).
Virgin Atlantic is not acting hypocritically by offering sales incentives, he said.

TD
Of course we reward and incentivise the travel trade.

The problem arises where the airline, such as BA in the UK, has become so dominant that sales deals which would be perfectly legal from smaller competitors become anti-competitive because of the undue influence dominant payers can have on the travel trade.

Mr Branson referred to BA's old Performance Reward Scheme to illustrate how requirements to sell an ever-increasing value of fares would have meant agents virtually doubling the value of tickets they sell for BA.
He claimed that Virgin's deals were aimed at increasing  competition.

Meanwhile, BA sales representatives are meeting agents to consult them about new deals which must be in place by September 1.

ABTA aviation committee chairman Sandy MacPherson (Voyager Travel) is to meet Tiffany Hall, BA's head of UK and Ireland sales, as part of the consultation process.
He said he hoped the new deals would be simple and transparent. See p8.

Coca-Cola is still fizzling out in Europe. Last week EC inspectors raided company offices in Britain, Germany, Austria and Denmark as part of an investigation into whether the soft-drink giant was unlawfully coercing retailers into stocking its products over those of lesser known rivals. The raids are the latest in a series of probes by the European Commission into suspected violations of  competition laws. This month  British Airways  was fined GBP4.4 million for operating illegal loyalty schemes. If found guilty, Coca-Cola could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its European turnover. Said a London spokesperson: "We are cooperating fully... but we maintain that we are in full compliance with the law."

LP
Is Europe Inc. finally ready to give the U.S. a run for its money?

The race, of course, is far from over, but for the first time in several quarters, Europe's trudging tortoise appears to be gaining strength as the U.S. hare shows signs of tiring.

TD
The euro has rebounded. Business sentiment is surging in key European countries such as Germany, France and Italy. Strong July manufacturing surveys portray economies in recovery mode. And
second-quarter earnings offer proof that for several sectors at least, the slowdown wrought by the emerging-market turmoil of the past two years is over.

"Euroland seems to be emerging from the rather dark tunnel of gloom we were in for some quarters," says Gwyn Hacche, senior European economist with HSBC Markets in London.

All this is happening just as the U.S., which has enjoyed nearly a decade of uninterrupted prosperity, appears to be weakening somewhat. Last Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew 2.3% in the second quarter, more than a full percentage point below expectations. Signs of higher wages have also increased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again, cooling the economy further. But numbers released Monday showed that the U.S. still has room to grow without bringing on inflation just yet. The prices purchasers pay for materials in July was lower than expected.

Indeed, the slowing U.S. growth rate is still faster than the economic growth in Euroland, which is expected to be closer to 1.6% in the second quarter, but the gap is narrowing. "I'm not confident enough" to bet against the U.S., says Darren Williams, European economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in London. "But I am confident on the European side of the story -- we're looking at solid growth for the next
12 to 18 months."

For Europe's corporate chieftains, who have benefited from the U.S. demand for European exports in the face of sluggishness at home, the apparent upswing is happening just in time. "We had an excellent American first half, but it's more difficult to predict the outlook," says Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint Gobain SA, the French glass, ceramics and building-materials manufacturer. "I'm hoping that European growth will pick up in time to compensate for the inevitable slowdown in the U.S."

Rolf Breuer, chairman of Deutsche Bank AG, which recently completed its purchase of Bankers Trust Corp. of the U.S., is also more optimistic about prospects in Europe. Trading profit through the first half of the year already amounts to more than that from all of last year, the bank reported last week. "Provided the market turmoil of the past two years does not recur in the remainder of 1999," he says, "we should be able to present a good result for the year as a whole."

Europe's great expectations are also underpinned by the growing strength of the Asian economies -- particularly South Korea, Japan, and Thailand -- which is helping European exports. As a sign of confidence in the region, Danone SA, the French food group, recently announced plans to invest in Asian food companies to expand its activities in the region.

Even though the skies are clearing in Europe, most analysts are still somewhat cautious. Just last autumn, most were betting that the Asian and emerging-markets crises were going to finally bring down the U.S.'s resilient economy, and that Euroland would strengthen further as it adopted the single currency.

That miscalculation has led analysts to continue to trim their earnings forecasts for 1999. European companies are expected to report an 11% gain in earnings for 1999, according to a compilation of estimates for 1,063 companies in 15 European countries done by 140 analyst teams. That's down slightly from the 11.3% estimate made three months ago, and the 12% estimate done six months ago, according to Associes en Finance, the Paris-based research firm that tabulated the estimates.

And price pressure will continue to weigh on Europe's companies. In the past, stronger companies had more market clout to raise prices. But as deregulation continues in Europe, allowing for more competition in previously protected industries such as telecommunications, prices shouldn't rise as high as they might normally, analysts say. The result is that companies will have to focus more on cutting costs to remain competitive. In most cases, that will mean more job cuts, or at the least no new hiring, meaning Europe's high unemployment remains.

What follows is a sector-by-sector review of second-quarter earnings and the outlook for the coming months.
AIRLINES AND AEROSPACE

European airlines hit a strong downdraft in the quarter, buffeted by a combination of war in Kosovo, overcapacity, rising fuel prices and air-traffic control problems.

The European market was already declining from a strong 1998 when the Kosovo conflict exacerbated growing congestion in the skies. Europe's antiquated air-traffic control system has proved incapable of handling booming traffic, as carriers add capacity at rates above 10% annually. Those problems were augmented by a global shift of airplanes from the Pacific to the North Atlantic last year after Asia's economic crisis. The glut of planes flying between the U.S. and Europe has squeezed ticket prices at the same time business travel softened. The combined impact was a weak performance -- especially compared with the year-earlier period, which was one of the industry's strongest in recent years.

The big losers included Austrian Airlines and Alitalia, which suffered most from Kosovo. Analysts expect Alitalia to swing to an ordinary pretax loss of 88 billion lire (45 million euros) in the first half, compared with a record profit of 296 billion lire a year ago. Revenue is expected to fall 1.6%. Alitalia was also stung by startup problems at a new airport in Milan and air-traffic control problems.

British Airways  also took a second-quarter hit, which was part of what prompted it to announce that its capacity would barely rise for the year. Analysts expect  British Airways'  quarterly pretax profit to be slightly ahead of last year at about GBP 169 million (256 million euros), most of which will come from the sale of its stake in reservation system Galileo. Revenue is expected to fall 4%. On an ordinary basis, profits will be "little more than break-even," says Andrew Light, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.

The few winners in the industry are low-cost and regional players, such as RyanAir and Virgin Express, which are seeing their traffic increase by more than 20% annually by winning economy-minded passengers and avoiding some air congestion by using secondary airports. Low-cost Virgin Express should report second-quarter revenue growth of 4.6%, analysts say.
AUTOS

European auto makers presented a mixed picture in the quarter, with some showing signs of recovery and others offering surprisingly sluggish numbers.

Fiat SpA's quarterly pretax profit fell by more than half to 327 million euros, but in its letter to shareholders, Fiat suggested it had hit bottom in the quarter. "The overall results for the group are sure to improve in the second half of the year," it said.

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is likewise upbeat about its full-year prospects despite a grim quarter. The first fruits of a massive restructuring at the company's Rover unit and new product launches "lead to expectations of a significantly improved group result in the second half of the year," it said.

In the first half, BMW's net profit fell 27% to 191 million euros because of the planned phase-out of several volume models and a "dramatic decline in prices in the U.K.," Rover's main market, according to BMW.

But others were not so upbeat. DaimlerChrysler AG disappointed investors in reporting a 0.3% drop in net income for the quarter to 1.43 billion euros, well below estimates. The company's shares dropped
11% in Frankfurt and 18% in New York on the news, exasperating company officials. The company's tepid outlook for the rest of the year -- of profit growth being "in line" with revenue growth -- also came as something of a surprise.

Volkswagen AG is no more bullish. It remains "cautious" about its full-year outlook despite a 13% rise in sales and 1.7% gain in net profit in the first half of the year. The company's net profit rose to 845 million marks (432 million euros) on sales of 74.37 billion marks.

VW, like Fiat, is heavily exposed to South America, where weak demand and a weak Brazilian currency have depressed repatriated profits.

On the whole, European car sales are up, but profits can't seem to match the pace. Demand for new cars in Europe has been driven by a flood of new models, including replacements for three of western
Europe's most popular cars -- the Volkswagen Golf, Opel Astra and Ford Focus. That has helped VW, General Motors Corp.'s Adam Opel AG unit and Ford sell more cars in the first half, and will help Fiat with the launch of its face-lifted Punto in the second half, analysts say.

But whereas new cars are generally produced more profitably than their predecessors, notable improvements in productivity are largely being eroded by stiff price  competition. "The increasingly intense model, price and incentive  competition demands its tribute," says Markus Pluemer, chief auto-sector analyst at WestLB Panmure in Duesseldorf.
BANKS

European banks continued to show signs of recovery in the quarter from the turbulence of last year's second half. Robust financial markets fueled higher commission income, and margin pressure is beginning to ease in some countries.

Each of Spain's large banks reported improved earnings in the first half, helped by gains in net interest income and falling costs. Leading the pack, Banco Santander Central Hispano SA reported a 16%
net-profit gain to e802.83 million, mainly because of cost-cutting measures linked to the April merger of
Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano.

British banks so far have at least matched market forecasts, although interest margins remain tight and the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive, says Brian Crossley, banking analyst at ABN Amro in London. "We're quite negative on the mortgage banks as a sub-group," he says. "It's hard to see where the growth will come from."

Abbey National PLC lifted its first-half profit 17% to GBP 875 million, partly as a result of its strategy to diversify away from mortgages. The bank said its non-mortgage businesses accounted for a record 49% of group profit in the first half, compared with 45% at the same time last year. Among the larger U.K. commercial banks, Lloyds TSB Group PLC set the pace for its rivals with a pretax profit of GBP 1.85 billion, up 18% from a year ago and exceeding expectations. HSBC Holdings PLC said first-half earnings rose 10% to $4.07 billion (3.8 billion euros), helped by lower bad-debt provisions in Asia, especially Thailand and Indonesia. The bank said overall net-interest income jumped 4.6% to $5.91 billion.
Standard Chartered PLC, which also has a large Asia presence, is also expected to benefit from lower provisioning for the region.

Germany's Deutsche Bank AG reported a 19% jump in first-half operating profit to $1.92 billion, bolstered by a whopping 79% rise in trading profits to $2.15 billion. Offsetting this was the bank's continued inability to rein in expenses, which rose 26% to $5.94 billion, although this was mostly due to employee bonuses and costs related to its acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. "As long as our earnings are more than the bonuses we pay, it's good for shareholders," said Mr. Breuer, the Deutsche Bank chairman. Bayerische Hypo- & Vereinsbank AG continued to struggle with non-performing real-estate loans, but still managed
to lift overall pretax profit by 2% to 717 million euros.

Swiss banks UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG are due to report earnings later in August, but will likely enjoy a solid first half on the back of increased trading income, analysts say. Analysts will be closely watching UBS, however, for signs of a recovery in its private banking business after a stagnant first quarter.

In France, profits at Societe Generale, Paribas and Banque Nationale de Paris are taking a backstage role as investors await the outcome of the six-month-old takeover battle. Paribas reported a record 1.01 euros billion first-half profit, up 57% over the previous year, driven by strong gains in its corporate and investment banking division.

BASIC MATERIALS

The paper and pulp industry is recovering from a rough year, boosted by the fall of the euro and a rare balance between supply and demand for forestry products.

Just a year ago, financial turmoil in Asia severely hurt forestry companies across the globe, as paper and pulp producers in Southeast Asia unloaded their excess products in Europe and the U.S. Western producers saw prices drop and found themselves peddling their goods in markets they had previously left untapped, like the Middle East.

Now it's on to better times. With the fall of the euro, European producers have become more competitive, finding increased demand in Asia and elsewhere. Companies like Finland's UPM-Kymmene Corp. and Finnish-Swedish StoraEnso, both with large operations in Asia, have seen their exports to that region increase, and other producers have experienced a similar trend.

What's more, demand and supply for pulp and paper is more balanced than it has been in years, edging up prices for both products. Faced with low paper and pulp prices last year and in the first quarter, U.S. and Canadian producers stopped their paper mills several times in the second quarter. The diminished global capacity took pressure off  fine paper and pulp prices, pushing them up 8% and 13% respectively from the end of the first quarter.

The industry also feels the millennium effect more strongly than before. As printers around the globe are gearing up to produce a host of special Year 2000 publications, demand for paper has gone up
somewhat -- with a further increase in demand expected for this summer and fall, analysts say. "I used to be quite pessimistic about the rest of the year," says Oerjan Hallberg, an industry analyst with Handelsbanken Markets in Stockholm. "But things are looking good. Even the traditional weakness in demand during the summer has not happened."

European chemical companies continued to suffer in the second quarter, primarily from lackluster global trading conditions, heavy price pressure, and narrow profit margins. But the industry is cautiously optimistic. Demand is gradually recovering, signaling better times ahead.

Of companies that have reported second-quarter results, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said consumer expenditures are increasing again in key markets, and the economic outlook in Asia looks brighter than a year ago, though some parts of Latin America remain weak. "Against this background we expect to make further progress in the second half," said Chairman Charles Miller Smith.

ICI reported a 16% increase in net profit in the second quarter to GBP 88 million. ICI's second-quarter numbers benefited from cost cutting and restructuring.

France's Rhodia SA reported a 22% jump in first-half net profit to 138 million euros. Rhodia said the second quarter benefited from a "significant recovery" in demand and its restructuring program. Demand for chemicals is expected to rise in the coming months, but the improvement will be gradual, analysts say.

Conditions for basic chemicals likely will experience the longest dry run, analysts say. Profit margins in this sector were squeezed in the first half by the large increase in oil prices. Although basic chemical producers responded by raising prices, increases failed to prevent a significant erosion in profit margins. "Profit margins started to rise in June so we think the bottom has been reached, but this will take a while to affect earnings," says Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Peter Cox.

When steel producers release their second-quarter results in the coming weeks, earnings should be better than the first quarter, but 1999 clearly will be weaker than 1998, analysts say. The reason is "considerably lower prices," says Andrew Howard, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London. "There's lots of steel in the world."

Indeed, surplus steel from Asia and Eastern Europe changed the European Union's position in world trade as a net exporter of steel. In 1999, for the first time since World War II, the EU countries became a net importer as emerging-market producers poured steel into Europe. Faced with this situation, the European Steelmakers Association (Eurofer) filed dumping complaints with the EU Commission against a number of countries. A  European Commission decision is pending.

Prices crashed in the wake of the Asian crisis, but in the first four months of 1999, prices recovered as producers reduced production by around 20%. Prices increased by 5% to 10% in the second quarter. But, seeing their chance, European producers increased production. As a result, analysts say, prices will continue rising in 1999 as demand in Europe and North America remains strong, but increases will be at a lower level. The industry is now looking to 2000 for a return to significant profit growth.

COMPUTERS AND SOFTWARE

The second quarter continued to be dismal for Europe's largest software concerns, with Year 2000 concerns crimping sales.

SAP AG, facing a slowdown in its core market and  competition from hotter Internet startups, said net income fell 7% to e142 million. Sales rose 13% to 1.26 billion euros. Sales of new software licenses, a key performance indicator for the industry, slipped for the third successive quarter, falling around 15% in the second quarter, analysts estimate.
Since last autumn, Walldorf, Germany-based SAP and many of its peers such as PeopleSoft Inc., and
Baan NV have seen sales slip as companies defer spending on new software systems until after the
Year 2000. SAP was also slow to tap booming demand for corporate software that runs over the Internet,
an area in which it is scrambling to catch up.

"It could have been better but with regard to the major changes we see in our industry, I am quite happy that we hung in," said Hasso Plattner, SAP's co-chairman and co-founder. He is heading SAP's push to develop new Internet-related products.

Baan continued to disappoint, reporting a second quarter loss in line with expectations, but also said sales of its business software slid dramatically. The Barneveld, Netherlands, company, which is in the middle of restructuring, reported a net loss of $9.2 million in the second quarter, its fourth successive quarterly loss, compared with a $17.1 million profit the year earlier. Sales slipped 25% to $172.8 million.

In the U.K., Misys PLC also confirmed what most observers have long suspected -- that the software company faces a slowdown at the end of the year as banks shy away from tweaking millennium-ready systems. In reporting a pretax profit after one-time items up 39% to GBP 124 million for the year ended May 31, Chairman Kevin Lomax said the division faces "a potentially slower period." Some orders, he added, already are being deferred.

The slowdown is also starting to affect some computer-services companies, although not to the extent that some analysts feared earlier in the year.
Europe's largest services company, Cap Gemini SA, reduced its forecast for full-year revenue growth to
16% from 20% after its U.S. unit posted a 6% fall in first-half sales. The company said provisional net
profit before exceptional items for the first half of 1999 rose 59% to 706 million French francs (107 million
euros), from 443 million francs a year earlier.

The U.K.'s Admiral PLC disappointed investors for the second time in three months by cutting full-year forecasts this week after revealing staffing problems earlier in the year.

One bright spot in the European technology scene was the performance of its semiconductor companies, some of which are showing healthier profits after a three-year industrywide slump. Franco-Italian chip maker STMicroelectronics NV said strong demand from the telecommunications and digital
consumer-goods sectors boosted net income 26% to $122.5 million. Net sales rose more than 11% to
$1.19 billion, in line with analysts' expectations. "It's nice to see the market growing after such a long wait
for a recovery," said Pasquale Pistorio, the company's chief executive.

The chip industry is recovering from a longer-than-expected cyclical downturn that was caused by a glut for certain low-end memory chips, such as DRAMs, and was exacerbated by the Asian financial crisis.

At semiconductor-equipment maker ASM Lithography NV, first-half net income fell 95% to 3.5 million euros -- but that was in line with expectations. Purchases of equipment often lags the industry's underlying growth. The Dutch company's sales dropped 10% to 408 million euros.
CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING

Prospects of stronger European economic growth in the second half of the year have buoyed the outlook for the engineering and construction sector. Announcing first-half results that revealed few surprises despite the relatively sluggish pace of economic growth, industry executives said that they are now detecting signs of an upturn.

"Our base-order business is improving," says ABB Ltd. Chairman Goeran Lindahl, announcing a 12% rise in ABB's first-half group net profit to $715 million. Including a $124 million exceptional capital gain, ABB's bottom line was $839 million, up 32% from the first half of 1998. Base orders refer to orders worth less than $15 million each.

ABB, which makes everything from power-generation equipment to factory automation systems, is closely watched as a bellwether for industrial investment. "We are seeing more business requests for tenders especially for small motors, and those show improvement very early in the economic cycle," says Mr. Lindahl, referring to small electric motors used in factories and some consumer goods.

Similarly, Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of French glass, ceramics and building-materials manufacturer Saint Gobain SA, says he expects demand to pick up in Europe through the second half of the year, helping to offset a likely slowdown in the U.S. economy. Like ABB, albeit to a lesser extent, Saint Gobain also enjoys a role as an economic bellwether because it supplies a wide range of industries, including automobiles, construction, steel, oil, gas and petrochemicals. The group reported an 11% rise in group net profit for the first half, not including exceptional items, to e468 million. Mr. Beffa added that the company was on track to deliver his declared aim of increasing earnings per share by 15% this year.

Executives played down the impact of the euro's fall against the dollar through the first half. Mr. Beffa at Saint Gobain, for example, noted that taken over the first six months of the year, the dollar is close to the same level against the euro on average as it was against the euro's component currencies in 1998. However, he predicted the euro was likely to pick up somewhat in the second half.

Optimism for a stronger second half was mostly fuelled by hopes of an imminent economic recovery in Germany. Some companies also have their eyes on the need for reconstruction of war-battered Kosovo, but any early hopes of lucrative contracts have not yet materialized. "The reconstruction of Kosovo is not moving as fast as we would like to see it," says ABB's Mr. Lindahl, who has proposed setting up a
regional infrastructure authority that would help map the damage done to the region and pave the way for rebuilding.
FOOD AND DRINKS
Economic recovery in Asia and Europe are improving the prospects for the food and drinks sector. "Overall, the outlook is much better than it was at this time last year," says Doriana Russo, analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney in London. And the improvement seen in the second quarter should continue
through the year, analysts say.
Swiss food group Nestle SA pleasantly surprised markets by reporting first-half real internal growth of
2.1%, more than double expectations. Sales were flat at 22 billion euros, in line with expectations. The
company said sales had accelerated toward the end of the first half, and predicts that full-year sales and
profits will outstrip those of last year, when Nestle earned a net profit of 4.29 billion Swiss francs (2.69
billion euros) on sales of 71.75 billion francs.

Nestle said all its companies in Southeast Asia have started growing again, while Russia, Brazil and some Latin American countries are still struggling to pull out of their economic difficulties. Hard times in emerging markets battered Nestle last year, particularly in the last quarter. Nestle's flat first-half sales compare with a 4.1% increase at French food group Danone SA of France, where revenue rose to 6.85 billion euros.

Most drinks groups are continuing the positive trend begun in the first quarter. French luxury-goods and spirits group LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SA reported strong growth in the first half, with sales up 16% at e3.59 billion thanks to a jump in champagne sales and to Asia's economic recovery. With retailers and customers stocking up for millennium celebrations, champagne sales soared 33% to e550 million in the first half, while sales of cognac and spirits rose 2% to 323 million euros.

The group has confirmed earlier forecasts of a minimum 15% rise in operating profit for the full year, noting that its businesses are growing everywhere.

Diageo PLC, the world's largest drinks group, formed from last year's merger of Guinness PLC and Grand Metropolitan PLC, warned recently that "adverse" conditions in several European countries, including Germany, would affect overall performance of its spirits brands in Europe. It also said business in Latin America should report lower volume and operating profit than last year.

However, the company said conditions had improved in Asia after last year's downturn in consumer spending and confidence, which slammed Diageo's premium brands like Johnnie Walker. Diageo said that while volume in Asia is expected to be down year-on-year, operating profit will rise.

French drinks group Remy Cointreau SA reported a 12% rise in revenue to 1.44 billion French francs from 1.29 billion francs for the quarter ended June 30, with champagne sales posting record growth of
45% to 253.9 million francs from 175.2 million francs a year earlier. Remy Cointreau also noted continued recovery in cognac sales for the quarter, up 14% at 377.2 million francs. The company attributed the rise to higher sales in the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea.

INSURANCE

Life insurers are the bright spot in the insurance industry. Concerned about the future of state pension schemes, Europeans are increasingly turning to life insurance and other long-term investment products -- and that means double-digit growth for many life insurers, analysts say.
The market cheered last month when Legal & General PLC reported that first-half profit rose 13% to GBP
194 million and showed that its margins had actually risen. That came as a surprise because investors in
the U.K. worry that competing insurers might be more willing to go after lower-margin business in the
rush to take advantage of the growing demand for longer-term products.

Less promising, Prudential PLC, the U.K.'s biggest life insurer, said its first-half operating profit fell 19% to GBP 372 million. The decline, which was expected, came largely from the company's stepped-up investment in its nine-month-old Egg telephone and online banking unit and continuing restructuring. The company said it expected sales to continue to rise in the second half, after new business rose 40% to GBP 5.9 billion. "We hope we can maintain our performance so far in the second half," says Jonathan Bloomer, Prudential Corp. PLC's finance director and deputy chief executive. "Some of that depends on the general economic climate and the development in interest rates, but so far the economy is moving along."

Tough competition and cut-rate premium prices continue to hurt the profits of European property and casualty insurers. Though few have reported second-quarter earnings, analysts say there's no reason to believe that the conditions that have dogged non-life insurers in recent years have changed. "There is still too much capital chasing too little business," says Chris Rathbone, analyst at Williams de Broe. If insurers are lifting profits, analysts say, it's through their investment returns or cost-cutting.

In Germany, where conditions have been especially tough, Allianz AG reported that pretax profit at its domestic non-life insurance business had risen only slightly to 1.1 billion marks. Premium income for its non-life business remained at 11 billion marks, stifled by low premiums in auto and industrial insurance. The company said premiums will probably decline in the second half.

Profits at U.K. non-life insurers aren't likely to fare any better this year than last, when a slew of claims from ice storms and bad weather hit companies hard. A mid-April Australian hailstorm and other, smaller catastrophes have pelted U.K. insurers' bottom lines so far this year. And while premiums in auto insurance look as if they're on the rebound, "they're coming off an extremely low level to begin with,"
says Mr. Rathbone. "It's going to be downbeat for non-life insurers for a very long time still."
OIL
Europe's oil companies are expected to report lackluster results for the second quarter, much like their
U.S. counterparts have already done.

That might seem strange at first glance, given this year's recovery in the price of crude oil -- the North Sea benchmark Brent blend crude, for instance, averaged about $15.92 a barrel in the second quarter this year, up from $13.88 a year earlier. But falling margins for refining crude oil into useful products such as gasoline provides the explanation.

Refinery margins in northwest Europe, for instance, actually slid into negative territory, with 56 cents being lost on every barrel refined, contrasting with a positive margin of 79 cents a barrel a year earlier, according to a report by Commerzbank AG. A glut of oil products -- major companies have already slashed refinery runs by some 20% -- and rising feedstock costs, namely higher-priced crude oil, don't help matters. The glut isn't expected to end for many months, at the earliest, and could continue into next year, putting pressure on earnings for the remainder of this year.

But cost-reduction programs undertaken by major oil companies will help offset some of the pressure, as the savings start kicking in later this year, analysts say.

Lucy Haskins, an analyst at Commerzbank, says that Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP Amoco PLC, two of the world's three largest oil companies, "might just manage to scrape up some gains." She expects Shell's net income to rise about 1% to $1.56 billion for the second quarter, and BP Amoco to report a 3% rise to $1.24 billion. Her estimates are on the high end of industry estimates.

The best performance may be recorded by the Italian oil giant ENI SpA, which has the lion's share of the domestic products market and an extensive gas business. Analysts expect ENI to report operating income growth in the low double digits to more than 835 million euros.

The two major French oil companies, Elf Aquitaine SA and TotalFina SA, are locked in a takeover battle. TotalFina is expected to show a slight gain in net income. Elf Aquitaine has told analysts that its net income might be down significantly because of poor products and chemicals margins.
PHARMACEUTICALS

Roche Holding Ltd. and SmithKline Beecham PLC proved that a new, blockbuster drug is the best way to rejuvenate sales -- and a company's stock price.

Sales at Roche's flagship pharmaceutical division surged 14% in the quarter to 4.22 billion Swiss francs, fueled by the growing appetite for Roche's obesity medicine Xenical. Analysts caution that it's still too early to predict exactly how big Xenical will become -- but sales are running at an annualized rate of 750 million francs, the level Roche had expected to reach after five years on the market.

SmithKline's drug division posted a 16% rise in quarterly operating profit to GBP 330 million, on an 18% sales jump to GBP 1.3 billion. During the quarter, SmithKline registered the first sales of a promising new diabetes drug, Avandia. Analysts at Merrill Lynch believe Avandia sales will climb rapidly, reaching $2 billion by 2003, and fueling double-digit sales growth at SmithKline over the coming three years.

By contrast, Glaxo Wellcome PLC is struggling to achieve its forecast for double-digit sales and profit growth this year. The giant British drugmaker's pretax profit edged up 7% to GBP 1.33 billion. The numbers disappointed the market, which drove down the company's stock price by 10% on the day of the news last week.
Overall, Europe narrowed a trans-Atlantic growth gap in prescription medicines during the early months
of 1999: Sales growth in major European countries surged by 8% in the 12 months through April, from an
anemic 4% rate that prevailed six months ago. Still, U.S. prescription drug sales continued to steam
ahead at a 12% pace during the same period.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

European phone carriers' profits have come under increased pressure as competitors cut prices. For former monopolies, the newly unleashed competitive forces are proving to be particularly troublesome.

Two giants, British Telecommunications PLC and Deutsche Telekom AG, reported lower-than-expected profits. British Telecom's pretax profit for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 rose 6.8% to GBP 772 million. BT was expected to report profit of GBP 800 million, according to analysts' consensus estimates.

Revenue jumped 17% to GBP 4.99 billion, but the increase was offset by higher costs incurred to acquire mobile-phone customers and payments made for terminating calls on other operators' networks. Sales from domestic calls grew a modest 3.2% to GBP 1.29 billion, partly reflecting a 25% reduction in the cost of calling a mobile phone from a regular telephone. The international calling business reported an 8.3% increase in revenue to GBP 390 million.

The former monopoly suffering most at the hands of competitors is Deutsche Telekom. In the first half of the year, the company saw net income fall 4.5% to 950 million euros, owing to aggressive price cuts aimed at fighting the  competition. Many analysts had expected the net-income level to be flat compared with the year-earlier period. Revenue fell 5% to 16.7 billion euros.

Among phone equipment makers, Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson reported lower-than-expected earnings for the first half. The Swedish company was hurt by delays in launching new mobile-phone models. Ericsson's pretax profit in the first six months dropped 44% to 4.26 billion kronor (485.3 million euros). Analysts had expected profit of 5.01 billion kronor. Revenue rose 12% to 92.38 billion kronor.

By comparison, rival Nokia Corp.'s net income surged 59%, buoyed by mobile-phone sales. The company said it may exceed its overall revenue target for the year. The Finnish mobile-phone maker reported net income of 581 million euros, in line with analyst expectations. Total revenue jumped 45% to
4.49 billion euros.

HD            Van Miert leaves challenging competition legacy for Monti. WC           920 words

LP
The annual August shutdown is upon us. The European Union's institutions are on holiday and the decision-making vacuum is made worse this year by the absence of a functioning  European              Commission.

Commission president Romano Prodi's team does not take up the baton until September, provided the European Parliament agrees, and Jacques Santer's commission, which resigned ignominiously earlier this year, hung on into July in a caretaker role, but is now more or less moribund.

TD
Yet the calm is deceptive. Outgoing  competition commissioner Karel van Miert fired off such a barrage of investigations into abuses of dominant position, cross-border cartels, price fixing, illegal state aid and hidden subsidies that governments and business alike are reeling from the onslaught. His final act, and the one that grabbed the most headlines worldwide, was a dawn raid on Coca-Cola.

EU investigators arrived unannounced at the offices of the US drinks giant and associated bottlers in four European countries and confiscated documents. Their mission: to search out alleged abuses of the company's dominant position, offering incentives to retailers to stock only Coke's products.

It seemed particularly uncompromising, given the damaging health scare the previous month which had prompted several countries to ban sales of Coke products until recall measures had been carried out.

But it was a logical move just one month after the commission had  fined British Airways  almost GBP4.5 million (about HK$56.5 million) for similar offences - and quite in line with the tough van Miert image.

Mr van Miert had, after all, dared to move against Coke before, imposing  fines for its failure to seek clearance from Brussels for its proposed acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes. And he had previously flexed his muscles against American corporations, winning concessions from Boeing over its handling of the merger with McDonnell-Douglas.

On top of that, he had  fined Volkswagen for uncompetitive sales practices and generally ensured that the biggest companies and their political backers in European capitals took the EU seriously.
But the move against Coke was only part of Mr van Miert's activist agenda for his final weeks in office. He opened an investigation into the commercial arrangements for Formula One racing, to the disgust
of sponsors, racers and even governments. He launched an inquiry into the German post office and
its alleged use of monopoly profits from Europe's most expensive letter-post service to make strategic
acquisitions abroad ahead of next year's privatisation and to cross-subsidise its loss-making parcel
service.

He also took on the German Government over hidden aid to Germany's public-sector banks. These institutions, which account for 50 per cent of the country's banking sector, usually have as their single shareholder either the Land - one of Germany's 16 states - or a regional or city administration.

When one of the largest state banks, Lower Saxony's West LB, required an increase in capital to comply with the Basle Convention's capital-adequacy rules, the state government tried a novel approach.

Instead of having the bank issue new shares and risk either a dilution of its shareholding or an injection of new taxpayer's cash, the state transferred the capital of its low-cost housing scheme into the bank's coffers.
That was in 1991. The move was copied by six other states.

But the commission cried foul and Mr van Miert finally decided the case last month, ruling the money was a state subsidy and demanding the bank repay 808 million euros (about HK$6.77 billion). The decision has implications for the public banking system across Germany and Austria, and the German Government is outraged.

Meanwhile, Bonn's state aids to industries in the former East Germany, long tolerated by Brussels as legitimate support for restructuring, have come under attack, as Mr van Miert imposed a repayment of aid on one steel firm, which may be forced to close as a result.

But, while the commission's previous tolerance of Germany has evaporated along with Germany's own acceptance of its decades-long role as EU paymaster, Mr van Miert has not been afraid to step on other nations' toes.

The competition directorate last month launched a formal investigation into the financing of public broadcasters in Italy and France, where cash injections, loans and subsidies are the order of the day, and private broadcasters regularly find themselves outspent and outbid by government money.

The move is only one step away from an investigation into the whole system of public funding for broadcasters, including licence fees - an area where Britain's BBC is particularly vulnerable.

But with Mr van Miert about to hand over the baton to his successor, Mario Monti, has he launched all his initiatives into a limbo where they will gradually fade away like so many restless but enfeebled ghosts?
The answer is probably no. Mr Monti is one of the few commissioners to survive from the Santer
team. Until now, in his role as commissioner for the internal market, he has taken on the EU's biggest
governments over duty-free sales and won, beaten industrial leaders such as Glaxo Wellcome into
submission over differential prices in member states and manoeuvring Britain into a corner on taxing
savings.

Mr Monti is no punch puller. Provided he wins the support of other commissioners - and it's a big if - the present calm will be no more than a lull in the typhoon.

HD     BA Fined In U.K., No U.S. Impact. BY     Kate Rice

NEW YORK -- The  European Commission's decision to  fine British Airways  7.8 million euro (about U.S. $6.5 million) for paying override commissions to British travel agents should have no immediate impact in the U.S. The EC said the override commissions were an abuse of BA's dominant position in the United Kingdom.

British Airways  immediately appealed the ruling after it was announced last month, saying that its business practices satisfy all the  competition rules that apply in the European Community and around the world and that the EC was wrong both iii fact and in law.

TD
"The company's policy is to give travel agents the chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets. This is normal business practice," said Dale Moss, BA's director of sales.
BA will continue its reward-by-performance in the U.S.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has also investigated whether or not overrides are
anti-competitive as recently as last March. Despite the fact, many industry observers consider a U.S.
equivalent to the EC's decision unlikely.

Chris Dane, CTC, president of GEM, said BA faces strong limits in the U.K. because of its market dominance there. However, he said, BA's override payments were typical of airline practices around the world.

But, he said, there is a difference between the U.S. and U.K. markets. One is that no single airline dominates the U.S.; none has more than 23 or 24 percent of the market--as compared to BA's marketshare of nearly 40 percent in the U.K.

"Having incentives for people to perform is an American way of doing business," Dane said. He said the strongest action he would expect U.S. regulators to take would be to require travel agencies to disclose such airline agreements to customers.

WHATEVER you do, don't mention 'fidelity  rebates' around British Airways'  Heathrow headquarters.

The airline was recently  fined Pounds 4.4m by the  European Commission for offering these incentives to travel agents. It is appealing against the decision.

TD
Next month chief executive Bob Ayling will launch something completely different. These will be
'bonuses' for travel agents who provide 'value-added' services -such as prominently displaying
British Airways  brochures.
Brussels allows this.
BA is also considering partly reversing the cut in travel agents' commissions from 12pc to 7pc, made
18 months ago.
Travel Weekly reports that commissions will rise to 10pc next month.

British Airways  denies any imminent change. But admits it will introduce a new regime next April and raising commissions is an option. The shares slipped 1p to 391 1 /2 p, their lowest level since February.
