BRUSSELS--The  European Union will impose a 13.661-million-euro ($17.07 million) fine on three water-management companies for operating a cartel in products used in heating, cooling and sanitation systems, it said in a statement Wednesday.

The companies involved are  Flamco, Reflex and Pneumatex, and the antitrust case brought against them by the EU watchdog refers to anti-competitive behavior in several EU member states from June
2006 to May 2008.

TD
Pneumatex will not be fined as it reported the cartel to the  European Commission and therefore enjoys protection under EU whistleblower rules.

The fines imposed were reduced by 10% because "the companies concerned acknowledged their participation in the cartel and their liability in this respect," the EU statement said.

"Most European consumers use one of the products sold by this cartel, often as part of their heating installation," said  Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, Joaquin Almunia.

The three firms were in collusion violating EU competition law mainly in Germany, the biggest market, but also for briefer periods of time  Pneumatex and Reflex were engaging in similar activity in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, the UK, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark.

The European Commission decided, on 27 June, to  fine two producers of water management products
- Flamco and Reflex - a total of €13,661,000 for operating together with  Pneumatex a cartel on the
German market. Pneumatex was not fined.

Between 2006 and 2008,  Flamco, Reflex and Pneumatex coordinated the prices for water management products, used in plumbing systems, heating and refrigeration on the German market. For a period of three months,  Pneumatex and Reflex also coordinated their prices in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, the UK, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark. The cartel members informed each other through bilateral contacts of the amount and date of planned price increases and exchanged sensitive market information. These practices are contrary to EU competition rules, which ban cartels and restrictive commercial practices.

TD
The Commission said that "the  fines take into account the companies' sales of water management products in the markets concerned by the cartel and the very serious nature of the infringement". The fines were set on the basis of the EU's 2006 guidelines and were reduced by 10% because the enterprises in question recognised their participation in the cartel and their responsibility.  Pneumatex received full immunity from  fines under the 2006 leniency notice for having revealed the existence of the cartel to the  Commission.

The fines are as follows: Flamco GmbH, Flamco Holding B.V.,  voestalpine Polynorm B.V. and voestalpine AG (Flamco): €3,870,000; and Reflex Winkelmann GmbH & Co. KG and Winkelmann Group GmbH & Co. KG (Reflex): €9,791,000.

Brussels, 28/06/2012 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday 27 June, the  European Commission decided to impose fines on a number of producers of water management products used in heating, cooling and sanitation systems, for breaching EU antitrust rules that outlaw cartels and restrictive business practices. It nonetheless reduced the  fines imposed by 10% as the companies concerned acknowledged their participation in the cartel and their liability in this respect.

TD
Flamco and Reflex were fined a total of €13,661,000 for operating together with  Pneumatex a cartel on the German market from June 2006 to May 2008. Also, during a three month period, to autumn 2006, Pneumatex and Reflex coordinated their prices in France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark.
