German shares added to their gains on Friday after Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, won a vote of confidence in parliament. While his victory was widely tipped, markets had expected a close vote, which prompted fears of a snap general election.

European bourses were broadly higher, with oil stocks leading the way following a rebound in crude prices.

At 1150 GMT, the FTSE  Eurotop  300 index was up 9.22 at 1,256.71.

FRANKFURT's blue-chip Dax index rose 61.97 to 5,068.30, while the Neuer Markt's Nemax 50 index added 9.69 to 1,241.36.

Allianz, the insurer, bounced 1 per cent after falling sharply over the past two days after the company raised its forecast for claims related to the September 11 attacks. Munich Re gained 0.9 per cent.
Technology stocks were mixed. Siemens rose 2.4 per cent and Epcos 0.8 per cent, but Infineon shed
2.1 per cent and SAP fell 1.7 per cent.

Volkswagen rose 2.1 per cent following reports earlier in the week that the carmaker was unlikely to increase its stake in Scania, the Swedish truckmaker.
MAN, which emerged as a possible bidder for Volvo's 45.5 per cent stake in Scania, rose 1.1 per cent. PARIS edged higher, with oil group TotalFinaElf gaining 2.9 per cent. The oil sector was under pressure
in recent days after Opec delayed planned output cuts and made them dependent on reductions by
non-cartel producers.

Technology, media and telecoms stocks were hit by profit-taking after a strong run this week. Lagardere fell 2.8 per cent, Cap Gemini 1.9 per cent and Dassault Systemes 1.3 per cent. Heavyweight France Telecom shed 0.8 per cent.

Usinor, the steel group, fell 11 per cent after it said would discuss with its Spanish partner Aceralia the terms of the offers for their planned three-way merger with Arbed, the Luxemburg-based steelmaker. Aceralia shares in Madrid were suspended, while Arbed fell 4.6 per cent in Brussels.
The CAC 40 index rose 16.10 to 4,593.38.
ZURICH slipped back as financial stocks ran into profit-taking after making gains through the week. The
SMI index fell 11.7 to 6,533.1.
CS Group and UBS both fell 0.8 per cent, while Bank Julius Baer eased 1 per cent.

Roche, the pharmaceutical group, fell 0.6 per cent after reports on Thursday that the company faced a record fine by the European Commission for fixing the price of  vitamins.
LONDON powered ahead after an uncertain start, with the FTSE 100 index rising 73.8 at 5,312.0.

Oil stocks moved sharply higher, with BP up 5.2 per cent, Shell Transport 3.7 per cent and Enterprise
Oil 4.9 per cent.
British Airways rose 6.9 per cent amid optimism that it would benefit from lower fuel prices.

Hays, the support services company, rose 6.9 per cent after it won a GBP30m, seven-year contract to provide human resources for Liverpool Victoria Friendly, the mutual fund.

But BHP Billiton fell 4.7 per cent after its Australian-listed stock fell sharply overnight. Resources stocks have been in demand recently amid a sharp rally in base metals prices.
International Power also fell 4.7 per cent as investors booked profits after Thursday's strong advance.

U.S. a while ago. And Europe has been investigating the same cartel. And tomorrow we`ve learned that
the European Commission is going to be asked to impose a record fine, much higher than the previous
fine, previous record of $750 million, on Roche (URL:  http://www.roche.com/) of Switzerland, BASF (URL:
http://www.basf.com/) and a group of other smaller chemicals companies for fixing the market in  vitamins
over a number of years.

HAYS: How big of a market is this, Andrew? You just told us the size of the  fine, I mean, I`m just curious how this stacks up overall?

HILL: I`m not sure how big the overall market is but it`s clearly one of the biggest cartel cases that the commission has had to handle. The previous  fine - biggest fine was for a shipping cartel, something in the range of $200 million. And the market itself was also one which the U.S. looked at, as I say, and in that punishment they also jailed one of the Roche executives. So it`s been viewed pretty seriously on both sides of the Atlantic, this  cartel.
HAYS: Wow,

FRANCIS: As everything that Mario Monti does, is viewed. How do we put this in perspective of Monti`s carrier as a trust-buster in  Europe?

HILL: Well, he`s clearly come to prominence here in the U.S. for what he did on GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) -Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) earlier this year. On cartels, he is making a start here. He said very clearly that he wants to clamp down on cartels. And in the U.S. there`s clearly perception that  European companies have a bit of a habit of getting into these cartelized organizations. He said he`s going to break these things up and this will be clearly be seen as one big step in that direction.

HAYS: Looks like you`ve got some information on that possible management change, but not one that is being made all that willingly?

HILL: That`s right. At Deutsche Bank, the big German bank, Rolf Breuer, who`s the chairman of the management board, you remember German companies have these two-tiered boards. He said he was going to step down next year in May. But we`re learning that he`s under a lot of pressure to hand over to Joseph Ackerman (ph), his successor, before then because the share prices dropped very sharply this year, 55 percent down. And Breuer is stirring up some discontent among other board members. Even hinting that he might not get elevated to become chairman of the larger supervisory board, which is the
next step for people when they step up from being the chairman of this management board. So a little bit of a reshuffle possibly and prospect at Deutche Bank we`re hearing.

FRANKFURT, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected to impose record  fines on Wednesday totalling over 850 million euros ($754.6 million) on several chemicals firms for fixing the price of vitamins, the Financial Times reported.

Sources with knowledge of the situation told Reuters last week that record  fines would be imposed as early as this week.

TD
The penalties come on top of billions of dollars the firms have already paid in  fines and settlements in the United States arising from an illegal  cartel that forced consumers around the world to pay more for nearly everything containing  vitamins.
Switzerland's Roche would be  fined 462 million euros and Germany's BASF 296 million, the FT
reported.
BASF declined to comment.

"We cannot comment on this until we have received official notification from Brussels," a spokeswoman said.
At least six other companies would be  fined on Wednesday, the FT added.

BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday announced a record  fine
of 855 million euros for eight distinct price-fixing cartels in vitamin products.

The two largest fines were 462 million euros for Roche and 296 million  euros for BASF for fixing the price of vitamins, costing consumers billions of  euros.

TD
"This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

The other companies  fined were Aventis of France - 5.04 million euros, Solvay - 9.1 million  euros, Merck of Germany - 9.24 million  euros, Daiichi of Japan - 23.4 million euros, Eisai Co of Japan 13.23 million euros and Takeda Chemical Industries 37.05 million  euros.
The conspiracies involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E Beta Carotene and vitamin premixes.

The fines are on top of billions of dollars the firms have already paid in record  fines and settlements in the United States, arising from an illegal  cartel that forced consumers around the world to pay more for everything containing  vitamins.

The new European Union fine exceeds that imposed on the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement of ocean shippers in 1998, which totalled 272.9 million  euros ($240.9 million). ($1=1.674 Swiss Franc) ($1=1.133  Euro).

U.S. consumer sentiment bounces up in November

NEW YORK - U.S. consumer sentiment rose in November, market sources said on Wednesday, as hopes for an economic recovery by next year overshadowed worries about job layoffs and an economy that has likely slipped into recession.

TD
The University of Michigan's closely-watched consumer sentiment index rose for a second straight month to 83.9 in November from 82.7 in October. That was higher than consensus forecasts for 83.5 and was up from a preliminary reading of 83.5 released two weeks ago.

Economic storm clouds again over  Europe, Japan

LONDON - Economic storm clouds gathered again over  Europe on Wednesday as a key survey showed German business sentiment at an eight-year low while the European Commission slashed its official growth forecasts.

In Britain, what one economist described as "shockingly bad" data showed a big drop in business investment and in France figures showed that consumers had drawn in their horns in October following the attacks the previous month on U.S. cities.

U.S. jobless claims fall in latest week

WASHINGTON - The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week for the fourth straight week to its lowest level since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government said on Wednesday.

Initial claims fell to 427,000 in the week ended Nov. 17, a period shortened by the Veterans Day holiday, the Labor Department said. The decline of 15,000 from a marginally revised 442,000 the prior week brought initial claims to their lowest level since 393,000 in the Sept. 15 week.

KPN in $4.4 bln cash call as posts Q3 loss

AMSTERDAM - KPN Telecom, the debt-crippled Dutch operator, said on Wednesday it planned to go cap in hand to shareholders and launch a five billion  euro ($4.41 billion) cash call as part of a rescue restructuring.

News of the huge share issue, reported by Reuters on Tuesday, knocked KPN's stock more than 11 percent lower at the start of trade. But the stock had stabilised three percent lower at 5.83  euros by
1200 GMT as the market agreed that a looming cash crisis left the group with few alternatives.

UK's Sainsbury sees boost from refits

LONDON - Britain's second-biggest food retailer, J Sainsbury Plc, began to reap the benefits of massive store investment on Wednesday as first-half profits before an array of one-off costs showed a modest gain on rising sales.

Pre-tax profits for the period ended October 13 rose 3.2 percent to 309 million pounds ($438 million) on turnover up 8.4 percent to 9.6 billion pounds, within analysts' expectations. The dividend was held at
4.02 pence.

Barnevik steps down as ABB chairman

ZURICH - Percy Barnevik, the man who created  Europe's biggest electrical engineering group ABB out of the 1988 merger of Swedish and Swiss firms, stepped down on Wednesday to take the blame for ABB's share price plunge.

Barnevik, 60, was once hailed as a business strategy guru as he implemented a decentralised structure at the globally active group. But lately he became the target of investor criticism over ABB's sluggish profits and share drop.

BERLIN - German Finance Minister Hans Eichel fended off calls from his Social Democrat comrades to introduce economic stimulus programmes on Wednesday, saying strict  euro-zone budget rules meant the cupboard was bare.

EU gives nod, but steel merger still undecided
PARIS - Regulators gave conditional approval to a plan to create the world's largest steelmaker on
Wednesday, putting the onus on Usinor and two partners to patch up a last-minute dispute to save their
$3 billion merger.

U.S. stocks sag, but upbeat data stem losses

NEW YORK - Stocks ticked lower in early morning trading on Wednesday, as worries about the near-term health of the economy and earnings resurfaced, while investors eyed a mixed batch of corporate news.

"We've had a tremendous rally from the Sept. 21 lows ... so I think you're seeing some of the more active traders realize some of those profits," said Erik Gustafson, portfolio manager at Stein, Roe & Farnham.

FRANKFURT, Nov 21 (Reuters) - BASF AG said on Wednesday the 296 million euros ($260.3 million) fine imposed by the European Commission for its part in a vitamin price-fixing cartel was not covered by provisions set aside for a penalty.

"We had made provisions for a  fine but this unreasonably high  fine exceeds the provisions we had made," a spokeswoman for the German chemicals group said. BASF was one of a number of companies fined a total of 855 million  euros by the Commission for what it called the most damaging series of cartels it had ever investigated.

BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission delivered a bitter pill to the world's top vitamin makers on Wednesday, ordering them to pay a record 855 million  euros in fines for operating a price fixing cartel.

In a move which raised the firms' global liability to three billion  euros ($2.64 billion), the Commission said it was the gravest violation of the EU's antitrust laws.

TD
"This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in announcing the record fine.

The fines are on top of more than $2.1 billion (2.39 billion  euros) the conspirators have paid in the United States to the federal government, individual states and private plaintiffs - and the suits there are not over.

The Commission named Roche of Switzerland as the cartel ringleader and fined it 462 million euros. Its top follower was BASF of Germany, which was fined 296 million euros.
The conspirators met secretly in a series of cartels that involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E,
Beta Carotene and vitamin premixes found in everyday goods like cereals, biscuits, juices, milk, animal
feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Monti said the cartel added to consumers' costs of every product containing  vitamins and to the bottom line of the cartel participants, especially Roche, which had 50 percent of the overall market.
Roche said in a statement it had worked closely with the EU Commission "since the (price-fixing)
agreements became known." It was Roche's second offence, after it was  fined in the United States in
1997 for an earlier vitamin  cartel.

Roche said more than 8,000 of its managers had taken part in a training programme to ensure they followed national and international laws, especially antitrust laws.

The firm that worked most closely with the Commission was Aventis of France, which blew the whistle on Roche and the others.
FULL IMMUNITY

The Commission said Aventis was granted full immunity in regard to its participation in the  cartel in vitamins A and E because it was the first company to cooperate with the EU's executive and provided decisive evidence in the case of these two products.

But Aventis did not give the Commission evidence on all  vitamins. It was  fined 5.04 million euros for passive participation in the vitamin D3 infringement.



Page 23 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Other firms facing  fines are Solvay of Belgium - 9.1 million  euros, Merck KGaA of Germany - 9.24 million euros, and Japan's Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd - 23.4 million  euros, Eisai Co - 13.23 million euros, and Takeda Chemical Industries - 37.05 million  euros.

The new European Union fine exceeds that imposed on the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement of ocean shippers in 1998, which totalled 272.9 million  euros ($240.9 million).

Both Roche and BASF said they were considering whether to appeal. If they appeal the firms need bank guarantees for their  fines and will owe interest if they lose.

The fines arise out of the rich pickings provided by the  cartel, Monti said. He said that in 1995 when the cartel was in its heyday, vitamin C produced revenues of 250 million  euros for the firms but in
1998 after the conspiracy ended they dropped off to 120 million  euros.

It took the European Commission two and a half years to reach its decision after the United States acted.

Monti said such probes could be streamlined if the United States and EU had agreements to share confidential information like one between the U.S. and Australia. But the Commission first has to work out trades of confidential information among the 15 EU member states.

"I see this as a longer term, ambitious, not particularly easy objective," he said of a U.S.-EU agreement to share confidential data.

BRUSSELS - The European Commission is today expected to impose record  fines totalling 850 million euros on Roche of Switzerland, BASF of Germany and several other companies for a
nine-year conspiracy to control the  vitamins market.

The Brussels regulator is believed to have found that Roche, which is expected to be  fined about 460 million euros ($648-million), and BASF, which is set to pay nearly 300 million euros, played
important roles in a  cartel to fix the price for some of the most popular vitamins in the world.

At least six other companies are expected to receive smaller  fines totalling 90 million.

The European competition directorate is expected to recommend the  fines for approval by the 20 commissioners today. The commissioners have the power to change the level of the  fines but usually agree with the advice of nation's

London (Platts)-21Nov2001/829 am EST/1329 GMT The European Commission on Wednesday fined
eight companies a total of  Euro855-mil ($751.4-mil) for participating in eight "market-sharing and
price-fixing cartels" affecting vitamin products, an EC press release said. Swiss company Hoffman-La
Roche and Germany's BASF were hit with the highest fines, with La Roche  fined Euro462-mil ($406-mil)
and BASF  fined Euro296-mil ($260-mil). Other companies fined for participation in the cartels included
Japan's Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd (Euro37-mil; $32.56-mil); Japan's Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd
(Euro23.4-mil; $20.6-mil); Japan's Eisai Co Ltd (Euro13.2-mil; $11.6-mil); Germany's Merck KgaA
(Euro9.24-mil, $8.1-mil); Netherlands' Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV (Euro9.10-mil, $7.9-mil); and France's
Aventis SA (Euro5.04-mil, $4.4-mil).

TD
London (Platts)-21Nov2001/831 am EST/1331 GMT The EC said each  cartel had a specific number of participants and duration, although all operated between September 1989 and February 1999. Because Hoffman-La Roche was an instigator and participated in all the cartels it was given the highest cumulative fine, the EC said. "This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of  vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

LONDON, Nov 21 (AFP) - The European Commission (EC) was Wednesday expected to impose record fines totalling 850 million euros on Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche, German chemical group BASF and several other companies for a nine-year conspiracy to control the  vitamins market, The Financial Times reported.

The EC is believed to have found that Roche, expected to be  fined about 460 million euros (405 million dollars), and BASF, set to pay nearly 300 million  euros, played important roles in a cartel to fix the price for some of the most popular  vitamins, the paper said.

TD
At least six other companies involved in the  cartel are expected to receive smaller  fines totalling 90 million euros, added the business daily.

CORRECTION: ATTENTION - ADDS BASF considers appeal

LP
BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (AFP) - The EU Commission imposed on Wednesday a record  fine of 855 million euros (761 million dollars) on vitamin producers, including BASF and Roche, found guilty of operating a price cartel.

The commission fined Roche 462 million euros and BASF 296 million  euros for their parts in a conspiracy to fix the price for some highly popular  vitamins.

TD
Both Roche in Basel, Switzerland and BASF in Ludwigshafen, Germany, said they might appeal.
Of the 13 companies concerned by the EU investigation, eight received  fines. In addition to Roche and BASF, three Japanese groups were sanctioned.
They were; Takeda, ordered to pay 37.05 million  euros, Daiichi (23.4 million), and Eisai (13.23 million).

The German company Merck was hit with a fine of 9.24 million  euros, Solvay Pharmaceutical, a Dutch division of the Belgian group got a 9.1-million-euro fine, and French group Aventis was ordered to pay
5.04 million euros.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said it was the most damaging group of practices that the
Commmission had ever investigated.

They covered an entire range of  vitamins found in many products including cereals, biscuits, drinks and other edible items, pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, and animal feed, he added.

In Basel, Roche said it was studying the decision and might appeal, saying it had cooperated fully with the commission since the price fixing had come to light.
And in Ludwigshafen, BASF said it had not expected "a  fine of this amount." The German said it believed the  fine was "inappropriately high".
"We will carefully review the reasons for this decision. We will then decide if we'll lodge an appeal with the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg within the two-month legal time limit," it said in a statement.
"We have cooperated with the European Commission throughout the investigations."
Members of the  cartel, which was active worldwide for 10 years, have already been hit with heavy  fines
in the United States, and some company directors have been given prison sentences.
Roche was fined 500 million dollars in May 1999, BASF ordered to pay 225 million dollars, and the  cartel
also agreed to pay more than one billion dollars in damages to US clients.

LP
BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (AFP) - The EU executive commission imposed on Wednesday a record  fine of 855 million euros (761 million dollars) on vitamin producers, including BASF and Roche, found guilty of operating a price cartel.

The commission fined Roche 462 million euros and BASF 296 million for their participation in a conspiracy to fix the price for some highly popular  vitamins.

TD
Both Roche in Basel, Switzerland and BASF in Ludwigshafen, Germany, said they might appeal.
Of the 13 companies concerned by the EU investigation, eight received  fines.

In addition to Roche and BASF, three Japanese groups were sanctioned -- Takeda, ordered to pay 37.05 million euros, Daiichi, 23.4 million, and Eisai, 13.23 million.

The German company Merck was hit with a fine of 9.24 million  euros, Solvay Pharmaceutical, a Dutch division of the Belgian group got a 9.1-million-euro fine, and French group Aventis was ordered to pay
5.04 million euros.
"This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated," said EU Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement.

That, he added, was "due to the sheer range of  vitamins covered, which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics".

Monti estimated the cost to consumers in the millions of  euros. When a vitamin C  cartel ceased to operate in 1995, he noted, prices fell and industry revenues declined by more than 50 percent on the European market.

In Basel, Roche said it was studying the decision and might appeal, saying it had cooperated fully with the commission since the price fixing had come to light.
And in Ludwigshafen, BASF said it had not expected "a  fine of this amount." The German firm said it believed the  fine was "inappropriately high".
"We will carefully review the reasons for this decision. We will then decide if we'll lodge an appeal with the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg within the two-month legal time limit," it said in a statement.
"We have cooperated with the European Commission throughout the investigations."

The eight companies have three months to pay the  fines, which taken together amount to one percent of the EU's total budget.

While appeals would give the companies breathing space on payments, added interest would be due if a higher court upholds the original penalty.

To date, the biggest  fine levied by the Commission had been 272.94 million  euros in 1998 in connection with price fixing for maritime transport in the North Atlantic.
Members of the vitamin  cartel, which was active worldwide for 10 years, have already been hit with heavy
fines in the United States, and some company directors have been given prison sentences.
Roche was fined 500 million dollars in May 1999, BASF ordered to pay 225 million dollars, and the  cartel
also agreed to pay more than one billion dollars in damages to US clients.
Monti told journalists that criminal penalties should not be expected in  Europe in the near future.

"There is more progress to be made" in anti-trust legislation before courts could consider handing down jail terms, he said.

HD                WRAP: EU Fines Vitamin Makers $755.1M For Price-Fixing

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission fined eight chemical and pharmaceutical companies a record-setting 855.22 million euros ($755.1 million) in a vitamin price-fixing scheme that lasted nearly a decade.

The largest  fine was given to Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., which was seen as the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the price-fixing scheme, the European Union's ruling body said Wednesday. Germany's BASF AG (BF) received the second-largest fine of 296.2 million  euros.

TD
The commission said a striking feature of the infringements was the central role played by Roche and BASF, the two main vitamin producers, in virtually each and every  cartel, while other players were involved in only a limited number of vitamin products.
Both Roche and BASF said they may appeal the hefty  fines levied against their companies.

In a statement, Roche said it has "fully cooperated with the [European]  Commission since these practices came to light." Such efforts include its implementation of a special corporate training program to "reinforce its commitment to conducting business in full compliance with all local and international laws," as well as a special monitoring team in its corporate internal audit department.
Roche also said its  fine is covered by provisions made in 1999.

BASF, meanwhile, called the  fine "inappropriately high" and said it plans to closely examine the reasons behind the penalty decision. The company said it will decide within two months whether to appeal.

Other companies  fined by the commission included Japan's Daichii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (23.4 million euros), Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. (37.1 million euros) and Eisai Co. Ltd. (13.2 million euros), as well as Germany's Merck KGaA (9.2 million euros), France's Aventis SA (AVE) (5
million euros) and Belgium's Solvay SA (9.1 million euros).

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a prepared statement.

"The companies' collusive behavior enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits," Monti said.

The U.S. Justice Department was the first to crack the worldwide vitamin  cartel, levying a $500 million fine against Roche in 1999, the largest ever in a criminal prosecution of any kind. BASF paid a $225 million fine in the case. Other companies  fined in the U.S. case included Merck, Takeda, Eisai and Daiichi.



Page 33 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Following the opening of the EU probe in May 1999, the commission said it found that 13
European and non-European companies participated in cartels aimed at eliminating competition in
the vitamin A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D3, biotin, folic acid, beta carotene and carotinoids markets.
The price-fixing scheme operated from September 1989 to February 1999, the commission said. The five remaining companies, Lonza AG of Germany and Japanese companies Kongo Chemical
Co. Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd., Sumika  Fine Chemicals Ltd. and Tanabe Saiyaku Co. Ltd.,
weren't  fined because the folic acid cartels in which those companies were involved ended five
years or more before the commission opened its investigation.

Wednesday's  fines come on the heels of a warning from Monti that increased resources for fighting cartels are yielding dramatic results in  Europe.
"The number of  cartel decisions that we will have adopted by the end of the year will clearly
exceed the same figure for many previous years," Monti said in a speech last week in Washington.

Monti told journalists Wednesday that the commission's actions on  cartel cases show it "has become more and more decisive." EU authorities can  fine companies up to 10% of their total annual sales in cartel cases.
The largest  cartel fine imposed by the EU to date was 272.94 million  euros in the 1998
Trans-Atlantic Shipping Alliance, or TACA, investigation. That probe revealed a price-fixing ring
involving containerized shipping companies.

THE news of the green light for the fifth terminal at Heathrow will have many implications as yet undetected.

One question that seems to have gone unasked is why Britain's leading airports are all run by one company. BAA should not have this near monopoly of Britain's top runways, let alone terminals which have become curious shopping centres with captive customers.

TD
The halo of prosperity that the new runway will create around Heathrow will not be shared elsewhere. Edinburgh remains a tiny provincial destination. If Heathrow was not allowed its magnetic power to suck in so much traffic international destinations to cities such as our own would be enhanced.

Another aspect of the Heathrow story is the realisation that our planning laws are ridiculously slow. Many lifetimes of legal fees and stupendous volumes of paper have been consumed to reach conclusions that were obvious in the first place.

The brutal authority of the French government to make almost instant planning rules regardless of local sensitivities is not a model to follow but letting everything proceed at the pace of committees of confused councillors is not adequate.

Almost every firm in the country can list planning inhibitions as impediments to future projects and success. Often the value attributed to a British company is in its planning permissions rather than its products. The Government has more than enough on its plate but the unhappy decision to authorise the fifth terminal seems to have created the unanimous view that important decisions should never be so delayed again.

The sheer volume of money being spent and the number of jobs it will create should make for enhanced optimism in a radius beyond Heathrow itself.
A bitter pill

THE European Commission is getting heavy in its determination to impose record fines on BASF of Germany and Roche of Switzerland for their long-standing conspiracy to rig the price of vitamins. The Commission is understood to be imposing a  fine of GBP 500 million. That is enough to make even these colossal corporations blink. It is certainly a scandal that these companies were able to fix the price for vitamins.

Neither company would comment on what they've been doing but the market knows that they have been setting aside large sums to cover their prospective  fines.

The decision appears to be the opposite of yesterday's court ruling that Levi could stop retailers selling their wares more cheaply. Tesco says it will fight on. Today's ruling on the vitamin  cartel would appear to be an endorsement of Tesco's position.
American hero
ANNE MULCAHY, the chief executive of Xerox has impressed with her promise that the company will
"enjoy a dramatic return to profitability" in 2002. Xerox shares lifted promptly on her declaration.



Page 35 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This is either defying the laws of gravity or she genuinely knows things few other people do. Xerox completely missed out in any leadership race on digital technology. Its copiers were once top of the range. Nobody claims that any more.

The market has assumed Xerox would wither and die or get taken over for its warehouse space rather than its products. If Ms Mulcahy can bring life back to the ailing Xerox she will become the most heroic figure in American capitalism.

GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) - The Swiss healthcare group, Roche, has been  fined 462 million euros (about 450 million U.S. dollars) by the European Commission for its involvement in a vitamin price fixing cartel, Swiss Radio International (SRI) reported Wednesday.

German Ifo falls, dampening upturn hopes
FRANKFURT - German business sentiment fell to an eight-year low in October, signalling a recovery in  Europe's largest economy is still not in sight and that more interest rate cuts
may be needed to revive growth.

The latest spending package, which comes only a week after
the last one was enacted, will be drawn from proceeds from past

Shares up,  euro dips as hopes for ECB rate cut rise
LONDON - Shares and bond prices rallied on Wednesday as weak German business confidence data increased speculation of another cut in  euro zone interest rates while talk of an
agreement on output cuts bolstered oil prices.
The euro fell almost half a percent against the dollar
after Germany's closely watched Ifo business climate survey eased to an eight year low, confirming widespread gloom over the euro zone's growth outlook.

U.S. consumer sentiment bounces up in November
NEW YORK - U.S. consumer sentiment rose in November, market sources said on Wednesday, as hopes for an economic recovery by next year overshadowed worries about job layoffs and an economy that has likely slipped into recession.
The University of Michigan's closely-watched consumer sentiment index rose for a second straight month to 83.9 in November from 82.7 in October. That was higher than consensus forecasts for 83.5 and was up from a preliminary reading of
83.5 released two weeks ago.

Economic storm clouds again over  Europe, Japan
LONDON - Economic storm clouds gathered again over  Europe
on Wednesday as a key survey showed German business sentiment at an eight-year low while the European Commission slashed its official growth forecasts.
In Britain, what one economist described as "shockingly bad" data showed a big drop in business investment and in France figures showed that consumers had drawn in their horns in October following the attacks the previous month on U.S. cities.

Initial claims fell to 427,000 in the week ended Nov. 17, a period shortened by the Veterans Day holiday, the Labor Department said. The decline of 15,000 from a marginally revised 442,000 the prior week brought initial claims to their lowest level since 393,000 in the Sept. 15 week.

KPN in $4.4 bln cash call as posts Q3 loss
AMSTERDAM - KPN Telecom, the debt-crippled Dutch operator, said on Wednesday it planned to go cap in hand to shareholders and launch a five billion  euro ($4.41 billion) cash call as
part of a rescue restructuring.
News of the huge share issue, reported by Reuters on
Tuesday, knocked KPN's stock more than 11 percent lower at the start of trade. But the stock had stabilised three percent
lower at 5.83  euros by 1200 GMT as the market agreed that a looming cash crisis left the group with few alternatives.

UK's Sainsbury sees boost from refits
LONDON - Britain's second-biggest food retailer, J Sainsbury Plc, began to reap the benefits of massive store investment on Wednesday as first-half profits before an array of one-off costs showed a modest gain on rising sales.
Pre-tax profits for the period ended October 13 rose 3.2
percent to 309 million pounds ($438 million) on turnover up 8.4 percent to 9.6 billion pounds, within analysts' expectations.
The dividend was held at 4.02 pence.

Barnevik steps down as ABB chairman
ZURICH - Percy Barnevik, the man who created  Europe's biggest electrical engineering group ABB out of the 1988 merger
of Swedish and Swiss firms, stepped down on Wednesday to take the blame for ABB's share price plunge.
Barnevik, 60, was once hailed as a business strategy guru as he implemented a decentralised structure at the globally
active group. But lately he became the target of investor

EU sets record  fine over vitamin cartel
BRUSSELS - The European Commission on Wednesday announced a record fine of 855 million euros for eight distinct
price-fixing cartels in vitamin products.
The two largest  fines were 462 million euros for
Switzerland's Roche and 296 million  euros for Germany's BASF
for fixing the price of  vitamins, costing consumers billions of

Eichel rejects stimulus call, budget woes grow
BERLIN - German Finance Minister Hans Eichel fended off
calls from his Social Democrat comrades to introduce economic stimulus programmes on Wednesday, saying strict  euro-zone budget rules meant the cupboard was bare.
Eichel said Germany's budget deficit was already getting too close for comfort to the three-percent ceiling set by Maastricht Treaty rules on monetary union - a fact highlighted by the European Commission in their autumn report.

EU gives nod, but steel merger still undecided
PARIS - Regulators gave conditional approval to a plan to
create the world's largest steelmaker on Wednesday, putting the onus on Usinor and two partners to patch up a last-minute dispute to save their $3 billion merger.
The tie-up between France's Usinor, Luxembourg-based Arbed
and Aceralia of Spain would create a pan-European manufacturer with the with sales of 30 billion  euros and output of 46

LEADING BUSINESS PEOPLE TO SHAPE STRATEGY AT DTI

Heralding radical restructuring at the Department of Trade and Industry, Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt has announced a plan to appoint three prominent business people to a board of seven people who will steer strategy at the department. Other business people will also be called in to sit on four
directorates-general, which will help form policy on issues such as science, technology and innovation; or curbing the negative effect of regulation on small businesses. Mrs Hewitt said that the department suffered from a lack of focus and she wanted to see it become a 'flagship' ministry able to enhance productivity and enterprise.

ENRON GRANTED BREATHING SPACE.

Talks between US energy trader Enron and its lenders will continue through the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday, according to people close to the negotiations. The company was trying to convince bankers, investors and customers on Wednesday that it has a future, after achieving a postponement on the repayment of $690 million in outstanding notes. Enron said it had finalised $450 million in credit from JP Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney , but some analysts doubt that the group's cash will last until the completion next year of the nine billion dollar rescue plan announced by its rival Dynegy two weeks ago. Before Enron announced the postponement of its debt payment, shares in New York were trading 33 percent lower on the day, but by lunchtime they had gained a little and stood at $4.97, down 29 percent.
MINISTERS MAY BAIL OUT AIR TRAFFIC SERVICE.

A Whitehall official has said that the government is considering the ways in which it can compensate the recently part-privatised National Air Traffic Services, which has demanded three million stg in help after the closure of American airspace following the September 11 attacks. Labour MPs critical of the
public-private partnership have suggested that this is a time to rethink what Martin Salter MP called an
'ill-conceived privatisation', while others said that the idea had been to reduce the burden of investment
from the government. A senior minister said: 'Before we did the PPP, taxpayers would have had to have
absorbed the cost of the changed conditions since September 11'. Nats has cut costs and waived
payments to its pension fund. It will debate, at a board meeting on Monday, its options for the future.
INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING TUMBLES TO A SEVEN-YEAR LOW.

Provisional third quarter figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown that business investment has reached its lowest level for 18 months. Overall investment was down 4.1 percent compared to the second quarter, but business investment fell by 13 percent, while official figures show margins in manufacturing at their lowest since the end of the last recession in 1992. The  European Commission has forecast that British economic growth next year will be 1.75 percent, lower than its estimate of three percent last April. Chief executive of the Industrial Society, Will Hutton, is expecting
Britain to follow the US, which has seen its longest fall in industrial production since the 1930s. Chancellor Gordon Brown had already said that stimulating business investment was a major objective, and The Treasury said: 'The chancellor has said he will be doing more in the pre-Budget report to recognise the contribution of manufacturing to the economy'.
MONTI LASHES 'VITAMINS AG'  CARTEL.

Page 45 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
European Competition commissioner Mario Monti, not known for bombast, gave a damning indictment of the 13 pharmaceutical companies involved in cartels to control the markets in  vitamins. He said: 'It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life'. Of fines totalling 855.2 million  euros, the biggest penalty gives Roche three months to pay 462 million euros. Roche has reinforced its commitment to stay within the law and said it had co-operated fully since the cartels came to light. BASF , which has been fined 296.16 million euros has called the fine disproportionate and it will examine the reasons for the fine and decide whether to appeal.
FRANCE TELECOM SEALS DEAL ON 2.1 BILLION STG CONVERTIBLE BOND.

France Telecom completed its record-breaking 3.5 billion  euro issue of four-year convertible bonds on Wednesday. The bonds are a good deal for investors who hope to have an opportunity to convert to shares if the price recovers, and good for France Telecom because the coupon prices are low, and if investors do convert the debt will not need to be paid back. The proceeds of the bond issue will be used
by France Telecom to refinance its existing debt. The issue also addresses France Telecom's problems of stock overhang resulting from its own shares that had been sold back to it by Vodafone after the purchase of Orange. The bonds have a very high conversion premium compared to the market norm, at 72  euros, a conversion premium of 64 percent compared to France Telecom's trading price on Monday, but the company is offering a coupon price of four percent to compensate investors, instead of the average two to three percent.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS PUT DENT IN SAINSBURY.

J Sainsbury on Wednesday announced an 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to 277 million stg for the 28 weeks to October 13 on sales up 7.5 percent to 7.8 billion stg in the core group. Like-for-like sales were up six percent, but analysts pointed out that accounting for the effects of petrol deflation, this figure fell to 5.5 percent. Operating profit fell from 331 million stg to 306 million stg, with an exceptional item of 21 million
stg for reorganisation costs. Sir Peter Davis, announcing the figures a third of the way through the
three-year recovery programme, said that the company was on track to achieve industry-leading margins.
Shares in Sainsbury's fell 1.25p to 385.75p.
BRAIN CHESS MOVE IN EINSTEIN GAMBIT.

The Aim traded science and technology company Einstein is in advanced merger talks with Brain Games Network, the company which launched the World Chess Championships a year ago. Einstein, whose shares had collapsed because of its cash position, will have an injection of two million stg in working capital as part of the deal, which is expected to see the merged company through to profitability in 2003. It is hoped that the merger will attract advertising and sponsorship for the events, though the next world championship and the company's Man versus Machine events have been delayed until early next year. Einstein shares fell 0.25p to 3.25p on Wednesday.
AKER CHALLENGES PLAN TO SAVE KVAERNER.

Kjell Inge Rokke, who controls the Norwegian oil service company Aker Maritime , has written to shareholders in Kvaerner asking them to postpone their decisions on the rescue plan for the company proposed by Yukos Oil. Mr Rokke holds that the current plan favours creditors of the company, but said:
'Work is well advanced on an alternative proposal which the board can use as the basis for fresh negotiations', and he said that a vote against proposals by Yukos may be necessary if a more shareholder friendly proposal emerges. Aker Maritime has announced already that it has increased its stake in Kvaerner to 20.15 percent, and reports suggest it may now have enough to itself veto plans by Yukos.
RTL RAISES CONCERNS OVER LIBERTY DEAL.

Europe's largest free-to-air television company, RTL , has written to the German  cartel office about its concerns over the planned takeover by US cable company Liberty Media of six regional cable companies from Deutsche Telekom , covering 12 of Germany's 16 Lander. RTL emphasised that the letter was not an attack on Liberty, but had been requested as part of the investigation by the  cartel office. It is expected
that the office will impose conditions on the takeover after hearing concerns from all of the German broadcasters. RTL is concerned about Liberty having power to lock out rivals, and about the possibility it might divide its broadcasting into basic and premium packages, thereby devaluing the platform for advertisers.

HD           Japan drugmakers mulling EC's cartel ruling. WC          370 words

TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Three of Japan's leading drugmakers said on Thursday they were considering a response to the European Commission's decision to  fine them and other vitamin makers for operating a price fixing cartel.

On Wednesday, the commission ordered eight of the world's top vitamin makers to pay 855 million euros ($750 million) for operating a cartel which it said added to the cost of products containing vitamins and to the coffers of cartel members.

TD
"We have cooperated fully in all ways with the European Commission's investigation," said Japan's leading drugmaker, Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd, whose fines totalled 37.05 million  euros.
"From now, we will consider whether or not to accept or appeal the commission's decision."

In separate statements, Japan's fifth-largest drugmaker, Eisai Co Ltd, and sixth-largest Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd also said they were considering whether to accept or appeal the commission's ruling.
Eisai was fined 13.23 million euros and Daiichi was fined 23.4 million euros.

Besides the three Japanese firms, five other vitamin makers were also fined, including Roche of Switzerland, for what the commission said was the gravest violation of the European Union's antitrust rules.

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in announcing the  fine on Wednesday.

The conspirators met secretly in a series of cartels that involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E, Beta Carotene and vitamin premixes, the commission said.

The vitamins are found in everyday goods like cereals, biscuits, drinks, animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

The fine came on top of more than $2.1 billion the  cartel members have paid in the United States to the federal government, individual states and private plantiffs.

At 0545 GMT, shares in Takeda were up 0.89 percent at 5,660 yen, while Eisai's were up 0.96 percent at 3,160 yen and Daiichi up 3.28 percent at 2,680 yen.
They were all outperforming the benchmark Nikkei average, which was down 0.49 percent. (1
euro=$0.8770).

HD         Cartels can oil the wheels of business - Commentary. BY         By Graham Searjeant.

BY MOST STANDARDS, the international vitamin  cartel exemplified the most sinister face of capitalism. Regular quarterly meetings were held between executives from top  European and Japanese companies to carve up markets in detail and to co-ordinate price increases for a bulk ingredient of anything from animal feed to breakfast cereal. Secrecy was maintained, names disguised and records destroyed. Prices of these commodity items were for years kept at profitable levels across the world.

This business ogre first surfaced in a private prosecution in Alabama four years ago. After  fines totalling #800 million in America and Australia and four months in jail for a key executive, members have been fined a further #530 million by the European Commission in what must surely be one of the cartel's last appearances outside antitrust textbooks. The fines were claimed to be records.

TD
Mario Monti, the EU's chief trustbuster, is now keeping up his role as bureaucratic tail-end charlie by sinking his teeth into Microsoft just after the main US case has been settled. But no matter, the message from around the world is that price-fixing cartels are evil, antisocial and will not be tolerated.

At least, cartels will not be tolerated unless they really matter. By far the biggest and most powerful cartel is the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Its 11 members meet regularly to fix output and agree quotas among themselves in an effort to manipulate the price of the world's most important commodity. By driving prices up, they have triggered two and perhaps three global recessions in the past 30 years.

Opec members do not lurk in secret corners, eat their own memos or fear arrest. They hold meetings openly in grand hotels, argue about the negotiations in advance and keep the world's attendant press fully informed of their deliberations. For these are not conniving corporate executives. They are representatives of sovereign states. Politics dictates that they are not sued.

Sometimes we even have a sneaking admiration for the oil  cartel. The Saudis, at least, try to manage the price of oil so that it remains relatively stable and keeps the customers in business. They fail, but they try.

Loyola de Palacio, the EU's Transport and Energy Commissioner, argued yesterday that the price of oil had fallen too low; the EU did not want the price to stay below $20 per barrel because that would threaten investment in oil exploration. By implication, Senora de Palacio wished Opec well in its efforts to inveigle non-members Russia, Norway and Mexico into joining in co-ordinated cuts in output that might drag the price back up from $16 per barrel at the start of this week nearer to Opec's target range of $22-28.

Many would agree. A low oil price might kick-start the US economy but would undo Russia and cause more trouble in the Middle East. The free market price is volatile, bringing feast and famine. But corporate cartels too are usually set up to give stability and to stop all producers being ruined in difficult times. What is good for  vitamins is good for oil, or vice versa.

THE European Commission yesterday issued a harsh warning to businesses seeking to run cartels by fining eight vitamin producers a total of 855 million ( #530 million) for fixing prices for almost a decade.
Roche, the Swiss drugs group, was  fined 462 million in the highest award to date imposed by the EU
on a single company for market abuse.

TD
BASF, the German chemicals group, was  fined 296 million for its part in the  cartel, which was known as Vitamins  Inc and was exposed in 1999.

Both BASF, which described its  fine as "inappropriately high", and Roche are considering an appeal. Competition experts said that the huge  fines underlined the EU's commitment to crack down on restrictive business practices.
Aventis, the French drugs group, escaped  fines in connection to two  vitamins in return for
co-operating with inquiries.Samantha Mobley, EU competition partner at the law firm Baker &
McKenzie, said: "It is the first time a company has achieved a 100 per cent reduction in a  fine,
illustrating the EU's commitment to encourage whistle-blowers." Other companies  fined included
Germany's Merck, three Japanese groups and a Dutch business.

BRUSSELS - Mario Monti is a cautious sort, more likely to dwell on the intricacies of little-known competition theory than to deliver bombast.

But yesterday the man responsible for  European competition policy broke with tradition to launch a damning indictment of the 13 pharmaceutical companies involved in a nine-year conspiracy to fix the price of vitamins.

TD
Announcing a record fine totalling 855.2-million  euros ($1.2-billion) on eight of those companies -- five companies were not fined because of time limitations -- Mr. Monti said the price-fixing agreements were "the most damaging series of cartels the [European Commission] has ever investigated."
The leading conspirators, Roche of Switzerland and Germany's BASF, will have to pay 462 million
euros and 296.16 million  euros, respectively.
The degree of collusion was so high the groups virtually operated as a single company, dubbed by
Mr. Monti "Vitamins  SA or Vitamins  AG."

The hefty  fines dwarf the previous record of 273 million  euros imposed on a shipping cartel and could prove a turning point in the policy of Brussels authorities, which have been criticized for being less effective than U.S. counterparts in busting price fixers.

Two years ago, the U.S. antitrust authorities found Roche and BASF guilty of similar offences,  fined them US$500-million and US$225-million respectively and jailed a former Roche executive for four months.

Mr. Monti said the offences committed in  Europe were extremely serious because the cartels enabled the companies to charge higher prices, "damaging consumers and allowing [the companies] to pocket illicit profits."

"It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life," he said.
Mr. Monti reserved some of his harshest words, and the biggest  fine, for Roche.

He said the Swiss group, the world's largest producer of  vitamins, was "the prime mover and main beneficiary" of the cartels and the only company involved in fixing the prices of all products.

Some of Roche's most senior executives were involved in the cartels, Mr. Monti said, a sign the arrangements "were part of a strategic plan conceived at the highest levels to control the world market in vitamins by illegal means."

BASF was also sharply criticized. "[The company] assumed a paramount role in following Roche's lead," the commission said.
"A striking feature of this complex of infringements was the central role played by Roche and BASF
in virtually each and every  cartel," Mr. Monti added.

The two firms even added new members to Vitamins  SA by, for example, recruiting the Japanese producer Eisai, which was  fined 13.23 million euros, to fix prices for vitamin E.

BASF denounced the  fine, which was higher than its U.S. penalty, as "inappropriately high" and said it would examine the reasons for the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

Mr. Monti's only praise, albeit faint, was for the French group Aventis, which was the first company ever to be granted full immunity by the commission.

Aventis came clean on the price-fixing arrangements on two  vitamins and provided EU investigators with decisive evidence, the commission said.

Mario Monti is a cautious sort, more likely to dwell on the intricacies of little-known competition theory than to deliver bombast.

But yesterday the man responsible for  European competition policy broke with tradition to launch a damning indictment of the 13 pharmaceutical companies involved in a nine-year conspiracy to fix the price of vitamins.

TD
Announcing a record fine totalling  Euros 855.2m ( #523m) on eight of those companies - five companies were not fined because of time limitations - Mr Monti said the price-fixing agreements were "the most damaging series of cartels the (European Commission) has ever investigated". The leading conspirators, Roche of Switzerland and Germany's BASF, will have to pay respectively  Euros 462m and Euros 296m.
The degree of collusion was so high that the groups virtually operated as a single company, dubbed by
Mr Monti "Vitamins  SA or Vitamins  AG".

The hefty  fines dwarf the previous record of  Euros 273m imposed on a shipping cartel and could prove a turning point in the policy of the Brussels authorities, which have been criticised for being less effective than their US counterparts in busting price-fixers.
Two years ago, the US antitrust authorities found Roche and BASF guilty of similar offences,  fined them
$500m and $225m respectively and jailed a former Roche executive for four months.

Mr Monti said the offences committed in  Europe were extremely serious because the cartels enabled the companies to charge higher prices, "damaging consumers and allowing (the companies) to pocket illicit profits".

"It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life," the commissioner said.
Mr Monti reserved some of his harshest words, and the biggest  fine, for Roche, which will have to pay
Euros 462m within three months.

The Swiss group, the world's largest producer of  vitamins, was "the prime mover and main beneficiary" of the cartels and the only company involved in fixing the prices of all products.

Some of Roche's most senior executives were involved in the cartels, Mr Monti said - a sign the arrangements "were part of a strategic plan conceived at the highest levels to control the world market in vitamins by illegal means".
BASF, which received a penalty of  Euros 296.16m, was also sharply criticised. "(The company)
assumed a paramount role in following Roche's lead," the Commission said.

"A striking feature of this complex of infringements was the central role played by Roche and BASF in virtually each and every  cartel," Mr Monti added.

The two companies even added new members to Vitamins  SA, by for example recruiting the Japanese producer Eisai - fined Euros 13.23m - to the cartel to fix prices for vitamin E.

BASF denounced the  fine, which was higher than its US penalty, as "inappropriately high" and said it would examine the reasons for the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

Roche said it had "fully co-operated with the Commission since these practices came to light" and had reinforced its commitment to work within the law.

Mr Monti's only praise, albeit faint, was for the French group Aventis, which became the first company ever to be granted full immunity by the Commission.

Aventis was the first company to come clean on the price-fixing arrangements on two  vitamins and provided the EU investigators with decisive evidence, the Commission said.
However, the French group was  fined Euros 5m for its minor role in another vitamin  cartel.

The picture painted by Aventis and others to the Commission is that of a highly sophisticated set of arrangements that enabled the participants to keep a tight grip on the markets for the  vitamins.

Each cartel had a formal hierarchy made up of different executives from the companies involved. Every month or quarter, each  cartel met to exchange sales and price data and review the quotas assigned to each company. And in the largest cartels, participants even prepared an annual "budget" to adjust sales according to each company's quota.

THE European Commission (EC) yesterday announced a record  fine of e855m ((pounds) 562m)
for eight distinct price-fixing cartels in vitamin products.
The two largest  fines were e462m ((pounds) 304m) for Switzerland's Roche and e296m ((pounds)
314m) for Germany's BASF for fixing the price of  vitamins, costing consumers billions of  euros.

TD
"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered," Mario Monti, left, EU competit-ion commissioner, said.

They were found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, Monti said.

"The prime mover and main beneficiary of these schemes was Hoffman-LaRoche, the largest vitamin producer in the world with some 50% of the overall market," the commission said.
"BASF, the next largest vit-amin producer world-wide, assumed a paramount role in following
Hoffman-LaRoche's lead," it added.

The commission also fined Aventis of France (pounds) 3.3m, Solvay of Belgium (pounds) 5.9m, Merck of Germany (pounds) 6m, and Japan's Daiichi (pounds) 15.4m, Eisai Co (pounds) 8.7m, and Takeda Chemical Industries (pounds) 24.3m.
The conspiracies involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E beta carotene and vitamin premixes.
It said Aventis was granted full immunity in regard to its participation in the  cartel in vitamins A and
E because it was the first company to co-operate with the commission. - Reuters.

Eight drug companies must pay back (pounds) 500m

Consumers' groups last night welcomed record fines by the European Commission on drug companies for running a price-fixing  cartel on vitamins.

TD
The ringleader was the Swiss company Hoffmann-La Roche, which was  fined nearly (pounds) 280m out of a total of more than (pounds) 500m levied against eight firms in all.

Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said the  fines were warranted because it was the worst case of its kind the commission has seen.

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated, due to the sheer range of vitamins covered, which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits, and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics."
The second largest penalty was imposed on BASF of Germany, which was  fined (pounds) 185m.

The conspirators met secretly in a series of cartels that involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E, and beta carotene.

Mr Monti said the cartel added to consumers' costs of every product containing  vitamins and to the bottom line of the cartel participants, especially Roche, which had 50% of the overall market. Both Roche and BASF said they were considering whether to appeal.

Roche said more than 8000 of its managers had taken part in a training programme to ensure they followed national and international laws, especially antitrust laws.

The fines are on top of more than (pounds) 1.4bn the conspirators have paid in the United States to the federal government, individual states, and private plaintiffs. Further lawsuits are pending.

The firm that worked most closely with the commission was Aventis of France, which blew the whistle on the others. It was granted full immunity in regard to its participation in the  cartel in vitamins A and E because it was the first company to co-operate with the EU's executive and provided decisive evidence in the case of these two products.

But Aventis did not give the commission evidence on all  vitamins. It was  fined (pounds) 3m for passive participation in the vitamin D3 infringement.
Mr Monti said that in 1995, when the  cartel was in its heyday, vitamin C produced revenues of
(pounds) 150m for the firms but in 1998, after the conspiracy ended, they dropped off to (pounds) 70m.

It took the European Commission two-and-a-half years to reach its decision after the United States acted against the cartel. Mr Monti said such investigations could be streamlined if there were joint agreements to share confidential information on such issues.

It was unclear what immediate effect the commission's action would have on High Street prices for
vitamins and manufactured foods like breakfast cereals that contain them.

A spokesman for the Consumers' Association (CA), said: "It is difficult to say at this stage but it may have a trickle-down effect, reducing costs of manufacturers. We would hope to see an overall reduction in prices paid by consumers."

Phil Evans, principal policy adviser to the CA, said: "Any time a  cartel jacks up the costs of legitimate business, they jack up the prices that the consumer ultimately pays. It is this sort of corporate mugging that consumers must be protected from."

He said the commission's firm action underlined the need for the UK government to move swiftly to bring in its planned enterprise bill, under which heads of companies could be jailed if their firms are involved in such activity.
"Only such action will flush out the many other cartels that are lurking around world markets," Mr
Evans added.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined eight companies a record 855.22 million  euros ($755.1-million U.S.) for allegedly fixing vitamin prices, but in an unprecedented move let one drug maker off the hook for turning on its former partners.

The supposed ringleader of the price-fixing  cartel, Roche Holding AG of Switzerland, was  fined 462 million euros, or 2.6 per cent of worldwide sales in 1999.

TD
Under the Commission's rules,  fines start at 20 million  euros per offense and increase by 10 per cent for each additional year of illegal activity. The figures in that formula are subject to mitigating or aggravating factors.

The Commission said although it would have been justified in fining Roche as much as 962 million euros, the sum was reduced because Roche co-operated in the investigation by, among other things, willingly giving the Commission documents for which it asked.

Roche was the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the scheme to fix prices on 12 separate vitamins in the 1990s, the Commission said. BASF AG of Germany was another "paramount" player, the Commission said, and was  fined 296.16 million euros. Fines for the six other companies ranged from 37.05 million  euros to 5.04 million  euros.
BASF called the  fine excessive and said it might appeal.

Roche, which also is weighing an appeal, said the amount was large but that it had provisioned for such a penalty after the same companies pleaded guilty to settle a U.S. probe in 1999.
"We don't like so much the figure, but we're getting closer to putting this chapter behind us," said
Horst Kramer, a Roche spokesman.

No fine was levied against Aventis SA of France, formerly Rhone-Poulenc, because Aventis cooperated with the Commission and provided decisive evidence of other companies' illegal activity.
"Companies that do not seize this chance must be aware of the responsibilities they face," said Mario
Monti, the Commissioner responsible for antitrust policy.

Mr. Monti said the eight companies operated the "most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated" in terms of harm to consumers. But the Commission didn't impose the maximum penalty possible under the law: 10 per cent of a company's annual sales during the last year in which the cartel operated. Altogether, that could have run into the billions of  euros.

Mr. Monti insisted the Commission wasn't letting the companies off lightly. But he lamented the fact that under  European Union law, there are no criminal sanctions for price-fixing, as there are in the United States.
Page 60 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We're working to make penalties more and more effective and more and more deterrent," he said.

In the 1999 U.S. case, Roche paid a  fine of $500-million (U.S.), and a former executive went to prison.

The companies have two months to appeal to the  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, but they have to pay the  fines immediately or submit bank guarantees for the amount of the  fine pending the outcome of the appeal.

A BASF spokesman said the punishment was "inappropriately high," particularly since it and other manufacturers had co-operated with the investigation and had introduced measures, such as special training for sales staff and internal auditing programs, to help prevent possible future antitrust violations.

Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Mr. Monti, said the Commission had wide discretion on the final amount of the  fine, in part because it wanted to maintain "a certain degree of uncertainty" so companies didn't calculate likely  fines into their business plans. However, Roche said it had already figured the  fine into its spending plans back in 1999.

Roche stock edged up to 122 Swiss francs ($73.95 U.S.), a gain of 50 centimes in Zurich trading yesterday, while in Frankfurt, BASF shares declined 40  European cents to 42.80  euros each.

HD          EC fines 'Vitamin  Inc' cartel - Record #534m penalty for price-fixing hits Roche, BASF, Aventis and Merck.

LP
Some of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies were yesterday  fined a massive #534m for operating an illegal price-fixing cartel on the supply of  vitamins throughout the 1990s - the biggest fine the European commission has ever handed down.

Mario Monti, the  European Union's competition commissioner, said the  cartel could be dubbed Vitamins  Inc, and was the most damaging and serious it had ever investigated and had cheated European consumers of billions of pounds since  vitamins were used in and affected the price of a whole range of products.

TD
He described how senior ex ecutives in 13 companies had cynically collaborated to ensure that consumers paid over the odds for  vitamins used on their own and in products such as cereals, biscuits, drinks, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

"It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life," Mr Monti said.

"The companies' collusive behaviour enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits."

Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, received particular criticism and was given the biggest fine of all - #288m - while German firm BASF was deemed to be the second worst offender and made to pay a fine of #185m.

When Mr Monti was asked whether the 13 firms were in effect just one big global monopoly which could be dubbed Vitamins  Inc, he agreed. Others  fined included Aventis ( #3m), Solvay ( #5.7m) and Merck ( #5.7m), together with three Japanese firms which were  fined a total of #46m.

The commission described how the companies had operated a highly organised  cartel holding regular meetings to collude on prices, exchange sales figures and coordinate price increases.
The cartels were run, Brussels said, "at the most senior levels of the undertakings concerned".

The commission concluded after its two-year investigation: "The prime mover and main beneficiary of these schemes was Hoffman La Roche, the largest vitamin producer in the world, with some 50% of the overall market.

"The involvement of some of its most senior executives tends to confirm that the arrangements were part of a strategic plan conceived at the highest levels to control the world market in  vitamins by illegal means."

The cartels, on the supply of  vitamins A, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D3, E and beta carotene, operated between 1990 and 1998, the EC found, and several of the companies implicated, including BASF, have already been fined in the US for similar offences.

The commission's investigation was helped by one of the offenders - French company Aventis - which agreed to turn whistleblower and furnished the commission with what Mr Monti called "decisive information". As a reward, Aventis was  fined just #3m instead of a figure nearer to #70m.

Many of the companies said they had been expecting the  fines and had put aside funds to cover them. They have three months to pay, although several indicated that they would be challenging the amounts in the  European courts.

THE EUROPEAN Commission levied record fines of 855m euros (#530m) on eight chemical and pharmaceutical companies yesterday for operating a  cartel that fixed the price of  vitamins used in a huge range of consumer products.

The firms are thought to have cost shoppers millions of pounds, by carving up the market and rigging prices for vitamins included in everything from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

TD
Mario Monti, the  European Union competition commissioner, described the case as the "most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated, due to the sheer range of  vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products".

Consumer groups in Britain welcomed the  fines, which they hoped would hasten the implementation of laws proposed in the Enterprise Bill to curb anti-competitive behaviour. The Consumers' Association described the secret vitamin  cartel as "corporate mugging".

Phil Evans, principal policy adviser at the Consumers' Association, said: "Any time a  cartel jacks up the costs of legitimate business, they jack up the prices that the consumer ultimately pays."

Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Mr Monti, said the  vitamins concerned were sold in bulk to manufacturers and were "used in products from cereals and biscuits to animal feed". She added: "Just look at a packet of cereal and you will see that they all include these  vitamins."

Brussels has been unable to calculate the increased cost passed on to consumers, but it does give one example relating to vitamin C. During the last year in which the cartel was in place the total value of the market was 250m euros, a figure that fell by more than half to 120m euros three years later.

Mr Monti said the firms were able "to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits".

He added: "It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life."

The highest  fine of 462m euros was imposed on F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG of Switzerland, which the EU said was the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the  cartel arrangements. The second highest fine of 296m euros was levied against the German firm, BASF AG, the world's second largest vitamin maker after Hoffmann-La Roche.

The European Commission also fined Aventis SA of France, Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV of the Netherlands, Merck KgaA of Germany and three Japanese companies, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Esai Co Ltd and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd.

The Commission said the companies had colluded to fix prices in the  European market for 12 different vitamin products with a sophisticated system. This included "the exchange of sales values, volumes of sales and pricing information on a quarterly or monthly basis at regular meetings".

The European Union on Wednesday slapped a total of 855.22 million  euros ($751.14 million) in fines against three Japanese and five  European pharmaceutical makers for allegedly forming a vitamin price cartel.
The three Japanese drug companies involved are Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Daiichi
Pharmaceutical Co. and Eisai Co.

TD
The European Commission, the executive arm of the 15-member EU, accused the eight companies of illegally controlling prices of  vitamins that are used as ingredients in drug products and animal feeds.
Takeda was fined 37 million euros, Daiichi 23.4 million  euros, and Eisai 13.2 million  euros.

Last April, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued a warning against Daiichi and Eisai, accusing them of forming an international  cartel.

HD          Pounds 534m fines for vitamin  firms in price fixing  cartel; Crackdown on manufacturers accused of 'corporate mugging'

MANUFACTURERS of topselling vitamin brands have been  fined a record Pounds 534million for operating a pricefixing  cartel.

The European Commission yesterday punished eight companies implicated in a scandal that cost consumers in Britain and on the Continent billions of pounds.

TD
It named Swiss giant Hoffman-LaRoche, maker of Sanatogen, as the prime mover behind what was last night condemned as the ' corporate mugging of consumers'.
The largest  fine of Pounds 289million was handed down to the company, whose brands also include
Supradyn, Redoxon and Berocca.

German firm BASF, which provides basic  vitamins used by UK supermarkets and other companies for their own-brand products, was  fined Pounds 185million.

Substantial penalties were also imposed on Aventis of France, Solvay of Belgium, Merck of Germany, and three Japanese suppliers Daiichi, Eisai Co and Takeda Chemical Industries. However, the  fines were not levied over the high cost of pills, but over the price of  vitamins sold in bulk to fortify popular breakfast cereals, bread, fruit juices and other foods.

The conspiracies involved  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E beta carotene and vitamin premixes. These also went into cosmetics and animal feed.

The Commission's action comes after the firms had already paid billions of dollars in  fines and settlements in the U.S. two years ago after a similar investigation there.

Yesterday, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti condemned the companies involved and warned other industries of future tough action.
He added: 'This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has investigated.

'The vitamins involved are found in products ranging from cereals, biscuits and drinks, to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.'

The Commission added: 'The prime mover and main beneficiary was Hoffman-LaRoche, the largest vitamin producer in the world, with 50 per cent of the market.
'The cartel arrangement covered its full range of vitamin products.'

Secret meetings were set up where sales figures and price information was shared under arrangements drawn up by top company figures.

The Commission added: 'The involvement of senior executives confirms that this was part of a strategic plan conceived at the highest levels illegally to control the world market in  vitamins.

Page 67 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
'BASF, the world's next largest producer, followed Roche's lead.'
Mr Monti added that in 1995, when the  cartel was active, vitamin C produced annual revenues of
Pounds 156.25million. But this collapsed to Pounds 75million in 1998 after the conspiracy ended.
French company Aventis was granted partial immunity after giving evidence against the other firms. Its fine was cut from a possible Pounds 70.6million to Pounds 3.15million.
The Consumers' Association, which has often challenged the value offered by over-the-counter
vitamins, welcomed the EU move.

Principal policy adviser Phil Evans said: 'Any time a  cartel jacks up the cost of legitimate business, it jacks up the price ultimately paid by the consumer, who must be protected most strongly from this sort of corporate mugging.'
He added: 'We must toughen our laws and regulators must protect industry and consumers.'

Last night, Roche insisted the price-fixing related to bulk  vitamins rather than to its household-name tablets.

It claimed the UK market for food supplements was highly competitive and argued that prices for over-the-counter medicines such as  vitamins were among the cheapest in  Europe.

The Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the trade association representing manufacturers, said the ruling would have no impact on tablet prices.

HD         #500m FINE FOR VITAMIN CARTELS. WC        315 words

EIGHT of the world's top drug companies were hammered yesterday with a #500million  fine for illegally fixing the price of  vitamins.

Their products were found in everyday goods like cereals, biscuits, juices, milk, animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, inflating the prices world-wide.

TD
Firms in Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium and Japan were involved, and EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the fraud was by far the most damaging the European Commission had ever investigated.

He added: "It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life."
The inquiry began more than two years ago, after American courts  fined the firms #450million - and US
damages actions are still going on.

The Commission named Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland as the  cartel ringleader, and fined them nearly #280million, more than half of the total penalty.
BASF of Germany was the other big loser.
The conspirators secretly fixed prices for  vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E, beta carotene and the
vitamins pre-mixed for adding to other goods.

Monti said the  cartel added to consumers' costs of every product containing  vitamins and to the profits of the cartel participants, especially Roche, which had 50 per cent of the overall market.

Roche said more than 8000 of its managers had now taken part in a training programme to ensure they did not break any laws.
Both Roche and BASF were considering an appeal.
But if they appeal, the firms will need bank guarantees for their  fines - and will owe interest if they lose. The Consumers' Association last night praised the Commission for cracking down hard on "corporate
mugging".

Labour MEP Philip Whitehead said: "We always suspected that  European consumers were being overcharged, but the sheer scale of the  cartel built among eight huge companies beggars belief."

BRUSSELS, Nov 21 -- The European Commission fined eight vitamin producers a total of just over
855 million euros ($752 million) today for involvement in a number of cartels that fixed prices and
market shares of vitamin products in the 1990's.

Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland was singled out as the ringleader and ordered to pay 462 million euros ($406 million), by far the biggest  fine the European Union's competition authority has ever levied against a single company. BASF of Germany, which was also found to have helped coordinate the cartels, was  fined 296 million euros ($260 million).

TD
Both companies have also been  fined by United States and Canadian agencies in connection with the same activities.

''This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated,'' said Mario Monti, the union's competition commissioner. ''The companies' collusive behavior enabled them to charge higher prices, allowing them to pocket illicit profits. It is particularly unacceptable that this behavior concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition essential for normal growth and maintenance of life.''

Roche said in a statement that it had set up a training program for its staff ''to reinforce its commitment to conducting business in full compliance with all local and international laws.'' It also said that a team in its internal auditing department would make sure the company complied with antitrust rules.

Roche and BASF were found to have been involved in all 12 separate cartels. Investigators said Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan and Merck of Germany joined them in rigging the market for vitamin C for human consumption; Rhone-Poulenc of France, now part of Aventis, joined them in the markets for vitamins A and E used in animal feed and vitamin D3.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical of Japan took part in the fixing of the markets for  vitamins B5 and B6, while another Japanese company, Eisai, colluded on vitamin E. Solvay Pharmaceuticals of Holland took part in the vitamin D3  cartel, the commission said. All were  fined.
Other vitamins involved were B1, B2, biotin (H), folic acid (M), beta carotene and carotenoids. After Roche and BASF, the  fines ranged from just over 37 million  euros ($33 million) down to 5
million euros ($4.4 million). Aventis was exempted from  fines for its involvement in the vitamin A and
E cartels because it was the first company to cooperate with the investigation in those markets, the
commission said, but it was  fined for participating in the vitamin D3  cartel.

Mr. Monti said the immunity for Aventis on the A and E vitamin cartels was a first. ''It illustrates the commission's willingness to grant companies that actively cooperate at the earliest stage a unique opportunity to get off the hook,'' he said.

Roche's fine is equivalent to 2.6 percent of the company's total sales last year. The commission may levy fines up to 10 percent of a company's sales in the most recent full year, but Roche and the other cartel participants avoided the harshest  fines by cooperating with the investigations, the commission said in its statement.

Five more companies were involved in the cartels but not  fined, because their involvement ended five years or more before the commission opened its investigations. They were identified as Lonza of Germany and four Japanese companies: Kongo Chemical, Sumitomo Chemical, Sumika  Fine Chemicals and Tanabe Saiyaku.

Corrections & Amplifications

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION fined Aventis SA of France 5.04 million  euros for its participation in a vitamin price-fixing ring. An article in Thursday's edition reported that it had received no  fine. (WSJE Nov. 23, 2001)

LP
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined eight companies a record 855.22 million  euros for allegedly fixing vitamin prices, but in an unprecedented move let one drug maker off the hook for turning on its former partners.

The supposed ringleader of the price-fixing  cartel, Roche Holding AG of Switzerland, was  fined 462 million euros, or 2.6% of world-wide sales in 1999.

TD
Under the commission's rules,  fines start at 20 million  euros per offense and increase by 10% for each additional year of illegal activity. The figures in that formula are subject to mitigating or aggravating factors.

The commission said although it would have been justified in fining Roche as much as 962 million euros, the sum was reduced because Roche cooperated in the investigation by, among other things, willingly giving the commission documents for which it asked.

Roche was the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the scheme to fix prices on 12 separate vitamins in the 1990s, the commission said. BASF AG of Germany was another "paramount" player, the commission said, and was  fined 296.16 million euros. Fines for the six other companies ranged from 37.05 million  euros to 5.04 million  euros.

BASF called the  fine excessive and said it might appeal. Roche, which also is weighing an appeal, said the amount was large but that it had provisioned for such a penalty after the same companies pleaded guilty to settle a U.S. probe in 1999. "We don't like so much the figure, but we're getting closer to putting this chapter behind us," said Horst Kramer, a Roche spokesman.

No fine was levied against Aventis SA of France, formerly Rhone-Poulenc, because Aventis cooperated with the commission and provided decisive evidence of other companies' illegal activity. "Companies that do not seize this chance must be aware of the responsibilities they face," said Mario Monti, the commissioner responsible for antitrust policy.

Mr. Monti said the eight companies operated the "most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated" in terms of harm to consumers. But the commission didn't impose the maximum penalty possible under the law: 10% of a company's annual sales during the last year in which the cartel operated. Altogether, that could have run into the billions of  euros.

Mr. Monti insisted the commission wasn't letting the companies off lightly. But he lamented the fact that under  European Union law, there are no criminal sanctions for price-fixing, as there are in the U.S. "We're working to make penalties more and more effective and more and more deterrent," he said.

In the 1999 U.S. case, Roche paid a  fine of $500 million (566.3 million  euros), and a former executive went to prison.

ROCHE, BASF and six other companies have been  fined a record 855.2 million  euros ($1.45 billion) after  European Union officials found them guilty of colluding on vitamin prices.
Roche, the world's number one vitamin maker, was  fined $780 million (462 million  euros), while
BASF was  fined $501 million (296 million  euros).

TD
The EU cited the companies, in locations ranging from  Europe to Japan, for rigging the market for
vitamins A, C, D and B complex.

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins," said competition commissioner Mario Monti.

The collusion allowed higher prices, "damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits," he said.

The previous largest  fine levied by the European Commission was $462 million, against TACA, a maritime container transport group, in September 1998.

The fines reflect a toughening of EU anti-trust enforcement since Monti took over in 1999. Roche's penalty was more than four times the previous record for an individual company, a $172 million  fine levied against Volkswagen for breaking EU free-trade laws.

Monti has also blocked four mergers since July and might  fine Microsoft for abusing its dominance of the software market.

Volkswagen's case also suggests any appeal could be limited. The carmaker had its fine reduced by about 10 per cent but the  European Court of Justice upheld the European Commission on the merits of its case.
The commission estimated that  European revenue just from vitamin C was cut in half after the
cartel was broken up.

Roche spokesman Horst Kramer said the company would study the decision before deciding on an appeal.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined eight companies a record 855 million  euros ($751.7 million) for allegedly fixing vitamin prices but, in an unprecedented move, let one firm almost
completely off the hook for informing on its rivals.

The alleged ringleader of the price-fixing  cartel, Roche Holding AG of Switzerland, was  fined 462 million euros, or 2.6% of its world-wide sales in 1999. The commission said it would have been justified in fining Roche as much as 962 million  euros, but that the sum was reduced because Roche cooperated with the investigation by providing documents the commission wanted.

TD
Roche was the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the scheme to fix prices on 12 separate vitamins in the 1990s, the commission said. Senior executives were involved, and even represented other cartel members as proxy in meetings in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, it said. BASF AG of Germany was another "paramount" player, helping Roche to recruit Japanese companies to the  cartel, the commission said, and was  fined 296 million euros.

BASF called the  fine excessive and said it might appeal the ruling. Roche, which also is weighing an appeal, said the amount was large but that it had provisioned for such a penalty. "We don't like so much the figure, but we're getting closer to putting this chapter behind us," a Roche spokesman said.

Aventis SA of France, formerly Rhone-Poulenc, was  fined just 5.04 million  euros because it cooperated with the inquiry by providing evidence of other companies' involvement, the commission said. Mario Monti, the EU antitrust commissioner, told a news conference Wednesday that the light fine for Aventis was intended to send a message to price-fixers to "cooperate at the earliest stage" of an investigation or face the consequences.

The other  cartel members fined were Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV of the Netherlands, Merck KgaA of Germany, and three Japanese companies: Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. , Eisai Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd.

Mr. Monti said the eight companies operated the "most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated" in terms of harm to consumers. The  cartel lasted from September 1989 through February 1999, and covered  vitamins A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C and D3 as well as biotin, folic acid, beta carotene and carotinoids. The commission didn't offer an overall monetary figure, but said Vitamin C prices in Europe dropped by more than half after the  cartel ended.

Still, the commission didn't impose the maximum penalty possible under the law: 10% of a company's annual sales during the last year in which the  cartel operated. Altogether, that could have run into the billions of euros.

A U.S. investigation into the same companies ended in 1999 with them pleading guilty in a settlement. In that case, Roche paid a  fine of $500 million, and a former executive went to prison.
The companies have two months to appeal to the  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS GOING TO  FINE THE SWITZERLAND COMPANY ROCHE, THE GERMAN COMPANY BASF, AND OTHER SIX COMPANIES. THE  FINE IS RECORD BREAKING, IT IS 855 MILLION  EURO ($751,3 MILLION). THE COMPANIES ARE ACCUSED OF COLLUSION AND FIXING PRICES AT THE MARKET OF  VITAMINS.

TD
During the investigation, which was conducted by the  European regulating bodies, it became clear that the companies have been involved in illegal activities for nine year. The damage the customers incurred accounts for a billion  euro. The company Hoffman-LaRoche is the largest vitamin producer in the world, which controls 50% of the market. Now it will pay the  fine of 296 million euro ($406 million), and the  fine of BASF amounts to 296 million  euro ($260 million).

The following companies were  fined as well: the French Aventis - 5,04 million  euro ($4,42 million), Belgium Solvay - 9,1 million  euro ($7,99 million), German Merck - 9,24 million  euro ($8,11 million). The following Japanese companies were fined as well: Daiichi - 23,4 million  euro ($20,5 million), Eisai - 13,23 million euro ($11,62 million) and Takeda Chemical Industries - 37,05 million  euro ($32,5 million). The companies agreed about the prices on such  vitamins as A, B1, B2, B6, D3, C, E, and polyvitamins.

The representative of the commission said that the French Aventis was the first of the illegal collusion participants to start cooperating with the investigators and it came up with valuable information about fixing the prices on vitamins. So its punishment was mitigated. Meanwhile the French company could not help the investigation with the vitamin D3, and therefore was  fined for "passive participation in the crime", connected with its product.

By the EC evaluation, in 1998 the volume of the vitamin market in the economical zone was about $703 million. For example, the market share of the vitamin A was $131 million, and that of vitamin E - $219 million.

The great amount of the fine the vitamin producers received broke the previous "record"-$240,9 million. It was the European commission that fined the sea ferrymen association "Transatlantic conference".

"Of all the violations investigated by the European commission and connected with fixing the prices, this agreement had the worst consequences for the customers", claimed M.Monti, the head of EC
anti-monopoly commission. According to him, the reason is that vitamin medications may be used in different products - like dry breakfasts, biscuits and drinks and even cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Only two years ago the American anti-monopoly bodies  fined Roche and BASF. They had to pay correspondingly $500 million and $225 million. Then they also fixed prices on  vitamins.

Today, November 21, 2001, the European Commission imposed fines amounting to EUR 855.22 million on 8 European and non-European vitamins manufacturers related to violations of antitrust laws. BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen, was informed today for the first time at 12:35 p.m. by the European Commission that it has been  fined EUR 296.16 million.

BASF did not expect such a  fine in this amount and believes that it is inappropriately high. BASF will carefully review the reasons for the decision. The company will then decide if it will lodge an appeal with the responsible  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg within the two-month legal time limit.

TD
The European Commission started investigations into a number of  vitamins manufacturers in 1999. BASF has cooperated with the European Commission throughout the investigations.

It is one of BASF's Principles that it strictly observes the laws of the countries in which it operates. In recent years, the company has strengthened measures to rule out violation of antitrust laws in future. These measures include:
* Additional training for senior executives with regard to antitrust legislation.

* A Group-wide Compliance Program based on BASF's Values and Principles. This obliges all employees to act in a legal fashion. Violations will not be tolerated and may have consequences under criminal and labor law.

* A hotline to an independent law office. Employees can confidentially seek advice regarding their own behavior or if they observe dubious practices in their work environment.
* Regular anti-cartel audits by the Corporate Audit department.

The European Commission has issued its biggest ever  fine of Euro 855.22 million on eight companies for operating market-sharing and price-fixing cartels affecting vitamin products. Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche, the largest vitamin producer in the world, was given the largest cumulative  fine of Euro 462 million (2.6% of its annual turn-over) because it had instigated and participated in all the cartels. Announcing the decision on November 21, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the  vitamins case was "the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated" and dubbed the companies involved "Vitamins  AG". The Commission waived a  fine on Aventis for co-operating with the investigation while the fines on Hoffman-La Roche and BASF were also reduced by 50% because they agreed to supply information to the Commission about the cartels.
..JJ:(EM)

TD
Following an investigation opened in May 1999, the European Commission found that 13  European and non-European companies participated in cartels aimed at eliminating competition in the vitamin A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D3, Biotin (H), Folic Acid (M), Beta Carotene and carotinoids markets. Hoffmann-La Roche and BASF, the two main vitamin producers, played a central role in virtually each and every  cartel, whilst other players were involved in only a limited number of vitamin products. Each  cartel had a specific number of participants and duration in time, although all operated between September 1989 and February
1999. Mr Monti said: "The companies' collusive behaviour enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits".Fines were imposed on the following eight companies:
- F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Switzerland):  Euro 462 million
- BASF AG (Germany):  Euro 296.16 million
- Aventis SA (France):  Euro 5.04 million
- Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV (Netherlands):  Euro 9.10 million
- Merck KgaA (Germany):Euro 9.24 million
- Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (Japan):  Euro 23.4 million
- Eisai Co Ltd (Japan):  Euro 13.23 million
- Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd (Japan):  Euro 37.05 million

The five remaining companies, Lonza AG (Germany), Kongo Chemical Co Ltd (Japan), Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd (Japan), Sumika  Fine Chemicals Ltd (Japan) and Tanabe Saiyaku Co Ltd (Japan) were not fined because the cartels in which they were involved - Vitamin H or Folic Acid - ended five years or more before the Commission opened its investigation.

The participants in each of the cartels fixed prices (i.e. "target" or "minimum" prices) for the different vitamin products, allocated sales quotas, agreed on compensation arrangements and implemented price increases and issued price announcements in accordance with their agreements. They also set up a system to monitor and enforce their agreements and participated in regular meetings to implement their plans.


Page 85 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The cartels were particularly important for the markets for  vitamins A and E, with certain variants in other products. 60% of world demand of  vitamins A and E is used in animal feed while vitamin C is used mainly in human nutrition. Hoffmann-La Roche acted as the agent and representative of the  European producers in the meetings and negotiations held in Japan and the Far East. BASF, the next largest vitamin producer worldwide, also played a major role. Both major  European producers effectively formed a common front in conceiving and implementing the arrangements with the Japanese producers concerned. Together, for example, they recruited Eisai to their "Club" in vitamin E. "Vitamins  Inc. would be a pretty accurate description of the cartel, or rather Vitamins  AG or Vitamins  SA," said Mr Monti.The Commission
estimated that the European Economic Area (EEA) market for the products covered in the decision was worth around Euro 800 million 1998. This includes vitamin E, which in 1998 was worth approximately Euro
250 million in the EEA and vitamin A, which represented some  Euro 150 million. Strikingly, European revenues in vitamin C slumped from  Euro 250 million in the last year the  cartel arrangements were in place (1995) to less than half -  Euro 120 million - three years later (1998).
Full immunity for co-operation.

Aventis (formerly Rh"ne-Poulenc) was granted full immunity in regard to its participation in the cartels in vitamins A and E because it was the first company to co-operate with the Commission and provided decisive evidence in the case of these two products. This is the first time that the Commission has granted a 100% reduction of a  fine under the terms of the Leniency Notice. A  fine was, however, imposed on Aventis for its passive participation in the vitamin D3 infringement, for which it provided no information to the Commission."Had Aventis not co-operated, it would have had to pay a  fine of Euro 113 million (compared to the current  Euro 5.04 million fine)," said Mario Monti. "The fact that the Commission has granted, for the first time, a total exemption of fines to a company illustrates its willingness to grant companies that actively co-operate at the 'earliest' stage a unique opportunity to get off the hook. Those companies that do not seize this chance must be aware of the responsibilities they will face," he warned.

Both Hoffmann La Roche and BASF also co-operated with the Commission at an early stage of the investigation by providing crucial information on all of the  vitamins cartels they had been involved in. The Commission granted a 50 percent reduction of the  fines to each company. The upper limit of any  fine is established at 10% of a company's total annual turnover.  Fines imposed by the Commission as a result of infringements of EU competition law are accounted into the general budget of the European Union once they have become definitive. The companies have three months to pay the imposed fines. Hoffmann-La Roche said it was considering appealing against the decision.In 1999 the main players of the cartels covered in the Commission's decision pleaded guilty to similar anti-competitive conduct in the United
States and paid heavy  fines, including $500 million for Hoffmann La Roche, $225 million for BASF and $72 million for Takeda.The Commissioner concluded by saying that "this decision shows that the Commission can be more incisive". "We have no criminal sanctions in our weaponry, but we are working towards effective punishment of cartels as well as deterrents." Mr Monti added that he thought that the
Commission's decision was also an opportunity to show that competition concerns can be overcome. "Each human activity and inhuman competition policy is a learning process and no one is perfect," he continued, referring to recent criticisms of several competition decisions he has made.

BASF has been  fined e296.16m and Aventis e5.04m. Other companies in the group included: Netherlands-based Solvay Pharmaceuticals (fined e9.10m) and Germany-based Merck (e9.24m).

The cartels were aimed at eliminating competition in the Vitamin A, E, B1, B5, B6, C, D3, Biotin and folic acid markets.

Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said: "This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of  vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products."

BASF and Roche said they would review the EC's decision before deciding whether to appeal. BASF had not expected such a large  fine and said it was "inappropriately high".

Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to impose fines of ?855 million (&#163;673 million) on eight vitamin companies is the most important price-fixing case in  Europe ever.

TD
The heaviest  fine was imposed on Hoffmann-La Roche which was  fined ?462 million because of its alleged role as the leader. Seven other firms were  fined amounts ranging from ?296 million to ?5 million. But the Commission said the  fines would have been almost double this had the companies not co-operated with the EU investigation.

The companies secretly colluded for 10 years on the price of almost every type of vitamin that goes into medicines, breakfast cereals, cosmetics and a range of food.

The case involved the highest collective  fines ever in a European cartel case. The fine is three times higher than any previous case, and seven times higher than the cement cartel in which Irish Cement was fined.

This case involved eight price-fixing cartels. They were sophisticated and highly secret -- it took the commission 30 months to investigate them. Some of them operated for a decade. They were organised at the highest level within the companies. Its members held regular meetings to police the cartel.

Significantly, the  vitamins covered by the cartels are found in a vast range of products, from food to cosmetics.

These fines mark a move away from the token  fines of the past to real  fines which bite. This EU decision is double trouble for some of these companies. The US authorities had also investigated the cartels in the US, and imposed  fines of $500 million on Hoffmann-La Roche and some of the other companies in this case. There is also the risk of national authorities in the member states also instituting proceedings, but these may not succeed.

The clear message if one suspects the existence of a  cartel seems to be to alert the  European Commission -- the first  cartel participant who alerts the commission about a  cartel and co-operates fully can get immunity. In this case, one company got a 100 per cent immunity in respect of those cartels about which it told the Commission.

Hoffman-La Roche was given the highest  fine (?462 million) because it was the instigator or ringleader but given a 50 per cent reduction because it co-operated with the Commission. So if you are not the first to alert the commission, it is useful to co-operate fully with it.

Five other companies were lucky to escape liability on the basis of a technicality because the cartels in which they were involved ended more than five years before the commission's investigation started, and under EU law cartels ended five years or more are not subject to investigation.

The fine goes to fund the EU's operations but because of this windfall, the member states (and the taxpayers in each state) will have less to contribute to EU funding.

It could happen here. Both national and international cartels could be operating here. Indeed, there is evidence that some international cartels in some industries have held meetings in Ireland.

At present we do not have an immunity programme so it would not be possible for anyone to claim immunity. But the Competition Authority is helpfully putting together an immunity programme, and no doubt we will see similar cases in Ireland in the not-too-distant future.
The key lessons for business executives from this case are:

* Don't fix prices with competitors -- not even 'target' or 'minimum' prices, which some businesspeople might see as inoffensive
* Don't fix quotas or market allocations with competitors
* Don't share competitive information (such as sales and production information) with competitors
* Don't fix the announcement of price changes with competitors
* Don't try to arrange with other competitors to guard the status quo in the market
* EC competition law applies even to companies which are established outside the EU.

This is a cause ce&#180; le bre which cost consumers dearly in the past, but it sets a precedent which may stop cartels in other sectors being formed in the future.

HD          News - Sales slump as Britons lose faith in vitamin  pills. BY          By SUSAN BISSETT.

THE GREAT vitamin pill craze is over. New figures reveal that shoppers are spending millions of pounds less on the expensive diet supplements.

Britons spent nearly #5 million less on  vitamins and mineral tablets in the year 2000 than in 1999. The turnaround has been welcomed by consumer groups and health advisers who say that, for most people, taking vitamin or mineral pills is a "waste of time".

TD
Sue Davies, of the Consumers' Association, said: "It's good news. Consumers have been overcharged on vitamins and our research shows that people don't really trust the manufacturers of  vitamins and want them regulated."

A survey by the Pharmaceutical Association of Great Britain found that the sum of money spent on vitamin and mineral supplements in Britain jumped substantially between 1998 and 1999, from #292.2 million to #310.1 million a year, an increase of just over six per cent. That was sharply reversed in
2000, when purchases through chemists' and grocers' shops fell 1.5 per cent to #305.3 million. The drop in sales was almost entirely accounted for by a 9.4 per cent fall in the sum spent on tablets containing single  vitamins. Sales of multivitamins and minerals were also down.

The fall is another blow to the vitamin industry, which was  fined a record #543 million by the  European Commission last week for operating a price-fixing  cartel in Britain and  Europe. The Commission imposed fines on eight manufacturers, reserving the largest  fine - #289 million - for Hoffmann-La Roche, the makers of Sanatogen and Redoxon. The company was said to be the "prime mover" behind deals to fix the price of  vitamins sold in bulk to fortify breakfast cereals, bread and other foods.

According to the Commission, in the case of just one vitamin, vitamin C, manufacturers earned more than #150 million a year from its bulk sale when the  cartel was in operation. That collapsed to #75 million a year when the conspiracy ended. Phil Evans, a principal policy adviser with the Consumers' Association, claimed that the vitamin  cartel would have had an indirect effect on the price of  vitamins in Britain.

"Manufacturers of vitamin tablets for the UK would have been overcharged because of this  cartel and passed those charges on to consumers."

Manufacturers have denied any price fixing of household vitamin pills and say the reason for the fall in the sum spent on tablets is unclear. The sudden decline, however, reverses years of almost unbroken sales growth.

Judith Hendry, the spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, said: "It's good news. People are, we hope, realising that they don't have to buy supplements. They can get their requirements from foods.

"For some groups in the population  vitamins are important, such as elderly people with a very poor diet, pregnant women or women intending to get pregnant. But having said that, there are huge numbers of people taking  vitamins who do not need to."




Page 90 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
She said that the public was more sceptical of claims made by vitamin manufacturers. "When you look at the amount spent advertising  vitamins and the amount spent advertising fruit and vegetables there is no comparison, but I think people are becoming more questioning."

Gaina Bussell, a dietitian, said: "People are starting to take notice of facts and figures about  vitamins and realise that they shouldn't be treated like Smarties. We know that vitamin and mineral supplements don't seem to work in most cases. It is better to get your nutrients through fruit and vegetables."

Miss Davies added: "Some  vitamins are unsafe if you take too much. The UK and the  European Union have established a working group to set limits on the level of  vitamins in supplements for the first time. This is more of an issue because food manufacturers are adding more  vitamins to fortify food."

Business - Blowing the final whistle - As Brussels blasts the drug giants, the man who took on Roche and was jailed for it talks to Nick Mathiason.

NEVER has the European Commission seen such a serious example of concerted price-fixing between giant corporations.

TD
Usually timid, the Commission last week let rip. Some of the world's biggest drug companies, including giant Swiss pharma, Roche, were  fined a record #523 million.

Mario Monti, the European Commission's competition director-general, said that 13 companies illegally colluded to raise the price of vitamin pills and  vitamins added to foodstuffs. He added that the  cartel could be dubbed 'Vitamin Inc' and was the most damaging case the commission had ever investigated, as it continued throughout the entire Nineties and involved substances vital for healthy living.

To Stanley Adams, Monti's ruling came as no surprise. He's seen it all before. The 74-year-old blew the whistle on Roche nearly 30 years ago. It was Adams who handed over documents to the  European Economic Community, as it was then, detailing how Roche kept the price of  vitamins high with the explicit collusion of its supposed rivals. Some things never change.

Adams said he would help the EEC with its investigation in return for anonymity. But the EEC bungled badly. It allowed a Roche official to photocopy some of the incriminating documents.

The documents came from Adams's office. They had his signature on them. He was sunk. The Swiss authorities arrested him and called him a spy. Adams's wife was told that he faced a 20-year jail term for industrial espionage. She committed suicide. In the end, Adams served six months in a Swiss prison.
But it took the Maltese-born whistleblower more than 10 years to wheedle compensation from  Europe through the courts. In 1985 the  European Union agreed to pay Adams #200,000 - #300,000 less than he wanted.

Alone in his flat in Weymouth, Dorset, the veteran Labour supporter is full of bitterness and derision. His targets are manifold. He says the EU, drug companies, politicians - the whole shooting match - are all as bad as each other.

But one thing cheers him - the level of the drug companies'  fines. 'I'm very happy, even though in my opinion they got off lightly,' he said in a heavy Mediterranean accent. 'My wife committed suicide. They've been at it since the Sixties. In some ways I feel vindicated and that the work I started is coming to an end.

'But the courts don't have the guts to take the necessary action. How is it that in the US they imprison company directors? It should happen in  Europe.'
Not surprisingly, Adams hates the European Commission. 'Because of their stupidity, I was in the shit.'




Page 92 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said that most major drug companies have senior politicians on their payroll to serve their interests.
'In England it was Lord Paget [now dead]. He was Roche's man. He was the only one who stood up in
the Lords and said I was a spy. The son of a bitch.'

Adams may be unfazed by the severity of the  fines issued by Monti. But the ruling stunned businessmen. German chemical group BASF, which was  fined #185m, expressed anger at the punishment and indicated that it may appeal. If it does, it risks an even greater punishment, warned an EU spokesman for Monti this weekend.

The size of the  fine staggered anti-trust lawyers. 'Super Mario has got his half a billion,' said Michael Cutting, an anti-trust lawyer at Linklaters & Alliance. 'The aggregate level of  fines is massive. There has to be appeals.'

The trial will continue to have huge ramifications. Chief among them is the treatment by Europe of companies that volunteer information. Aventis was the first company to come to the European Commission and escaped with a paltry #3m  fine. This is what  Europe wants to encourage.

The Commission is preparing to take on a more muscular approach to  cartel-busting. It is delegating increasing competition powers to individual countries so that it can work on the bigger cases.
But it is still dreadfully slow. It's been nearly two years since the EC announced it was investigating
Sotheby's and Christie's on price-fixing charges. It has yet to decide whether it is going to bring charges.

But Adams can't put all the blame on Roche and the Commission for his present situation. The one-time leftwing cause celebre and friend of Labour high-fliers, emerged from prison three years ago, having served five and a half years for the attempted murder of his second wife. He had hired a hitman, wanting to benefit from her life insurance.
'It is my biggest regret,' he says. 'If I had not done that, I would have been in the House of Lords today.'.

Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to impose fines of &#8364;855 million (&#163;673 million) on eight vitamin companies is the most important price-fixing case in  Europe ever.

TD
The heaviest  fine was imposed on Hoffmann-La Roche which was  fined &#8364;462 million because of its alleged role as the leader. Seven other firms were fined amounts ranging from &#8364;296 million to &#8364;5 million. But the Commission said the fines would have been almost double this had the companies not co-operated with the EU investigation.

The companies secretly colluded for 10 years on the price of almost every type of vitamin that goes into medicines, breakfast cereals, cosmetics and a range of food.

The case involved the highest collective  fines ever in a European cartel case. The fine is three times higher than any previous case, and seven times higher than the cement cartel in which Irish Cement was fined.

This case involved eight price-fixing cartels. They were sophisticated and highly secret -- it took the commission 30 months to investigate them. Some of them operated for a decade. They were organised at the highest level within the companies. Its members held regular meetings to police the cartel.

Significantly, the  vitamins covered by the cartels are found in a vast range of products, from food to cosmetics.

These fines mark a move away from the token  fines of the past to real  fines which bite. This EU decision is double trouble for some of these companies. The US authorities had also investigated the cartels in the US, and imposed  fines of $500 million on Hoffmann-La Roche and some of the other companies in this case. There is also the risk of national authorities in the member states also instituting proceedings, but these may not succeed.

The clear message if one suspects the existence of a  cartel seems to be to alert the  European Commission -- the first  cartel participant who alerts the commission about a  cartel and co-operates fully can get immunity. In this case, one company got a 100 per cent immunity in respect of those cartels about which it told the Commission.

Hoffman-La Roche was given the highest  fine (&#8364;462 million) because it was the instigator or ringleader but given a 50 per cent reduction because it co-operated with the Commission. So if you are not the first to alert the commission, it is useful to co-operate fully with it.

Five other companies were lucky to escape liability on the basis of a technicality because the cartels in which they were involved ended more than five years before the commission's investigation started, and under EU law cartels ended five years or more are not subject to investigation.

The fine goes to fund the EU's operations but because of this windfall, the member states (and the taxpayers in each state) will have less to contribute to EU funding.

Eight companies have been  fined a total of EUR 855.2 M by the European Commission for their involvement in a 9 year vitamin price fixing  cartel. Roche faces the largest fine of EUR 462 M, which the company says is covered in a provision made in 1999. BASF's  fine of EUR 296.16 M exceeds its provisions. The other companies receiving  fines are Aventis SA (EUR 5.04 M), Solvay Pharmaceuticals (EUR 9.10 M), Merck KGgA (EUR 9.24 M), Daiichi Pharmaceutical (EUR 23.40 M), Eisai (EUR 13.23 M) and Takeda Chemical Industries (EUR 37.05 M). The EC claims 13 companies participated in cartels from
1989-1999, aimed at eliminating competition in  vitamins A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D, biotin, beta-carotene, folic acid and carotinoids. Five companies: Lonza, Kongo Chemical, Sumitomo Chemical, Sumika  Fine Chemicals and Tanabe Seiyaku escaped  fines as the cartels they were involved in were wound up 5 years or more before the EC began its investigations. Roche has a 50% share of the global  vitamins market.

The European Commission has fined the members of the 10 year  cartel in vitamins. The Commission called the case the most serious of its type that it had to deal with, and inflicted record fines, totalling EUR
855.22 M. The biggest  fines were the EUR 462 M and EUR 296 M for Roche and BASF respectively. This item details too the other amounts, for Takeda, Daiichi, Eisai Pharmaceutical, Solvay Pharmaceutical, Merck (Darmstadt) and Aventis. The  fines imposed earlier in the US for the same offence are listed. Aventis escaped a US  fine by cooperating with the authorities, but was included in the European Commission fines. Roche complains that its  fine is too big, since it cooperated with the European authorities. BASF finds its own  fine too high. Roche is studying whether to appeal.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 21 Kyodo

The European Union on Wednesday slapped a total of 855.22 million  euros ($751.14 million) in  fines against three Japanese and five  European pharmaceutical makers for allegedly forming a vitamin price cartel.

TD
The three Japanese drug companies involved are Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Daiichi
Pharmaceutical Co. and Eisai Co.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the 15-member EU, accused the eight companies of illegally controlling prices of vitamins that are used as ingredients in drug products and animal feeds.
Takeda was fined 37 million euros, Daiichi 23.4 million  euros, and Eisai 13.2 million  euros.

Last April, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued a warning against Daiichi and Eisai, accusing them of forming an international  cartel.

BASF of Germany, the world's largest chemicals group, is expected to report a fourth-quarter loss as a result of extra provisions for a  Euros 296m ( $261m) fine imposed by the European Commission for its part in a price-fixing  cartel.

BASF confirmed yesterday that it would book the additional charges in the fourth quarter. Expected to be about Euros 200m, these charges are forecast to push BASF into the red in the current quarter. However, BASF declined to comment on fourth-quarter results and insisted that results for the full year would still be positive.

Last week, Mario Monti, the EU's commissioner for competition,  fined seven European and Japanese chemicals companies a record sum of  Euros 850m in total for colluding to keeping vitamin prices artificially high in the 1990s.

Roche of Switzerland received the biggest  fine with Euros 462m. BASF was criticised by the  European Commission for leading the  cartel alongside Roche, "assuming a paramount role in Roche's lead". Its Euros 296m fine was the second biggest.

BASF had already paid a total of  Euros 233m in fines to US, Canadian and Australian regulators. Expenses for out-of-court settlements, legal costs, and  fines related to its involvement in the  cartel, which was known as "Vitamins  Inc", are expected to cost BASF up to  Euros 900m.
Roche had already set aside  Euros 1.64bn for potential antitrust  fines in 1999.

After Mr Monti announced the  fine, Roche said its provisions would be sufficient and that results for this year would not be affected.

It is unclear whether BASF will appeal against the decision. The group not only considers the sum inappropriately high but also feels badly treated by Brussels' information policy.

It is annoyed that details about the  fine were leaked before the companies were informed. Even now an explanatory statement has not yet arrived at the group's headquarters in the town of Ludwigshaffen.

HD     BASF to increase fourth-quarter provisions in face of vitamin  fine

LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany, Nov 28 (AFP) - BASF, the world's largest chemical groups, will have to increase its risk provisions for the fourth quarter because of a  fine by the European Commission for its part in a price-fixing  cartel, a spokesman said on Wednesday.

"The fine is higher than we thought. We will therefore have to up our provisions accordingly to make up the difference," spokesman Michael Grabicki told AFP.

TD
The EU fined BASF about 296 million euros (261 million dollars) last week for its part in a conspiracy to fix the price for some highly popular vitamins.

At the time, BASF described the  fine as "inappropriately high" and indicated it might appeal against the decision.

Grabicki declined to say how much BASF would have to decide to cover the additional provisions, nor what effect that might have on fourth-quarter earnings.

A report in the Financial Times Deutschland on Wednesday said the provisions were expected to amount to 200 million euros, which would push the group into loss in the fourth quarter.

Grabicki merely pointed to recent comments by BASF chairman Juergen Strube who had predicted that fourth-quarter business "will probably be less favourable" that in the third quarter.
That was before the EU imposed the  fine, the spokesman added.

Looking at the year as a whole, BASF's earnings would remain "positive, but will fall short of last year's levels," said Grabicki.

Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to impose fines of ?855 million (&#163;673 million) on eight vitamin companies is the most important price-fixing case in  Europe ever.

TD
The heaviest  fine was imposed on Hoffmann-La Roche which was  fined ?462 million because of its alleged role as the leader. Seven other firms were  fined amounts ranging from ?296 million to ?5 million. But the Commission said the  fines would have been almost double this had the companies not co-operated with the EU investigation.

The companies secretly colluded for 10 years on the price of almost every type of vitamin that goes into medicines, breakfast cereals, cosmetics and a range of food.

The case involved the highest collective  fines ever in a European cartel case. The fine is three times higher than any previous case, and seven times higher than the cement cartel in which Irish Cement was fined.

This case involved eight price-fixing cartels. They were sophisticated and highly secret -- it took the commission 30 months to investigate them. Some of them operated for a decade. They were organised at the highest level within the companies. Its members held regular meetings to police the cartel.

Significantly, the  vitamins covered by the cartels are found in a vast range of products, from food to cosmetics.

These fines mark a move away from the token  fines of the past to real  fines which bite. This EU decision is double trouble for some of these companies. The US authorities had also investigated the cartels in the US, and imposed  fines of $500 million on Hoffmann-La Roche and some of the other companies in this case. There is also the risk of national authorities in the member states also instituting proceedings, but these may not succeed.

The clear message if one suspects the existence of a  cartel seems to be to alert the  European Commission -- the first  cartel participant who alerts the commission about a  cartel and co-operates fully can get immunity. In this case, one company got a 100 per cent immunity in respect of those cartels about which it told the Commission.

Hoffman-La Roche was given the highest  fine (?462 million) because it was the instigator or ringleader but given a 50 per cent reduction because it co-operated with the Commission. So if you are not the first to alert the commission, it is useful to co-operate fully with it.

Five other companies were lucky to escape liability on the basis of a technicality because the cartels in which they were involved ended more than five years before the commission's investigation started, and under EU law cartels ended five years or more are not subject to investigation.

The fine goes to fund the EU's operations but because of this windfall, the member states (and the taxpayers in each state) will have less to contribute to EU funding.

It could happen here. Both national and international cartels could be operating here. Indeed, there is evidence that some international cartels in some industries have held meetings in Ireland.

At present we do not have an immunity programme so it would not be possible for anyone to claim immunity. But the Competition Authority is helpfully putting together an immunity programme, and no doubt we will see similar cases in Ireland in the not-too-distant future.
The key lessons for business executives from this case are:

* Don't fix prices with competitors -- not even 'target' or 'minimum' prices, which some businesspeople might see as inoffensive
* Don't fix quotas or market allocations with competitors
* Don't share competitive information (such as sales and production information) with competitors
* Don't fix the announcement of price changes with competitors
* Don't try to arrange with other competitors to guard the status quo in the market
* EC competition law applies even to companies which are established outside the EU.

This is a cause ce&#180; le bre which cost consumers dearly in the past, but it sets a precedent which may stop cartels in other sectors being formed in the future.

The European Commission has imposed record fines of 855.22 million  euros (L534m; $753m) on eight pharmaceutical companies for operating secret market sharing and price fixing cartels in the supply of vitamins throughout the 1990s.

The heaviest penalty of 462 million  euros was handed out to the Swiss based multinational Hoffman-La Roche. The investigators maintain that the company was the chief instigator and was involved in all 12 cartels that they uncovered. Hoffmann-La Roche is the largest vitamin producer in the world, with about half of the overall market share.

TD
The German company BASF, which is second in size only to Hoffman-La Roche, was accused of following its lead and was handed a penalty of 296.1 million  euros. Lower fines were imposed on three Japanese manufacturers and on a further trio of  European companies-Merck KgaA (Germany), Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV (Netherlands), and Aventis SA (France). As Aventis was the first to cooperate with the investigation and had supplied decisive evidence, its penalty was considerably reduced.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION in November fined eight companies a total of $755.1 million for participating in eight distinct secret Market-sharing and price-fixing cartels affecting vitamin products. Each cartel had a specific number of participants and duration, although all operated between September 1989 and February 1999.

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics" said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "The companies' collusive behavior enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits. It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behavior concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life."

TD
Following the opening of an investigation in May 1999, the European Commission found that 13
European and non-European companies participated in cartels aimed at eliminating competition in the
vitamin A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D3, Biotin (H), Folic Acid (M), Beta Carotene and carotinoids markets.

Monti said that a striking feature of this complex of infringements was the central role played by Hoffmann-La Roche and BASF, the two main vitamin producers, in virtually each and every  cartel, while other players were involved in only a limited number of vitamin products.

As an instigator who participated in all the cartels, Swiss-based Hoffman-La Roche was given the highest cumulative fine of $462 million. The German BASF was  fined $296.16 million.

HD     VITAMIN MAKERS FACE HIGH FINES OVER 1990s CARTELS WC    941 words

The European Commission Nov. 21 slapped record  fines on eight vitamin makers over a series of cartels formed in the 1990s. The  fines, totaling 855.22 million  euros (about the same in U.S. dollars), are the highest ever imposed on firms guilty of operating illegal cartels in the E.U.; the previous biggest combined fine only came to a third of this amount.

"This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated,"  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement. "The companies' collusive behavior enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play."

TD
The commission singled out Swiss-based Hoffmann-La Roche and Germany's BASF for criticism, saying the "central role" the two played was "a striking feature" of the infringements. The other firms were only involved in a limited number of vitamin cartels.

Roche received the largest cumulative  fine 462 million euros because it "was an instigator and participated in all the cartels," the commission wrote. Other fines are:
* BASF (Germany), 296.16 million  euros.
* Merck (Germany), 9.24 million  euros.
* Solvay (the Netherlands), 9.10 million  euros.
* Aventis (France), 5.04 million  euros.

Three Japanese firms also participated in the cartels. Takeda Chemical Industries will pay 37.05 million euros, Daiichi Pharmaceutical 23.4 million  euros and Eisai 13.23 million  euros. No U.S.-based companies were involved.

Five other vitamin makers that took part could not be  fined because the vitamin H and folic acid cartels in which they were involved ended five years or more before the commission started its investigation in May
1999. E.U. laws on prescription meant that Kongo Chemical (Japan), Lonza (Germany), Sumika  Fine Chemicals (Japan), Sumitomo Chemical (Japan) and Tanabe Saiyaku (Japan) escaped  fines. Prescription also applied to vitamin B1 and B6 cartels.

Aventis (formerly Rhone-Poulenc) also was granted full immunity from its part in the vitamin A and E cartels because it was the first company to co-operate with the commission and "provided decisive evidence in the case of these two products."

This was the first time the commission granted a 100 percent reduction in a  fine under the Leniency Notice. Aventis was  fined for its part in the vitamin D3  cartel, on which it provided no information to the commission.

"The fact that the commission has granted, for the first time, a total exemption of  fines to a company illustrates its willingness to grant companies that actively cooperate at the earliest stage a unique opportunity to get off the hook," Monti said. Roche and BASF also cooperated with the commission early in the investigation and received a 50 percent reduction on the  fines. The other five firms also had their fines reduced after co-operating with the commission.

The commission's Nov. 21 statement said that participants in each  cartel fixed prices for the different vitamin products, allocated sales quotas, agreed on and implemented price rises and issued price

Page 106 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
announcements in line with their agreements. The firms also set up a system for monitoring and enforcing the cartel deals.

The cartels worked almost identically, and each involved two key features: establishment of a formal structure and hierarchy of different management levels, often with overlapping membership at the most senior levels to ensure the cartels functioned; and the exchange of sales values, sales volumes and pricing information on a quarterly or monthly basis at regular meetings. The largest cartels also prepared,
agreed to and implemented an annual "budget" followed by adjustment of actual sales achieved to comply with the quotas allocated.

Roche represented the  European producers at meetings in Japan. The firm, which controls some 50 percent of the world vitamin market, was the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the schemes, which covered its full product range, the commission said.

The fact that the company's most senior executives were involved confirms that "the arrangements were part of a strategic plan conceived at the highest levels to control the world market in  vitamins by illegal means," the commission said. BASF, the world's next largest vitamin producer, also assumed a large role, according to the commission.

The commission estimated that the  European Economic Area (the E.U., plus Iceland and Norway) market for vitamins linked to the cartels was worth around 800 million  euros in 1998 including vitamin E, which was worth about 250 million  euros alone, and vitamin A, worth about 150 million  euros.
The commission also said that  European revenues in vitamin C fell sharply after the cartels ended, from
250 million euros in 1995, the last year they were in place, to 120 million  euros in 1998. In 1999 the key
players in the cartels covered by the commission's Nov. 21 decision pleaded guilty to similar
anti-competitive conduct in the U.S. and were  fined heavily. Roche paid $500 million, BASF $225 million
and Takeda $72 million.

The eight firms now have three months to pay the fines but can appeal. Any appeal must be lodged within two months. The  European Court has reduced large fines in the past, notably those involving three 1994 decisions covering cartonboard, cement and steel beams.

In a Nov. 21 statement, BASF said it "did not expect such a  fine in this amount and believes it is inappropriately high." The company said that it was reviewing the decision to see whether it would lodge an appeal. Roche also looks set to appeal. "Roche is reviewing the European Commission's decision in order to decide on the appeal against the sentence," a company statement said.

The European Commission has issued its biggest ever  fine of EUR 855.22 M on 8 companies for operating market-sharing and price-fixing cartels affecting vitamin products. Hoffmann-La Roche, the largest vitamin producer in the world, was given the largest cumulative  fine of EUR 462 M (2.6% of its annual turnover) because it had instigated and participated in all the cartels. The Commission waived a fine on Aventis for co-operating with the investigation while the  fines on Hoffmann-La Roche and BASF
were also reduced by 50% because they agreed to supply information to the Commission about the cartels. The Commission found that 13  European and non-European companies participated in cartels aimed at eliminating competition in the vitamin A, E, B1, B2, B5, B6, C, D3, Biotin (H), Folic Acid (M), Beta Carotene and carotinoids markets.

TD
Other fines imposed were EUR 296.16 M on BASF, EUR 5.04 M on Aventis SA, EUR 9.10 M on Solvay
Pharmaceuticals NV, EUR 9.24 M on Merck KGaA, EUR 23.4 M on Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, EUR
13.23 M on Eisai Co Ltd and EUR 37.05 M on Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. The five remaining
companies, Lonza AG, Kongo Chemical Co Ltd, Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd, Sumika  Fine Chemicals Ltd
and Tanabe Saiyaku Co Ltd were not  fined because the cartels in which they were involved (Vitamin H or
Folic Acid) ended five years or more before the Commission opened its investigation. 60% of world demand
of vitamins A and E is used in animal feed while vitamin C is used mainly in human nutrition. The
Commission estimated that the  European Economic Area market for the products covered in the decision
was worth around EUR 800 M in 1998. This includes vitamin E, which in 1998 was worth approximately
EUR 250 M in the EEA and vitamin A, which represented some EUR 150 M. Strikingly,  European
revenues in vitamin C slumped from EUR 250 M in the last year the cartel arrangements were in place
(1995) to less than half, EUR 120 M, three years later (1998). A fine was imposed on Aventis for its
passive participation in the vitamin D3 infringement, for which it provided no information to the Commission.
In 1999, the main players of the cartels covered in the Commission's decision pleaded guilty to similar
anti-competitive conduct in the US and paid heavy  fines, including $500 M for Hoffmann-La Roche, $225 M
for BASF and $72 M for Takeda.

THE WEEK: December 5, 2001
Huntsman Skips Bond Payments; Seeks Fnancial Restructuring

TD
Huntsman Corp. and its Huntsman Polymer subsidiary say they will skip bond payments due in December and January, and they have initiated talks with bondholders aimed at restructuring debt. Huntsman has retained Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (New York) as financial adviser and investment banker to assist in the debt restructuring. Huntsman also is talking with lenders to secure a three- to six-month waiver of requirements under its bank debt facility, according to SEC filings. The company says it has received a financing commitment from its lead lender Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown (New York) for $80 million-$150 million to fund day-to-day operations. The financing will be secured against future accounts receivables. Huntsman Corp. and its U.S. subsidiaries have an estimated $3.6 billion in outstanding debt. Huntsman is expected to develop a plan to swap part of its outstanding debt for equity, a financial source says. A Huntsman official would not comment on the financial restructuring, but he says "a bankruptcy filing is not imminent and is not under consideration at this point."
Enron on the Brink of Bankruptcy

Enron was on the brink of bankruptcy late last week after Dynegy backed out of a $9-billion deal to buy the company (CW, Nov. 14, p. 9). Enron chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay says the company is working "to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses." But EnronOnline, a leading online petrochemical trading exchange, was closed at CV/press time late last week. Enron's stock was trading at about 35 cts/share on Thursday, down from its 52-week high of $84.87/share a year ago, and the major credit rating agencies downgraded Enron's long-term debt to below junk status. The SEC is investigating Enron for financial reporting irregularities.
Degussa, Engineered Carbons Merge Carbon Black Units

Degussa and Engineered Carbons (Port Neches, TX) have signed a letter of intent to combine their respective North American carbon black businesses. The 50-50 joint venture, Degussa Engineered Carbons (Parsippany, NJ), is slated to begin operations on January 1. The jv will have six plants with a capacity of more than 1 billion lbs/year, overtaking Columbian Chemicals as the second-largest carbon black maker in North America, behind Cabot.
Technology Flavors A Fragrances to Merge with Belmay

Technology Flavors & Fragrances (TFF; Amityville, NY) says it will merge with privately held fragrances firm Belmay Holding (Yonkers, NY). TFF says it will issue new shares of common stock when the deal closes, giving Belmay shareholders 75% of TFF's common stock. The combined company, to be called Belmay/TFF, will have sales in excess of $60 million/year. Ted Kesten, president and CEO of Belmay, will become chairman and CEO of Belmay/TFF; Philip Rosner, chairman and CEO of TFF, will become vice chairman. Lawmakers Reach Accord on Mexican Truck Access

The House and Senate reached a tentative agreement last week that would allow Mexican long-haul trucks access to U.S. roads, provided they meet a series of safety requirements. The House previously voted for an outright ban on long-haul Mexican carriers, a measure President Bush had threatened to veto. A competing bill in the Senate would have allowed access provided certain safety requirements are met

(CW, Aug. 1, 2001, p. 5). The compromise includes requirements that Mexican carriers of hazardous materials be subject to spot checks, insured by a U.S.-licensed company, and that truckers' licenses be electronically screened. Congress must approve the compromise bill.
Bayer to Consolidate Electronic Chemicals within Starck

Bayer Corp. says it will consolidate its electronic chemicals operations within its H.C. Starck (Newton, MA) subsidiary, effective January 1.

* Cambrex Combines Chemical Units

Cambrex says it will combine its six specialty and  fine chemical operating units into a new subsidiary, Rutherford Chemicals. It will include CasChem, Cosan Chemical, Heico Chemicals, Nepera, Seal Sands Chemicals, and Zeeland Chemicals. Keith Hendersen, president of Cambrex  Fine Chemicals, will become president of Rutherford Chemicals. The company expects to take a charge of $10 million-$20 million in the fourth quarter to cover asset write downs, severance, and other costs; it did not provide details.
Separately, Cambrex says it has obtained a new $430-million credit facility from a group of banks led by
J.P Morgan Chase. (New York).
* Gases Prices on the Way Up

Air Products and Chemicals says it will increase schedule pricing on bulk and liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon and hydrogen by 8%, and raise packaged gases prices 5%. Praxair says it will increase prices for acetylene, carbon dioxide, cylinder helium, and oxygen by 7%-15% in Canada, and reduce discounts in the U.S.
* FMC Completes Equipment Spin-Off...

FMC Corp. says it will spin off its 83% stake in FMC Technologies as a tax-free dividend to FMC Corp. shareholders at year-end. FMC Corp. sold a 17% stake in FMC Technologies, an equipment supplier to the energy, food, and transportation industries, via an initial public offering this past June.
* ...Forms Agchems Agreement with ISK

FMC and Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha (ISK) say they have agreed to an alliance in the Japanese agchems market. ISK Bioscience will sell FMC's insecticide products in Japan, and the companies will collaborate on product development.
* EniChem Divestment Expected Soon

The acquisition of EniChem from ENI (Rome), most likely by Sabic, will be completed within days, say Italian press reports. ENI (Rome) says that discussions to sell EniChem are "going well." The company recently confirmed that it is in talks to sell EniChem to Sabic (CW, Oct 17 p. 20). The first stage of the proposed deal involves the sale of a 51 % stake in EniChem for 13.5 billion ($1.5 billion), local press reports say. The remaining 49% will be sold in 2005. EniChem's units in Sardinia are excluded from the deal.
* MBO For Wacker's Silicon Carbide

Wacker-Chemie has sold its EUR65-million ($57 million)/year silicon carbide business to a management buyout team. The business has plants at Freshen-Grefrath, Germany and Delfzijl, the Netherlands. It has been on the block for five years. Wacker expects to report a loss this year (p. 20).
* BASF May Post a Loss; Cuts EPS Output
Analysts expect BASF to post a fourthquarter loss as a result of a planned provision, estimated at about
200 million ($175 million), for a 296-million  fine imposed by the European Commission to punish BASF
for its participation in a  vitamins cartel (p. 19). Separately, BASF says it has cut expandable polystyrene
(EPS) production by 25% at Ludwigshafen until the end of January, as part of a recently announced
program of output cuts (CW Nov. 21/28, p. 15).

* Three Firms Plan Joint Bid for Unipetrol

MOL (Budapest), TVK (Tiszaujvaros, Hungary), and OMV say they are discussing a possible joint bid for the Czech government's 62.99% stake in Unipetrol. The government recently issued a shorlist of bidders that included OMV bidding with Agrofert Holding (Prague), and MOL bidding with TVK (CW, Oct. 31, p. 6). OMV, however, has since abandoned its planned bid with Agrofert to link up with MOL and TVK.
Rhodia Ends Talks with Clariant; DSM May Acquire Stake

Rhodia has confirmed that it has held merger negotiations with Clariant, but it says that those talks came to an end last month (CW, Nov. 7 p. 6). The companies failed to agree on how to restructure the merged entity, sources say. Rhodia may seek another partner, says CEO Jean-Pierre Tirouflet. DSM previously confirmed that it had made a preliminary approach to Aventis with a view to buying Aventis's 25% stake in Rhodia. Analysts say that DSM will be better equipped financially to make a bid for Rhodia once DSM completes the planned E 1.2-billion ($1 billion) sale of its stake in gas company Energie Beheer Nederland to the Dutch government. Further details of that deal, which is scheduled for completion on December 28, were not disclosed. DSM is also negotiating to sell its petrochemicals business to ExxonMobil Chemical or Sabic.
Production Growth Slows Down in  Europe

Chemical industry output growth in the  European Union (EU) will slow to 1.1% in 2001, from 4.6% last year, Cefic says. Output growth will recover to 1.8% in 2002, it says. EU chemicals output, excluding pharmaceuticals, will decline this year by 1. 1%, and increase in 2002 by 0.8%, it adds. Cefic cites "the slowdown in world economic activity, especially the recession in the U.S. and Japan." Cefic forecasts that U.S. chemical output will fall 4. 1% in 2001, after rising 1.8% last year, and will rise 1.8% next year. U.S. output, excluding pharmaceuticals, will drop 10% this year, however, Cefic says.
Kemira's Fertilizers to Become a Separate Entity

Private equity capital firm Industri Kapital (Stockholm) and Finland's ministry of trade and industry have agreed that Kemira's fertilizer business will become a separate entity on completion of the previously announced merger between Industri Kapital's chemical subsidiaries, Dynea and Sydsvenska Kemi, and the rest of Kemira (CW, Sept. 12, p. 15). The Finnish government, which owns 56% of Kemira, will keep a majority stake in the fertilizer business, but it will sell its share of the rest of Kemira to Industri Kapital as part of the deal. The agreement addresses concerns recently expressed by Finland's agriculture and forestry commission, and by certain members of the Finnish parliament, over possible plant closures and job losses in the fertilizer business after the merger. The parliament will vote on the merger in
mid-December.
Israel Chemicals Buys UX Potash Producer

Israel Chemicals (ICL; Tel Aviv) has agreed to buy Cleveland Potash (Saltburn-by-the-Sea, U.K.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American (London), for $45 million. ICL, a leading potash producer, says that the deal is subject to antitrust approval and could take up to four months to complete. Cleveland Potash posted sales of 90 million ($125 million) last year. ICL posted a 46% drop in third-quarter net profits, to $16 million, on sales down 7%, to $450 million.
Altana. to Create 2,000 JoK- Build U.& Genomics Center

Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals company Altana (Bad Homburg, Germany) has announced plans to create 2,000 jobs over the next three years as part of an expansion, including a new genomics center at Waltham, MA. It currently employs more than 9,000. Altana says that more than 50%lo will be in the company's pharmaceutical business. The company posted a 50% rise in pretax profits in the first nine months of 2001, to 350 million ($307 million), on sales up 23%, to CI .7 billion. Third-quarter results were not disclosed. Kvaerner Agrees on Merger with its Biggest Shareholder

Kvaerner has agreed to merge with the oil and gas activities of its biggest shareholder, oil services company Aker Maritime (Oslo). The agreement was reached after Aker withheld its support for a financial restructuring of Kvaerner, which is on the brink of bankruptcy (CW Nov. 7, p. 6). The merger will create a NK20-billion($2.2 billion)/year company in which Aker will have a 50% stake. Kvaerner will issue shares worth NK3.5 billion to stakeholders, including Aker, as part of the deal. It will also reschedule NK8.5 billion

of debt. The merger is subject to creditor and shareholder approval. Yukos Oil, Kvaerner's secondbiggest shareholder, which helped devise the earlier restructuring package, has backed Akers plan. Aker owns
24.9% of Kvaemer and Yukos holds 22%. Yukos recently acquired Kvaemer's process technology business (CW, Oct. 31, p. 7).

TD
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS imposed a record  fine totaling more than EUR855 million ($750 million) on eight companies for conspiring to fix the price of bulk  vitamins between 1989 and 1999. Roche and BASF, identified by the commission as the  cartel ringleaders, will pay the lions share of the  fine (table).

The commission says that different groups of companies operated separate cartels in the markets for 12 products:  vitamins A, E, Bl, B2, BS> B6, C, D3, and H, as well as beta carotene, carotenoids, and folic acid. "This is the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the range of vitamins covered," says  European competition commissioner Mario Monti.

Participants in each cartel "fixed prices, allocated sales quotas, and implemented price increases," the commission says. Cartel meetings involved company representation "at the most senior levels," it adds.

Roche, the "prime mover and main beneficiary" of the scheme, was the only company involved in fixing the prices of all 12 products, the commission says. BASF played "a paramount role in following Roche's lead," the commission says. Roche and BASF say they may appeal separately against the commissions decision. BASF says its  fine is "inappropriately high."

Aventis, meanwhile, was handed a  fine of just EUR5 million after cooperating with the commission's investigation and providing "decisive evidence" on other companies' illegal activities, the commission
says. RhonePoulenc, which later merged with Hoechst to form Aventis, participated in three of the cartels, the commission adds.

The commission found five additional companies, Kongo Chemical (Toyama, Japan), Lonza, Sumitomo Chemical and its Sumika Fine Chemicals (Osaka) subsidiary, and Tanabe Seiyaku (Osaka), guilty of vitamin price fixing. It did not fine them, however, because the cartels in which they participated, for vitamin H or folic acid, ceased to operate at least five years before the commission's investigation began in 1999.

The U.S. Department of Justice in 1999  fined Roche and BASF $500 million and $225 million, respectively, for conspiring to fix vitamin prices, and it jailed a former Roche executive for four months (CW,July 19, 2000, p. 8).

The commissions previous record fine was C273 million, levied on members of a shipping  cartel in 1998. The previous highest chemical cartel fine was EI 10 million imposed last year on companies that conspired to fix amino acid prices. -IAN YOUNG

DATELINE BRUSSELS Tracy Sutherland INTERNATIONAL price-fixing cartels have been warned. The recent decision by the European Commission in Brussels to impose a record 855 million  euro ($1.47 billion) fine for price fixing on eight major vitamin producers is the strongest signal yet that Europe is belatedly clamping down on uncompetitive behaviour by both local and foreign firms.
The EU found the Swiss firm Roche was the "main instigator" of the  cartel which operated between
1990 and 1998 to fix the price of bulk  vitamins, such as those added to breakfast cereals and animal
feed.

TD
Roche was fined million, while German firm BASF received a million  fine for its "paramount role".

The fine for both these companies would have been double the final figure had they not co-operated with the investigation, noted EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

Monti described the case as "the most damaging series of cartels the commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of  vitamins covered, which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics".

Other companies  fined smaller amounts included the German/US firm Merck, Aventis of France, Belgium's Solvay and significantly, Japanese producers Daiichi, Takeda and Eisai.
The fine is the largest the EU has ever imposed, beating the million penalty handed down to the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement of ocean shippers in 1998.

Noting that EU  fines for price fixing have steadily increased over the years, one commission source said it was about settling on a big enough  fine to provide a suitable deterrent.
Until recently, international companies have regarded the EU as a soft touch when it comes to
anti-competitive behaviour, reflecting a broadly held view that the only country with effective sanctions
for price fixing is the United States.

"They've certainly under-estimated the  European machine and I think that signal is deliberately being sent out in this case," said Michael Reynolds, a leading anti-trust lawyer with Brussels-based Allen & Overy.
"The commission has the power and will impose  fines outside the EU."
Roche said its fine was "within the range of expectations" but BASF has described its as
"inappropriately high".

The fine was designed to recoup some of the profits the  cartel made over almost a decade, noted Reynolds, saying the EU had sent a clear message: "If you're the ringleader and you set it up and police it and you punish people who break the rules of the  cartel, you must expect to be hit hard."

He rejected the defence employed by some companies that the price fixing was masterminded by individuals, without the knowledge of senior company executives.
"Vitamins  Inc" appeared well organised with its own management structure and even committees.

Page 120 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But while the EU's ruling puts illegal cartels on notice, it conspicuously falls short of action taken in
the US where at least one Roche executive convicted over similar offences faces a possible jail term.

With the exception of Britain,  European investigators cannot impose US-style sanctions like jail terms for price-fixing violations and can only act against companies and not the individual executives involved.

Analysts agree that forcing individuals to take personal responsibility for their illegal actions would provide a greater deterrent, but constitutional complexities within the EU block this for now.

However, the ruling is expected to add weight to an Australian class action suit against Australian and Asian subsidiaries of Roche, BASF and Aventis for similar alleged offences, which was scheduled to resume in the Federal Court in December.

Australian, Canadian,  European and American regulators are increasingly working in tandem and this is likely to grow further, noted the commission source: "Cartels are increasingly global, so the answer has to be global."

Said Reynolds: "The regulators increasingly talk to each other, the net is closing, but there are still an awful lot of cartels out there."
Tracy Sutherland will be on leave over December and her column will return in the New Year.

The fine was designed to recoup some of the profits the  cartel made over almost a decade, noted Reynolds, saying the EU had sent a clear message: "If you're the ringleader and you set it up and police it and you punish people who break the rules of the  cartel, you must expect to be hit hard."

He rejected the defence employed by some companies that the price fixing was masterminded by individuals, without the knowledge of senior company executives.

"Vitamins  Inc" appeared well organised with its own management structure and even committees.
But while the EU's ruling puts illegal cartels on notice, it conspicuously falls short of action taken in
the US where at least one Roche executive convicted over similar offences faces a possible jail term.
With the exception of Britain,  European investigators cannot impose US-style sanctions like jail
terms for price-fixing violations and can only act against companies and not the individual executives
involved.

Analysts agree that forcing individuals to take personal responsibility for their illegal actions would provide a greater deterrent, but constitutional complexities within the EU block this for now.

However, the ruling is expected to add weight to an Australian class action suit against Australian and Asian subsidiaries of Roche, BASF and Aventis for similar alleged offences, which was scheduled to resume in the Federal Court in December.

Australian, Canadian,  European and American regulators are increasingly working in tandem and this is likely to grow further, noted the commission source: "Cartels are increasingly global, so the answer has to be global."

Said Reynolds: "The regulators increasingly talk to each other, the net is closing, but there are still an awful lot of cartels out there."

LP
A recent judgment of the European Court of First Instance (Corus UK Ltd v Commission, 10 October
2001) has confirmed the European Commission's (EC) obligation to pay interest on  fines required to be
repaid following a successful appeal against a decision of the EC in competition cases. The proceedings
also brought to light the existence of a recent, but little-publicised, EC decision that made a new system
available for dealing with  fines available to parties that have paid a  fine but wish to appeal the decision.

The level of the EC's  fines is escalating dramatically. In November, the EC imposed  fines of E855m (#532.9m) against parties engaged in the vitaminscartel - Hoffman La Roche and BASF were each  fined substantially more than any single party in any previous case. The Corus judgment offers some comfort
on the financial treatment of those who might successfully challenge EC decisions.

TD
It is normal for a party that has been  fined by the EC and who wishes to appeal the decision to be offered the option of paying the  fine immediately on a provisional basis, or giving a bank guarantee. In the latter case, the EC will usually require that the  fined party pay interest on the  fine should it lose its appeal. Perhaps for this reason, the trend is to pay the  fine immediately. Until recently, after a successful appeal, the EC has paid back only the sum it had received without interest.

In the Corus cases, British Steel (now Corus) was fined ecus32m (#19.9m) by the EC in 1994 for alleged anti-competitive activities. British Steel paid the fine but promptly brought an action to annul the decision. The decision was annulled in part in 1999, when the Court of First Instance found that the correct level of the fine should have been only E20m (#12.47m). The EC paid back the difference, but refused to pay interest, so British Steel made an application to the Court of First Instance claiming interest.

The court decided that the EC was obliged to pay interest on the E12m, which it had held since 1994, as this was a necessary step in complying with the judgment annulling the original decision. While the Corus case was brought under the Treaty Establishing the Coal and Steel Community (ECSC Treaty), the reasoning in the judgment would apply equally to decisions under the  European Community Treaty, such as decisions to oppose a  fine for breach of Articles 81 or 82. The level of interest to be paid back was, for the main part, set by the court at the level that the EC had earned interest. The court calculated this at a little more than E3m (#1.87m).

However, the requirement to pay interest is apparently not limited to situations in which the EC may be unjustly enriched. The court stated that the duty to pay interest was an essential component of the EC's obligation to restore the applicant to its original position. Clearly, this is independent of any element of unjust enrichment. In the Corus case, the EC was obliged to pay interest on the E3m interest in respect of the period from payment back of the primary sum of E12m, until the date of the court's judgment. The
court did not look for any unjust enrichment which might have occurred, but set a simple interest rate of
5.75 per cent, being the rate applicable to capital refinancing operations set by the  European Central
Bank, plus two percentage points.

Parties challenging an EC decision imposing  fines now appear to have a further means of safeguarding their position on interest, but it is one in which the EC has so far appeared loathe to publicise. In the Corus case, the EC was obliged by the court to describe its new procedures for dealing with money paid in fines pending an application for annulment, and a very short description of recent changes has found its way into the judgment by the EC. Under a decision adopted by the EC on 14 September 1999, parties facing a fine but wishing to challenge the decision should now be offered the option of either providing a

bank guarantee (plus an obligation to pay interest should the appeal fail), or payment of the  fine into an interest-bearing account opened for that purpose by the EC. Before the court, the EC stated that following a tender procedure, the EC has appointed a bank and has been progressively applying the practice since June 2000.

2001 Review

TD
2001 WAS TURNING INTO A BLEAK YEAR FOR chemical makers even before September 11. Slowing demand and soaring feedstock prices took a bite out of profits, forcing some firms into bankruptcy. The aftermath of the terror attacks brought further declines in demand, and added new worries, such as plant security. M&A kept up a strong pace, however, despite the uncertain outlook.

JANUARY. The year gets off to a lackluster start, as rising feedstock prices and falling demand prompt a flood of earnings warnings, plant closures, and job cuts. The pace of M&A remains brisk, however. Ineos acquires EVC, Huntsman buys the former Albright & Wilson surfactants from Rhodia, and Solvay swaps its polypropylene for BP's engineering plastics.

FEBRUARY. Feedstock pricing woes are borne out in dismal fourth-quarter earnings. Dow completes its long-delayed acquisition of Union Carbide, but it is forced to make several divestments. Eastman
Chemical announces plans to split in two, and Henkel decides to auction Cognis. Chemical companies are worried by a European White Paper they say could lead to product bans.

MARCH. President Bush reverses his position on capping carbon dioxide emissions, citing national energy concerns, although natural gas pricing pressure starts to abate. Dow pays $1 billion for Rohm and Haas's (R&H) agchems. The industry's image takes a hit when three workers are killed in an explosion at a BP plastics plant at Augusta, GA, and a TV expose says companies concealed the harmful effects of vinyl chloride monomer.

APRIL. Spring brings another flurry of deals. Dow acquires Ascot ,Ineos buys Phenolchemie, and Eastman buys most of Hercules' resins. W.R. Grace and Borden Chemicals and Plastics file for bankruptcy protection, and DuPont, OxyChem, and PPG announce hefty job cuts. The U.S. angers Europe an environmentalists by dropping support for the Kyoto protocol.

MAY. Slowing is reflected in more disappointing earnings reports, and several companies fall into the red. R&H announces job cuts and a series of plant closures. There is no slowdown in deal-making, however, as OMG and Ferro agree to divide up Degussa's dmc^sup 2^ in a $1-billion deal.

European Commission opposition, however, threatens to derail GE's plans to buy Honeywell.

JUNE Second-quarter earnings warnings start early, as the demand slowdown reaches  Europe. BASF says it will slash spending and close 10 sites in an effort to meet its profit targets. DuPont sells its drugs business to Bristol-Myers Squibb and its polyester business to Alpek. Gulf Coast chemical makers, bruised by falling demand, take a beating from tropical storm Allison.

JULY. More companies announce profit warnings and job reductions, although feedstock price declines provide some margin relief. Penn Specialty Chemicals and Sterling Chemicals file for bankruptcy, and GE's plans to buy Honeywell fall apart. Akzo Nobel pleads guilty to price fixing in the U.S., and one of its executives is jailed. Three workers are killed at an explosion at Atochem's Riverview, MI plant.


Page 126 of 134 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
AUGUST. Another round of poor earnings reports leads to more job cuts and plant closures on both sides of the Atlantic. Pioneer Companies files for bankruptcy, and Huntsman sells a stake to two financial
groups to ease its debt repayment problems. Bayer's stock tumbles after reports of deaths caused by its
Baycol cholesterollowering drug, and the company delays a planned U.S. listing.

SEPTEMBER. Terror attacks on the U.S. lead to short-term disruption in chemical production and distribution. Chemical companies donate cash, materials, and equipment for relief efforts in New York and Washington. There is no major short-term impact on prices, but the effect on demand casts more shadows on earnings. More than 29 people die in an explosion at Atochem's fertilizer plant at Toulouse, France, including six people outside the site perimeter.

OCTOBER. Hazmat shippers are frustrated by a moratorium on rail shipments sparked by the start of hostilities in Afghanistan. Regulators, and chemical producers and carriers step up security. Further declines in feedstock prices help margins, but a demand drop dims profit hopes, and there are a string of third-quarter warnings. Bayer acquires Aventis CropScience, and its Cipro antibiotic gets a boost following anthrax attacks.

NOVEMBER. The effect of the terror attacks is felt in lower third-quarter earnings, and there is another spate of plant closure and job cut announcements. A private equity capital consortium agrees to buy Cognis, and Brussels waters down its chemicals White Paper.

DECEMBER. There is not much good news to end the year. Enron, rocked by financial scandal, files for Chapter 11, and Eastman postpones plans for a split. Huntsman skips a bond payment but avoids bankruptcy. The European Commission slaps record fines on a vitamins cartel led by BASF and Roche. Industry braces for another poor quarter, and ACC warns that 2002 will also be tough. -ANDREW WOOD

BRUSSELS, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The European Commission imposed its second-largest ever  fine on Thursday, hitting 10 companies with 313.7 million euros ($282.1 million) for operating a price-fixing cartel in the market for carbonless copy paper.

Fines included a 184.3 million  euro penalty for Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the British paper and packaging firm recently acquired by French financial services and holding company Worms & Cie .

TD
"The Commission has uncovered evidence that, in order to ensure implementation of the agreed price increases, a sales quota was allocated to the various participants and a market share was fixed for them," it said in a statement.

Total annual sales of carbonless paper, with coatings that allow the user to transfer images from one sheet to the next without using carbon paper, amount to about 850 million  euros.

European Union antitrust laws permit  fines of up to 10 percent of total annual turnover of firms that violate cartel rules. Companies have three months to pay the penalty.

"This new case comes at the end of a year in which the Commission has taken a long line of decisions against cartels of all kinds," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"This unprecedented level of activity shows two things: first, that these secret practices are unfortunately widespread, and also that the Commission has given itself the wherewithal to detect and pursue such offences and impose effective penalties."
The Commission's long-running investigation began in 1996 and it raided or visited 17 companies in
1997. In 2000 it sent the companies a statement of objection.

The investigation revealed that the  cartel members met regularly, including five general meetings between September 1993 and February 1995 in hotels in Paris and Frankfurt.

Austria's Papierfabrik August Koehler and Zanders Feinpapiere were  fined 33.1 and 29.8 million euros respectively. Bollore SA received a 22.7 million  euro penalty and Mitsubishi HiTech Paper Bielefeld GmbH 21.2 million.

Others were Torraspapel 14.17 million  euros, Papeteries Mougeot SA 3.64 million, Distribuidora Vizcaina de Papeles SL 1.75 million, Carrs Paper Ltd 1.57 million and Papelera Guipuzcoana de Zicunaga SA 1.54 million  euros.

Last month the Commission  fined the world's major vitamins producers 855 million euros following a cartel probe. The huge  fine included a 462 million euro penalty for ringleader Roche and 296 million euros for BASF .

In 1998 the Commission  fined the TACA group of shipping companies 273 million  euros for restricting competition.

BASF is to lodge an appeal against the  fine imposed by the European Commission on November 21,
2001 with the responsible  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

BASF has admitted responsibility for the anti-trust violations relating to the vitamins business and contributed to the clarification of the case by fully cooperating with the European Commission. The appeal therefore relates solely to the level of the  fine, which the company considers in its case to be inappropriately high at EUR 296 million. The appeal is primarily based on the failure to take sufficient account of BASF's cooperation in resolving the case.

TD
To provide for the risk of an unsuccessful appeal BASF will book an additional provision of approximately EUR 200 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.

In recent years, the company has significantly reinforced its measures to rule out violations of antitrust laws in the future. These measures include regular anti-cartel audits by the Corporate Audit division as well as a Group-wide Compliance Program based on BASF's Values and Principles which obliges all employees to act strictly in a law abiding fashion.

More information on BASF's Values and Principles can be found on the Internet under  www.basf.com under About Us: Values and Principles.

BASF is a transnational chemical company that aims to increase and sustain its corporate value through growth and innovation.

The company's product range includes high-value chemicals, plastics, colorants and pigments, dispersions, automotive and industrial coatings, agricultural products and  fine chemicals as well as crude oil and natural gas. BASF's approach to integration, known in German as "Verbund," is one of its particular strengths, ensuring cost leadership and a unique competitive advantage. With sales of about EUR 36 billion (circa $34 billion) in 2000 and over 90,000 employees, BASF is one of the world's
leading chemical companies. BASF acts in accordance with the principles of Sustainable Development.

In a statement Friday, the German chemical company said the appeal "relates solely to the level of the  fine, which it considers... inappropriately high." The appeal will be made to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, the statement said. Commenting on the EC judgment, the statement said BASF "had admitted responsibility... and contributed to the clarification of the case by
fully cooperating with the European Commission." BASF was one of eight companies facing a combined
fine of Euro855-mil ($751-mil) after an EC investigation into anti-trust violations in the  vitamins industry.

LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany, Dec 21 (AFP) - German chemicals maker BASF said Friday it would appeal a 296-million-euro fine imposed by the European Commission for fixing the price of  vitamins within a cartel of other pharmaceutical and chemical companies.
BASF said in a statement it was appealing due to the size of the  fine, which it considered to be
"inappropriately high."

TD
"The appeal is primarily based on the failure to take sufficient account of BASF's cooperation in resolving the case," BASF said.

BASF said it had admitted responsibility for the antitrust violations and had fully cooperated with Brussels during the investigation.

BASF added that it would book an additional provision of roughly 200 million  euros (179 million dollars) in the fourth quarter of this year, to provide for the risk of an unsuccessful appeal.

The EU Commission imposed in November a record  fine of 855 million euros on vitamin producers, including BASF and Roche, found guilty of operating a price  cartel.
