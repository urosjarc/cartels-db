The European Commission on Wednesday announced it was fining paraffin  wax producers a total of over 676 million euros (956 million dollars) for operating a price fixing  cartel which included Shell, Exxonmobil and Total.
Shell escaped any  fine under the whistle-blower rule which applies to companies which help the EU
competition authorities to uncover a  cartel.

TD
The biggest  fine of over 318 million  euros was handed out to South African company Sasol.

US giant ExxonMobil received an 83.5 million  euro fine with smaller penalties going to fellow  cartel members Repsol of Spain, Italy's ENI, Tudapetrol, Hansen and Rosenthaland and RWE of Germany, French Total and MOL of Hungary.
They were penalised for "participating in a  cartel for paraffin wax in the European Economic Area
(EEA)" between 1992 and 2005.

"Shell also participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission," the EU executive said in a statement.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia' cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic
damage," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Such illegal  cartel behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the  Commission, and companies' managers and shareholders should take note".

The infringement committed by ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, RWE and Total also related to slack  wax sold to end-customers on the German market.
Slack wax is the raw material used to produce  paraffin wax.
The fine for Sasol was increased by 50 percent "because it was the leader of the cartel," while ENI's  fine
was increased by 60 percent as it had been previously taking part in similar cartels, the commission
said.

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety of products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the wax coating on cheese, chemicals, tyres and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries.

The European Commission on Wednesday announced it was fining paraffin  wax producers more than
676 million euros (956 million dollars) for operating a price fixing  cartel that included Shell, Exxonmobil

The biggest  fine of over 318 million  euros was handed out to South African company Sasol.

US giant ExxonMobil received an 83.5-million-euro fine with smaller penalties going to fellow  cartel members Repsol of Spain, Italy's ENI, Tudapetrol, Hansen and Rosenthaland and RWE of Germany, French Total and MOL of Hungary.
They were penalised for "participating in a  cartel for paraffin wax in the European Economic Area
(EEA)" between 1992 and 2005.

"Shell also participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission," the EU executive said in a statement.

Paraffin waxes are used in a products ranging from candles and  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, to tyres, packaging and chewing gum.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia' cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic

was increased by 60 percent as it had been previously taking part in similar cartels, the commission
said.

A spokesman for the Total group in Paris said it had received notification and was "awaiting the reasons for the decision" in order to determine what measures are necessary.

ExxonMobil was more immediately penitent, saying in a statement that it "deeply regrets its involvement, although limited, in the infringement of competition laws through the participation of a few of the company's former employees."

"Honesty, integrity, and strict legal compliance are the cornerstones of the way ExxonMobil conducts its business," the firm added.

PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Total has been fined about 128 million  euros ($181 million) by the  European    Commission for fixing prices of paraffin  wax, the French oil company said on Wednesday. A Total spokeswoman said the company's French division was one of nine accused of fixing the price of the  wax used for candles and  waxed paper between 1992 and 2005. The  Commission also fined South Africa's Sasol and Italy's Eni but the spokeswoman did not specify how much. Royal Dutch Shell was not  fined, she added. The  European Commission had informed Total of its decision on Wednesday, Total said, but it had yet to receive the supporting arguments. "Total will examine the supporting arguments of the judgment and examine the means of appeal," the spokeswoman said. Total received notification in 2007
of the claim that nine companies had exchanged confidential information concerning  paraffin wax. Shares in Total, the world's fourth largest company, were little changed at 42.5  euros by 0853 GMT.

BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined nine petrochemicals companies a total of 676 million euros ($955 million) on Wednesday for forming a "paraffin  mafia" to fix prices and carve up markets for paraffin  wax, an official statement said. The biggest individual  fine of 318.2 million  euros was imposed on Sasol of Germany and South Africa, which the  European Union executive described as the leader of the illegal  cartel. Shell escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle to the EU competition authorities. The other companies involved were ENI, Exxon Mobil , Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol,

It was the fourth-highest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a sector, topped only by the record 992.3 million euros on elevator companies last year, 790.5 million on makers of vitamins in 2001 and 750.5 million on manufacturers of gas insulated switchgear in 2007.  Paraffin waxes are used in a wide range of products from candles to paper cups and plates, the  wax coating of cheese, chemicals, tyres and chewing gum. The Commission said the cartel activity took place between 1992 and 2005, when it began investigating with raids on petrochemicals companies prompted by an application from Shell for leniency
in return for information provided. (Reporting by Paul Taylor, editing by Dale Hudson) ($1=.7079  euro) Keywords: EU  WAX/CARTEL Keywords: EU  WAX/CARTEL

HD     EU fines 9 companies over wax cartel

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union on Wednesday imposed one of its highest ever  cartel fines on a "paraffin  mafia" accused of fixing prices and markets for everyday household products like chewing gum, tires and candles.

A group of nine  paraffin wax producers were ordered to pay  fines totaling almost euro700 million (almost US$1 billion) for forcing  European consumers to pay more because paraffin  was kept at artificially high prices.

TD
European Commission Neelie Kroes said the  cartel leader was Sasol Ltd. of South Africa but also included such multinationals as ExxonMobil, Repsol, Shell and Total.  Paraffin wax is obtained from petroleum and is used in candles,  wax paper, cosmetics and many other products.

The overall total of euro676 million (US$967 million) is the fourth highest  fine ever and the fine slapped on Sasol of euro318.2 million ($455.12 million) was the fourth largest for an individual company.

"I hope that the harsh lesson of these high  fines will encourage the management of these companies to look very carefully at what their staff is doing," Kroes said. "And I hope that in turn the shareholders of these companies look very carefully at the management."

"They should not be under any illusion -- such illegal  cartel behavior cannot and will not be tolerated," said the commissioner, who has turned  cartel fighting into a priority issue.
The companies involved can still appeal the  fine and Sasol intends to do so.

"Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it," the company said in a statement.

"Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and antitrust law compliance programs in all its businesses including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition laws."
The European market for paraffin wax totals about  euro500 million (US$700 million) a year and the
cartel covered about three quarters of that for 13 years. "The 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel ran from 1992 to
2005," Kroes said.

At first, Kroes said, the companies showed a common resolve to rig the market when they started meeting secretly in Hamburg's Blauer Salon under the code name "the blue saloon group."
Meetings all over Europe followed as the  cartel flourished. But then Shell started informing the
commission about the illegal practices.
"By being the first to bring us evidence, Shell avoided a  fine of euro96 million (US$137 million)," she said.

Sasol's  fine was increased by 50 percent for being the  cartel leader but the South African company also got a reduction for being the second company for cooperating with Kroes's office. Still, its  fine was one of the highest ever.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Wednesday imposed one of its highest ever  cartel fines -- almost $1 billion -- on a "paraffin  mafia" accused of fixing prices and markets for everyday household products like chewing gum, tires and candles.

A group of nine  paraffin wax producers including Exxon Mobil Corp. of the United States were ordered to pay fines totaling almost 700 million  euros for forcing  European consumers to pay more because paraffin was kept at artificially high prices.

TD
European Commission Neelie Kroes said the  cartel leader was Sasol Ltd. of South Africa but also included such multinationals as Exxon Mobil, Repsol, Shell and Total.  Paraffin wax is obtained from petroleum and is used in candles,  wax paper, cosmetics and many other products.
The overall total of 676 million  euros ($967 million) is the fourth highest  fine ever and the fine slapped on
Sasol of 318.2 million  euros ($455.12 million) was the fourth largest for an individual company.

"I hope that the harsh lesson of these high  fines will encourage the management of these companies to look very carefully at what their staff is doing," Kroes said. "And I hope that in turn the shareholders of these companies look very carefully at the management."

"They should not be under any illusion -- such illegal  cartel behavior cannot and will not be tolerated," said the commissioner, who has turned  cartel fighting into a priority issue.
The companies involved can still appeal the  fine and Sasol intends to do so.

"Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it," the company said in a statement.

"Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and antitrust law compliance programs in all its businesses including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition laws."

Exxon Mobil, which was  fined 83.5 million euros ($119 million), was uncertain on its course of action but said earlier in a statement it "deeply regrets its involvement, although limited, in the infringement of competition laws through the participation of a few of the company's former employees."
The European market for paraffin wax totals about 500 million euros ($700 million) a year and the
cartel covered about three quarters of that for 13 years. "The 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel ran from 1992 to
2005," Kroes said.

At first, Kroes said, the companies showed a common resolve to rig the market when they started meeting secretly in Hamburg's Blauer Salon under the code name "the blue saloon group."

Meetings all over Europe followed as the  cartel flourished. But then Shell started informing the
commission about the illegal practices.
"By being the first to bring us evidence, Shell avoided a  fine of 96 million euros ($137 million)," she said. Sasol's  fine was increased by 50 percent for being the  cartel leader but the South African company also
got a reduction for being the second company for cooperating with Kroes's office. Still, its  fine was one of
the highest ever.

Total of France was given a  fine of 128 million euros ($183 million). Other companies  fined were Repsol of Spain, ENI of Italy, Tudapetrol, Hansen & Rosenthal and RWE of Germany and MOL of Hungary.

HD      European Commission fines MOL EUR 23m for participation in paraffin wax cartel

Budapest, October 1, 2008 (MTI-ECONEWS) - The EuropeanCommission has decided to fine Hungarian oil and gas company MOL EUR 23m for its participation in a paraffin  wax cartel, European Commissioner for Competition Policy Neelie Kroes announced on Wednesday.

MOL was one of ten companies in the cartel, which fixed prices and shared markets for the sale of paraffin wax, Ms Kroes said. The cartel covered about three-fourths of the  European paraffin wax market and operated from 1992 until 2005.

TD
The combined fine levied on all of the companies in the cartel comes to EUR 676m, the fourth-largest ever imposed by the European Commission in a cartel case, Ms Kroes said. It reflects the duration of the cartel and the size of the market -- almost EUR 500m a year, she added.

Other companies in the  cartel were South Africa's Sasol, which led the  cartel and was fined EUR 318m; France's Total, fined EUR 128m;US-based Exxon Mobil,  fined EUR 83m; Italy's ENI, fined EUR 29m; RWE of Germany, fined EUR 37m; Germany's Hansen and Rosenthal,  fined EUR 23m, Respol of Spain, fined EUR 20m; Tudapetrol of Germany,  fined EUR 12m; and the Dutch company Shell, whose  fine was lifted because it was the first to produce evidence of the  cartel.

MOL said in a statement on Wednesday it regretted that, in the 90s, it had no such internal control and auditing system that could have uncovered activity of this kind. It added that its sales of  paraffin wax during the period investigated by the  Commission were carried out by an earlier purchased subsidiary. The unit was not placed under the responsibility of the parent company until later.

Paraffin wax sales account for just one-half of one percent of MOL's revenue, MOL said.

Reuters reported that The European Commission fined nine petrochemicals companies a total of EUR676 million ($955 million) for forming a paraffin  mafia to fix prices and carve up markets for paraffin  wax. Sasol Limited was  fined EUR318.2 million and Royal Dutch Shell escaped a potential fine of EUR96 million because it blew the whistle first to the EU competition authorities. The other companies fined were Total (EUR128.1 million), Exxon Mobil (EUR83.6 million, RWE (EUR37.4 million), ENI (EUR29 million), Hansen & Rosenthal (EUR24 million), MOL (EUR23.7 million), Repsol

Ten groups of companies, including ExxonMobil, Total, Resol, Sasol and Shell, were involved in an illegal paraffin wax scam, operating a  price-fixing, market-rigging  cartel which ran for 13 years until
2005.

TD
Shell alone escaped fines under Commission "leniency" provisions, because the company revealed the existence of the cartel and claimed immunity.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a press conference in Brussels: "There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'paraffin  mafia' cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage.

"Such illegal  cartel behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the  Commission, and companies' managers and shareholders should take note."

Paraffin waxes are used in candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates and the  wax coating on cheese, as well as in chemicals, tyres and car components and in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries.

The Commission investigation started with surprise inspections in April 2005, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Shell under the EU's 2002 "Leniency Notice".

According to the  Commission the cartel was known in the Shell group as the "paraffin  mafia" and in the Sasol group as "Blauer Salon" - after the "blue saloon" hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the  cartel took place in 1992 to fix prices and markets between them.

Other cartel meetings took place at a series of top hotels all over  Europe, including Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg.

The nine groups fined today were ENI, ExxonMobil, Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, RWE and Total.

Along with Shell, they took part in regular gatherings to discuss prices, allocate markets and customers, and to exchange sensitive commercial information, said Ms Kroes.
She said the  cartel's activities were "a very serious infringement of EU Treaty anti-trust rules". end

ExxonMobil this afternoon expressed regret at the company's "limited" involvement in the  cartel.

A statement said "a few" of the firm's former employees had participated in activities which infringed competition laws.

"It is ExxonMobil's policy to uphold the highest ethical standards and to comply with all applicable competition laws," said a company statement.

"ExxonMobil has a very strong competition law compliance programme and it expects its employees to observe high ethical standards.

"Honesty, integrity and strict legal compliance are the corner stones of the way ExxonMobil conducts its business.

"Frequent training and regular reviews of the company's business activities are conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with these policies and laws."

HD     Sasol Limited: Statement Issued by Sasol Limited  in Response to an Announcement by the
European Commission

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Oct. 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Statement issued by Sasol Limited (JSE: SOL; NYSE: SSL) in response to an announcement by the European Commission regarding a finding of anti-competitive behaviour by Sasol  Wax GmbH and other members of the European paraffin wax industry. As anticipated in several previous announcements made by Sasol Limited, the European Union found that members of the European paraffin  wax industry, including Sasol Wax GmbH, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws. A fine of EUR 318 200 000 was imposed by the European Commission on Sasol Wax GmbH (of which Sasol  Wax International AG, Sasol Holding in Germany GmbH and Sasol Limited would be jointly and severally be liable for EUR 250 million). The  fine is payable within three months.

TD
As a result of Sasol's co-operation and support in the investigations, the  European Commission reduced the base amount of the  fine by 50% to the net amount stated above. Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with
a view to lodge an appeal against it. According to the statement of objections of the  European                  Commission an infringement of antitrust laws commenced in 1992 or even earlier. In 1995 Sasol became a co-shareholder in an existing  wax business located in Hamburg, Germany owned by the Schumann group. In July 2002 Sasol acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture and became the sole shareholder of the business. Sasol Limited was unaware of these infringements before the  European      Commission commenced their investigation at the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005. Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and anti-trust law compliance programmes in all its businesses including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws,
including competition laws.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined nine wax producers a total of EUR676 million for participating in a paraffin  wax cartel.

TD
The companies fined are Sasol Ltd. (SOL.JO), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), ENI SpA (ENI.MI), Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL Nyrt (MOL.BU), Repsol SA (REP), RWE AG (RWE.XE) and Total SA. (12027.FR).

Sasol, a South African energy company, was the leader of the  cartel and will have to pay the largest part of the  fine, of EUR318 million, the  commission said. Total will have to pay the second largest part of the fine of EUR128 million.
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) blew the whistle on the praffin wax cartel, which operated for 13 years from
1992 to 2005, and thus managed to avoid all fines, the commission said. Shell's shareholders are
lucky the company was the first to own up to the cartel, the European antitrust commissioner Neelie
Kroes said. "As it has been involved in  cartel activity before, it would have had its  fine increased by
60%," amounting to a  fine of EUR96 million, Kroes added.

Italian oil and gas company ENI had its  fine increased by 60% to EUR29 million because it is a repeat cartel offender, having participation in the PVC and polypropylene cartels in the 1990s and 1980s, the commission said.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that hasn't bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia'  cartel," Kroes said.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products - from candles and paper cups to tires and car components.

The cartel covered about 75% of the European market for paraffin wax, which is worth some EUR500 million annually, according to the commission.

ExxonMobil, which was fined EUR83 million for participating in the  cartel, said it "deeply regrets its involvement," in the cartel by few of the company's former employees, saying it would now determine whether it would need to take any further action.

Edited Press Release
FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday said that as part of a total
financial penalty of EUR600 million against all the parties involved in the alleged  cartel, it has imposed a
fine of altogether EUR36 million on companies of the Hansen & Rosenthal Group and H&R WASAG AG
for anti-competitive behaviour in the  paraffin  sector during the years 1994 - 2005.

TD
Of the total amount, H&R Chemisch-Pharmazeutische Spezialitaeten GmbH, a subsidiary of H&R WASAG AG, is being ordered to pay a sum of EUR22 million, with sales partners a further  fine of EUR14 million. The written substantiation for the  fines has not yet been issued.

The board of H&R WASAG AG sees grounds for substantial legal objections, which already applied to the investigation proceedings. This is also reflected in the balance sheet treatment of the matter as a contingent risk. Appropriate procedural steps will be instituted against the  fine once the written substantiation has been received. Only when this is available will it be possible to form a conclusive opinion concerning the justification for the  fine and any impact it may have on the balance sheet and profit and loss account. As matters stand Wednesday, the company continues to view the  fine as unjustified in terms of both substance and amount and will on all accounts institute legal proceedings against the  Commission's decision.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined nine wax producers a total of EUR676 million for participating in a paraffin  wax cartel.

TD
The companies fined include Sasol Ltd. (SOL.JO), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), ENI SpA (ENI.MI), Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL Nyrt (MOL.BU), Repsol SA (REP), RWE AG (RWE.XE) and Total SA. (12027.FR).
The fine is the fourth largest the  commission has ever imposed in a cartel case.

Sasol, a South African energy company, was the leader of the  cartel and will have to pay the largest part of the  fine, EUR318 million, the  commission said. Total will have to pay the second largest part of the fine of EUR128 million.
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported the praffin wax cartel, which operated for 13 years from 1992 to
2005, and thus managed to avoid all fines, the commission said. Shell's shareholders are lucky the
company was the first to own up to the cartel, the European antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
"As it has been involved in  cartel activity before, it would have had its  fine increased by 60%,"
amounting to a  fine of EUR96 million, Kroes added.

Italian oil and gas company ENI had its  fine increased by 60% to EUR29 million because it is a repeat cartel offender, having participation in the PVC and polypropylene cartels in the 1990s and 1980s, the commission said.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that hasn't bought products affected by this

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products - from candles and paper cups to tires and car components.

The cartel covered about 75% of the European market for paraffin wax, which is worth some EUR500 million annually, according to the commission.

ExxonMobil, which was fined EUR83 million for participating in the  cartel, said it "deeply regrets its involvement," in the cartel by few of the company's former employees, saying it would now determine whether it would need to take any further action.

Spanish Repsol faces a EUR19.8 million  fine, while German Tudapetrol is fined EUR12 million. Another German company Hansen & Rosenthal will pay a EUR24 million fine, while RWE pays EUR37.4 million, Hungarian energy company MOL was  fined EUR23.7 million.

Under Kroes' leadership the  commission has made fighting cartels one of its main priorities, with the competition chief keen to demonstrate how  cartel-busting affects  European consumers.

During the past four years, the  commission imposed more than EUR7 billion in cartel fines. This amount is likely to increase steeply after the  commission introduced harsher fines from early 2007.

HD        3rd UPDATE: EU Fines Wax Producers EUR676M For Price Fixing
WC        514 words

(Adds Eni comment)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission on Wednesday fined nine wax producers a total of EUR676 million for participating in a paraffin  wax cartel.

TD
The companies fined include Sasol Ltd. (SOL.JO), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), ENI SpA (ENI.MI), Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL Nyrt (MOL.BU), Repsol SA (REP), RWE AG (RWE.XE) and Total SA. (12027.FR).
The fine is the fourth largest the  commission has ever imposed in a cartel case.

Sasol, a South African energy company, was the leader of the  cartel and will have to pay the largest part of the  fine, EUR318 million, the  commission said. Total will have to pay the second largest part of the fine of EUR128 million.
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported the paraffin  wax cartel, which operated for 13 years from 1992 to
2005, and thus managed to avoid all fines, the commission said. Shell's shareholders are lucky the
company was the first to own up to the cartel, the European antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"As it has been involved in  cartel activity before, it would have had its  fine increased by 60%," amounting to a  fine of EUR96 million, Kroes added.

Italian oil and gas company ENI had its  fine increased by 60% to EUR29 million because it is a repeat cartel offender, having participation in the PVC and polypropylene cartels in the 1990s and 1980s, the commission said.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that hasn't bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia' cartel," Kroes said.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products - from candles and paper cups to tires and car components.

The cartel covered about 75% of the European market for paraffin wax, which is worth some EUR500 million annually, according to the commission.

ExxonMobil, which was fined EUR83 million for participating in the  cartel, said it "deeply regrets its involvement" in the cartel by a few of the company's former employees, saying it would now determine whether it would need to take any further action.

Spanish Repsol faces a EUR19.8 million  fine, while German Tudapetrol is fined EUR12 million. Another German company Hansen & Rosenthal will pay a EUR24 million fine, while RWE pays EUR37.4 million, Hungarian energy company MOL was  fined EUR23.7 million.

Late Wednesday, Eni said in an emailed statement that it acted in full respect of EU Antitrust rules. The Italian oil company also said it will eventually appeal to appropriate institutions once evaluated the reasons of this  fine.

Under Kroes' leadership, the  commission has made fighting cartels one of its main priorities, with the competition chief keen to demonstrate how  cartel-busting affects  European consumers.

HD     Sasol Limited's response  to finding by European Commission
WC    574 words

Release date - 01102008

Statement issued by Sasol Limited in response to an announcement by the  European Commission regarding a finding of anti-competitive behaviour by Sasol  Wax GmbH and other members of the European paraffin wax industry.

TD
As anticipated in several previous announcements made by Sasol Limited, the  European Union found that members of the European paraffin  wax industry, including Sasol Wax GmbH, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws. A fine of EUR 318 200 000 was imposed by the European Commission on Sasol Wax GmbH (of which Sasol Wax International AG, Sasol Holding in Germany GmbH and Sasol Limited would be jointly and severally be liable for EUR 250 million). The  fine is payable within three months.

As a result of Sasol's co-operation and support in the investigations, the  European Commission reduced the base amount of the  fine by 50% to the net amount stated above.

Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it.

According to the statement of objections of the  European Commission an infringement of antitrust laws commenced in 1992 or even earlier. In 1995 Sasol became a co-shareholder in an existing  wax business located in Hamburg, Germany owned by the Schumann group. In July 2002 Sasol acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture and became the sole shareholder of the business. Sasol Limited was unaware of these infringements before the  European Commission commenced their investigation at the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005.

Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and anti-trust law compliance programmes in all its businesses including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition laws.

Sasol may, in this document, make statements that are not historical facts and relate to analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These are forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

South African chemical giant Sasol was  fined 318.2m Euros (R3.7bn) by the  European Commission
(EC ) after it had been found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour.
A press release issued by the EC on Tuesday revealed that nine companies involved in manufacturing
paraffin wax had been fined a total of 676  euros.

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said "There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this  paraffin  mafia cartel. Such illegal  cartel behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the  Commission, and companies' managers and shareholders should take note".

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety of products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the wax coating on cheese, chemicals, tyres and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries.
In its statement, the EC said that Sasol had carried nearly 50 percent of the  fine because it was the  cartel
leader.
The cartel operated from 1992 to 2005.

Anglo-Dutch giant Shell had participated in participated in the  cartel, but its 96m  euro fine was written off because it had informed the Commision of the  cartel.
Sasol's  fine is payable within three months.

In a statement Sasol group communications manager Jacqui O'Sullivan said: "Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it."

She said Sasol Limited had bought into an existing business and it had only became the sole shareholder in the business in 2002.

"Sasol Limited was unaware of these infringements before the  European Commission commenced their investigation at the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005."

(ADP News) – Oct 1, 2008 - Spanish oil and gas giant Repsol (MCE:REP), as a part of a price fixing cartel, will pay a EUR 19.8 million (USD 28m)  fine, imposed by the European Commission (EC), the EC said on Wednesday.
A total fine of EUR 676 million was imposed on nine petrochemicals firms, which produced paraffin  
wax and manipulated the market.

TD
The biggest  fine was for South African company Sasol (JSE:SOL) of EUR 318.2 million, followed by
French Total (PAR:FP) with EUR 128.2 million.

Shell (LSE:RDSA) escaped the  fine because it collaborated with the  European Union (EU) authorities to uncover the  cartel.
The Repsol fine was decreased by 25% to its current amount due to Repsol's collaboration with the
EU investigation.

Release of an Ad hoc announcement according to § 15 WpHG, transmitted by DGAP
- a company of EquityStory AG.
The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.
=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- Salzbergen, 1.10.2008
The European  Commission has today announced that as part of a total
financial penalty of EUR 600 million against all the parties involved in the alleged cartel, it has imposed a fine of altogether EUR 36 million on companies of the Hansen & Rosenthal Group and H&R WASAG AG for
anti-competitive behaviour in the paraffin sector during the years 1994 -
2005. Of the total amount, H&R Chemisch-Pharmazeutische Spezialitäten GmbH, a subsidiary of H&R WASAG AG, is being ordered to pay a sum of EUR 22 million, with sales partners a further of EUR 14 million. The written substantiation for the fines has not yet been issued.

The board of H&R WASAG AG sees grounds for substantial legal objections, which already applied to the investigation proceedings. This is also reflected in the balance sheet treatment of the matter as a contingent
risk. Appropriate procedural steps will be instituted against the fine once the written substantiation has been received. Only when this is available will it be possible to form a conclusive opinion concerning the justification for the fine and any impact it may have on the balance sheet and profit and loss account. As matters stand today, the company continues to view the fine as unjustified in terms of both substance and amount and will on all accounts institute legal proceedings against the Commission's decision.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungary's state asset manager MNV will announce a one-round public tender for the sale of properties belonging to a former military air base near southwest Hungary's Taszar, MNV announced Wednesday.

The Taszar facility served as a NATO base during the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s, but was closed down in 2005, and is currently without an airport license.

TD
Earlier this year, MNV already fielded the opinion of potential investors, receiving 12 concept applications that have influenced the content of the upcoming tender. Among others, MNV said that potential applicants preferred the sale of the property, rather than a lease scheme, and saw possibilities to develop an intermodal logistics base, in addition to what would primarily be a cargo airport.

MNV said the offered purchase price will weigh 26% toward applicants' final score, with financial strength, guarantees and the quality of development concepts each weighing a further 17%, among others.
According to press reports, the government expects developments totaling HUF 30 bln at Taszar. BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungarian property developer Gestor and
Belgium's BPI have teamed up to build a EUR 45 mln mixed project in the ninth district of Hungarian capital
Budapest, to be completed by mid-2010, the companies announced on Wednesday.

The project will involve the renovation and expansion of an old factory and warehouse building, which in recent years served as an alternative cultural center under the name Tuzraktar. The new project, named The Gallery, will build a three-star business hotel with 105 rooms, retail space totaling 2,500 square meters (sqm), and 'A' class offices with net leasable area of 10,500 sqm.

"There is a large supply of new offices in Budapest [...] but so far this has been limited to the Southern Buda and Southern Pest areas of the city, and the Vaci Ut office corridor," Gestor CEO Andras Gero was quoted saying. "At the same time, there is a lack of quality projects along the road leading to the Ferihegy international airport [where The Gallery will be located]."

With 200 underground parking places and a pedestrian passage, total built-in space in The Gallery will reach 29,500 sqm.

Gestor, owned by private investor Peter Gero and his family, has ongoing projects worth a total HUF 20 bln in Hungary, mostly in the residential segment. The group, founded in 1990, is also active in facility management and property consulting.
BPI is part of Belgium's CFE group, a construction, real estate and infrastructure conglomerate active in the
Benelux countries, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL EUROPE – Hungary's top oil and gas company MOL has received a EUR 23 mln fine from the European Commission (EC), as part of a  cartel investigation involving the EU's paraffin  wax market that led to fines totaling EUR 676 mln.

"The cartel covered about 75% of the European market in paraffin wax, lasted for 13 years, and included
10 companies," Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition Policy announced in Brussels
Wednesday. "The companies have been  fined a total of EUR 676 mln, the fourth largest  fine ever imposed
by the EC in a  cartel case, [reflecting] both the long duration of the  cartel and the size of the market
concerned – nearly EUR 500 mln a year."

Kroes said the  paraffin  mafia cartel ran from 1992 to 2005. In the beginning, the  cartel met at the Blauer Salon, a hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany.  Cartel meetings subsequently took place at a series of top hotels all over Europe – Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich, Strasbourg and others, according to the Commissioner.

German-South African manufacturer Sasol was the leader of the  cartel, and was rewarded with a EUR 318 mln fine. France's Total received a EUR 128 mln  fine, while U.S.-based Exxon Mobil will have to pay a
EUR 83 mln penalty. Other companies involved in the  cartel – including MOL – were awarded  fines
between EUR 12–37 mln each.
U.K.-based oil major Shell, which blew the whistle on the  cartel, has escaped what would have been a
EUR 96 mln fine, Kroes added.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products – tyres, car components,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, packaging, adhesive, candles, chewing gum, and the  wax coating on cheese, among others.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Holcim Hungaria Zrt, the Hungarian unit of Swiss cement maker Holcim, has received a construction permit for its planned EUR 300-mln new cement factory in northern Hungary's Nyergesujfalu, the company announced in a statement.

"Securing the construction permit is a significant step for us," chairman-CEO Richard Skene was quoted saying. "We are convinced that remaining preparatory measures can be completed soon."

Holcim said earlier it will employ 280 workers in the Nyergesujfalu factory, once production starts in 2010. Of these, 228 will be transferred from Holcim's other factory in nearby Labatlan, which will be closed down following the new factory's completion.

Before the launch of construction, Holcim still needs to finalize agreements with subcontractors, and take additional steps to prepare the site for building.

The new cement factory will have annual capacity of 1.77 mln tonnes. Preparations to build the factory began in 2005.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungarian developer Biggeorge's-NV is ready to launch construction of a HUF 20–25 bln airport near the Hungarian city of Szekesfehervar 60 kilometers west of the capital Budapest, in the first part of 2009, Robert Stalmayer, the director of the project company, told Interfax.

"After a long procedure to get the permits, which took nearly four years, we now have all necessary authorizations to start the HUF 20–25 bln investment in the first part of 2009," Stalmayer said.

The development, to be named Alba Airport, will open for business at the start of the summer season in March 2010. The project company, Alba Airport Kft, is currently 50% owned by Biggeorge's-NV and 25% each by the local governments of Szekesfehervar and the neighboring town of Aba. However, Biggeorge's-NV's share will soon increase to 90% while the municipalities will own a total of 10%.

Stalmayer said the airport will be built on a 180-hectare plot on a run-down former military air base, owned by the local governments but leased to Alba Airport for a period of 60 years.

Stalmayer could not yet provide details of the financing plan of the project, but noted that Alba Airport expects to involve outside investors as well.

"We are in the process of finding other investors, such as property developers or professional investors, and although the credit crunch will surely impede this process, this project is good enough to attract other companies," Stalmayer noted.

The company sees Alba Airport as possibly the first genuine rival to Hungary's main international airport, Ferihegy near Budapest. While Ferihegy handles more than eight million passengers a year, most small regional airports in Hungary have rarely managed beyond a few tens of thousands of passengers a year.

"We expect to already have 150,000 passengers in 2010, while the capacity of the airport is eventually seen to be expanded to two million," Stalmayer said, noting that he expects to reach one million passengers by the fifth year of operation.

Stalmayer said that although the airport initially plans to serve low-cost airlines and charter flights, the facility will be able to accommodate traditional airlines as well.

Stalmayer noted that he is optimistic regarding the airport's growth potential because of its advantageous location, close to major tourist destinations Budapest, lake Balaton and lake Velencei, which are seen
Page 47 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
attracting a sizable influx of foreign tourists. Meanwhile, plans to create direct bus and train services to the airport are aimed at maximizing the airport's domestic catchment area.

"The airport can be reached in a 90-minute drive by 3.5 million potential passengers, and this is essential in order to bring a discount airline base here," Stalmayer said.

He added that a low-cost airline base is expected to be opened at Alba Airport by the third or fourth year of operation.

In addition to creating new jobs locally, Alba Airport is also seen boosting the regional economy, by increasing tourist activity as well as bringing in industries that involve significant moves in personnel, such as the automotive and pharmaceutical industries.

Stalmayer noted that the company also plans to set up an industrial park on a 110-hectare plot near the airport, which is expected to attract additional passengers to the airport.

CURRENT AFFAIRS: One Third of Hungarians Strongly Prejudiced against Foreigners – Study – According to a regular survey prepared by pollster Tarki on Hungarian's general attitude towards
foreigners, the last year has brought no major changes. One third of the population would keep the nation's borders hermetically sealed, some 10% are pro-foreigners while the largest group, 58% of the total population would contemplate allowing entry based on the applicant's nationality.

An interesting element in the study is measuring the general attitude towards "Piresians," citizens of a non-existent country created by researchers. Rejection of the fictitious ethnicity has not changed much
from last year's 68%, since 66% of all Hungarians would still not allow them to enter the country, Tarki said. [Nepszabadsag]

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – The Hungarian forint continued to ease against major currencies on Wednesday as the market confidently awaits the U.S. Senate's decision later on Wednesday on the banking sector bailout bill.

The Hungarian forint opened weaker than Tuesday's closing mark, and although it firmed later in the morning, it lost ground again after the publication of poor EU and U.S. employment data in the afternoon and closed at EUR/HUF 242.53, which compares to late Tuesday's EUR/HUF 241.36.
The forint-U.S. dollar pair traded in a similar path and closed at USD/HUF 172.80, which compares to
Tuesday's USD/HUF 171.73.

Fixed-income yields were down on Wednesday, falling 2-14 basis points across the board, according to data provided by the Government Debt Management Agency (AKK).

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL EUROPE - Hungary's top oil and gas company MOL has received a EUR 23 mln fine from the European Commission (EC), as part of a  cartel investigation involving the EU's paraffin  wax market that led to fines totaling EUR 676 mln.

"The cartel covered about 75% of the European market in paraffin wax, lasted for 13 years, and included 10 companies," Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition Policy announced in Brussels Wednesday. "The companies have been  fined a total of EUR 676 mln, the fourth largest  fine ever imposed by the EC in a  cartel case, [reflecting] both the long duration of the  cartel and the size of the market concerned - nearly EUR 500 mln a year."

TD
Kroes said the  paraffin  mafia cartel ran from 1992 to 2005. In the beginning, the  cartel met at the Blauer Salon, a hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany.  Cartel meetings subsequently took place at a series of top hotels all over  Europe - Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich, Strasbourg and others, according to the Commissioner.
German-South African manufacturer Sasol was the leader of the  cartel, and was rewarded with a EUR
318 mln fine. France's Total received a EUR 128 mln  fine, while U.S.-based Exxon Mobil will have to
pay a EUR 83 mln penalty. Other companies involved in the  cartel - including MOL - were awarded
fines between EUR 12-37 mln each.
U.K.-based oil major Shell, which blew the whistle on the  cartel, has escaped what would have been a
EUR 96 mln fine, Kroes added.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products - tyres, car components,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, packaging, adhesive, candles, chewing gum, and the  wax coating on cheese, among others.

SOL - Sasol - Statement Issued By
Sasol Limited In Response To An Announcement
By The European  Commission

Sasol Limited

(Incorporated in South Africa) (Registration number: 1979/003231/06) ISIN Code: ZAE000006896
JSE Code: SOL NYSE Code: SSL
("Sasol" or "the Company")

Statement issued by Sasol Limited in response to an announcement by the

European  Commission regarding a finding of anti-competitive behaviour by
Sasol
Wax GmbH and other members of the European  paraffin  wax industry

As anticipated in several previous announcements made by Sasol Limited, the

European Union found that members of the European  paraffin  wax industry, including Sasol Wax GmbH, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws. A fine of EUR 318 200 000 was imposed by the European  Commission on Sasol Wax GmbH (of which Sasol Wax International AG, Sasol Holding in Germany GmbH and Sasol
Limited would be jointly and severally be liable for EUR 250 million). The

fine is payable within three months.

As a result of Sasol's co-operation and support in the investigations, the

European  Commission reduced the base amount of the fine by 50% to the net

amount stated above.


Page 54 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of
this fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it.
According to the statement of objections of the European  Commission an infringement of antitrust laws commenced in 1992 or even earlier. In 1995
Sasol became a co-shareholder in an existing wax business located in Hamburg, Germany owned by the Schumann group.  In July 2002 Sasol acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture and became the sole shareholder of the
business. Sasol Limited was unaware of these infringements before the

European  Commission commenced their investigation at the wax business in

Hamburg in April 2005.

Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition
and anti-trust law compliance programmes in all its businesses including joint
ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition laws.

PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Total has been fined about 128 million  euros ($181 million) by the  European
Commission for fixing prices of paraffin  wax, the French oil company said on Wednesday.

A Total spokeswoman said the company's French division was one of nine accused of fixing the price of the wax used for candles and  waxed paper between 1992 and 2005.

TD
The Commission also fined South Africa's Sasol and Italy's Eni but the spokeswoman did not specify how much. Royal Dutch Shell was not  fined, she added.

The European Commission had informed Total of its decision on Wednesday, Total said, but it had yet to receive the supporting arguments.

"Total will examine the supporting arguments of the judgment and examine the means of appeal," the spokeswoman said. Total received notification in 2007 of the claim that nine companies had exchanged confidential information concerning  paraffin wax.

Shares in Total, the world's fourth largest company, were little changed at 42.5  euros by 0853 GMT. (Reporting by Vanessa Walters and Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Paul Bolding)

HD      UPDATE 4-EU fines "paraffin mafia"  wax makers' cartel

(Adds ENI reaction, para 12)

BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined nine petrochemicals companies a total of 676 million euros ($955 million) on Wednesday for forming a "paraffin  mafia" to fix prices and carve
up markets for paraffin  wax.

TD
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic
damage," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide range of products from candles to paper cups and plates, the  wax
coating of cheese, chemicals, tyres and chewing gum.

The biggest individual  fine of 318.2 million  euros was imposed on Sasol of South Africa and Germany, which the European Union executive described as the leader of the illegal  cartel, an official statement said.

Anglo-Dutch oil major Shell escaped a potential  fine of 96 million euros because it blew the whistle first to the EU competition authorities.

Kroes said the  cartel was known inside Shell as the "paraffin  mafia" and in Sasol as "Blauer Saloon" (Blue Saloon) after the hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany, where the first meetings of executives from the companies were held.

It was a very serious infringement of EU treaty antitrust rules, compounded by the duration of the  cartel, she said.

It was the fourth-highest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a sector, topped only by the record 992.3 million euros on elevator companies last year, 790.5 million on makers of vitamins in 2001 and 750.5 million on manufacturers of gas insulated switchgear in 2007.
SASOL APPEAL
Sasol, the world's biggest maker of motor fuel from coal, said it would likely appeal the ruling.

"Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it," the company said in a statement.

The other companies  fined were Total (128.1 million), Exxon Mobil (83.6 million  euros), RWE (37.4 million), ENI (29 million), Hansen & Rosenthal <24 million), MOL (23.7 million), Repsol (19.8 million), and Tudapetrol (12 million).

Eni said it would appeal, adding it noted "the  Commission has estimated the company's involvement ... as marginal and limited in time (2002-2005)."

Page 58 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said the cartel activity took place between 1992 and 2005, when it began investigating with raids on petrochemicals companies prompted by an application from Shell for leniency in return for information provided.
The companies were well aware their activity was illegal, Kroes added.

"I sincerely hope... that these high  fines will encourage the management of these companies and others to look very carefully at what their staff are doing, and I hope that in turn the shareholders... will look very carefully at the management," she said.

THe Commission said individuals or companies that were victims of the  cartel were entitled to seek damages in national courts of EU member states.

HD       EU Fines Sasol R3,7 Billion Over 'Paraffin  Mafia' BY        by Siseko Njobeni
WC      706 words
PD       2 October 2008
ET        11:05 AM SN       All Africa SC       AFNWS LA        English
CY       (c) 2008 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved

LP
Johannesburg, Oct 02, 2008 (Business Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE  European      Commission yesterday slapped a EUR 318,2m (R3,7bn) fine on Sasol for its role as a leader of a
price-fixing "paraffin  mafia" cartel that operated in the European paraffin  wax market for 13 years.
The cartel of nine was jointly  fined EUR 676m, and Sasol's penalty was the largest.

TD
The commission started investigating the  cartel in 2005 when one of the members, oil multinational
Shell, blew the whistle on the companies' activities in return for immunity from a EUR 96m  fine.
"Shell was the first company to inform us about the  cartel," European Competition Policy Commissioner
Neelie Kroes said yesterday. 96m  fine.
The EUR 318,2m, the biggest antitrust  fine imposed on a South African company and which Sasol said
it might appeal against, dwarfs the punishment meted out to the other members of the  cartel. Kroes said
this was because of the role Sasol played as leader of the  cartel. The fine is payable in three months.
Sasol's financial statements for the year to June showed it had R4,3bn in cash and cash equivalents.

The other  cartel members are: Total (France,  fined EUR 128m), Exxon Mobil (US, EUR 83m), Repsol, (Spain, EUR 20m), Tudapetrol (Germany, EUR 12m), Hansen and Rosenthal (Germany, EUR 24m), RWE (Germany, EUR 37m) and MOL (Hungary, EUR 23m).

The EUR 676m  fine is the fourth-highest yet imposed by the  commission. Kroes said the penalty was a reflection of the duration of the  cartel and the size of the affected market, which was worth almost EUR
500m a year.

"There is probably not a household or a company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this cartel," she said.

Kroes said in a hard-hitting statement that the  cartel's meetings took place at top hotels in Milan, Vienna, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg. Kroes said companies participating in the  cartel knew what they were doing, and that it was wrong.

This was not Sasol's first brush with competition authorities. In May 2005, SA's Competition Commission found that Sasol Chemicals and two other companies, Kynoch and Omnia Fertiliser, had fixed fertiliser prices. The matter has since been referred to the Competition Tribunal.

Sasol spokeswoman Jacqui O'Sullivan said yesterday the group was surprised, did not understand the reasons for the magnitude of the  fine, and would be "studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal against it".
O'Sullivan said the group was not aware of the infringements before the start of the probe in April 2005. But analyst Paul Theron of stockbroking firm Vestact said an appeal might be ill-advised, given that the
fine was reduced by 50% for good behaviour.


Page 62 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said news of the  fine coincided with a recovery in Sasol's share price after Monday's sell-off. "Before the news of the  fine broke, the share was trading at R363,63. It fell about R10 per share, but has recovered a bit since then."

Theron said that had it not been for the news of the  fine, Sasol's share price might have recovered more.
Sasol fell 5,12% on the JSE yesterday and it was R332 at the close.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products, including tyres, car components,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, packaging, chewing gum,  wax coating on cheese, and candles.
The cartel covered 75% of the  European paraffin wax market.

"I hope that the harsh lesson of these high  fines will encourage the management of these companies to look very carefully at what their staff is doing. And I hope that in turn the shareholders of these companies look very carefully at the management," Kroes said.
The commission earlier this year ordered Microsoft to pay EUR 899m for not complying with terms of a
2004 ruling.

In 1995, three years after the apparent start of the anticompetitive behaviour, Sasol became a co-shareholder in a wax business in Hamburg, Germany, owned by the Schumann group.
In July 2002, Sasol acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture.

HD       Sasol's Image Hurt By Its R3,7 Billion Fix

Johannesburg, Oct 02, 2008 (Business Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE stink that goes with being branded a price fixer may give Sasol a bigger hangover than the EUR 318,2m (R3,7bn)  fine imposed by the European Commission for its role in the "paraffin  Mafia".
Sasol and other groups, including Exxon Mobil, Total Respsol, Tudapetrol, Hansen & Rosenthal, RWE
and MOL, find themselves in the  commission's firing line.

TD
Their sin? From 1992 to 2005, representatives of these companies, excluding Sasol, which joined the cartel only when it became a shareholder in a German  wax business owned by the Schumann group three years later, met at top  European hotels and hatched plans to fix prices and share markets for the sale of paraffin wax. And they were not small-time players.

The companies, which called themselves "the blue saloon group", accounted for 75% of the  European  paraffin wax market. Paraffin wax is used in tyres, car parts,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, chewing gum and candles.

The commission imposed a fine of EUR 676m (R7,9bn) on the companies, the fourth-largest  fine it has imposed to date. It said Sasol was not just an obscure member of the  cartel but took a leading role. For this reason, the EC saw fit to make Sasol's  fine heavier at EUR 318,2m.

Sasol said it would study the ruling and consider appealing. But a Cape Town analyst said Sasol should just pay the  fine and move on. "Their cash flows are more than enough to pay it."

Warwick Lucas of Imara SP Reid agreed. The  fine was about 11% of profits, so Sasol could pay it. "It should not damage their project pipeline."

Bearing the financial burden should be easier than shaking off a tag as a price fixer. Just look at the number of times Tiger Brands and  price fixing  have been mentioned in the same breath in the past year.

Sasol must now embark on the long journey to win back public confidence and mend the harm to its reputation. This seems to have started in earnest.

The group said, "Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and antitrust law compliance programmes in all its businesses, including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition law."

Yesterday started with much promise for Sasol. At one stage its share price on the JSE was R363,63, but it tumbled 4,54% to R334 at the close. Sasol admitted it was taken aback at the size of the  fine. It expected less, having been the second company, after Shell, to offer full co-operation.
The chronology of events raises questions. Sasol became a shareholder in the German  wax business in
1995 and got full ownership in 2002. The EC says the price fixing  started in 1992. So what happens to
the previous shareholders under whose watch the price fixing  started?

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: “Paraffin mafia” heavily fined

Brussels, 01/10/2008 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday 1 October, the  European Commission imposed a total of €676,011,400  fines on 9 groups - ENI, ExxonMobil, Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, RWE and Total - for participating in a  cartel for paraffin  wax in the European Economic Area (EEA) between 1992 and 2005. Shell also participated in the cartel but was not fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. The infringement committed by ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, RWE and Total also related to slack wax sold to end-customers on the German market.
Slack wax is the raw material used to produce paraffin  wax. All participants fixed prices for the products concerned.

TD
ExxonMobil, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, Shell and Total, in addition, allocated markets and customers for
paraffin waxes.
“There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia' cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic
damage,” Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told press. Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety
of products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the wax coating on cheese, chemicals,
tyres and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries.
Kroes estimated the value of the market at almost €500 million.

In the Shell group, the  cartel was called “paraffin  mafia” and in the Sasol group, “Blauer Salon” (“blue saloon”), after a hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the  cartel took place. Subsequent meetings took place at a series of top hotels all over  Europe, including Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg. The cartel constituted a very serious infringement of EC Treaty antitrust rules, Kroes pointed out. In setting the fines (the fourth highest ever imposed by the  Commission), the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the cartel agreements. Sasol's  fine was increased by 50% because it was the leader of the cartel. The Commission increased the fines for ENI and Shell
by 60% because they had already been fined for cartel activities in previous Commission decisions, but
Shell was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel under the Commission's
2002 Leniency Notice and, therefore, received full immunity from  fines. The Commission, acting under its
leniency programme, also rewarded three groups for cooperating with the investigation. Sasol, Repsol and
ExxonMobil were granted a reduction of their  fines of 50%, 25% and 7% respectively.
In concrete terms, Shell has received a 100% reduction under the leniency programme (the €96 million
fine has been written off) and will not have to pay anything. Sasol has been  fined €318.2 million (including
reduction), Repsol €19.8 million (including reduction), ExxonMobil €83.58 million (including reduction), ENI
€29.12 million, Tudapetrol €12 million, Hansen & Rosenthal €24 million, MOL €23.7 million, RWE €37.44
million and Total €128.16 million.

The Commission points out that any person or company adversely affected by cartels can refer the case to member states' courts to seek damages. (O.L./transl.rt)

Commission

SASOL LTD ("SSL-N") - Statement Issued by Sasol Limited in Response to an Announcement - by the European Commission Statement issued by Sasol Limited, in response to an announcement by the European Commission regarding a finding of anti-competitive behaviour by Sasol  Wax GmbH and other members of the European paraffin  wax industry. As anticipated in several previous announcements
made by Sasol Limited, the European Union found that members of the European paraffin  wax industry, including Sasol Wax GmbH, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws. A fine of EUR 318 200 000 was imposed by the European Commission on Sasol Wax GmbH (of which Sasol  Wax International AG, Sasol Holding in Germany GmbH and Sasol Limited would be jointly and severally be liable for EUR 250 million). The  fine is payable within three months.

TD
As a result of Sasol's co-operation and support in the investigations, the  European Commission reduced the base amount of the  fine by 50% to the net amount stated above. Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with
a view to lodge an appeal against it. According to the statement of objections of the  European                   Commission an infringement of antitrust laws commenced in 1992 or even earlier. In 1995 Sasol became a co-shareholder in an existing  wax business located in Hamburg, Germany owned by the Schumann group. In July 2002 Sasol acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture and became the sole shareholder of the business. Sasol Limited was unaware of these infringements before the  European       Commission commenced their investigation at the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005. Sasol views this matter in a serious light and has intensified its competition and anti-trust law compliance programmes in all its businesses including joint ventures. It is Sasol's policy to comply with all applicable laws, including competition laws.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined Spanish oil company Repsol YPF and eight other petrochemical manufacturers €676 million for colluding to fix the price of  paraffin wax.

Repsol was fined €19.8 million. The biggest penalty was imposed on South Africa's Sasol, which was fined €318.2 million. Other members of the cartel, which operated in the period 1992-2005, included ExxonMobil and Shell, which escaped a fine because it gave Brussels information about it.

The EU’s competition regulator yesterday slapped a  fine of 318.2 million euros (R3.7 billion) on the European wax division of petrochemicals producer Sasol for leading a price-fixing cartel dubbed the “paraffin  mafia”.

The penalty, payable in three months, is nearly 10 times the R381 million operating profit generated in the year to June 2008 by Sasol  Wax, the unit that houses the group’s Hamburg-based  European       wax operations.

TD
Sasol said in response that it was “surprised and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this fine”.
It would be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal.
Sasol’s fine comprises nearly half of the total 676 million  euros penalty imposed on nine  cartel
participants. The others are:
n Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest oil multinational;
n Italian oil and gas group ENI;
n German groups Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol and RWE;
n Hungarian oil producer MOL;
n Spanish oil group Repsol; and n French oil major Total.

Europe’s biggest oil group, Shell, avoided a  fine because it had disclosed the  cartel.
South Africa’s competition  commission said yesterday that it had received complaints against
Sasol’s South African  wax division for excessive pricing and exclusionary practices.
“We are looking into it,” said commissioner Shan Ramburuth. He said no formal investigation had yet been launched.

The European Commission has fined nine companies a total of €676 million ($946 million) for operating a price-fixing "paraffin  mafia."

The nine -- which include South Africa's Sasol, France's Total and US supermajor Exxon Mobil -- were found guilty of participating in a  paraffin wax cartel from 1992 to 2005 in the  European Economic Area in violation of  European Union rules.

TD
A 10th company, Royal Dutch Shell, had its fine waived after its tip-off led to surprise raids in April 2005 by the commission. Shell would have been fined €96 million.
The steepest €318.2 million fine was levied on Sasol, which the  commission identified as the
ring-leader, while Total was fined €128.2 million and Exxon €83.6 million. RWE was  fined €37.4 million,
Eni €29.1 million, Hansen & Rosenthal €24 million, Mol €23.7 million, Repsol YPF €19.8 million and
Tudapetrol €12 million.
Sasol's  fine would have been double had it not cooperated, while Eni's  fine was increased by 60%
because of its involvement in other cartels dating back to the 1980s (OD Dec.6,p7).

The European Commission fined nine petrochemical companies a total of $955 million on
Wednesday for forming a "paraffin  mafia" to fix prices and carve up markets for  paraffin wax.

"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Johannesburg: The European Union’s competition regulator yesterday slapped a  fine of e318.2 million (R3.7 billion) on the European wax division of petrochemicals producer Sasol for leading a price-fixing cartel dubbed the “paraffin  mafia”.
The penalty, payable within three months, is nearly 10 times the R381m operating profit generated
in the year to June 2008 by Sasol  Wax, the unit that houses the group’s Hamburg-based  European
wax operations.

TD
Sasol said in response that it was “surprised and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine”. It would be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal.

Sasol’s fine comprises nearly half of the total e676m penalty imposed on nine  cartel participants. The others are:
l Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest oil multinational;
l Italian oil and gas group ENI;
l German groups Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol and RWE;
l Hungarian oil producer MOL;
l Spanish oil group Repsol; and
l French oil major Total.

Europe’s biggest oil group, Shell, avoided a  fine because it had disclosed the existence of the
cartel.

SA’s Competition  Commission said yesterday it had received complaints against Sasol’s SA  wax division for excessive pricing and exclusionary practices. “We are looking into it,” said commissioner Shan Ramburuth.

Sasol, the world’s big-gest maker of motor fuel from coal, said it would likely appeal the hefty  fine
imposed on it by the  European Commission for fixing prices.

The EC charged nine petrochemicals companies a total of E676 million (R7.9 billion) yesterday for forming a “paraffin  mafia” to fix prices and carve up markets for  paraffin wax.

TD
“There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this ‘paraffin  mafia’ cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage,” EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide range of products from candles to paper cups and plates, the  wax
coating of cheese, chemicals, tyres and chewing gum.

The biggest individual  fine of E318.2 million was imposed on Sasol of South Africa and Germany, which the European Union executive described as the leader of the illegal  cartel, an official statement said.

Kroes said the  cartel was known inside Shell as the “paraffin  mafia” and in Sasol as “Blauer Saloon” (Blue Saloon) after the hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany, where the first meetings of executives from the companies were held.
It was a very serious infringement of EU treaty anti-trust rules, compounded by the duration of the
cartel, she said.

“Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it,” the company said in a statement.

Anglo-Dutch oil major Shell escaped a potential  fine of E96 million because it blew the whistle first to the EU competition authorities.

The Commission said the cartel activity took place bet-ween 1992 and 2005, when it began investigating with raids on petrochemicals companies prompted by an application from Shell for leniency in return for information provided.
The companies were well aware their activity was illegal, Kroes added.

£535m price-fixing fine
A CARTEL of oil companies were yesterday  fined £535million for price-fixing.

TD
The European Commission described the 10 firms who took part as the continent's "ParaffinMafia".
They spent 13 years manipulating the price of  paraffin wax.

It has hundreds of uses, from packaging, adhesives and chewing gum to candles,  waxed paper and the coating on cheese.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "There is probably not a household or company in
Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'ParaffinMafia' cartel.

"Such illegal  cartel behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the  commission and companies' managers and shareholders should take note."

The commission investigation started with surprise inspections in April 2005, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Shell under the EU's 2002 "leniency notice".
They escaped punishment yesterday.

The nine firms  fined were ENI, ExxonMobil, Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, RWE and Total.

The first cartel meeting took place in Germany in 1992. Others were held at a series of top hotels in cities all over Europe, including Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg.

The firms discussed prices, allocated markets and customers, and exchanged sensitive commercial information.
Kroes said the  cartel's activities were "a very serious infringement of EU Treaty anti-trust rules".

The European Commission has today fined MOL Euro 23.7 million for participating in an alleged concerted activity with regard to the European paraffin  market for the period of 1992-2005.

TD
As MOL has already stated while co-operating with the  Commission on this matter, MOL's position is that no official corporate decision was made with regard to participating in  cartel-type behaviour in case of the affected product.

Paraffin  sales represent a very small proportion, less than 0,5% of MOL's total revenues. The sales activity in this market was undertaken by an earlier acquired subsidiary of MOL in the beginning of the investigated period, and following that was taken over to the parent company's responsibility.

MOL regrets that in the 1990s it did not at that time have sufficient internal controlling and audit systems which could have identified and filtered out a situation such as that identified by the  Commission in its investigation.

MOL has yet to study the final decision and has a period of two months in which to reflect on the findings of the decision and in order to determine whether to lodge an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

HD          Majors hit by $1 billion EU fine over paraffin cartel

The European Commission has fined nine companies including ExxonMobil, Eni and Total more than Eur676 million ($959 million) for operating a  price fixing cartel on paraffin wax headed by South African refiner Sasol.

The Commission said that from 1992 to 2005, the producers of  paraffin waxes and its feedstock slack wax in the European Economic Area operated a "paraffin  mafia" in which they fixed prices for paraffin  waxes.

TD
ExxonMobil, Hungary's MOL, Spain's Repsol YPF, Sasol, Shell and Total engaged in market allocation for paraffin  and ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, Germany's RWE and Total also fixed prices for slack  wax sold to end-customers on the German market.

The biggest  fine of over Eur318 million was handed out to South African refiner Sasol, which saw its penalty increased by 50% because it was the leader of the  cartel.
ExxonMobil received an a  fine of Eur83.5 million, with smaller penalties going to fellow  cartel
members Repsol, Italy's Eni, Germany's Tudapetrol, Hansen & Rosenthal and RWE, Total and MOL.

Shell escaped any  fine under the EU's whistle-blower rule, which applies to companies that help the EU competition authorities uncover a  cartel. Eni's fine of Eur29.1 million was increased by 60% as it had previously taken part in similar cartels, the Commission said.

"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"Such illegal  cartel behavior cannot and will not be tolerated by the  Commission, and companies' managers and shareholders should take note."

Sasol said it was "surprised" by the ruling and is considering grounds to appeal its  fine, which must be paid within three months. "Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal against it," the company said in a statement.

Sasol said it was unaware of the  cartel infringements before the  Commission began its investigation into the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005.

In a statement, ExxonMobil said it "deeply regrets" its involvement in the  cartel, adding the employees concerned no longer work at the company.

Despite Sasol's base  fine being increased by 50% to reflect its leadership of the  cartel, the Commission said it later reduced the  fine by the same amount in a leniency move as the refiner had cooperated with its investigation.

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety of products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the wax coating on cheese, chemicals, tires and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries. The  European market is worth almost Eur500 million/year.

The Commission launched its investigation with a round of surprise inspections in April 2005, prompted by notification of the  cartel and by an application for immunity lodged by Shell.

The Commission said the companies involved held regular meetings to discuss prices, allocate markets and/or customers and to exchange sensitive commercial information.
Within Shell, the  cartel was referred to as the "paraffin  mafia" and in the Sasol group, as the "Blauer
Salon" (blue saloon), after a hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the  cartel took place.

Subsequent meetings took place at a series of top hotels all over  Europe, including Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg, the  Commission said.

HD     RENEWED CALL FOR SASOL RE-NATIONALISATION WC    486 words

LP
News of Sasol's R3,7 billion  fine for price fixing  and market sharing  led to renewed calls for the renationalisation of the chemical and fuel company on Thursday.

Sasol was fined about R3,68 billion (Euro 6,7 million) on Wednesday by the European Commission for being a leader of a cartel, which, with eight other companies, was found to have fixed prices for paraffin wax products in Europe.

TD
"The EU  fine once more underlines the correctness of the SACP's call for the re-nationalisation of this strategically critical corporation," said the SA Communist Party of the company which was privatised in
1979.

It argued that because Sasol produces about 30 percent of local oil needs, it is an extremely important national strategic asset.

The party also claimed the company charges the same price as an imported product for products it manufactures locally.
"... as if Sasol oil had come all the way from the Middle East," it commented.

They called for intervention by the SA Competition  Commission and the introduction of a windfall tax on the company's oil profits which would be invested in energy security and public transport.
The Competition  Commission's Shan Ramburuth said the structure of the market for the supply of
paraffin wax is different in South Africa from that of the  European Union.
"In fact in South Africa, Sasol is dominant in the supply of  wax and the collusion does not arise," he said. "However, participants in this market have raised concerns with the  commission with regard to Sasol's
pricing and exclusionary conduct. The  commission is looking into these concerns."

A commission tribunal previously prohibited Sasol's purchase of Price's candles because of exclusionary conduct, but the company successfully appealed this and bought the company.

The commission recently completed an investigation into Sasol's role in an investigation into the fertiliser industry. The company provides one of the inputs for fertiliser. This will be heard before a tribunal shortly.

Company spokesman Johann van Rheede said the company would not comment further until it had read the full documentation related to the  fine.
On Wednesday it announced that it may appeal as it did not understand why the  fine was so big.
The company did not respond to a question on whether it could afford to pay the  fine (over three months)
or if anyone had resigned or been fired as a direct result of the  commission's decision.
Cosatu's Patrick Craven said the latest "scandal" reinforced their call for the nationalisation of Sasol.

Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety of products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the wax coating on cheese, chemicals, tyres and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries. The market is worth almost 500 million  euros, the European Commission said.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FREQUENCY 'Urgent' need for Brown to take more risks

AS IF things couldn't get any worse for him, it is only a matter of time before risk-averse Gordon Brown completely loses the confidence of his colleagues and country, according to a leading human resources and management consultant.

Bridget Biggar, managing director of Management Intelligence Consulting, says the troubled prime minister's "psychological signals" are "on completely the wrong frequency", despite some respite in attacks on his "dithering" since the Labour Party conference.

Biggar says there is possibly a way back for him, but only if he goes completely against his psychological make-up - and starts to take risks and bring urgency into his personality.

She adds: "Ironically, he's actually overplaying his strengths, he's trying too hard - in doing so, he is moving from productive use of those strengths to excessive, causing a sure and insidious fall off in credibility.

"As chancellor to Tony Blair, his risk-averse nature was disguised by Blair's high-energy and human approach. But Brown's personality traits and approach have shot to the fore since he entered Number
10."
Conclusion: our ideal PM is a Brown/Blair hybrid? A scary thought. FACT OF THE DAY 98,652
PORSCHE sold 98,652 vehicles in the year to 31 July, a 1.2 per cent rise on the previous year. This included 45,478 Cayennes, Porsche's sports utility vehicle, sales of which were up by 34 per cent.

But sales of the classic 911 fell by 16 per cent to 31,423, while sales of the Boxster series were down by 16.8 per cent to 21,747.

The European Commission imposed one of the highest cartel fines in its history yesterday as it penalised nine companies for operating an illegal "paraffin  mafia" for more than 13years.

The combined penalties of Euro 676 million (Pounds 534 million) on the companies for fixing prices and carving up markets for paraffin  wax - which is used in products such as candles, tyres and adhesives - are the latest sign of the Commission's determination to stamp out cartels that prevent customers benefiting from competition.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, said: "There is probably not a household or company in Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage."

The Commission made dawn raids on the companies three years ago after Shell, one of its members, blew the whistle on the illegal activities.

The investigators found that the companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, allocate markets and customers and exchange sensitive commercial information.

Shell escaped a possible  fine because it provided the  Commission investigators with the initial vital information.

Sasol, the South African-German company that was considered the leader of the group, was  fined      Euro 318.2 million. Among its employees, the  cartel was dubbed the Blauer Salon (Blue Saloon) after the hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings were held.

Sasol, the world's biggest manufacturer of motor fuel from coal said: "Sasol is surprised by and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it."
The other companies  fined were Total of France (Euro 128.2 million), ExxonMobil of the US (Euro
83.6 million), RWE of Germany (Euro 37.4 million), ENI of Italy (Euro 29.1 million), Hansen &
Rosenthal of Germany (Euro 24 million), MOL of Hungary (Euro 23.7 million), Repsol of Spain (Euro
19.8 million) and Tudapetrol of Germany (Euro 12 million).
The global paraffin wax market is worth almost  Euro 500 million. (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2008

HD          Sasol faces R3,7bn EU price-fixing penalty

The European Union’s competition regulator has slapped a  fine of e318,2-million (about R3,7-billion) on the European wax division of petrochemicals producer Sasol for leading a  price-fixing cartel dubbed the “paraffin  mafia”.

The penalty, payable in three months, is nearly 10 times the R381-million operating profit generated in the year to June 2008 by Sasol  Wax, the unit that houses the group’s Hamburg-based  European wax operations.

TD
Sasol said in response yesterday that it was “surprised and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine”.
It would be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal.

Sasol’s fine comprises nearly half of the total e676-million penalty imposed on nine  cartel participants. The other guilty parties are:
nExxon Mobil, the world’s biggest oil multinational. nItalian oil and gas group ENI.
nGerman groups Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol and RWE. nHungarian oil producer MOL.
nSpanish oil group Repsol.
nFrench oil major Total.

Europe’s biggest oil group, Shell, avoided a  fine because it had disclosed the  cartel.
South Africa’s Competition  Commission said yesterday it had received complaints against Sasol’s
South African  wax division for excessive pricing and exclusionary practices.

“We are looking into it,” said commissioner Shan Ramburuth, adding that no formal investigation had yet been launched.

Because Sasol is the dominant producer of  wax in South Africa, competition issues revolve less around collusion than dominance. The Competition Tribunal prohibited a merger between Sasol and candle-making group Prices Daelite several years ago, but this was subsequently overturned by the Competition Appeal Court.

The European Union issued a massive fine overnight against nine companies for  cartel-behaviour. Could be something in it for Australia's competition watchdog. By Glenn Dyer.
The Australian's Matthew Stevens
(http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24433025-5001641,00.html) took a swipe at the
European Union's investigation of the BHP Billiton bid for Rio Tinto. From what he wrote, he seems to
think the EU doesn't know vey much about competition or things like cartels,  price fixing  and the like.
Unlike the ACCC with its long and impeccable track record of victories?

TD
Well, Matthew should have a chat to the ACCC who will tell him that the  Europeans  are the nasty folk of world trade and anti-cartel behaviour. They are the heavy guys of global competition authorities and take the whole idea of competition very seriously indeed.
(http://europa
.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1434&type=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLangua
ge=en) And overnight they scored a huge win over a claimed  cartel that fixed the price of  wax used in
candles, plates and paper cups.

It doesn't sound much, but the  fine was huge -- 676 million euros, close to $A1.2 billion, depending on exchange rates. That was the fourth highest  fine from the EU ever (
(http://europa
.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/600&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiL
anguage=en) check this list for all-time list). The companies involved were Exxon, Total, ENI, Saso1
(which was fined 318 million euros and the fourth highest individual  fine ever) and five others. Nine
companies in total. Sasol's fine was boosted by 50% because it was the leader of the pack.
The Commission said the cartel ran from 1992 to 2005.

They might be a bunch of  European public servants, but they don't scare easily, and as the link to the website shows, have levied some enormous  fines in major industries and against some of the world's biggest companies.

So they won't be pressured or threatened by lobbying by BHP, Rio or  European steel groups, or by BHP's supporters in Melbourne.

HD      COMPETITION : COMMISSION FINES NINE COMPANIES OVER PARAFFIN WAX CARTEL WC     424 words

The European Commission announced, on 1 October, that it had  fined nine paraffin wax producers a total of €676 million for sharing the  European market and fixing prices for 13 years.

For the two biggest  fines, Sasol (Germany, South Africa) will have to pay €318.2 million and the French company Total €128.1 million. Then ENI (Italy) will have to pay €29.1 million; the American company ExxonMobil €83.5 million; German companies Hansen & Rosenthal €24 million; Tudapetrol €12 million; RWE €37.4 million; the Hungarian company MOL €23.7 million and the Spanish company Repsol €19.8 million.

TD
Paraffin waxes are used in products such as candles,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, the  wax coating on cheese, chemicals, tyres and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries. The  European market is worth almost €500 million.

A tenth company involved in the cartel, Shell (UK-Netherlands), was exempted from paying any  fine as it was the first to denounce the cartel to the EU executive. "Shell and its shareholders did the right thing," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, knowing that, lacking this denunciation, the petrol giant would have had to settle a bill for €96 million. Other discounts were granted to Sasol, Repsol and ExxonMobil. These three groups benefit from a reduction of their  fine of 50%, 25% and 7%, respectively, for having cooperated in the  Commission's investigation, as set out in its leniency programme adopted in
2002.

The meetings between the incriminated parties took place at a series of top hotels all over  Europe, including Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg. The infringements committed by ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, RWE and Total also concerned slack  wax - a raw material used in the production of  paraffin wax - sold to end-customers on the German market.
In the Shell group, the  cartel was called the paraffin  mafia', this illegal  cartel prospered from 1992 to
2005. It was also called Blauer Salon' (blue saloon) in the Sasol group, after a hotel bar in Germany
where the first meetings of the  cartel took place.

The fine will take fourth place among the highest financial sanctions inflicted by the  Commission against corporate cartels, after elevators (€992.3 million in 2007), vitamins (€790.5 million in 2001) and
switchgear (€750.5 million in 2007). Kroes toughened the rules in 2006 to sanction cartels more heavily, by taking better account of the duration of the  cartel and repeat offences.

HD         Financial: 'Paraffin  mafia' firms given pounds  500m fines for price-fixing

A fine of more than pounds 500m has been slapped on a group of leading energy companies including
ExxonMobil and npower's parent, RWE, after the whistle was blown on a  price-fixing cartel by Shell.

The penalty, one of the highest  cartel fines imposed by the European commission, resulted from secret meetings which began at a saloon bar in Germany. This led to the fixing of prices and markets for everyday products containing  paraffin wax such as chewing gum, tyres and candles.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the  European commissioner for competition, said the leader of the "paraffin  mafia" was South Africa's Sasol but it included other leading oil companies. "I hope the harsh lesson of these high fines will encourage the management of these companies to look very carefully at what their staff is doing," said Kroes. "And I hope that in turn the shareholders of these companies look very carefully at the management."
The European market for paraffin wax totals about  euros 500m (pounds 397m) a year and the  cartel
covered about three-quarters of that between 1992 and 2005, added Kroes.
The companies had shown a common resolve to rig the market when they started meeting in
Hamburg's Blauer Salon under the code-name "the Blue Saloon group".

Meetings followed all over  Europe as the cartel developed, but Shell began informing the  commission about the illegal practices after discovering the role being played by DEA, a subsidiary it acquired from RWE in 2002. A Shell spokeswoman in London said last night it had been "disappointed" to uncover
the market abuse while the  commission said the Anglo-Dutch group's cooperation had helped it avoid a potential  euros 96m fine.

The other companies involved can appeal, and Sasol said it intended to. "Sasol is surprised by, and does not understand, the reasons for the magnitude of this  fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to an appeal," it said. ExxonMobil was uncertain on its course of action but said in a statement it "deeply regrets its involvement, although limited, in the infringement of competition laws through the participation of a few of the company's former employees".
France's Total was  fined euros 128m and

ExxonMobileuros 83.5m. Others penalised were Repsol of Spain, Italy's Eni, Tudapetrol, Hansen & Rosenthal and RWE, all of Germany, and Moll in Hungary.

The German entrepreneur Hans-Otto Schumann is alleged to have been involved in the case relating to
an alleged paraffin wax cartel. According to EU authorities, a  cartel for market-sharing and price-fixing
was formed in 1992, before his  wax firm, Hans-Otto Schumann GmbH & Co, was acquired by the South
African oil and chemicals group Sasol. Even following the change of ownership in 2003, Mr Schumann is
reported to have remained active in business until 2005, the year in which the  price-fixing is said to have
ended.

TD
The Anglo-Dutch oil and gas group Shell is reported to have discovered the alleged  cartel in 2005, around three years after its acquisition of the German oil company DEA from energy group RWE. The EU Commission is reported to have demanded fines from 10 companies, including 318m  euros from Sasol as owner of the Schumann company and alleged cartel leader. The German company Hansen & Rosenthal, which is among the companies facing fines, plans to take legal action. Its management has denied having participated in a  cartel, claiming that the agreements related, not to higher, but to lower prices, with the aim of forcing small companies, such as Hansen & Rosenthal, from the market.

(ADP News) - Oct 2, 2008 - Hungarian oil and gas company MOL (BDP:MOL), along with eight other petrochemical companies, was  fined EUR 23.7 million (USD 33m) by the  European Commission (EC) for cartel activities between 1992 and 2005, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said Wednesday.

EC fined the cartel, having a 75% share of the European paraffin-wax market, with a total of EUR 676 million, which is the fourth biggest fine imposed by the EC. The cartel included 10 companies, but Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) was not fined, because it was the company to reveal the  cartel to the Commission. Apart from MOL other  fined companies are South Africa’s Sasol (JSE:SOL), France’s Total (PAR:FP), US-based Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Italy’s Eni (BIT:ENI), RWE of Germany (FRA:RWE), Germany’s Hansen & Rosenthal, Respol of Spain and Tudapetrol of Germany.

PETROCHEMICALS The European Commission fined nine petrochemicals companies a total of
€676m (£534m) yesterday for forming a "paraffin mafia" to fix prices and carve up markets for paraffin  
wax, although Shell escaped a €96m fine because it blew the whistle. "There is probably not a
household or company in Europe that has not bought products affected by this 'paraffin  mafia'  cartel,
with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage," the EU
Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said.  Paraffin waxes are used in products from candles to
paper cups and plates, the  wax coating of cheese, chemicals, tyres and chewing gum. Ms Kroes said the
cartel was known inside Shell as the "paraffin  mafia" and in Sasol as "Blauer Salon" (Blue Saloon) after
the hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany, where the first meetings of executives from the companies were
held. It was the fourth-highest  fine imposed by EU regulators on a sector. The firms  fined were Exxon
Mobil, Repsol, ENI, Tudapetrol, Hansen & Rosenthal, RWE, Total and MOL.

The European Union imposed one of its highest  cartel fines, accusing nine companies of fixing prices and markets for  paraffin wax, used in products like chewing gum, tires and candles.

Sasol Ltd., ExxonMobil Corp., Eni SpA, Hansen &Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, MOL Nyrt, Repsol SA, RWE AG and Total SA will have to pay a total of 676 million euros ($951.6 million). South Africa's Sasol was fined the most -- 318 million  euros -- said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.

TD
Royal Dutch Shell PLC blew the whistle and thus managed to avoid  fines.
Sasol said it intends to appeal the  fine.
ExxonMobil said it "deeply regrets its involvement" in the  cartel, which operated from 1992 to 2005.

HD        €676m fine for Paraffin Mafia

THE European Commission has imposed fines of €676million on a  Paraffin  Mafia that for years ensured every household in Europe paid too much for goods.

Leading companies, including Total, Exxon-Mobil, Resol, Sasol and Shell, were involved in an illegal paraffin wax scam, operating a price-fixing, market-rigging  cartel which ran for 13 years until 2005. Shell alone escaped fines under Commission leniency provisions because the company revealed the existence of the cartel and claimed immunity.

TD
EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes told a press conference in Brussels: There is probably not a household or company in Europe that has not bought products affected by this  Paraffin  Mafia cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage.

Such illegal cartel behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by the  Commission, and companies managers and shareholders should take note, added Ms Kroes.

The Commission investigation started with surprise inspections in April 2005, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Shell under the EUs 2002 Leniency Notice.

According to the  Commission, the cartel held meetings in top  European hotels to discuss and fix prices, allocate markets and customers, and to exchange sensitive commercial information.Paraffin      wax is used in candles, waxed paper, paper cups and plates, as well as in chemicals, tyres, car components and in the rubber, packaging, adhesive and chewing gum industries.

Synfuel giant assures local market
By ELLA SMOOK

TD
Staff Reporter

South African synfuel giant Sasol has given its assurance that the  price-fixing which led to its German operation receiving a mammoth  fine had not impacted on local consumers.

“This is a European matter, and is not impacting on any local product,” Sasol spokes-man Johann van Rheede told the Cape Argus yesterday, after it emerged that the  European Commission had imposed a e318.2 million  fine on the company.

Sasol had received the lion’s share of a total fine of e676m imposed on nine international groups for participating in a  paraffin wax cartel in the European Economic Area.

The company could also face further claims, as firms and individuals affected by its anti-competitive behaviour may seek damages in the courts of member states, while the finding by the  commission is binding proof that the illegal behaviour had occurred.

Shell, which had also participated in the  cartel, was not fined because it had been the whistleblower on the cartel.

Other companies who received  fines, all of them payable within three months, were Repsol (Spain), ExxonMobil (US), ENI (Italy), Tuda-petrol, Hansen&Rosenthal and RWE (Germany), MOL (Hungary) and Total (France).
In a statement released by Sasol in South Africa yesterday, the company said it had ex-pected the
commission’s finding.

“As anticipated in several previous announcements made by Sasol Limited, the  European Union found that members of the  European paraffin wax industry, including Sasol  Wax GmbH, had formed a
cartel and violated antitrust laws.”

Its co-operation with and support of the  commission’s in-vestigations had led to a reduction of 50% in the base amount of the  fine to e250m, Sasol and the  commission said.

However, Sasol added that it had been “surprised by” and did not understand the reasons for the magnitude of the  fine, and would be studying the reasons for the ruling with a view to lodge an appeal against it.

The commission said in its press release that it had taken into account the “respective affected sales of the companies involved, as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the

Page 106 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
cartel agreements” in determining the size of  fines and that Sasol’s  fine had been increased by 50%
because it had been the  cartel leader.
Asked whether it would be investigating Sasol locally in light of the  commission ruling, the
Competition  Commission of South Africa said Sasol’s dominant position in the country’s  paraffin wax
market meant there would not be a collusion case against it locally.

However, concerns had been raised with the  commission that Sasol might be abusing its dominant position by employing excessive pricing and exclusionary behaviour, the  commission added.

Following the  European Commission’s finding, Sasol said yesterday that the in-fringement of antitrust laws had begun “in 1992 or even earlier”, while it had became a co-shareholder in the implicated German wax business only in 1995.

It had acquired the remaining shares in the joint venture in 2002 to become the sole shareholder of the business.

“Sasol Limited was un-aware of these infringements before the  European Commission commenced their investigation at the  wax business in Hamburg in April 2005,” the statement explains.

Paraffin waxes, as distinct from liquid  paraffin  used in many South African households, are used in products such as candles,  wax paper, packaging, tyres and car components.

The EU’s competition regulator yesterday slapped a  fine of €318.2 million (R3.7 billion) on the European wax division of petrochemicals producer Sasol for leading a  price-fixing cartel dubbed the “paraffin  mafia”.

The penalty, payable in three months, is nearly 10 times the R381 million operating profit generated in the year to June by Sasol  Wax, the unit that houses the group’s Hamburg-based  European wax operations.

TD
Sasol said in response that it was “surprised and does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this fine”.
It would be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodging an appeal.

Sasol’s fine comprises nearly half of the total €676 million penalty imposed on nine  cartel participants. The others are:
n ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil multinational;
n Italian oil and gas group ENI;
n German groups Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol and RWE;
n Hungarian oil producer MOL;
n Spanish oil group Repsol; and n French oil major Total.

Europe’s biggest oil group, Shell, avoided a  fine because it had disclosed the  cartel.
South Africa’s competition  commission said yesterday that it had received complaints against Sasol’s
South African  wax division for excessive pricing and exclusionary practices.

“We are looking into it,” said commissioner Shan Ramburuth, adding that no formal investigation had yet been launched.

Because Sasol is the dominant producer of  wax in South Africa, competition issues revolve less around collusion than dominance.

The competition tribunal prohibited a merger between Sasol and  candle making group Prices Daelite several years ago, but this was subsequently overturned by the competition appeal court.

In Europe yesterday, competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement that the penalty against Sasol was increased by 50 percent because it had led the  cartel.
Page 108 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, because Sasol was among four companies that had co-operated with the  commission in terms of its leniency programme, the company was also granted a reduction of 50 percent.

Kroes said: “In setting the  fines, the commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the cartel agreements.”

Sasol was cited for fixing prices in markets for paraffin  wax (which is used to make candles, the wax coating on cheese and chewing gum) and slack wax, the raw material used to manufacture paraffin wax. It was also found to have allocated markets and customers for  paraffin waxes.

The commission said that the  cartel members had held regular meetings to discuss prices, allocate markets and customers, and exchange sensitive commercial information from 1992 to 2005.

The cartel was referred to as both the paraffin  mafia and Blauer Salon (Blue Saloon), after a hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the cartel took place. Subsequent meetings took place in top European hotels, in cities ranging from Milan to Vienna.
Sasol said in a statement that it had become a co-investor in an existing  wax business owned by the
Schumann group in 1995, and then became the sole shareholder in the business seven years later.
It was “unaware” of the infringements before the  European Commission began its investigation in
2005.

“Sasol views this matter in a serious light, and has intensified its competition and antitrust law compliance programmes in all its businesses, including joint ventures,” said the group.

Sasol was listed last week on the Dow Jones sustainability index, whose criteria include corporate governance.
On the JSE, Sasol shed 5.1 percent to close at R332.

LP
Johannesburg, Oct 03, 2008 (Business Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- SASOL's costly experience with the  European competition authorities illustrates yet again just how high are the risks for SA companies going into joint ventures abroad.
The European Commission has fined Sasol EUR 318m for its participation in a nine-member  cartel
that fixed prices and parcelled out markets in  Europe's paraffin wax industry from 1992 to 2005.

TD
Sasol's share is almost half of the total of EUR 676m in fines to be paid by the nine, which include oil majors such as Total, Exxon Mobil and Shell. The commission upped Sasol's  fine 50% on the grounds that it was the  cartel leader but then cut it 50% because Sasol was the second company (after Shell) to come forward to blow the whistle on the  cartel. That enabled it to take advantage of the corporate leniency policy under which whistle-blowers gain immunity from prosecution.

Even so, Sasol's fine was horribly high, especially given that the turnover of its entire  wax business (in SA and in Europe) in the latest year was less than R1bn. The experience must be all the more bitter because Sasol gained full control of the Hamburg-based  wax business only in 2002, after it bought out its joint venture partner in the business, Schumann  Wax. The joint venture dated back to 1995, not long after the cartel began. But cartels are secretive by their very nature, not to mention illegal, so it was not likely the executives involved were going to tell all to their new shareholder. And joint ventures are anyway only a partial form of control.

Either way, Sasol clearly didn't know what was going on; when it found out in 2005, it immediately offered to co-operate with the  European commission. But too late, it seems, to avoid a steep  fine.
It probably is a lesson for all South African companies about the risks of offshore ventures, especially
joint ventures. The  wax case is also a reminder, yet again, of the efficacy of corporate leniency policies in
catching cartels. SA's Competition  Commission has also made good use of these. Nothing should be
done to undermine the effectiveness of these policies.

HD       Holding  on to Our Sasol Shares [column] BY       by Ben Temkin

Johannesburg, Oct 03, 2008 (Business Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE news on Wednesday of the huge  fine imposed on Sasol by the  European Commission more than soured Jean's and my day. It is an unpleasant feeling to know that some managers in the group were involved in a cartel.

Tiger Brands was one of the first investments we made for the Private Investor portfolio. When we learnt that some of its managers had been involved in fixing the price of bread, we did not immediately sell the shares. It later became clear, however, that the company's economic crime was not an isolated one. It also seemed that senior executives -- by not acting against the illicit practices -- had tacitly approved them.

TD
Our loss of confidence in Tiger Brands' management, rather than the exposure of the economic crimes, was the main reason for selling the shares. The exodus of CEO Nick Dennis and several other senior managers left a void. Their successors could be better or worse managers but we did not want to ride along while we found out.

Our past experience told Jean and I that a change in a company's leadership was often a poor investment fundamental.

I don't need to reiterate the history of the  paraffin wax cartel to confirm that Sasol's senior management inherited the damage and did their best to limit it. We will stick to CE Pat Davies and his team and hold our Sasol shares.

Of course, Sasol's earnings growth will be affected by the amount of the  fine, or -- what seems to be a faint hope -- a smaller amount. I suspect that the market has already more than discounted the effect of this in the share price.

In due course I plan to return to my review of Sanlam. However, before I do this, as I also received yesterday the monthly broker's statement on the Private Investor portfolio, it is timely to report on the portfolio's progress.

Last month, the portfolio received two dividends, a handsome one of R278,80 from Grindrod and a less handsome one of R74,73 from Anglo American. After administration charges and interest, the portfolio now holds cash of R2148,10. This cash amount is still far below the ideal critical mass for reinvestment.

The portfolio's index at the end of the month was 90,86, a paper loss of 9,14% since we seeded the portfolio with R100000 of our own money on August 21 last year.

Against most of the standard investment benchmarks, this is fair performance, but, as you know, we don't use benchmarks -- we assess the portfolio on the intrinsic investment fundamentals of the constituent counters.

We accept, though, that overall market sentiment apart, the share price weakness of one or more the counters may be telling us there is an investment fundamental about which we know little or nothing.


Page 111 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It is disappointing that only three counters, Murray & Roberts, NewGold and Sasol, have shown paper gains. The remainder have paper losses varying from Hudaco's 2,13% to Bell's 49,5%.

On the investment fundamentals I know about, all the investments with paper losses to date look under-priced. Try as I want to I cannot, however, be either a disinterested or entirely objective commentator on shares I own.

HD      Sasol to pay EU's 'paraffin mafia' fine but plans to appeal

South African petrochemical giant Sasol said Friday it would pay a 318-million-euro fine for its role in a
paraffin wax cartel but planned to appeal the  European Commission's judgment.
Sasol was handed the biggest fine of a total 676 million  euros (936 million dollars) levied by the
commission Wednesday against paraffin  wax producers including Exxonmobil and Total.

TD
"We will provide for the full amount of the  fine," chief executive Pat Davies told a media briefing. "The provisions will be immediately put in place for the current financial year."

Davies said the money would be raised from Sasol's internal treasury and the  fine should not hamper future growth due the company's strong balance sheet and cash flow.

"Fortunately Sasol is a successful company," he said. "Given our financial strength, we don't see this impacting on our future growth plans."

While Sasol admitted there was a  cartel, Davies said the company currently intended to appeal the findings but was waiting for the detailed reasoning from the  commission.
Davies said the company did not agree with the  commission's labelling it as the leader of the  cartel
which has been dubbed the "paraffin  mafia."

"We have a difference of opinion there," he said, adding that it was the biggest producer of the group of companies.
The European Commission found that members of  Europes's paraffin wax industry, including Sasol
Wax, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws.
The fine of 318.2  euros imposed on Sasol Wax is payable within three months.

Shell escaped a fine under the whistle-blower rule, which applies to companies that help EU competition authorities to uncover a  cartel.
The fine for Sasol was increased by 50 percent "because it was the leader of the  cartel," the
commission said.

US giant ExxonMobil received an 83.5-million-euro fine with smaller penalties going to fellow  cartel members Repsol of Spain, Italy's ENI, Tudapetrol, Hansen and Rosenthaland and RWE of Germany, French Total and MOL of Hungary.

HD      Sasol to pay EU's 'paraffin mafia' fine but plans to appeal

South African petrochemical giant Sasol said Friday it would pay a 318-million-euro fine from the
European Commission for its role in a  paraffin wax cartel but plans to appeal the penalty.
Sasol was handed the biggest fine of a total 676 million  euros (936 million dollars) levied by the
commission Wednesday against paraffin  wax producers including Exxonmobil and Total.

TD
"We will provide for the full amount of the  fine," chief executive Pat Davies told a media briefing. "The provisions will be immediately put in place for the current financial year."

Grounds to appeal would be decided once the company receives the  commission's detailed reasonings, Davies said.
"We admit that there was a  cartel and we admit that some of our employees were involved in part of the
cartel. So obviously we cannot appeal against that," he said.

"Clearly the magnitude of the fine is one of things that we want to understand. If we find that we have no grounds of appeal to take on the fine, then we won't appeal. As we see things now, we intend to appeal."

Davies said the money would be raised from Sasol's internal treasury and the  fine should not hamper future growth due the company's strong balance sheet and cash flow.

"Fortunately Sasol is a successful company," he said. "Given our financial strength, we don't see this impacting on our future growth plans."
Davies said the company did not agree with the  commission's labelling it as the leader of the  cartel
which has been dubbed the "paraffin  mafia."

"We have a difference of opinion there," he said, adding that it was the biggest producer of the group of companies.

The European Commission found that members of  Europes's paraffin wax industry, including Sasol, formed a cartel and violated antitrust laws.
The fine of 318.2 million  euros is payable within three months.

"We regret that this has occured in one of Sasol's subsidiaries and ... failed to identify this anti-competitive behaviour," Davies said.

Shell escaped a fine under the whistle-blower rule, which applies to companies that help EU competition authorities to uncover a  cartel.
The fine for Sasol was increased by 50 percent "because it was the leader of the  cartel," the
commission said.

US giant ExxonMobil received an 83.5-million-euro fine with smaller penalties going to fellow  cartel members Repsol of Spain, Italy's ENI, Tudapetrol, Hansen and Rosenthaland and RWE of Germany, French Total and MOL of Hungary.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Oct. 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- This week, the  European Union found that members of the  European paraffin wax industry, including Sasol  Wax GmbH, formed a  cartel and violated competition law.

"We regret that this has occurred in one of Sasol's subsidiaries and that our due diligence and compliance programmes failed to identify this anti-competitive behaviour, when we acquired the business 13 years
ago and thereafter," said Sasol chief executive, Pat Davies.

TD
"Sasol is a successful business that is built on a foundation of over 30,000 committed and responsible employees. The past actions of but a few former employees has resulted in serious damage to our company's reputation and that affects each one of us," he said.

Sasol's management, including the Sasol directors of the Schumann-Sasol joint venture, was totally unaware of these activities. When we became aware of them in 2005, they were immediately stopped and Sasol promptly began cooperating with the  European Commission's (EC) investigation.

These cartel activities were clearly reprehensible and constituted a flagrant breach of Sasol's policies and values. By their very nature, these activities are secretive and very difficult to detect.

While a fine was expected, we didn't anticipate the magnitude of the  fine, particularly in the light of, amongst other factors, not being the legacy owner. We do not yet have the detailed reasoning from the EC and will study it, as soon as it is supplied, to clarify our next steps. As we see things now, it is our intention to appeal.

Sasol wishes to assure our shareholders and the broader public of the serious light in which matters of this nature are viewed.

We have rigorous compliance programmes relating to competition law. Clearly this is an area in which we must continuously improve as our business becomes more complex and competition laws around the world become more stringent. We have recently further intensified our compliance programmes with a particular focus on high risk areas such as joint ventures.

"We are on a journey of transforming the organisation and our values are central to this journey. These values define the manner in which we choose to conduct our business. The activities that led to this  fine are completely counter to the way we are transforming this organisation.

We wish to assure our employees, shareholders and our customers that there is no place at Sasol for illegal activities and we will vigorously root out any impropriety," Davies said.

Sasol on Friday accepted accountability for the anti-competitive behaviour that led to an approximately R3 billion fine for paraffin wax price fixing  in Europe, but it intended to appeal.

"I need to make it very clear that we don't distance ourself from accountability on this," said Sasol chief executive officer Pat Davies.

TD
However, the company would like to get details on how the European Commission (EC) concluded the matter to establish whether it was indeed a leader in the nine company cartel as alleged, and to see whether the size of the  fine was appropriate.

Davies said that as soon as the company was told of an investigation into cartels in April 2005, it immediately stopped it.

He said the company has over 30,000 employees and those implicated amounted to just a few individuals.
They had clearly breached company policy and values when they did this, he said.
They had co-operated with the  commission and were surprised by the magnitude of the  fine.

In terms of EC rules, they will pay the  fine over the next three months, probably through a combination of cash and borrowing.
"As we see things now it is our intention to appeal," he said.

The company had intensified its compliance monitoring and said that: "this is something that has happened in the past".

Sasol will pay the R3 billion  fine imposed on it by the  European Commission for price-fixing by its
German paraffin wax subsidiary, but also plans to appeal, chief executive Pat Davies said on Friday.
"We have to pay first and appeal later. This is the rule," Davies said in Johannesburg.

TD
Although the company expected the  fine after being informed of an investigation in 2005 into the activities of Sasol  Wax in Germany and those of nine other global companies dating back to 1992, it did not anticipate the magnitude of the  fine, said Davies.

It had co-operated with the  commission and immediately stopped cartel activities and was surprised by the Euro 318 million fine -- the fourth largest the EC's competition commission has imposed.

He said that although the company accepted that some staffers were involved in  cartel activities, it questioned the labelling of Sasol as the  cartel leader.
"I was not aware that they thought we were the leaders of the  cartel," he said.

Sasol hoped to get more details on how the  commission came to this conclusion when the final report was received.

It had not made provision for the  fine when told it was being investigated, because it had not known how much the eventual  fine would be.

The company would now probably provide for the  fine from the its internal treasury. Speaking on the sidelines of the briefing, Davies said Sasol might also borrow some money.

He said the company did not distance itself from accountability, but was not aware of this activity when it bought into the "legacy" company Schumann in the late 1990s and finally became its sole owner with a rebranding in 2002.
"I need to make it very clear that we don't distance ourselves from accountability on this," he said. Participating in the  cartel had been a "flagrant breach" of company policy and values and was profoundly
regretted, but its secretive nature had made it difficult to detect.
"We certainly would not have acquired this business had we know what was going on inside it," he said. Davies said that as soon as the company was told of the investigation by the  commission, it immediately
stopped the  cartel and issued a notice on the Stock Exchange News Service to inform shareholders.

The company has over 30,000 employees. It was only a few individuals who had damaged the reputation of the company and they had since "moved on".

"They are honest people, they are hard working people.... it's a handful of people that were involved in this," he said

The company had intensified its compliance programmes and would focus on high risk areas like joint ventures.

The other companies involved were: Shell, which was not  fined because it reported the activities to the competition authorities, Total, Exxon Mobil, RWE, ENI, Hansen and Rosenthal, Repsol and Tudapetrol.

JOHANNESBURG (I-Net Bridge)--Sasol Ltd. (SSL), the world's largest producer of motor fuels from coal, Friday said it will immediately make provisions for a EUR318.3 million (3.8 billion rand)  fine imposed by the European Commission.

Europe's antitrust watchdog this week  fined the Johannesburg-based company for its part in a
paraffin  wax cartel and violating antitrust laws.

TD
"We were unable to provide for it financially because we did not know the extent of the  fine," Chief Executive Pat Davies said, adding the company "certainly did not anticipate the magnitude of the fine".
Davies said the money will come from Sasol's internal treasury.

"We are fortunate to be a strong cash flow generator and have a strong balance sheet," he said, adding the fine will impact the operating profit line but isn't expected to have any impact on the company's expansion plans.

HD         How to survive  financial woes: drink and recycle

LP
The following is the salutary story, doing the rounds in the UK, of how best to survive in the current tough environment.

The “advice” says that if a year ago you had purchased a stake worth £1 000 (R15 000 at yesterday’s exchange rate) in Northern Rock, the UK bank taken under state ownership in February, it would now be worth £4.95.

TD
If you had invested in HBOS, Britain’s biggest home loan lender, which the UK government arranged to be taken over by rival Lloyds TSB to avoid a collapse, then earlier this week your £1 000 would have been worth £16.50. And your £1 000 invested in XL Leisure, the British tour operator that collapsed last month, would now be worth less than £5.

But if you bought £1 000 worth of Tennents Lager one year ago, drank it all, then took the empty cans to an aluminium recycling plant, you would get £214.
“So, based on the above statistics the best current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle,”
the advice concludes.

For those passionate about the environment and sustainable investment, it’s encouraging to see that the best investment advice these days has an environmentally friendly dimension to it. This investment suggestion also gives a different perspective on what constitutes rubbish.
Who’s fooling whom?

“We didn’t know.” This appears to be Sasol’s moral defence after one of its European subsidiaries was outed this week as the ringleader of a  price-fixing cartel in markets for paraffin  waxes.
At first glance a e318 million (R3.7 billion)  fine, which ranks at the top end of those yet imposed by the
EU’s antitrust watchdog, appears to be harsh punishment for the petrochemicals producer.

After all, Sasol says, it bought a stake in the German  wax business three years after the first meeting of the cartel took place in the Blauer Salon (Blue Saloon) hotel bar in Germany in 1992. And it took control of the business a decade after that first meeting.

Pleading ignorance certainly won’t let Sasol off the hook from paying the  fine imposed by the European Commission’s competition regulator, which, like South African competition authorities, has been cracking the whip on cartels in recent years.
Perhaps this line of defence is meant to restore confidence in Sasol’s corporate governance culture.

But there, too, it falls short. Just ask the Tiger Brands board, which is attempting to rebuild a semblance of corporate integrity after claiming to be unaware about price rigging at two subsidiaries, for which it incurred large penalties from the South African competition  commission.

Page 124 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the Tiger  fines take on the dimensions of Mickey Mouse compared with the jumbo-sized Sasol penalty.

The fact that the local watchdog has received several complaints against Sasol for alleged abuse of dominance at home does its image no good either.
While the  European case has given Sasol a profile as a “Mafioso”, local matters paint a
not-altogether-different picture of a bully – a case of “David versus Goliath”, in the words of one South
African complainant, Profert, a small fertiliser business.
It claimed that Sasol gave discriminatory price discounts to a competitor and refused to supply Profert. Sasol has also been accused of charging excessive ammonia prices by fertiliser producer Nutri-Flo, and
giving a competitor price and supply preferences.

There have been complaints about the group’s local  wax unit charging excessive prices and conducting exclusionary practices.

And of course, there is the case in which Nationwide Poles complained about Sasol charging its rivals lower prices for creosote. It won the case but subsequently had to close shop when Sasol won an appeal.
Government covers its bets

It is interesting and ironic that the government is doing some introspection on its performance regarding the gambling industry.
It is interesting because it is unusual for the government to be proactive and question its own decisions;
this is a responsibility that opposition parties have assumed.
The government wants to investigate if it has allowed too much gambling in the 12 years that it has
been legalised. This may not be answered; it depends on whether the proposal to set up a  commission
to investigate this will receive a green light.

In South Africa there have always been two extreme views on gambling. One sees it as a social evil that should be banned; the other supports it as a harmless form of entertainment. The government has tried to find common ground to accommodate both views. It constantly talks about the damage done by gambling, such as addiction. At the same time it praises the industry for its contribution to job creation, taxes and tourism.

In April, Rob Davies, the deputy minister of trade and industry, said a study commissioned by the National Gambling Board of SA in 2003 ranked the country 14th out of 50 nations based on gross gambling turnover. South Africa ranked higher than the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and Singapore.

The irony in the government’s position is that before the industry was legalised, another  commission, headed by Nic Wiehahn, was established. That  commission found that if gambling was not permitted,
it would lead to an underground sector that would leave betters at the mercy of unscrupulous operators.

The government denies that it wants to review the Wiehahn recommendations, but it does want to assess if any activities should be curtailed.

While introspection is welcome, any decision that could lead to job losses in a country that is battling to win the war on unemployment must be approached carefully.

Some of Europe’s largest companies - including fuel majors - have been  fined heavily for participating in a paraffin  wax cartel, raising the cost of this key input for tyre and car component manufacturers.

Sasol, Total, ExxonMobil and six others were penalised a total of EUR676m for participating in what has been branded the 'paraffin wax mafia'.

TD
Members, the European Commission (EC) concluded, exchanged sensitive commercial information, fixing European Union (EU) paraffin  wax prices between 1992 and 2005, with executives meeting in luxury hotels across Europe in cities such as Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich and Strasbourg.
"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this
'paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic
damage," said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, announcing the  fines.

She valued the EU  paraffin wax market at EUR500m a year; it is also a key input of most rubber goods, adhesives and chemicals also used by the auto industry.

The companies involved - and their  fines - were: Sasol (Germany) - EUR318m; Total (France) - EUR128m; ExxonMobil - EUR83m; RWE (Germany) - EUR37m; ENI (Italy) - EUR29m; Hansen & Rosenthal (Germany) - EUR24m; MOL (Hungary) - EUR23m; Repsol (Spain) - EUR19m; and Tudapetrol (Germany) – EUR12m.

Shell was also involved in the  cartel, but its EUR96m  fine was cancelled by the  commission because it tipped off anti-trust officials about the  cartel, leading to a series of raids on company premises in 2005.

As well as price fixing,  ExxonMobil, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, Shell and Total also agreed market allocations for the product, while ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, RWE and Total also fixed prices for slack  wax (paraffin   wax’s raw material) to end users in Germany.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 3. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE - Hungary recorded a foreign trade deficit of EUR 365.1 mln in July 2008, up from the preliminary EUR 239 mln and widening from the EUR 115 mln deficit recorded in July 2007, according to final and detailed figures published by the Central Statistical Office (KSH) on Friday.

The July deficit came after Hungary noted a surplus for five consecutive months, which also reduced the year-to-date surplus to EUR 100.9 mln, which compares to the EUR 280.7 mln deficit noted in
January-July last year

TD
Hungary's exports reached EUR 6.11 bln in July, rising 4% year-on-year (y/y), while import volume was up 8% y/y to EUR 6.48 bln. In the first seven months of 2008, exports increased by 10% y/y, while imports were up 11% y/y to a respective EUR 43.84 bln and EUR 43.74 bln.
KSH figures indicate that Hungary's exports in the first seven months increased at above-average rates
of more than 30% y/y to Asian and non-EU  European countries. By contrast, EU-bound exports were up
just 9.7% y/y, including 5.9% y/y growth in exports to the original 15 member states.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL EUROPE – Hungary's top oil and gas company MOL has received a EUR 23 mln fine from the European Commission (EC), as part of a  cartel investigation involving the EU's paraffin  wax market that led to fines totaling EUR 676 mln.

"The cartel covered about 75% of the European market in paraffin wax, lasted for 13 years, and included 10 companies," Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition Policy announced in Brussels Wednesday. "The companies have been  fined a total of EUR 676 mln, the fourth largest  fine ever imposed by the EC in a  cartel case, [reflecting] both the long duration of the  cartel and the size of the market concerned – nearly EUR 500 mln a year."

Kroes said the  paraffin  mafia cartel ran from 1992 to 2005. In the beginning, the  cartel met at the Blauer Salon, a hotel bar in Hamburg, Germany.  Cartel meetings subsequently took place at a series of top hotels all over Europe – Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, Munich, Strasbourg and others, according to the Commissioner.
German-South African manufacturer Sasol was the leader of the  cartel, and was rewarded with a EUR
318 mln fine. France's Total received a EUR 128 mln fine, while U.S.-based Exxon Mobil will have to pay
a EUR 83 mln penalty. Other companies involved in the cartel – including MOL – were awarded  fines
between EUR 12–37 mln each.
U.K.-based oil major Shell, which blew the whistle on the  cartel, has escaped what would have been a
EUR 96 mln fine, Kroes added.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide range of products – tyres, car components,  waxed paper, paper cups and plates, packaging, adhesive, candles, chewing gum, and the  wax coating on cheese, among others.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 30. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungary's current account deficit was EUR 1.84 bln in the second quarter of 2008, narrowing from EUR 1.97 bln in Q2 2007, but exceeding analyst expectations, figures released Tuesday by Hungary's central bank MNB indicate.

Page 128 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the first half of the year, Hungary's current account deficit was EUR 3.49 bln, opening up slightly from
EUR 3.41 bln in the same period of 2007.

In a year-on-year comparison, Hungary's second-quarter trade balance in goods and services improved by EUR 160 mln to a EUR 588 mln surplus. This was slightly offset by a EUR 28 mln increase in Hungary's income and transfer deficit to EUR 2.04 bln, thanks to higher income outflow on debt, and an increase in miscellaneous transfers.

Hungary's "net financing requirement," which also takes into account transfers received from the EU, was EUR 1.72 bln in Q2, down from EUR 1.83 bln a year earlier and amounting to 4.4% of GDP, according to seasonally-adjusted figures.

Non-debt generating financing of the current account deficit reached a negative EUR 1.02 bln in Q2, led by a large outflow of portfolio investments, the MNB said. Non-debt generating financing inflow in the first half of the year was EUR 550 mln, compared to a large EUR 3.8 bln outflow in the same period last year.

MNB figures also reveal that Hungary's gross foreign debt was EUR 89.9 bln at the end of the quarter, up EUR 4.6 bln from the previous quarter, thanks mainly to an increase in private sector debt. Hungary's net foreign debt was EUR 48.3 bln at the end of Q2, rising EUR 1.0 bln from Q1 thanks to an identical increase in public sector debt.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungary's draft 2009 budget, officially submitted to Parliament on Monday, counts on a cash-flow deficit of HUF 975.9 bln, with total expenditures of HUF 18,064 bln and total revenues of HUF 17,088 bln, Finance Minister Janos Veres said Monday, according to state news agency MTI.
The planned 2009 cash-flow deficit comes to 3.4% of GDP, compared to this year's projected 3.8%. The
2009 deficit according to the EU's ESA methodology, used to determine compliance with  eurozone entry
criteria, is seen at 3.2% of GDP, down from this year's 4.0% target.

Compared to a primary deficit – the balance of the budget minus interest payments on state debt – of HUF 103 bln this year, Hungary's state budget calculates with a primary surplus of HUF 199 bln, or 0.7% of GDP in 2009, Veres said.

Following plenary and committee debates in Parliament, a final vote on Hungary's 2009 budget is expected on December 15.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – (adds quotes, detail) The Monetary Policy Council (MPC) of Hungary's Central Bank (MNB) decided at its Monday meeting to keep the base rate unchanged at 8.50%, meeting analyst expectations.

"In view of the significant increase in global uncertainty, as well as inflation risks that point in both directions, the Council decided to hold the base rate unchanged," MNB President Andras Simor told reporters, presenting the Council's statement.

The decision follows near-unanimous rate-hold decisions in each of the past three months, and analysts had widely expected the trend to continue in September, thanks to largely stable inflation developments and a strong currency.

"As in our previous meeting, we discussed two options, either keeping rates unchanged or a cut by 25 basis points, and an overwhelming majority voted in favor of holding rates," Simor said. "In the past month, inflation has developed in line with what we had anticipated in our [quarterly] inflation report in August."
Citing the Council's statement, Simor said that the U.S. financial crisis is having a mixed impact on the
Hungarian economy and its growth and inflation prospects.

Among others, stricter credit conditions and a slowdown in U.S. and  European growth could negatively impact growth in Hungary, while such a global slowdown could also help disinflation through lower energy, food and raw material prices. At the same time, global uncertainty could lower risk appetite and increase the risk premium on Hungarian assets, the statement added.

Simor added that despite the above effects, the financial crisis has had "no direct and significant impact" on Hungary's economy.

Commenting on local trends influencing inflation, the Council's statement notes that slow GDP growth has helped keep inflation in check. However, private-sector wage growth has been faster than what would be justified by productivity growth.

"Costs incurred by the real economy related to pushing down inflation could be eased if wage agreements were in line with the MNB's inflation target," the Council said.

Consumer price inflation in Hungary was 6.8% year on year (y/y) in the first eight months of this year, compared to the central bank's medium-term inflation target of 3%. Meanwhile, gross wages in Hungary were up 8.1% y/y in January–July, including 9.7% y/y in the private sector.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungary's average unemployment rate was 7.5% in the three-month period spanning June to August 2008, the same as in the May–July period but up 0.3 percentage points (pp) from the 7.2% unemployment rate in the same period one year ago, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) said Monday.

There were 317,200 unemployed people in Hungary during the period, up 12,600 on a year earlier and rising 1,500 compared to May–July. At the same time, the number of employed people fell by some
31,100 over the past year, to 3.914 million.

Hungary's labor-force participation rate, defined as the percentage of economically active individuals (whether employed or seeking work) within the 15–64 age group, fell by 0.3 percentage points on the year to 61.8%. Hungary's employment rate was 57.1% in this age group.

Hungary's unemployment rate harmonized in line with  Eurostat  methodology was 7.5% in July, the middle month of the three-month period, compared to 6.7% in the EU-15 and 6.6% across all 27 EU members, according to the KSH.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 2. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – The Hungarian government has introduced a new incentive package to small and medium-sized companies to assist them in finding loans, Hungarian Minister for National Development and Economy Gordon Bajnai said at a press conference on Thursday.

"Following consultations with professionals we can say that the U.S. financial crisis will not have direct influence on Hungary, as our country's economic and financial system is stable," Bajnai said, adding that the country's GDP growth will nevertheless be negatively influenced by the ailing export markets.
Bajnai added that loans will also be more difficult to obtain, therefore the government will support
Hungarian companies in providing grants and offering favorable loans.

The Hungarian government will increase the duration of its micro loan provided to small companies from five to 10 years, while the amount will also be raised from HUF 6 mln to HUF 10 mln, according to Bajnai.

In order to assure the liquidity of banks for financing SMEs, the government will also provide a EUR 50 bln package to financial institutions, Bajnai said.
Bajnai noted that this money will be provided from  European Union funds and the funds of state-owned
Hungarian Development Bank (MFB).

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 2. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – The Romanian shopping center market is expanding at a faster pace than retailers are capable of keeping up with, considering that more than 100 mall projects have been announced nationwide, according to Vicentiu Zorzolan, CEO of Romanian retailer AAV Group, Romanian news site businessstandard.ro reported on Thursday.

"Retailers cannot keep up with developers," Zorzolan was quoted as saying. "They move faster than retailers' possibilities to secure financing and to develop their business."

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungary's state asset manager MNV will announce a one-round public tender for the sale of properties belonging to a former military air base near southwest Hungary's Taszar, MNV announced Wednesday.

The Taszar facility served as a NATO base during the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s, but was closed down in 2005, and is currently without an airport license.

Earlier this year, MNV already fielded the opinion of potential investors, receiving 12 concept applications that have influenced the content of the upcoming tender. Among others, MNV said that potential applicants preferred the sale of the property, rather than a lease scheme, and saw possibilities to develop an intermodal logistics base, in addition to what would primarily be a cargo airport.

MNV said the offered purchase price will weigh 26% toward applicants' final score, with financial strength, guarantees and the quality of development concepts each weighing a further 17%, among others.
According to press reports, the government expects developments totaling HUF 30 bln at Taszar. BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungarian property developer Gestor and
Belgium's BPI have teamed up to build a EUR 45 mln mixed project in the ninth district of Hungarian
capital Budapest, to be completed by mid-2010, the companies announced on Wednesday.

The project will involve the renovation and expansion of an old factory and warehouse building, which in recent years served as an alternative cultural center under the name Tuzraktar. The new project, named The Gallery, will build a three-star business hotel with 105 rooms, retail space totaling 2,500 square meters (sqm), and 'A' class offices with net leasable area of 10,500 sqm.

"There is a large supply of new offices in Budapest [...] but so far this has been limited to the Southern Buda and Southern Pest areas of the city, and the Vaci Ut office corridor," Gestor CEO Andras Gero was quoted saying. "At the same time, there is a lack of quality projects along the road leading to the Ferihegy international airport [where The Gallery will be located]."

With 200 underground parking places and a pedestrian passage, total built-in space in The Gallery will reach 29,500 sqm.

Gestor, owned by private investor Peter Gero and his family, has ongoing projects worth a total HUF 20 bln in Hungary, mostly in the residential segment. The group, founded in 1990, is also active in facility management and property consulting.

BPI is part of Belgium's CFE group, a construction, real estate and infrastructure conglomerate active in the Benelux countries, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – The number of permits issued for residential construction in Romania increased by 11.2% year on year (y/y) to 41,290 in the first eight months of 2008, according to data released by the Romanian National Institute of Statistics (INS) on Wednesday.

Some 6,057 permits were handed out for construction of residential buildings in August alone, an 8.7% increase compared to August 2007 and up 3.7% compared to July 2008. Around 62% of the permits were granted to rural constructions, INS said.

The growth in construction permits was driven by the northwestern and northeastern Romanian regions, while the number of permits granted in half of the eight Romanian development regions dropped in the period.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE - Israeli property developer Globe Trade Center (GTC), listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, opened the first mall of its planned Romanian "Galleria" shopping center chain in the southeastern Romanian city of Buzau, and plans quick expansion of the chain in the country, GTC announced in a statement.
Page 132 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Galleria Buzau is the first mall developed by GTC in Romania, as a part of a chain of Galleria shopping centers in Central and Southeastern  Europe," GTC said in a statement.

The company said that it intends to develop retail centers in Romanian cities with over 75,000 inhabitants, with two further malls expected to be completed already this year in the Northeastern Romanian cities of Suceava and Piatra Neamt.

"The significant increase of purchasing power in Romania, as well as the low saturation of modern retail space, are considered by GTC's management the main reason for further expansion," the statement said.

GTC noted that it has already secured the plots for the first six locations where it plans to build malls under the Galleria brand, while "the acquisition process for the rest of the locations is to be finalized in due course."

The tenant mix of Galleria Buzau – the first modern shopping center in the city – consists of over 60 retailers, while the mall also includes a six-screen cinema, restaurants, a food court and more than 300 parking places. The mall, built on a 2.1-hectare plot, will have around 14,000 sqm of gross leasable area.

The company has been active in Romania since 1999, through developing projects in the residential, office and retail segments of the property market.

GTC is controlled by Israeli company Kardan, a major real estate developer in Central and Eastern Europe, with ongoing projects in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia and Croatia.
The company has developed around 600,000 square meters (sqm) of net space and now owns
completed commercial property with a net area of some 254,000 sqm. GTC also holds a portfolio of 2 mln
sqm of commercial and residential area at various stages of development.
BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Holcim Hungaria Zrt, the Hungarian unit of
Swiss cement maker Holcim, has received a construction permit for its planned EUR 300-mln new
cement factory in northern Hungary's Nyergesujfalu, the company announced in a statement.

"Securing the construction permit is a significant step for us," chairman-CEO Richard Skene was quoted saying. "We are convinced that remaining preparatory measures can be completed soon."

Holcim said earlier it will employ 280 workers in the Nyergesujfalu factory, once production starts in 2010. Of these, 228 will be transferred from Holcim's other factory in nearby Labatlan, which will be closed
down following the new factory's completion.

Before the launch of construction, Holcim still needs to finalize agreements with subcontractors, and take additional steps to prepare the site for building.

The new cement factory will have annual capacity of 1.77 mln tonnes. Preparations to build the factory began in 2005.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Romanian developer Romanian Retail Development (RRD) is planning to develop a 45,000 square-meter (sqm) shopping mall in the southeastern Romanian city of Tulcea, Romanian national daily Ziarul Financiar reported on Monday.

The company said that the details of the Tulcea Shopping Center project – such as the level of investment – will only be revealed when the construction is launched.

The development, which will be the first mall in the city of 90,000 residents and the first project of RRD, will include a hypermarket, a DIY store, an electronics shop, as well as leisure facilities.

RRD is a joint venture created by Romanian developer EMCT Romania and Switzerland-based property firm Redevco Europe in late 2007. The company announced at the time that it would invest a total of EUR 500 mln in Romania over five years.

In particular, RRD said the company will focus on developing retail projects of around 25,000-100,000 sqm in large Romanian cities.

EMCT is also involved in the development of the Sun Plaza project in the southern part of Romanian capital Bucharest and the Siret Plaza in the southeastern Romanian city of Galati, which require total investments of around EUR 210 mln.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – U.S.-backed Romanian property developer Mega Company is planning to postpone the opening of its EUR 80-mln Mega Designer Outlet center in Romanian capital Bucharest, Romanian national daily Ziarul Financiar reported on Wednesday.

The completion of the outlet center, built on a 17-hecatre plot, has been delayed due to logistics issues and also because future tenants asked the developer to postpone the opening until next spring, citing liquidity concerns.

The Mega Designer Outlet is being developed in two phases. The first phase involves around 17,000 square meters (sqm) of retail area, while the second phase will eventually expand the total leasable space to 38,000 sqm.
The daily noted that Mega's outlet center is the fourth retail project postponed until next year in Romania. BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 1. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungarian developer Biggeorge's-NV is
ready to launch construction of a HUF 20–25 bln airport near the Hungarian city of Szekesfehervar 60
kilometers west of the capital Budapest, in the first part of 2009, Robert Stalmayer, the director of the
project company, told Interfax.

"After a long procedure to get the permits, which took nearly four years, we now have all necessary authorizations to start the HUF 20–25 bln investment in the first part of 2009," Stalmayer said.

The development, to be named Alba Airport, will open for business at the start of the summer season in March 2010. The project company, Alba Airport Kft, is currently 50% owned by Biggeorge's-NV and 25% each by the local governments of Szekesfehervar and the neighboring town of Aba. However, Biggeorge's-NV's share will soon increase to 90% while the municipalities will own a total of 10%.

Stalmayer said the airport will be built on a 180-hectare plot on a run-down former military air base, owned by the local governments but leased to Alba Airport for a period of 60 years.

Stalmayer could not yet provide details of the financing plan of the project, but noted that Alba Airport expects to involve outside investors as well.

"We are in the process of finding other investors, such as property developers or professional investors, and although the credit crunch will surely impede this process, this project is good enough to attract other companies," Stalmayer noted.

The company sees Alba Airport as possibly the first genuine rival to Hungary's main international airport, Ferihegy near Budapest. While Ferihegy handles more than eight million passengers a year, most small regional airports in Hungary have rarely managed beyond a few tens of thousands of passengers a year.

"We expect to already have 150,000 passengers in 2010, while the capacity of the airport is eventually seen to be expanded to two million," Stalmayer said, noting that he expects to reach one million passengers by the fifth year of operation.

Stalmayer said that although the airport initially plans to serve low-cost airlines and charter flights, the facility will be able to accommodate traditional airlines as well.

Stalmayer noted that he is optimistic regarding the airport's growth potential because of its advantageous location, close to major tourist destinations Budapest, lake Balaton and lake Velencei, which are seen attracting a sizable influx of foreign tourists. Meanwhile, plans to create direct bus and train services to
the airport are aimed at maximizing the airport's domestic catchment area.

"The airport can be reached in a 90-minute drive by 3.5 million potential passengers, and this is essential in order to bring a discount airline base here," Stalmayer said.

He added that a low-cost airline base is expected to be opened at Alba Airport by the third or fourth year of operation.

In addition to creating new jobs locally, Alba Airport is also seen boosting the regional economy, by increasing tourist activity as well as bringing in industries that involve significant moves in personnel, such as the automotive and pharmaceutical industries.

Stalmayer noted that the company also plans to set up an industrial park on a 110-hectare plot near the airport, which is expected to attract additional passengers to the airport.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 30. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – U-K. developer Modus Properties received a zoning permit from local authorities for its EUR 450 mln shopping center project in the

Page 134 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Northwestern part of Romanian capital Bucharest, and expects to launch construction in the first third of
2009, Modus announced in a statement.

The first phase of the project dubbed Colosseum Center will build 56,000 square meters (sqm) of lettable area in a retail park, with 70% already pre-let ahead of the completion scheduled for early 2010. Modus Properties has already signed lease agreements with major anchors such as Carrefour, Leroy Merlin, Altex and Franco, the statement said.

The project, expected to be completed in 2012, will develop a total 169,000 sqm of retail, leisure and entertainment area, as well as 9,000 parking places. The complex will include a 12-screen cinema, a
20-lane bowling alley, as well as several restaurants and a food court.

The project, which the developer said is the largest retail project in Bucharest, will spend over EUR 30 mln on infrastructure improvements, such as a new bus and tram facility.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 30. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Israeli-owned developer Plaza Centers is planning to invest EUR 80 mln in a mixed-use property project in the central Romanian city of Targu Mures, the company announced in a statement.

"We will invest more than EUR 80 mln in the 12th largest city in Romania, in a city with 175,000 inhabitants who need top-quality areas to spend their spare time in," Luc Ronsmans, county manager of Plaza Centers Romania was quoted as saying. "Moreover, we will bring office buildings at international standards close to the retail area, for the important companies of the city."

The development, which is expected to be opened in the third quarter of 2010, will have a rentable area of 34,000 square meters (sqm), as well as 1,200 parking places.

The statement said that the project will be located one kilometer away from the city center on the main avenue of Targu Mures, on the site of the former Imatex factory.

Plaza Centers noted that the procedure to receive the zoning permit will start at the end of this year, while the architectural design of the buildings will be created by Israeli company Yashar Architects.
Ronsmans added that the company is planning to develop further malls throughout Romania.

"Our strategy is to invest in 15 of the cities with the highest business potential in Romania, developing a high-standard mall network," Ronsmans said.

Plaza Centers entered the Romanian market at the end of 2006, and so far has launched eight real estate projects, with investments estimated to come in at around EUR 2 bln in the next four years. The company has so far spent EUR 200 mln in Romania.

"The real estate market in Romania is growing mature, and we believe real estate development can still be a good business for a serious developer, Mordechay Zisser, president of  Europe Israel Group, the owner of Plaza Centers said."We have the experience and drive to do great projects in Romania and our strategy is to double our presence here in the near future."

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Major Hungarian real estate developers and the city of Budapest have set up a marketing cooperation to promote the region's property projects and real estate potential abroad, members of the agreement told reporters on Monday.

"The business region of Budapest and surrounding areas represent 4.5–5 million people, comparable to Warsaw and Bucharest," Gergely Gulyas Kovacs, managing director of developer DunaCity said. "Those regions are already presenting a united front abroad and that's what we want to do as well, otherwise we would be in a competitive disadvantage."

The association, branded Budapest Business Region, was formed by developers DunaCity, Talentis, BD Park, FHB Ingaltan, property fund  Europa Ingatlanbefektetesi Alap, marketing agency Aera, and the city
of Budapest. The new brand will appear at major international property fairs, such as Vienna, Cannes and
Munich, with the developers presenting their projects under one joint stall with the aim to boost chances
of securing financing.

"At these property fairs, we are going to represent projects totaling HUF 200 bln," Gulyas Kovacs said, adding that the association, which is open to new members, could spend up to HUF 150 mln on marketing at major foreign events.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Hungarian retail prices of gasoline will fall by HUF 2 per liter as of Wednesday this week, while retail diesel prices are to remain unchanged, despite increases in global prices last week, news portal portfolio.hu reported on Monday.
Page 135 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As a result, the average retail price of gasoline will drop to around HUF 297 per liter, its lowest since late April. Meanwhile, the average retail price of diesel will remain around 308.60 per liter, a level last seen in early March 2008.

The report noted that the cut in gasoline prices – which follows a massive HUF 8 per-liter reduction that took place last week – comes despite a 1.6% increase in international gasoline prices last week, as expressed in forint terms. Likewise, diesel prices are remaining unchanged despite a 4.6% rise in
HUF-calculated global diesel prices last week, according to portfolio.hu.

Hungary's top oil and gas company, MOL, which controls more than 80% of the Hungarian fuel wholesale market, changes prices on Wednesdays, if at all. Actual prices at the pump depend on the filling station's location, as well as the pricing policies of fuel chains or individual operators, with differences in per-liter prices often exceeding HUF 25.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 2. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Romanian liquid gas distributor Butan Gas expects to increase revenues in 2008 by some 47% on the year (y/y) to EUR 100 mln, Romanian news site businessstandard.ro reported on Thursday.

According to the CEO of the company, Florin Preda, the growth in revenues is due to the increased quantity of liquefied petroleum gas sold, as well as to higher prices.

The news site said that Butan Gas is planning to invest EUR 8 mln in the coming two years in building three wind-power turbines with a total capacity of 4.5 MW in the Western Carpathian Mountains of the country's Transylvania region.

Preda noted that this development will be a pilot project, and if it proves successful, Butan Gas will invest in wind power projects in other areas of the country as well.

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 3. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – The issue of building a new nuclear power block in Hungary is expected to be discussed by Parliament in the spring of 2009, Gyorgy Podolak, chairman of the Economy Committee of the Hungarian Parliament said on Friday, Hungarian state news agency MTI reported.
Podolak said that a new block could be built without state support, adding that the construction of 1,000
MW nuclear power capacity costs EUR 3.5 bln at current prices.

European Parliament member Edit Herczog noted that if the necessary steps are not made in time, the country will face competitive disadvantage.

According to Jozsef Kovacs, CEO of Hungary's sole nuclear power plant Paks, a new block could start operations 12 years after the political decision is made.
The Paks nuclear power plant, which generates about 40% of the country's electricity, has a capacity of
1,940 MW.

BUDAPEST. SEPTEMBER 30. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – State-owned Hungarian electricity holding MVM and Matrai Eromu, a power plant operator owned by Germany's RWE-EnBW consortium, signed an agreement on Tuesday setting up a joint venture to build a HUF 200-bln, 400-MW lignite-fired block on Matrai's existing power plant site near Northern Hungary's Visonta.

"The new power plant will reduce Hungary's energy dependence and will definitely lower the average price of locally produced electricity," MVM CEO Imre Martha told reporters. "Building more power plants like this is inevitable."

MVM will own 74.9% of the joint venture, while Matrai will own a 25.1% stake. According to the agreement, MVM will be responsible for the construction of the power plant and for organizing the sale of electricity produced. Meanwhile, Matrai – which owns large lignite mines nearby – will be responsible for operating the power plant and securing fuel supplies.

The new 400-MW lignite-fired block, to be built between 2010 and 2015, will replace two 100-MW blocks that came online in the 1960s, part of more than 900 MW of total capacity at the power plant.
Compared to the 26% efficiency ratio of the outgoing blocks, the new block will have efficiency of 42%.
As a result of this and other technological improvements, the CO2 emission of the new block is estimated
at 0.86 kilograms per kWh of electricity produced, as opposed to the 1.22 kg emitted by the existing
blocks as of 2005. When measured together with the remaining blocks, Matrai's CO2 emission will be
0.97 kg per kWh, a more than 20% reduction over 2005 figures.


Page 136 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Matrai Chairman Jozsef Valaska noted that the free distribution of CO2 emission quotas will end as of
2013, meaning that the company will have to buy quotas at auction, resulting in significantly higher quota
spending than that of more efficient gas-fired power plants. While this concern prompted Matrai to
suspend plans to build the new block as recently as January this year, the jump in gas prices has made
the company confident that the new block will be profitable.

"If we have to buy quotas after 2013, we will have to pay 30% more [than gas-fired power plants], but the price of lignite is only one-fourth that of natural gas," Valaska said.

The chairman added that while gas is almost exclusively imported, lignite (or brown coal) is mined locally, with reserves expected to last for at least another 120 years.

Valaska said the company also expects to eventually install equipment that could subtract CO2 from the power plant's exhaust, which would eliminate the need for quotas.

According to the company's calculations, the new block will help preserve Matrai's position as Hungary's second cheapest electricity source after the Paks nuclear power plant, a unit of MVM. The HUF 200-bln investment will be recovered in a period of about 25 years, Valaska added.

MVM CEO Martha said the project will be 20% financed from equity and 80% from a syndicated loan. Martha added that the ongoing global financial crisis is not expected to have a serious impact on the company's plans.

"By the time we actually get to take out these loans, the crisis will likely have calmed down," he said. "Besides, the energy sector is still among the most profitable for banks to finance."

BUDAPEST. OCTOBER 2. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE – Germany's Deutsche Bank AG is mulling the possibility of financing renewable energy projects in Romanian, Romanian news site businessstandard.ro reported on Thursday.

According to Alberto Pisanti, director of Deutsche Bank London, the bank is in the process of negotiating with three or four major wind and hydroelectric power project developers to finance their Romanian projects. Pisanti noted that Deutsche Bank is interested in wind projects with capacity ranging from 50 to
100 MW.
Pisanti said that although several green energy projects have recently been announced in Romania,
these projects could be delayed due to the international financial crisis. He added that local authorities do
not adequately encourage the production of energy from renewable sources either.

The news site noted that the German bank also plans to start energy trading in Romania,= once it receives all necessary permits.

WARSAW. SEPTEMBER 29. INTERFAX CENTRAL  EUROPE - Hungarian OTP Bank is mulling a debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange by the end of 2008, OTP Chairman and CEO Sandor Csanyi told reporters Monday.

"I hope that we may debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange by the end of this year," Csanyi said. "In this case it will be a dual listing with Hungary."

OTP plans to launch a road show in October to promote the bank to Polish investors, which currently constitute the bank's second largest investor group. It will not be issuing any new shares as part of the debut and has a 2009 target to join Warsaw's blue-chip index WIG20.

Polish media have speculated on the possibility of a merger between OTP and Poland's No. 2 bank in terms of assets, PKO BP. Csanyi admitted that the banks have negotiated some form of partnership but did not want to disclose details.

"I can't go into detail but there has been work and we looked for cooperation between the two banks but we never reached the idea of a merger," Csanyi said. "We are interested in certain cooperation with PKO BP but I can't give any details for the time being."

While OTP recognizes the need for caution during a turbulent time on financial markets, according to Csanyi, the bank has already survived the major crisis, which hit Russian and Asian markets in 1992, and expects to survive this one.

"There is no financial institution that is not worried about the financial market, but we can influence this situation [...]," Csanyi told Interfax. "The Warsaw Stock Exchange valuation given to institutions in Poland is higher than the same comparative basis given to Hungarian institutions and it is important to be listed on more liquid markets."

KYIV. Oct 3 (Interfax) - Naftogaz Ukrainy and Russia's gas monopolist Gazprom will in the next few
weeks sign long-term contracts on the delivery of natural gas to and its transit through Ukraine, Ukrainian
Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko told a news conference on Friday.

"We instructed economic agents – Naftogaz Ukrainy and Gazprom – to sign contracts on the delivery and transit of natural gas in the next few weeks with regard to an intergovernmental memorandum signed on Thursday," Tymoshenko said.
The contracts will be signed for at least ten years, the premier said.

Ukraine and Russia agreed on the gradual switch to  European pricing for gas and its transit services, she added.

Gas prices for Ukraine will grow together with the growth of tariffs for the transit of Russian gas through the country, Tymoshenko said.

The Ukrainian prime minister did not disclose the expected gas price for Ukraine in 2009, noting that it will become clearer after Gazprom agrees on the terms of buying gas from Central Asian producers.

YEREVAN. Oct 3 (Interfax) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov thinks that artificial NATO eastward expansion, which can be explained by the mindset of exploring new territories, is dangerous to Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

"The threat is in artificial NATO eastward expansion, which takes place as a part of the mindset of exploring new territories and which is not justified and does not correspond with any real threat," Lavrov told a news conference in Yerevan in the wake of talks with Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian.

Russia, however, sees no threat if NATO evolves in an alliance that counters real challenges and threats, the minister said.
Russia and Armenia see eye-to-eye on what kind of NATO they would like to cooperate with, he said. Russia does have interaction with NATO, he said. In particular, both Russia and Armenia are members of
the Euroatlantic Partnership Council, Lavrov said.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct 2 (Interfax) - External factors have caused "minimal" damage to
Russian-German relations, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday.

"Our premise is that such effects [of external factors] on our relations have at the end of the day done minimal damage to our relations. What explains this is not only the interdependence of our economies, their mutual influence, and public openness to dialogue," Medvedev said at Russian-German talks in St. Petersburg.

Such a cooperative attitude characterizes the position of those who "make ultimate decisions [and] shape international policy both in Moscow and in Berlin," Medvedev said.

There are points on which Russia and Germany are seriously divided, the president said. "But we try - and our German partners do the same - to understand each other, to work for our shared future. And by and large we succeed," he said.

Germany and Russia disagree on some issues of foreign and security policy and that this primarily applies to the recent conflict in Georgia, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.

However, she credited Russia and Germany with maintaining stable and direct contacts throughout the conflict.
Germany had contributed to the plan for the settlement of the Georgian conflict, she also said. Merkel expressed optimism about future German-Russian relations.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct 2 (Interfax) – Countries that do not participate in the Nord Stream gas pipeline project should not hinder its development, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday during the Russian-German top-level interstate consultations.

"We are hoping that countries that are not related to this project will not try to impact its development," Medvedev said.



Page 138 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The profit from this project is obvious. We believe it will be good for all of its participants. In any case, we are hoping for progress within the time that we have planned," he added.

The 1,200-km Nord Stream gas pipeline is supposed to link Russia's Baltic coast near Vyborg with Germany's Baltic coast near Greifswald. In the initial phase, Russia should supply 27.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Germany via the pipeline. Capacity is to be increased to 55 billion cubic meters per year after a second strand of the pipeline has been built.

Russian gas monopolist Gazprom owns 51% in the project, Germany's E.ON and BASF have 20% each, and the Dutch Gasunie owns 9%.

The Nord Stream project, circumventing Poland as a transit country for gas, has been criticized by most Polish political parties as too expensive compared to a land alternative. The Baltic States and Sweden opposed the Nord Stream project on ecological grounds.

Polish governments have in the past also expressed concern that with Nord Stream Russia may use gas supplies as a political weapon, reducing gas supplies to Central  Europe without affecting deliveries to Germany.

MOSCOW. Sept 30 (Interfax) - The Main Military Prosecutor's Office has granted the relatives of the Polish officers shot in Katyn in 1943 access to classified documents, including the decree to close the criminal case on the basis of the military men's killings. Access to the documents was granted under a court ruling.

On Tuesday, the Moscow District Military Court proposed to consider a complaint filed by the relatives of the Polish officers about the decision to stop the investigation into the officers' killings, the plaintiffs' lawyer Anna Stavitskaya told Interfax.

"In the past hearing, we requested access to the decree to stop the criminal case and the case materials about the people we represent. The court granted that request and the Main Military Prosecutor's Office provided the documents," she said.

"We have been asked to give our written undertaking not to disclose information constituting a state secret as the decree and some of the materials are classified information," she said.

Stavitskaya also said the court has adjourned until October 9 to enable the plaintiffs to become familiar with the case materials.
The case is being tried in the Moscow City Court without journalists present.

The Moscow Khamovnichesky District Court earlier refused to consider the complaint about the closure of the investigation into the so-called Katyn case. The Moscow City Court on July 7 let that ruling stand.

Commenting on the ruling issued by the Khamovnichesky District Court, Stavitskaya said the judge made that decision citing the presence of classified information in the case materials.
"The court did not consider our complaint on its merits," she said,

During the trial, the court received a message from the Prosecutor General's Office, which stated that the Katyn case materials constitute classified information as they contain information constituting a state secret. The Prosecutor General's Office said in its message that the materials can be provided to the Moscow District Military Court, where the complaint is to be tried.

Earlier, officials from the Main Military Prosecutor's Office also pointed out that the case materials contained classified information, saying the case could not be tried by a district court for that reason,
The decree to close the Katyn case was issued by the Main Military Prosecutor's office on September 21,
2004. The victims' relatives contested that ruling.

MOSCOW. Sept 30 (Interfax-AVN) - President Dmitry Medvedev has urged the heads of the Russian military to strengthen the strategic nuclear deterrence forces and to create an integrated system of
air-space defense.

"Concurrently with the army and navy's upgrade and efforts to make them more mobile, the strategic nuclear deterrence forces must be strengthened, a single air-space defense system must be created and Russia's status as a great naval power must be enhanced," Medvedev told officers just appointed to high command posts in the Grand Kremlin Palace on Tuesday.


Page 139 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Also, the armed forces' control bodies and "the state's entire military organization, must be perfected," Medvedev said.
Recent times have set new tasks before the country's law enforcement system, the president said.

"A swift identification of external threats to national security by the Russian foreign intelligence service acquires special importance," he said.
MOSCOW. Sept 29 (Interfax-AVN) - The proposed U.S. missile shield is apparently targeted against
Russia, former Russian General Staff Chief Yury Baluyevsky said.
"The anti-Russian potential of this system will increase, and no one should be tricked into thinking that
the missile shield is being created to control Iran and North Korea. Where is Eastern  Europe? And where
is Pyongyang, or Tehran?" Baluyevsky said in an interview, published by the Versia newspaper on
Monday.

If the United States had been indeed concerned about the Iranian missile-dangerous direction while deploying a radar installation in the Czech Republic, it would have chosen a different site, such as the Gabala radar in Azerbaijan, rented by Russia, he said.

"Would it not have been easier to accept our proposal and make use of the tracking facility already in place in Azerbaijan?" Baluyevsky asked in a rhetorical question.
Instead, the United States is "re-inventing the wheel," Baluyevsky said.

"We [Russia] are the issue here. [The U.S. missile shield] as well as control over the Russian armed forces, and - we cannot discard this, either - preparing a strike against our country. Let it be a supposition for now. Let it be something not talked too much about, but the U.S. does see our country as its potential enemy," Baluyevsky said.

In this context, Russia should observe a balance and "not spend more than it can afford on arms, but not try to economize on its security, either," he said.

TBILISI. Sept 29 (Interfax) - Georgian Ambassador to Russia Erosi Kitsmarishvili has announced that it is impossible for him to continue working for the administration of President Mikheil Saakashvili.

"I cannot work for the Saakashvili team because they failed to prevent a war with Russia," Kitsmarishvili said in a interview with the Georgian weekly Kviris Palitra on Monday. The ambassador was withdrawn from Moscow on July 11, 2008.
In his opinion, the Georgian administration could have avoided hostilities with Russia.

"If the Georgian administration had spent [on the prevention of war] at least one percent of funds assigned for military purposes, I can assure you that the result would have exceeded the widest expectations," Kitsmarishvili said.
Western leaders and diplomats kept warning Saakashvili against attempts to resolve the conflicts in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia by force, he said.

"One high-ranking Western diplomat wrote that each warning had an effect for only two weeks and then military rhetoric resumed," he said.

If late Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania had been alive, the events in Georgia would have taken a peaceful course, the diplomat said.

"The death of Zhvania was not natural; it was a murder. At the same time, I cannot say who benefited from Zhvania's death," Kitsmarishvili said.

Text of report by Hungarian privately-owned conservative newspaper Magyar Nemzet, on 2 October
[Unattributed report: "MOL Punished for Operating  Cartel"]

TD
The European Commission has imposed a total  fine of 676 million euros on nine oil companies, including MOL [Hungarian Oil and Gas] for operating a cartel. MOL responded by announcing that the company would be giving due consideration to the Commission's decision and would clarify its position in two months on whether it would appeal to the European court of first instance in Luxembourg. The Commission fined MOL 23.7 million  euros.

Paraffin wax is used in a wide variety of products such as candles,  waxed paper, tires, and car parts. The market is worth nearly 500 million  euros, according to the Hungarian MTI news agency. MOL released a statement, saying: MOL regrets that in the 1990s it was not possible for the company to have adequate internal control and auditing systems to screen such cases. It added that there had never
been a management decision to take part in any kind of  cartel.

Neelie Kroes, European commissioner for competition, announced yesterday that the companies in the cartel fixed prices for paraffin  wax and thus distorted competition. The highest  fine, 318 million euros, was imposed on the German-South African Sasol; the other companies, ENI, Exxon-Mobil, Hansen & Rosenthal, Tudapetrol, Repsol, RWE, and Total were  fined sums between 12 and 128 million euros. According to the  European Commission, those companies participated in a  cartel for paraffin  wax between 1992 and 2005 in violation of the Commission's treaty ban on cartels and restrictive business practices. Shell, which was also part of the cartel, blew the operation's cover and escaped  fines after supplying information on the  cartel's activities to the European Commission. Sasol's  fine was increased by 50 per cent because Sasol led the cartel. ENI's fine was increased by 60 per cent, as the company had taken part in similar cartels before.

Political ructions remained top of the news in South Africa this week as the war of words between the old and new leadership of the ANC fuelled speculation that a breakaway party would be formed. This week saw the resignation of Mbhazima Shilowa, the Gauteng premier, and Paul Mashitile is the ANC’s preferred candidate to replace him. Sasol was  fined R3 billion by the  European Commission for
price-fixing by its German  paraffin wax subsidiary. Tito Mboweni, the Reserve Bank governor, refused to apologise for an alleged racist jibe at a shareholder’s meeting, and the United States government finally approved a landmark, revised, $700 billion Wall Street bailout bill.

EC fines "paraffin  mafia" cartel €676m

The European Commission has fined nine petrochemical companies a total of €676m ($950m) for taking part in an industry-wide paraffin  wax trading cartel. Italy's ENI, US-based energy and chemical giant ExxonMobil, German oils firms Hansen & Rosenthal and Tudapetrol, Hungary's MOL, Spain's oil and gas firm Repsol, South Africa's Sasol, German power firm RWE, and French petrochemical giant Total were all found guilty of  price fixing  between 1992 and 2005. Sasol's  fine was increased by 50% for leading the cartel, while ENI was ordered to pay 60% more for previous activities in similar cartels. The Commission said that in the Shell group, the  cartel was called "paraffin  mafia," and in the Sasol group, "Blauer Salon" (blue saloon), after a hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the  cartel took
place.

wax Producers claim innocence

Paraffin wax producers said they were in the dark on the exact reasons why they have been  fined by the European Commission for price fixing,  with some considering court appeals. Germany's Hansen & Rosenthal, which was fined a total of €36m ($51m), said it would look to appeal and that it "continues to rule the fine as unjustified." South Africa-based Sasol, which received the largest fine of €318m, said it
was surprised by, and "does not understand the reasons for the magnitude of this fine and will be studying the reasons for the finding with a view to lodge an appeal against it."
Delaware court rules in favor of Huntsman

A Delaware, US, state court has ruled in favor of US-based chemical firm Huntsman by ordering a speedy completion of its merger with US-based rival Hexion Specialty Chemicals. "We are gratified that Apollo's [Hexion's parent company] allegations and tactics have failed to persuade the Chancery Court," said Peter Huntsman, president and CEO of Huntsman. "We are disappointed by the Court's decision. We are reviewing the decision and our options," Hexion said in a statement.
Huntsman sues banks

US-based chemical firm Huntsman is suing the two banks that are financing its $10.6bn (€7.3bn) merger with Hexion Specialty Chemicals. In the suit, Huntsman accused global bank Credit Suisse and Germany's Deutsche Bank of conspiring with Hexion's parent firm - Apollo Management - to interfere with the merger. Huntsman has received a temporary restraining order against the banks, which stops them from ending their commitments to finance the merger with Hexion.
AkzoNobel ups synergy

Netherlands-based specialties firm AkzoNobel is planning a raft of measures to achieve additional cost savings and improve performance. Leif Darner, AkzoNobel board member and head of performance coatings, said that part of the company's plans included accelerating efforts to integrate the UK-based ICI businesses acquired earlier this year as well as focusing on organic growth. In addition to the €340m ($490m) saved through the ICI integration, AkzoNobel will aim for additional net savings of €100m. The combined effect of this will be around 3,500 job losses by 2011.
Pressure groups attack BMS expansion

German pressure groups have challenged chemical company Bayer MaterialScience's plans for a €300m ($423m) upgrade of isocyanates production in Germany. The Coordination Against Bayer Dangers, and the German Friends of the Earth Affiliate, BUND, called on BMS not to proceed with the consolidation and expansion of production at Brunsbuttel and Dormagen/Uerdingen up to 2013. They are also protesting against the use of phosgene-based technology in the new projects.
SAFC doubles output at arklow unit
Changing attitudes among major pharmaceutical companies toward quality and cost issues have played a key role in doubling the output of US-based SAFC Pharma's manufacturing facility in Arklow, Ireland,
since its acquisition from US industrial supplies manufacturer Honeywell two years ago, said Mike Harris, vice president of sales and manufacturing at SAFC Pharma. "We are seeing with many of the compounds that Arklow are making a real resurgence in volume," he said at the CPhI '08 trade show in Frankfurt, Germany.
German industries unite against ETS

Germany's energy-intensive industrial producers warned of a €7.2bn ($10.1bn) cost burden by 2020 if the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) goes into law as is proposed. "If the  European          Commission's ETS proposal passes without changes, the deindustrialization of Germany will be inevitable," said Ulrich Lehner, president of Germany's Chemical Industry Association (VCI).
Brenntag buys Rhodia's Asian arm

German chemical distributor Brenntag has purchased Rhodia's Asia-Pacific specialty chemical distribution business. The deal gives Brenntag access to fast-growing distribution markets in Australia, India,
Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam, the company said at the  European Petrochemical Association (EPCA) meeting in Monaco. Rhodia's Asia-Pacific distribution network achieved total sales of $400m (€290m) in 2007.
Sumitomo halves h1 earnings estimate

Japan's Sumitomo Chemical has halved its forecast for consolidated net income for the first half of the year to yen (Y) 5bn ($47.5m) due to the worsening climate in the petrochemical and basic chemical segments. For the full year ending March 2009, Sumitomo expects net income to be Y15bn, down by
72.7% from the previously forecast Y55bn.
Holliday to get Palladium Medal

The award is in recognition of Holliday's contributions to the industry, and thereby to the enhancement of the international aims and objectives of the trade organization.

The near-collapse in  European bank and insurer Fortis could squeeze credit lines for petrochemical traders. Two sources from an international trading house said at EPCA that they had used Fortis for credit on a variety of projects and that they were not alone. "Fortis are lenders big time. Everyone has business with them," said one trader. Fortis's financial problems "are really slowing things down."
cefic aims for 100% plastics recycling

The EU, US and Japan should be recycling 100% of plastics waste by 2030,  European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) president Francois Cornelis said. The global production of plastics is set to double to 350m tonnes/year by 2030, and the issue of disposal should be placed high on the agenda, said Cornelis, also president of chemicals at French oil and chemical giant Total. "I can't understand how in  Europe we still put plastics into landfills. I think burning plastics instead of coal should be easy and we need to get to the solution much faster. Why can't we substitute 10% of the coal burned in power plants for plastics" he said.
Azelis preregisters

European distributor Azelis has revealed that it was one of two companies to have preregistered all

CORRECTION

In the ICIS Top 100 listing in September 15 issue of ICIS Chemical Business, we missed US-based Rockwood Holdings, which had $3.14bn (€2.26bn) in sales in 2007, and Russia-based  EuroChem, which also had about $3.14bn in sales in 2007. Our apologies for the oversights.

HD            Sasol’s BEE investors are learning  the hardest way

But life has many twist and turns, and a lot has happened over the few intervening weeks.

The crude oil price has fallen sharply, with the benchmark Brent blend dropping from about $115 a barrel at the start of September to about $94 on Friday. It could fall further, as the global economy slows and demand for oil subsides.

TD
So Sasol shareholders’ returns look less promising than they did a month ago.
But much worse is the news that Sasol’s  European wax division has been brought to book by the
European Commission for anti-competitive behaviour.

And, as part of what the commission described as the “paraffin  mafia” cartel, the multinational petrochemical company has been fined E318.2 million (R3.8 billion) – the fourth-largest  fine the commission has ever imposed.

The penalty, which is nearly 10 times Sasol  Wax’s R381 million operating profit in the year to June, must be paid over the next few months.
And Sasol, which has known about the investigation for some time, made no provision for the  fine
because, it said, it had not known how much it would be.
Now it will set aside R3.8 billion, which will make a serious dent in Sasol’s profit in the current
financial year. Sasol says it will pay the  fine but it plans to appeal against the  commission’s findings.

Meanwhile, the new shareholders are already deep in negative territory, with the share trading 2 percent lower at R305 on Friday. It later closed at R308.

As many of the BEE shareholders have been heavily funded by third parties – perhaps as many as 90 percent says one analyst – the fall in the share price and the reduced dividend streams will have further consequences.

The episode is an example of the booby traps life sets for the unwary. But even the wary could have fallen into this trap.
Only someone with a crystal ball could have foreseen the events that unfolded over this month. There is an inherent problem in trying to accumulate wealth and manage savings, particularly in the
current uncertain environment. Investing in equities puts capital at risk.

But investing in bonds or putting money in a bank exposes the capital to the risk of erosion by inflation. Moreover, after a certain threshold, investors have to pay tax on their interest rate returns.



Page 149 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The worst case scenario for bank savings is that the bank could collapse. This has become a common occurrence in the US, while the UK and  Europe have also seen banks fold this year.

No South African bank is at risk at the moment, but Saambou was forced into curatorship in 2002, when depositors withdrew about R1 billion over two days.

Perhaps the only lesson to be learnt from the episode is the obvious one: that high debt levels are dangerous because the unexpected often happens.

Many consumers and householders have learnt this lesson over the past few years, as debt service costs rose. And more will be exposed to the consequences of taking on too much debt, as falling asset prices create a negative equity trap.
In the current environment, cans of beans may be the best form of investment.

The alternative is to spend your surpluses on mood-altering substances and leave the world to take care of itself.

Paraffin  was makers expressed puzzlement over the decision by the  European Commission to fine them for price fixing,  with some considering appealing the ruling. German firm Hansen & Rosenthal, which was slapped a EUR 36 M  fine, is considering an appeal, while South Africa's Sasol, which was slapped the largest  fine of EUR 318 M, said it was surprised by the  fine and will review the ruling with the view of filing an appeal against it.

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling EUR 676 M on around 10 companies for participation in a price-fixing cartel for paraffin  wax and gatsch (raw material for paraffin  wax). A histogram gives fines imposed for 10 companies. Sasol received the heaviest fine at EUR 318.2 M followed by Total at EUR 128.2 M, ExxonMobil at EUR 83.6 M and RWE at EUR 37.4 M. Other companies fined were ENI (EUR 29.1 M), Hansen & Rosenthal (EUR 24 M), MOL (EUR 23.7 M), Repsol (EUR 19.8
M) and Tudapetrol (EUR 12 M). Shell had already been  fined EUR 96 M in previous litigation. The European Commission wiped its account clean for being the first to provide information. Sasol was found to have played the leading role in the  cartel but is to appeal.

EUROPEAN UNION -- The  European Commission has fined nine companies, including Exxon Mobil, Total and South Africa's Sasol, almost $1 billion for operating a  price-fixing "paraffin  mafia." The nine were found guilty of participating in a  paraffin wax cartel from 1992 to 2005 in the European Economic Area in violation of EU rules. A tenth company, Royal Dutch Shell, had its fine waived after its tip-off led to surprise raids by the commission in April 2005. The steepest, $445 million fine was levied on Sasol, which the commission identified as the ringleader, while Total was  fined $179 million and Exxon $117 million. Others fined included Germany's RWE, Italy's Eni, Hungary's Mol and Spain's Repsol YPF.

TD
Sasol's  fine would have been double had it not cooperated, while Eni's  fine was increased by 60%
because of its involvement in other cartels dating back to the 1980s.

The European Commission has imposed a total of more than $930 million in  fines on nine companies for participating in a  cartel for paraffin wax.

A 10th company—Royal Dutch Shell P.L.C.—participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, according to the  commission. Three other companies had their  fines reduced because they cooperated with the investigation.

TD
Paraffin waxes are used in a wide variety of products, including tires and car components as well as in the rubber, packaging, adhesives and chewing gum industries. The market is worth almost $700 million.
The companies and the amounts  fined were:

* Sasol Ltd. of South Africa and Germany, $440 million. It received the largest  fine, which was reduced 50 percent from its original total because of its cooperation.
* Repsol S.A. of Spain, $27.3 million. Its  fine was reduced by 25 percent for cooperation.
* ExxonMobil Corp. of the U.S., $115.4 million. It received a 7-percent reduction on its original  fine.
* Eni S.p.A. of Italy, $40.2 million.
* Tudapetrol of Germany, $16.6 million.
* Hansen & Rosenthal of Germany, $33.1 million.
* MOL Nyrt of Hungary, $32.7 million.
* RWE A.G. of Germany, $51.7 million.
* Total S.A. of France, $176.8 million.

The infringements committed by ExxonMobil, Sasol, Shell, RWE and Total also related to slack  wax sold to end-customers on the German market. Slack  wax is the raw material required for the manufacture of  paraffin waxes and is produced in refineries as a by-product in the manufacture of base oils from crude oil.

"There is probably not a household or company in  Europe that has not bought products affected by this `paraffin  mafia'  cartel, with all that implies in terms of paying over the odds, higher costs and economic damage," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Such illegal  cartel behavior cannot and will not be tolerated by the  commission, and companies' managers and shareholders should take note."

The EC probe started with surprise inspections in April 2005, prompted by an application from Shell for immunity under the 2002 Leniency Notice.

Page 156 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission said that from 1992 to 2005 the producers of  paraffin waxes and slack wax operated a cartel in which they fixed prices for  paraffin waxes. ExxonMobil, MOL, Repsol, Sasol, Shell and Total also engaged in market allocation for this product, the EC statement said.

The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, allocate markets and/or customers, and to exchange sensitive commercial information, according to the EC. The  commission said that within the Shell group, the  cartel was called "paraffin  mafia" and in the Sasol group, "Blauer Salon"—or blue saloon—after a hotel bar in Germany where the first meetings of the  cartel took place. Subsequent meetings took place at a series of hotels all over  Europe, including Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; Budapest, Hungary; Paris; Munich, Germany; and Strasbourg, France.
Oil supplier Hansen & Rosenthal said it intends to fight its  fine. It said companies within its group
were fined a total of nearly $50 million, but it hasn't received written substantiation for all of the  fines.
The company said that its board "sees grounds for substantial legal objections."

South Africa's Sasol plans to appeal the  European Commission's decision to  fine one of its subsidiaries and a group of refiners including ExxonMobil, Total and Eni a total of Eur676 million ($969.5 million) for operating a  paraffin wax price-fixing cartel, Sasol CEO Pat Davies said October
3.

"While a  fine was expected, we didn't anticipate the magnitude of the  fine, particularly in the light of, amongst other factors, not being the legacy owner," Davies said. "We do not yet have the detailed reasoning from the EC and will study it, as soon as it is supplied, to clarify our next steps. As we see things now, it is our intention to appeal."

The European Commission said October 1 that from 1992 to 2005 the producers of  paraffin wax
and its feedstock slack wax in the European Economic Area operated a "paraffin  mafia" in which they
fixed prices for paraffin  waxes (ON 10/2).

The EC gave Sasol a  fine of Eur318.2 million ($455.12 million), the largest for an individual company, because of its role as leader of the  cartel, the EC said.

"We regret that this has occurred in one of Sasol's subsidiaries and that our due diligence and compliance programs failed to identify this anti-competitive behavior, when we acquired the business
13 years ago and thereafter," Davies said.

He said Sasol's management, including the Sasol directors of the Schumann-Sasol joint venture, was totally unaware of these activities. "When we became aware of them in 2005, they were immediately stopped and Sasol promptly began cooperating with the  European Commission's investigation," he said.

These cartel activities were "clearly reprehensible" and constituted a flagrant breach of Sasol's policies and values, Davies added.

HD          Sasol ‘totally unaware’ of cartel

The European wax division of Sasol, bust last week by the  European Commission’s competition watchdog for leading a price rigging “paraffin  mafia”, ironically began making significant profit only after the  cartel was exposed.
“Our view is this was an ineffective  cartel,” Sasol chief executive Pat Davies said on his return to
South Africa on Friday from an investor road show in the US.

Davies immediately held a media briefing to deal with the fallout of the e381 million (R4.5 billion)
penalty slapped on the petrochemicals producer for its role in the  paraffin waxes cartel.
Other members included ExxonMobil, Shell and Total.

“This was a business that hardly made any money until a couple of years ago,” Davies said of the European wax unit. “Ironically, it started making significant money after 2005. This is a cyclical business so it’s had its moments, but generally it’s not been a particularly profitable business.”

Davies emphasised that while Sasol accepted responsibility for the actions of the unit, the company had been “totally unaware” of the  cartel’s activities until the  commission launched its investigation in April 2005.

He said the first meetings of the  cartel took place three years before Sasol took a stake in the division and a decade before the company bought full control of the unit.

Sasol had been taken by surprise by the magnitude of the  fine, particularly because it was not the original owner of the unit, he said.
“As we see things now, it is our intention to appeal.”

The company would await detailed reasoning from the commission before deciding the basis of the appeal, but one aspect was likely to be the size of the fine, he said.

Sasol’s penalty comprises nearly half of the total  fine imposed by the commission on the 10 cartel members. Although the  fine was reduced by 50 percent because Sasol co-operated with the commission, it was also raised by 50 percent because the company was named as the leader of the cartel.

Davies firmly denied that Sasol was the leader, although he conceded it was the largest operator in the market.

There was no evidence that the individuals involved in the  cartel, who had all since left Sasol, had gained personally from their involvement. Davies suspected their motive had been to enhance what they considered to be the success of the business.

In a sign of how strongly cash generative Sasol is in a climate of generally high oil prices, the company is to draw on internal cash resources to pay the  fine – which must be deposited with the  commission in three months, regardless of whether an appeal is lodged. Future projects will not be affected.

Sasol had “substantial strength” in its balance sheet to fund projects and remain within its self-imposed gearing ratio of between 30 percent and 50 percent, Davies said. At the end of the 2008 financial year in June, Sasol’s debt-to-equity ratio was 20 percent.

Davies said that Sasol had not previously provided for the fine because it had been impossible to determine how much provision to make because of the commission’s wide discretion.

The EU’s tough regulatory framework on competition issues meant that Sasol would in future be “extremely careful” with its due diligence and compliance procedures, were it to make any acquisitions in the region in future, Davies said.

The company had recently strengthened its compliance programmes, with a particular focus on high-risk areas such as joint ventures.

HD         Amended antitrust bill eases up on directors
BY          Donwald Pressly

A national assembly committee has approved amendments to the Competition Amendment Bill to relax a clause that would have set a stringent negligence standard for criminal sanctions on directors, even if they were unaware of  cartel arrangements.

The legislation was brought back to the trade and industry portfolio committee after amendments were made by the national council of provinces (NCOP). The original bill passed through the assembly committee, chaired by ANC MP Ben Martins, and the assembly itself in August.

TD
A cartel can be defined as a group of businesses that aims to fix prices and limit supply and competition. Such conduct could include  price-fixing, collusive tendering, bid rigging, market carving and excluding competition.

Zodwa Ntuli, the deputy director-general at the department of trade and industry, said yesterday that after discussion with stakeholders and consideration of points raised in the select committee in the NCOP, the department had realised that there “may be an issue of fairness” in the case of directors who were not aware of  cartel arrangements.

There were some arguments that the stringent provision was unconstitutional, but the department had redrafted the relevant clause in consideration of the fairness argument.

Asked for an example, Ntuli said that four competitors might come together and make a  price-fixing arrangement. A director of one of the firms – represented at the meeting – was not aware of the arrangement and was not present. “In that case, it would be a bit unfair to say that director, who had no knowledge of that conduct, could be criminally liable.”

Asked how the bill now differed from the Competition Act of 1998, she said that previously only companies were liable for  cartel behaviour and not individual directors. Now, directors who were aware of the cartel behaviour would be liable for prosecution alongside their companies. Only those who were not aware would fall outside this sanction.
In addition, for the first time, individual directors would be responsible for the payment of the sanctions. In terms of the legislation, a contravention would carry a  fine “not exceeding R500 000” or
imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or both.

Under the current act, such a penalty is reserved for individuals who contravened an order of the competition tribunal or the competition appeal court. In the case of other offences, the  fine was limited to R2 000, imprisonment for six months or both.

Ntuli noted that assessment of whether a director – or even a member of staff of a company – was aware of cartel behaviour could arise following application by leniency applicants or whistle-blowers, or through a search and seizure operation by the competition  commission.

According to the website Polity.org, competition tribunal chairman David Lewis added his voice to concern that the provision regarding personal liability for directors could be found to be in conflict with the constitution.

At that point, the bill said a director would have committed an offence if he or she was responsible for causing the firm to engage in a prohibited practice, or knowingly acquiesced by either having actual knowledge of the behaviour or occupying a position in which he or she reasonably should have been aware.
While the amendments allow for directors to be criminally liable, they must know of the  cartel
behaviour.

The current legislation allows for a maximum penalty of 10 percent of total turnover of a company found to have engaged in  cartel behaviour.

A recent example of  cartel behaviour is a R145 million settlement between the competition commission and New Reclamation Group over its involvement in collusion and  price-fixing in the scrap metal market. Last year the  commission fined Tiger Brands nearly R100 million for bread overpricing. Tiger Brands acknowledged that it had colluded with other milling companies.
Sasol has recently been slapped with a fine of e318 million (R4.3 billion at yesterday’s exchange rate)
for alleged fixing of  paraffin wax prices in Europe between 1992 and 2005.

HD          How will Sasol be held to account  in South Africa for its misdeeds  in Europe? BY           Alide Dasnois

If there was a week to “bury bad news”, then last week certainly was one of them. With enough domestic political turmoil, it was anything but a slow news week. No one would have been more relieved than Sasol chief executive Pat Davies
Synfuel producer Sasol was  fined a whopping R3.7 billion by the  European Commission for
price-fixing and leading the so-called “paraffin wax mafia” last week.

TD
Sasol, the commission found, was the leader of the nine-company  cartel which dominated the
paraffin  wax market in Europe for 13 years.

Essentially, these large companies made the decision to fix prices in the lucrative  paraffin wax industry. The  European Commission has been investigating the matter for a number of years, after, interestingly enough, a company itself involved in the  price-fixing affair blew the whistle on Sasol and the other companies in the  cartel.
Sasol received by far the highest  fine for its illegal activities.

The finding by the  commission is damning. It exposes the price-fixers as having full knowledge that what they were doing was illegal. Sasol has sufficient cash reserves and so appears comfortable that it is in a position to pay the  fine within the required three months.
As has been pointed out elsewhere, it was not Sasol’s first brush with anti-competitive behaviour. In
2005, the Competition  Commission in South Africa  fined the company for fixing fertiliser prices. Spot
the theme.
The blatantly illegal behaviour again raises the fundamental question of corporate accountability.

As Neelie Kroes of the  European Commission has warned, there is a greater need for shareholder activism and management accountability to prevent some of these excesses.

While Sasol might appeal the ruling, it is its reputation which remains at risk. It has in its PR tried to drive home the fact that the transformation of the company is under way and that it wants to reflect certain “values”.
Which values, one must ask?

Serious questions have to be asked of companies; where are the accountability deficits in the way in which companies are managed and in the oversight which boards have?

In September last year, Mittal Steel was  fined R700 million by the Competition Tribunal for “excessive” pricing in the steel industry. At the time, Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa talked of giving the Competition  Commission greater powers to investigate uncompetitive behaviour pro-actively.


Page 182 of 191 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Regulation is important, as is an effective body to investigate and follow-up on issues of  price-fixing
or any anti-competitive behaviour.

But, more importantly, the cases brought before the Competition  Commission provide the public with much-needed information on exactly when corporate South Africa is being less than frank about the way in which it does business. Such information is an important link in the accountability chain.

The Sasol  price-fixing scandal brings us squarely into the realm of corporate governance and the impact of weak corporate governance on both the market in which a specific product is bought and sold and the impact further down the line on households and consumers.

How accountable are companies to their major stakeholders like employees, shareholders and the broader public?
Do companies see themselves as part of the society in which they operate?

Many times, the answer seems to be a resounding “No”. Out of the  price-fixing scandal and the financial crisis sweeping the world’s economies, lessons must be drawn.

The financial system, like a money merry-go-round, with selective accountability to broader society, is unravelling before our eyes.

The repercussions of a laxity in regulation and monitoring of the corporate sector are now being felt by all and sundry.
Whether it’s the global financial crisis or  price-fixing, it is usually the “little person” who suffers most. Tiger Brands and bread  price-fixing allegations spring to mind here. Such examples of
anti-competitive behaviour provide grist to the mill of trade unions demanding greater corporate
accountability, more regulation and an open discussion on executive remuneration.

Rightly so, for accountability is not something to be extracted from governments and political leadership only, but from those in the corporate world too.

Closer to home, these are some of the arguments the new South African leadership will no doubt hear from the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party as it debates “fat-cat capitalism” and the structure of the economy.
And so, in a world which has become increasingly borderless, how will Sasol be held to account in
South Africa for its corporate misdeeds in  Europe?

Surely the South African public, a not insignificant stakeholder in Sasol’s interests, has a right to know what happened and whether local markets could be exposed to similar acts of illegality? Should the
tax-payer be demanding that heads roll?

It seems only fair that Sasol faces up to the tough questions at home, if only to serve as a warning to other companies intent on distorting the markets for illegal gain.

The European Commission has fined nine companies a total of €676 million ($946 million) for operating a European paraffin  wax price-fixing cartel for 13 years. The  fine must be paid within three months.

The companies, which included Eni, Exxon Mobil, Mol, Repsol YPF, RWE, Sasol and Total, were found guilty of participating in the  cartel from 1992 to 2005 in violation of  European Union rules. Royal Dutch Shell, which was also involved in the  price fixing,  had its fine waived after tipping-off the  commission.

TD
The steepest  fine, $445 million, was levied on the  cartel's ring-leader Sasol. Total was  fined $179 million and Exxon $117 million. Sasol's  fine would have been twice as big had it not cooperated with the commission, while Eni's fine was increased by 60% because of its involvement in other cartels dating back to the 1980s, the commission said.

Sasol said it was surprised by the magnitude of the  fine and said it intended to appeal. Eni also said it would appeal the ruling. Exxon said that while it "deeply regretted" its involvement in the cartel and that it would "determine any further actions that need to be taken" after reading the full text of the commission's decision. Total issued a similar statement.

Oct 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined banana importers Dole and Weichert a total 60.3 million euros ($82.4 million) on Wednesday for price fixing  in violation of the EU's strict antitrust laws.
Del Monte Inc was held jointly and severally liable by the EU executive for paying the  fine imposed on
Weichert as it controlled the German company at the time of the infringement.

TD
California-based Dole was fined 45.6 million euros, with U.S. company Del Monte and Weichert jointly accountable for 14.7 million euros of the fine.
Dole later said it had not violated  European competition laws, and would appeal against the decision and
fine.

The following is a list of the highest  fines the Commission has imposed on companies and by sector. All but one appealed against the  fines:

BERLIN, October 15 /PRNewswire/ --
- Alarmingly Big  Fines and Lack of Rule of Law

TD
- Experts Consider a Great Need for Reforms to Exist in  European Cartel Law

The European Commission takes action against illegal cartel agreements in the EU by imposing spectacularly heavy fines. Recently it hit the so-called Paraffin cartel. The companies concerned have to pay Euro 676 million to the EU treasury. Last year the leading manufacturers of elevators were hit, who together had to pay  fines in an amount of just under  Euro 1 billion. The  Commission imposed a fine of Euro 479 million on ThyssenKrupp alone. Based on experts' observations, sanctions have been substantially increased over the last years. The total amount imposed trebled between 2005 and 2007.

Experts are not only alarmed on account of the amount of the  fines imposed. Rather, many experts believe that the  European cartel law has serious deficiencies. "The demand for a review of the  cartel law system is appropriate and reasonable", conceded even the former Director-General for Competition of the EU Commission, Dr. Alexander Schaub, who discussed the legal and political question marks of the prosecution of cartels under EU law on Tuesday in Berlin in the German Parliamentary Society together with company representatives, expert politicians and jurists who had accepted an invitation from Prof. Dr. Rupert Scholz, an expert on constitutional law, and the ICC's national committees in Germany, Suisse
and Austria.
Proceeding lacks legal standards

The well-known expert on  European Law, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Schwarze, and lawyers from the law firm Gleiss Lutz have closely examined the critical issues of  cartel law in a study. This study provides evidence of numerous weaknesses of the current practice. For a better understanding, one should take a look at the usual procedure. Naturally cartels are discreet associations. The Community's aim is to crack open the illegal groups by way of an immunity rule. The first member of the  cartel who confessed will go unpunished. Other companies incriminating themselves will be granted a deduction from the  fine. The
Commission is free to determine the amount of the  fine at its absolute discretion. The scope of such  fine is up to ten percent of the sales of an undertaking or a group of undertakings. Theoretically large undertakings could thus be sanctioned by  fines in the amounts of billions. The undertakings concerned
are only able to a limited extent to take action against a decision of the  Commission and can file a legal action with the Court of First Instance of the  European Court of Justice in Luxemburg. However, the judges do not re-examine the underlying facts, but only conduct a limited examination without investigating the facts themselves. The same applies to the  European Court of Justice itself as the next and at the same time last instance.

The study produced by Gleiss Lutz finds fault with the unclear legal basis of the law governing  cartel        fines. According to the study, the criteria for determining the amount of  fines are too vague and there is no sufficient legal basis for a liability of the parent undertakings for their subsidiaries. The jurists consider
the immunity rule as well to be questionable, because the other members of the  cartel are factually forced to incriminate themselves in order to escape higher penalties. A further issue with which the experts find fault is the limited judicial control of the decisions. The co-author of the study, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Schwarze, therefore demands a number of reforms of the applicable law. This includes, inter alia, regulations

regarding the amount of  fines and the requirement of evidence of an infringement of the  cartel prohibition by specific employees. A further proposal is that compliance programmes by which undertakings intend to prevent infringements should be considered in mitigation. Primarily, however, the analysis advocates a procedure based on the rule of law in which the EU  Commission acts as prosecutor, and a court examines the facts of the individual case and determines the amount of  fines. Mr Schwarze demanded that "a new two-stage procedure should be introduced".
Panel discussion shows need for reforms

The experts largely agree that there is a need for reforms. "We believe that the  European cartel law must be closely examined", Mr Scholz explained. Klaus-Heiner Lehne, too, who is a member of the legal committee of the  European Parliament, is of the view "that there is a need for improvement in terms of
the rule of law". The EPP Member of Parliament pleaded for an independent  cartel authority in  Europe based on the model of the German Federal  Cartel Office and for a discussion about introducing the formation of a  cartel as a criminal offence. In this way offences could also be punished by a prison sentence. This is common practice in the USA. Mr Lehne also considered it important that compliance programmes are taken into account when determining the award of punishment.

The spokesman for legal policy of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the German Bundestag, Jürgen Gehb, criticised the lack of a legal basis in the law governing  cartel fines. Mr Gehb said that it is not the amount of the  fines which is at issue, but that such  fines have to be enforced in a manner which is in accordance with the rule of law. Klaus Becher, chief corporate counsel at Daimler Financial Services and deputy chairman of the competition committee of the BDI, i.e. the Federal Association of the German Industry, also complained about legal deficiencies. Mr Becher said that the industry finds it incomprehensible that the Court of First Instance does not conduct any examination of the facts. "This must be changed", demanded Mr Becher.
"Medieval Clan Liability"

Another issue which causes considerable annoyance in the industry is the fact that the parent undertaking is held liable for offences in subsidiaries. "This corresponds to clan liability in the Middle Ages", said the chief corporate counsel of the Total SA group, Dr. Peter Herbel. He said that in criminal law as well, the rule is that it is not an offender's father or mother who is wanted, but the offender himself. Total itself is currently affected by penalty  fines in the Paraffin cartel through a subordinated subsidiary. Mr Herbel complained about a high award of punishment set by the  Commission and said that the  fine was seven times the amount of the company's annual sales and 40 times the amount of its profit. Dr. Klaus Moosmayer, too, considers the  Commission's practice of holding an entire undertaking liable for an infringement of an individual company to be questionable. Mr Moosmayer, who is the head of the compliance programme of Siemens AG, believes that a universal supervision of all employees is impossible in large undertakings. "There will always be inappropriate behaviour", fears Mr Moosmayer,
and the efforts taken by the company groups to prevent infringements should therefore be taken into account. Prof. Dr. Karl Hofstetter, chief corporate counsel and member of the supervisory board of the Swiss Schindler Holding AG, demands in addition that individual offenders be punished. "If the undertaking has done everything to prevent infringements, then the individual offender must be held liable", demanded Mr Hofstetter.

Fines have a deterring effect - but  fine practice should be reviewed

However, the former Director General for Competition of the EU Commission, Mr Schaub, also asked the attendants to have sympathy for the severe course of action taken by the EU Commission. He said that cartel infringements had been regarded as a trivial offence for a long time and had virtually not been prosecuted, and that the  Commission had taken care of this matter. The expert emphasised the effect of big fines as a deterrent. He defended the penalty  fines by stating that "this has resulted in drastic
changes in the undertakings", but that nontheless it has meanwhile become necessary to review the current practice. The Federal  Cartel Office as well considers the  cartel law to be quite a sharp instrument. A representative of the Office emphasised that the immunity rule is "extremely effective" and that the amounts of  fines are a deterrent.

In summary, Prof. Scholz expressed the warning that the efficiency of the measures aimed at combatting cartels must not serve as an authorisation to evade the rule of law.
