TOKYO (Nikkei)--Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061) decided Friday to challenge a 7.6 billion yen  fine
from the European Commission for allegedly fixing  synthetic rubber prices.
The company is preparing to file a complaint with the European Court of Justice by Feb. 5 to have the
fine nullified.

TD
The commission concluded last month that Denki Kagaku was part of a  cartel that manipulated the market from 1993 to 2002 for  rubber products used in autoparts and bonding materials.  Fines totaling
243 million euros, or about 40 billion yen, were assessed against Denki Kagaku, Tosoh Corp. (4042), U.S. firms DuPont and Dow Chemical Co., and a European company.

Denki Kagaku says its own investigation has found no evidence that it engaged in such activities. Tosoh is considering its response.

Tokyo, Jan. 15 (Jiji Press)--Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. said Tuesday that it will file an appeal against a
European Commission decision to impose a  fine on the Japanese company for joining a
price-fixing  cartel for synthetic  rubber products.

The Japanese chemicals company will file the appeal with the European Court of First Instance by the Feb. 5 deadline.

TD
Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which was  fined 47 million euros, said that the company and its German sales subsidiary never committed anticompetitive practices deliberately.

The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union,  fined Denki Kagaku Kogyo and five other companies a total of 243.21 million euros in December, claiming that the six held regular meetings to discuss how to carve out the market for chloroprene  rubber among themselves and fix prices.
Chloroprene rubber is used in hoses and automobile parts.

TOKYO, Jan. 15 -- Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. said Tuesday its German subsidiary Denka Chemicals
GmbH will file a lawsuit with the European Court of First Instance by Feb. 5, seeking nullification of the
47 million euro fine imposed on the company for allegedly forming an international price-fixing cartel
on synthetic rubber sales.

Last December, the  European Commission slapped five companies including two Japanese firms -- Denki Kagaku Kogyo and Tosoh Corp. -- with  fines totaling 243 million euros for the alleged infringement of European Union competition rules.

TD
The commission, the European Union's executive body, said the five companies coordinated the prices and shares in Europe of synthetic  rubber, which is used in a variety of products from shoes and
rubber hose to industrial goods, from 1993 to 2002.
Denki Kagaku Kogyo said, ''It never intended to act in a way that restricts competition and is at odds
(with the commission) in its understanding of the facts.''

The Tokyo chemicals producer plans to book some 7.6 billion yen as an extraordinary loss in its consolidated accounting for the year ending in March in case the commission does not repeal the penalty.

As a result, the company now projects a group net profit of 9.9 billion yen, down from the 17.5 billion yen projected in its earlier forecast.

Weak home market to slow Japan economy for a while, warns BOJ chief

TD
TOKYO - The Japanese economy will slow for a while as housing investment has declined ''to a large extent,'' Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said Tuesday as the central bank cut its economic assessments for four of the country's nine regions.

The warning by the BOJ chief, who also noted a larger-than-expected fallout on Japanese banks from the subprime mortgage crisis, came as the world's second-largest economy faces threats to its growth from the record-low levels of housing starts, which emerged in the middle of last year due to tighter building regulations.

Mizuho is one of the non-U.S. financial institutions and non-government-owned funds Merrill Lynch has asked for investment to strengthen its capital base, the sources said.

For the October-December quarter of 2006, it reported 6.21 billion yen in operating losses instead of the earlier stated 3.87 billion yen profit.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong has been ranked the freest economy in the world for the 14th consecutive year by the Heritage Foundation, a U.S. conservative think tank, and the Wall Street Journal, according to an annual report released Tuesday.

The 2008 Index of Economic Freedom ranked 157 countries and regions in the world to examine the relationship between their economic policies and prosperity in 10 categories: business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government size, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom.

Jasdaq and the OSE.

Some Jasdaq officials initially opposed the idea that the JSDA sell Jasdaq shares to the Osaka bourse operator, but the latest decision, made at an extraordinary Jasdaq board meeting earlier in the day, is expected to accelerate talks on the Jasdaq-OSE integration.

such as Citigroup Inc. later in the day.
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 107.58-61 yen against 108.11-21 yen in New York at 5 p.m.
Monday and 108.93-95 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Friday. Japanese financial markets were closed Monday
for a national holiday.

Petchem project costs to fall - Technip

Project cost escalation, which has led to delays and cancellations of new petrochemical plants and global expansions over the past year, is over, said an executive from French engineering firm Technip last week."The big turmoil, cost-wise, we feel it is over," Antonino Macri Pellizzeri, Technip's executive vice president and chief business officer declared. He added that costs were still rising but in a more logical way. SABIC CEO Mohamed al-Mady echoed this recently, saying the soaring construction costs were unsustainable and that the bubble would deflate over time.

US R&D not flowing abroad

Research and development (R&D) spending among US refining and chemical industries is likely to remain robust, despite the shift of production capacity to Asia and the Middle East, a top US science panel said last week. Officials with the congressionally chartered National Science Board said that some chemical industry R&D would follow the shift of process industry production capacity to Asia and the Middle East. But the funding losses are likely to be minor and may be offset by foreign R&D investment in the US.
BASF converts to "European company"

BASF has completed its transition to European Company status, changing the German chemical company's name to BASF SE (Societas Europaea). Its supervisory board now has 12 members, including six shareholder representatives and six employees. Also, with immediate effect, the company has established a new European works council named BASF Europa Betriebsrat, which consists of 23 members from 12 European countries. "We are the first company in our industry to embody the idea of Europe through its legal form," said vice chairman of the executive board Eggert Voscherau.
Ciech considers IPO to fund acquisitions

Ciech is considering an initial public offering (IPO) in order to finance acquisitions over the next five years, said Poland's largest base chemicals producer last week. The company will explore the role of an IPO within a strategy that should see it spend zloty (Zl) 4.8bn (€1.3bn/$1.9bn) on a series of domestic and foreign acquisitions and investments up to 2011. A spokesman said the company was currently looking at Polish firms ZA Pulawy and Zaklady Chemiczne Police as potential acquisitions.
INEOS acquires BP's Saltend acetates

The UK's INEOS has agreed to buy BP's vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and ethyl acetate (ETAC) businesses for an undisclosed sum. Based in Saltend, near Hull in the East of England, the businesses include a 250,000 tonne/year VAM plant and an ETAC plant of the same capacity, along with the Teesside to Saltend ethylene pipeline. "The addition of these facilities broadens the INEOS portfolio of
oxygenated solvents, optimizes existing links with our Grangemouth site and helps us to meet the growing demand for both products," said INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe.
EU brushes off fears of biofuel targets

The EU will keep the target of producing 10% of its energy requirements from biofuels despite apparent criticism of the policy by environment commissioner Stavros Dimas. He was concerned that setting the figure too high could lead to the excessive commercialization of biofuel crops, such as palm oil, with

Page 10 of 78 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
potentially damaging environmental and economic impacts. But, a spokesman for energy, commissioner Andris Piebalgs, stressed that Dimas' comments would not mean a change in the policy. His department will publish proposals on how to achieve this 10% target on January 23.
German biodiesel market "dead"

Many German biodiesel producers are facing bankruptcy following a tax hike on biodiesel, effective January 1, industry association Verband der Deutschen Biokraftstoffindustrie (VDB) said last week. "Only two weeks after the tax was hiked by 6 euro cents to 15 cents [a liter], our predictions came true: the market for B100 [100% biodiesel] is dead," said VDB president Arnd von Wissel, adding that B100 accounted for about 60% of Germany's biodiesel market.
Hungary stands by its "lex MOL" law

Hungary has formally told the  European Commission that it sees its "Lex MOL" law as a legitimate way of protecting strategic companies, such as MOL, from hostile takeovers, the country's foreign minister Kinga Goncz said last week. She said the law - drawn up after Austrian OMV's declaration that it wished to merge with MOL - was in line with EU rules on the free movement of capital. However, Hungary would be open to changing the law if the Commission pinpointed difficulties, she added.
US wind energy sees growth for epoxies

Wind turbine blade manufacturing is expected to remain the fastest-growing end-use market for basic liquid epoxy resin (LER), but the hype surrounding that sector is overshadowed by low-profitability expectations, an LER producer said last week."In the long run, it's the worst business for [LER] producers to sell into," the source said, citing stiff price competition in securing large-volume LER supply contracts in the wind energy sector.
Neste Oil to start Mid-East base oils in 2011

Neste Oil, the Finnish refiner, plans to produce 900,000 tonnes/year of Group III base oils in the Middle East by building two plants to start up in 2011 and 2013. One of the projects, a 400,000 tonne/year unit, will be built in Bahrain in a joint venture (JV) with Bahrain Petroleum Co, said Risto Rinne, president and CEO of Neste. Bidding has started for contractors, said Rinne, adding that the project is expected to start up in late 2010 or 2011. Another 500,000 tonne/year project in the United Arab Emirates is a JV with Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Co. (TAKREER) and Austrian oil and gas firm OMV.
India's RCF plans $1bn urea expansion

India's Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) is planning to invest Indian rupees (Rs) 40bn ($1bn) to expand urea capacity at its plant in Thal, Maharashtra, in two phases. In the first phase, the company will debottleneck its 1.85m tonne/year urea plant at an investment of Rs4.5bn, said M Sundararaman, the company's director of finance. "In this debottlenecking, we would be increasing the Thal unit's urea capacity by around 10% to 2.03m tonne/year," he added.

cartel fine makes Denka DROP forecast
Denki Kagaku Kogyo (Denka) has lowered its consolidated net income forecast for fiscal-year 2007 by

of the resins business," said managing board member Nico Gerardu. The companies have not disclosed the financial details of the transaction.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined German chemical maker Bayer AG and Zeon Corp. of Japan on Wednesday a total of euro34.2 million (US$49.6 million) for colluding to fix prices of synthetic  rubber used in automotive parts and other products.

The European Commission said the two companies carried out their  cartel between 2000-2002, to set prices of their rubber products which are widely used in the automobile industry. Bayer was hit with a euro28.87 million (US$41.84 million)  fine, while Zeon got a euro5.36 million (US$7.77 million) penalty.

TD
It was the second time in two months Bayer was named by Brussels in  cartel cases to set prices on
rubber products used to make hoses, belting, cable, o-rings, seals, adhesives, and sealants.

In December, Bayer escaped a fine then because it received full immunity for blowing the whistle on the price fixing  for chloroprene rubber, which is used to make hoses, transmission belts and as latex used to make shoe soles and condoms.

"This is the fourth  cartel decision in the synthetic  rubber industry in just over three years. I hope that this is the last," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. She said carmakers and other industry buyers of synthetic  rubber "should be concerned about how much these cartels have cost them."

Commission officials said it had started its investigation into Bayer and Zeon in 2003, conducting surprise raids on the two.

The Commission said the companies "held regular meetings to discuss prices and to coordinate price increases, to exchange sensitive commercial information and to follow-up the implementation of their illegal plans."

The EU executive said however, both companies cooperated to hand over evidence once their  cartel was discovered by EU regulators. As a result Bayer received a 30 percent reduction in its  fine and Zeon 20 percent.
The two companies had already been found guilty by U.S. Department of Justice in 2005 for similar  cartel
practices in the U.S. market for acrylonitrile-budadiene, a form of synthetic  rubber also known as NBR.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined chemical companies Bayer
AG (BAYRY) and Zeon Corp. (4205.TO) EUR34.2 million for  fixing  synthetic  rubber prices.

The two companies operated a  cartel in Nitrile Butadiene  Rubber, used mainly in car manufacturing for fuel hoses and seals, between late 2000 and 2002, the commission said.

Germany's Bayer has to pay a lion's share of the  fine at EUR28.9 million, its  fine increased by 50% for being a repeat offender, despite receiving a reduction for cooperating with the probe. Japanese Zeon has to pay EUR5.4 million, receiving a 20% reduction for good cooperation with the investigation.

Bayer and Zeon raised prices through a series of meetings, where they coordinated price increases and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

"This is the fourth  cartel decision in the synthetic  rubber industry in just over three years. I hope that this is the last," said the European antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes.

HD      FT.com site : Brussels urged to cut cartel fines. BY       Nikki Tait

Companies are demanding cuts of at least one-fifth in Europe's mounting cartel fines in return for admitting anti-competitive behaviour and reaching swift settlements with the European Commission, the region's top competition watchdog.

In submissions just made public, industry bodies from France, Germany, the UK and the US have warned Brussels that reductions will have to be "substantial" and guaranteed if it wants companies to reach voluntary deals.

TD
The American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels has told the Commission that  fine reductions "would need to be in the range of at least 20-30 per cent if the process is to prove attractive to companies".

The Confederation of British Industry said: "Engaging in the settlement process is likely to bring forward and, potentially, prejudice the defence of any ensuing civil litigation.

"We regard it as vital that the  fine reduction [is] both quantifiable and significant . . . We propose that this should not be less than 25 per cent."

The American Chamber of Commerce points out that French competition authorities usually offer reductions in the 25-50 per cent range if companies agree to early settlements.

To date, the  European Commission has never done deals with companies suspected of price-fixing, although companies can win immunity or  fine reductions in return for blowing the whistle on a cartel and or co-operating.

But last autumn, the Brussels regulator put forward a draft package which, for the first time, would allow companies to settle allegations of price-fixing  if they agreed to admit liability and follow simplified procedures.

This would benefit the Commission, which is facing a heavy antitrust workload, by freeing up resources. Companies who settled would also have little scope for appealing against  fine decisions, so years of litigation could be avoided.

Companies, meanwhile, would be able to put  cartel offences behind them, and avoid being embroiled in an increasingly tough competition regime. Last year, Brussels raised more than 3.3bn ($4.8bn) in  cartel fines, compared with 390m in 2004.

But the Commission's draft package stated that the regulator would not negotiate with suspected offenders over sanctions or the use of evidence. Instead, it would unilaterally "reward" companies for their co-operation in achieving procedural efficiencies on a fairly discretionary basis.

But many companies and lawyers are now warning that there might be insufficient incentive to engage in the settlement process and that the drawbacks could outweigh the advantages.

The International Bar Association, for example, says it is "concerned about the lack of transparency and certainty for the parties willing to settle.



Page 20 of 78 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"This may discourage and prevent these parties from entering into settlement discussions and could thus undermine the goals of the Commission's initiative," it notes.

One of the main concerns cited is the extent to which admissions made to the Commission could be used in separate damages litigation brought by third parties - especially if these have to be in writing.

? Germany's Bayer and the Japanese Zeon group have been  fined 34.2m ($49.7m) by the  European     Commission for fixing  prices of nitrile butadiene  rubber - a synthetic  rubber used mainly in carmaking - between late 2000 and 2002. Bayer will pay 28.9m, and Zeon 5.36m. Both saw their fines reduced for
co-operation, but Bayer's  fine was also increased as it had already been penalised for cartel activity in an earlier Commission decision. This is the fourth  cartel in the synthetic  rubber industry to be prosecuted by Brussels in as many years and Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said yesterday she hoped it would be the last. Total  fines in the four cases have topped 850m.

(Adds statement by Bayer, background)

BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday fined Bayer of Germany and Zeon of Japan a total 34 million euros ($49.7 million) for fixing  prices on nitrile butadiene  rubber, used for hoses and seals.

TD
Bayer was fined 28.87 million euros and Zeon 5.36 million euros.

"This is the fourth  cartel decision in the synthetic  rubber industry in just over three years. I hope that this is the last," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.
The cartel was relatively short-lived and the  fine comparatively small.

By contrast, members of a chloroprene rubber cartel were fined 243 million euros in December 2007. In November 2006, members of a synthetic rubber cartel were fined 519 million, and a  rubber chemicals cartel was fined 76 million in December 2004.

Brussels said Bayer and Zeon had conducted meetings to coordinate prices and exchange sensitive information in a  cartel that lasted from 2000 to 2002.

Nitrile butadiene  rubber is used in the auto industry because of its resistance to petroleum fluids, good physical properties and useful temperature range, the Commission said.

Bayer said in a statement that "the amount of the  fine is partially covered by provisions in the balance sheet.

"When it receives the written statement of the reasons for the decision, the company will consider it in detail and then decide whether to appeal."

Bayer also said it "very much regrets the legal violations in the past" and had assisted the Commission. The company said it had adopted guidelines on legal compliance in 1999 -- one year before the  cartel began.
The company said it had tightened those guidelines in 2004 and that violations would not be tolerated. The Commission had reduced Bayer's fine by 30 percent and Zeon's by 20 percent because they
cooperated. But it then increased Bayer's fine by 50 percent because the company had been in other
cartels. (Reporting by Darren Ennis and David Lawsky, Editing by Paul Bolding/Rory Channing)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined chemical companies Bayer
AG (BAYRY) and Zeon Corp. (4205.TO) EUR34.2 million for  fixing  synthetic  rubber prices.

The two companies operated a  cartel in Nitrile Butadiene  Rubber, used mainly in car manufacturing for fuel hoses and seals, between late 2000 and 2002, the commission said.

Germany's Bayer has to pay a lion's share of the  fine at EUR28.9 million, its  fine increased by 50% for being a repeat offender, despite receiving a reduction for cooperating with the probe. Japanese Zeon has to pay EUR5.4 million, receiving a 20% reduction for good cooperation with the investigation.

Bayer and Zeon raised prices through a series of meetings, where they coordinated price increases and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

"This is the fourth  cartel decision in the synthetic  rubber industry in just over three years. I hope that this is the last," said the European antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission has imposed fines worth 34.2 million euros (one euro=1.4566 U.S. dollars) on the Bayer and Zeon groups for fixing  prices for a synthetic rubber.

Between late 2000 and 2002, Bayer and Zeon managed to raise or otherwise stabilize prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts, said the commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU), on Wednesday.

TD
The rubber involved -- Nitrile Butadiene  Rubber -- is used mainly in car manufacturing for its resistance to petroleum fluids, good physical properties and useful temperature range.
This is the fourth time that the commission has to  fine for price fixing  in the synthetic  rubber industry.

KENNAMETAL LOWERS SIGHTS

Kennametal Inc. yesterday reduced its fiscal 2008 profit outlook and issued a third-quarter profit prediction below Wall Street estimates, citing expectations of more moderate sales growth. The Latrobe-based company said it expected to post an annual profit of $2.71 to $2.77 per share, down
from previous estimates of $2.80 to $2.85 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial estimated a profit of $2.79 per share. For the third quarter, Kennametal expects to post a profit of 72 cents to 75 cents per share, while analysts, on average, expect a profit of 80 cents per share. Shares closed at
$28.15, down 7 cents.

CNX BOOSTING SPENDING

CNX Gas Corp. said yesterday it would boost capital spending by 35 percent this year for natural gas exploration and development. The Robinson-based company plans to spend $470 million in 2008, vs.
$348.6 million last year. CNX said one exploration project would require $88 million, and three development projects would cost $377 million. The $88 million earmarked for exploration includes $46 million for shale and other resources, $27 million for coalbed methane and $15 million for land.
EARNINGS

Northwest Bancorp Inc., Warren, reported fourth-quarter net income of $15.9 million, or 33 cent per diluted share, vs. $9.8 million, or 20 cents, a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had estimated earnings of 27 cents per share. Results for the most recent quarter include an after-tax gain of $3 million and a charge of $1.1 million related to the write-down of securities. Excluding items from both quarters, net income totaled $14.4 million vs. $11.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the year was $49.1 million, or 99 cents per diluted share, vs. $51.5 million, or $1.03, in 2006.
Southwest Airlines, again showing its ability to hedge against high fuel costs, said it doubled
fourth-quarter net income to $111 million, or 15 cents per share, vs. $57 million, or 7 cents, a year ago.
Excluding one-time gains, profit was 12 cents a share, 2 cents more than the per-share estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.49 billion.
AIRLINE SPEAK AT ONE
The US Airways Labor Coalition, a group representing about 30,000 workers at the airline, is

Brussels, 23/01/2008 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 23 January, the European Commission imposed fines totalling € 34 230 000 on the Bayer (Germany) and Zeon (Japan) groups for fixing  prices for Nitrile Butadiene  Rubber (NBR). This is the fourth  fine imposed on synthetic  rubber producers in three years.

NBR is used mainly in car manufacturing for fuel and oil handling hoses, seals, o-rings and water handling applications. Between late 2000 and 2002, Bayer and Zeon managed to raise, or otherwise stabilise,
prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts. Bayer's and Zeon's  fines are reduced by
30% and 20%, respectively, because they co-operated with the investigation under the Commission's
2002 Leniency Notice. However Bayer's  fine was increased by 50% because it had been  fined for cartel
activity in a previous Commission decision (December 2005).

TD
The Commission's investigation started with surprise inspections in March 2003, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by a third company under the 2002 Leniency Notice. Both Bayer and Zeon co-operated with the Commission and submitted additional evidence. (C.D.)

The companies Bayer and Zeon will have to shell out a total of €34.2 million for fixing  the price of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) between late 2000 and 2002, announced the European Commission on 23
January.

Resistant to petroleum fluids, NBR is used predominantly in the motor industry (fuel and oil handling hoses and seals, among others).

TD
The German company Bayer receives a  fine of €28.8 million and the Japanese company Zeon €5.3 million.

The fine is "relatively" low because it only involves two companies and because their collusion lasted "a relatively short time," emphasised a spokesperson. In fact, he reiterated, the Commission made its calculation based on its 2006 guidelines "adapted" to the length of the infringement.

"We can hope that we have arrived at the end of these  rubber cartels," the spokesman added, confirming that the EU executive was not carrying out other investigations in the sector "for the moment".
"Shareholders should be concerned about how much the  fines have cost them," commented Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes. She has always said that she wants to combat cartels more intensely.

Bayer and Zeon, however, benefited from a respective reduction of 30% and 20% for cooperating during the investigation, as set out in the 2002 communication on leniency.
REPEAT OFFENCES

It is the fourth  cartel in the rubber industry that Kroes has taken down in just over three years. The other fines were higher given the number of companies involved and the duration of the cartels: €519 million in November 2006 for synthetic rubber BR-ESBR particularly used in making tyres (see Europolitics 3200) and €243.2 million for chloroprene rubber (adhesives, diving equipment, condoms) in December 2007 (3428). Bayer was involved each time. The Commission nonetheless decided not to take this into account because these repeat offences "took place in a similar period of time and therefore are parallel infringements," it said in a press release.
The fine received by the German manufacturer was increased by 50% because it had been  fined for
cartel activity in the citric acid sector in a previous Commission decision, said the spokesperson.

To recall, the Commission applied guidelines, adopted in 2006, for the calculation of  fines, now based on a percentage of annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years that the infringement has lasted.

Companies are demanding cuts of at least one-fifth in Europe's mounting cartel fines in return for admitting anti-competitive behaviour and reaching swift settlements with the European Commission, the region's top competition watchdog.

In submissions just made public, industry bodies from France, Germany, the UK and the US have warned Brussels that reductions will have to be "substantial" and guaranteed if it wants companies to reach voluntary deals.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels has told the Commission that  fine reductions "would need to be in the range of at least 20-30 per cent if the process is to prove attractive to companies".

The Confederation of British Industry said: "Engaging in the settlement process is likely to bring forward and, potentially, prejudice the defence of any ensuing civil litigation.

"We regard it as vital that the  fine reduction (is) both quantifiable and significant . . . We propose that this should not be less than 25 per cent."

The American Chamber of Commerce points out that French competition authorities usually offer reductions in the 25-50 per cent range if companies agree to early settlements.

To date, the  European Commission has never done deals with companies suspected of price-fixing, although companies can win immunity or  fine reductions in return for blowing the whistle on a cartel and or co-operating.

But last autumn, the Brussels regulator put forward a draft package which, for the first time, would allow companies to settle allegations of price-fixing  if they agreed to admit liability and follow simplified procedures.

This would benefit the Commission, which is facing a heavy antitrust workload, by freeing up resources. Companies who settled would also have little scope for appealing against  fine decisions, so years of litigation could be avoided.

Companies, meanwhile, would be able to put  cartel offences behind them, and avoid being embroiled in an increasingly tough competition regime. Last year, Brussels raised more than Euros 3.3bn (Dollars
4.8bn) in cartel fines, compared with Euros 390m in 2004.

But the Commission's draft package stated that the regulator would not negotiate with suspected offenders over sanctions or the use of evidence. Instead, it would unilaterally "reward" companies for their co-operation in achieving procedural efficiencies on a fairly discretionary basis.

But many companies and lawyers are now warning that there might be insufficient incentive to engage in the settlement process and that the drawbacks could outweigh the advantages.

The International Bar Association, for example, says it is "concerned about the lack of transparency and certainty for the parties willing to settle.

"This may discourage and prevent these parties from entering into settlement discussions and could thus undermine the goals of the Commission's initiative," it notes.

One of the main concerns cited is the extent to which admissions made to the Commission could be used in separate damages litigation brought by third parties - especially if these have to be in writing.
Chemicals groups hit by penalties over  rubber pricing

Germany's Bayer and the Japanese Zeon group have been fined Euros 34.2m (Dollars 49.7m) by the European Commission for fixing  prices of nitrile butadiene rubber - a synthetic  rubber used mainly in carmaking - between late 2000 and 2002. Bayer will pay Euros 28.9m, and Zeon, Euros 5.36m. Both saw their fines reduced for co-operation, but Bayer's  fine was also increased as it had already been
penalised for cartel activity in an earlier Commission decision. This is the fourth  cartel in the synthetic rubber industry to be prosecuted by Brussels in as many years and Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said yesterday she hoped it would be the last. Total  fines in the four cases have topped Euros 850m.

HD         EC Fines German Bayer 29 Mln Euro For Nitrile Rubber Price Fixing

The European Commission (EC) has imposed on German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Bayer AG a fine of 29 mln euro ($42.4 mln) for  fixing  nitrile rubber prices with Japanese competitor Zeon between 2000 and 2002, German daily Financial Times Deutschland (FTD) reported on January
24, 2008.
Zeon was fined 5.0 mln euro ($7.3 mln).

TD
A spokesman for Bayer said the fine would be paid mostly with company reserves. According to him, that is the last  rubber price-fixing  case for the company in the EU. Whether and where further  fines for price-fixing  are possible will be discussed in late February along with the presentation of financial results.

That is the fourth case in which Bayer is being investigated by the EC on participating in a  cartel. In the first two cases, the company did not pay any  fines as it chose to collaborate as chief witness, and in
the third case it was  fined 59 mln euro ($86.3 mln).

In 2005, Bayer spun off its  rubber business in local polymer and chemical group Lanxess and agreed that Lanxess will assume 30 pct of possible  fines on cartels and if the total sum does not surpass 100 mln euro ($146.2 mln). Now that the ceiling has been exceeded, Lanxess will not pay any part of Bayer's latest  fine.

Gilead Denounces Claim
By Patent Foundation

TD
Gilead Sciences Inc. late yesterday blasted as "misleading and exaggerated" a claim by the Public Patent Foundation that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected four of Gilead's patents covering its HIV/AIDS drug Viread. Viread is the now the most widely used AIDS antiviral compound in the U.S. The foundation said it challenged Gilead's filing by submitting prior art that the company hadn't disclosed to the patent office during the application process. A Gilead spokeswoman said the company is confident in its patents position and will vigorously defend its position.
Tyco Income Increases; Expectations Are Lifted
Tyco International Ltd. issued preliminary first-quarter results and boosted full-year expectations, helping send shares 8% higher. The manufacturing and services company said preliminary operating income in the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $499 million, up from $256 million a year ago. Operating income excluding items rose 55% to $523 million. The percentage change reflects just the year-earlier operations of what now makes up Tyco, which was split in three last year. Revenue rose 12% to $4.87 billion. For the fiscal year, Tyco now sees earnings, excluding items, of $2.60 to $2.70 a share.
EU Fines Bayer, Zeon
For Colluding on Prices

European Union antitrust regulators  fined German chemicals maker Bayer AG and Zeon Corp. of Japan a total of 34.2 million euros ($50 million) for colluding to fix prices of synthetic  rubber used in auto parts and other products. The  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the two
companies carried out their cartel between 2000 and 2002. Bayer was hit with a 28.87 million euro fine, while Zeon received a 5.36 million euro penalty. Bayer said yesterday that "the amount of the  fine is partially covered by provisions in the balance sheet."

Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has been fined 28.9m euros by the  European Commission for entering into illegal price agreements for synthetic rubber. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes says that this is the fourth ruling on cartels in the synthetic rubber sector in three years. Bayer plans to await the justification for the verdict before deciding whether to appeal.

Japanese group Zeon, with which Bayer entered into the agreements between 2000 and 2002, has been ordered to pay a fine of just under 5.4m euros. Bayer says that reserves on its balance sheet will cover part of its  fine. The fact that both companies cooperated with the Commission is said to have lessened the penalties, although Bayer's  fine was increased by 50 per cent because the company had already been fined for involvement in cartels previously.

The European Union  fined German chemical firm Bayer AG and Zeon Corp. a total of 34.2 million euros, or about $51.2 million (Canadian), for  fixing  the prices of a synthetic  rubber used in cars, part of a crackdown on  rubber industry cartels.

Bayer was fined 28.9 million euros, reflecting an increased penalty as a repeat offender from past cartel cases, the European Commission, the EU's antitrust enforcer in Brussels, said. Zeon and affiliates of the Tokyo-based company were  fined 5.4 million euros.

TD
The fines yesterday were "relatively low" due to the short life of the  cartel, from late 2000 to 2002, said commission spokesperson Jonathan Todd. The case is the EU's fourth against
synthetic-rubber firms in a little more than two years, totalling 872.4 million euros.
The case involves synthetic  rubber called nitrile butadiene, used in car water and fuel hoses.

HD        EC fines Bayer, Zeon Eur34 mil for fixing  butadiene  rubber prices

The European Commission has imposed fines totaling Eur34.2 million ($50.6 million) on Germany's Bayer and Japan's Zeon for fixing  prices for nitrile butadiene  rubber, the Commission announced January 23.

Bayer's and Zeon's actions were in violation of the EC Treaty's and the EEA Agreement's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement).

TD
Between late 2000 and 2002, Bayer and Zeon managed to raise or otherwise stabilize prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts, the EC said in a statement.

Bayer's and Zeon's  fines were reduced by 30% and 20%, respectively, because they co-operated with the investigation under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice. In addition, Zeon benefited from a further reduction as it was the first to disclose the first period of the  cartel to the Commission.
However Bayer's  fine was increased by 50% because it had been  fined for cartel activity in a previous
EC decision.

The Commission's investigation started with surprise inspections in March 2003, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by a third company under the 2002 Leniency Notice. The EC did not identify the third company. Both Bayer and Zeon co-operated with the EC and submitted additional evidence.

From at least 2000 to 2002, the producers of NBR operated a  cartel in which they fixed prices. The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices and to coordinate price increases, to exchange sensitive commercial information and to follow-up the implementation of their illegal plans.

These practices constitute very serious infringements of EC Treaty antitrust rules. In setting the  fines, the Commission said it took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share, the geographical scope and the implementation of the  cartel agreements.

The EC increased the  fines for Bayer by 50% because it had already been  fined for cartel activities in a previous EC decision. "However, the decisions adopted in recent years concerning other infringements of competition rules perpetrated by Bayer in the synthetic  rubber industry did not lead to a further increase of this  fine as they took place in a similar period of time and therefore are parallel infringements," the EC said. The three decisions adopted by the Commission in this sector and the corresponding fines were:

Rubber Chemicals in December 2004: Eur75.86 million
Synthetic  Rubber BR/ESBR in November 2006: Eur519 million
Chloroprene Rubber in December 2007: Eur243.2 million
In this latest case, Bayer was  fined Eur28.87 million while Zeon was  fined Eur5.36 million.

"This is the fourth  cartel decision in the synthetic  rubber industry in just over three years," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I hope that this is the last. Buyers of synthetic  rubber should be concerned about how much these cartels have cost them. And shareholders should be concerned about how much the  fines have cost them."

NBR is a type of synthetic  rubber consisting of a complex family of unsaturated copolymers of acrylonitrile and butadiene. It is used mainly in car manufacturing for fuel and oil handling hoses, seals, o-rings and water handling applications. Resistance to petroleum fluids, good physical properties and useful temperature range make NBR a widely used  rubber.

Japan's Zeon and Germany's Bayer have been ordered to pay EUR 34.23 M ($49.9 M) in  fines by the European Commission for their participation in a  cartel that fixed the prices of nitrile butadiene  rubber. The Commission said the two companies held a succession of meetings and other illegal contacts between 2000-2002 to increase or stabilize prices. Zeon was  fined EUR 5.36 M  fines, while Bayer was hit with a $28.87 M  fine.

The European Commission has penalised Bayer and Japan's Zeon a total of EUR 34 M ($50 M) for colluding in the price-fixing  of nitrile butadiene  rubber (NBR) in 2000-2002. The  fine for Bayer amounted to EUR 28.87 Mand EUR 5.36 M for Zeon. The penalties of the two firms were lowered by 30% and 20%, respectively, for cooperating in the commission's inquiries. Still, Bayer's initial  fine was raised by 50% due to its participation in separate price-fixing  activities for  rubber chemicals, butadiene  rubber (BR) and chloroprene rubber. Bayer's penalties for the BR and chloroprene cartels were cancelled because it reported the activities to the commission. Bayer has yet to resolve if it will petition the NBR  cartel penalty. The commission has given a total fine of more than EUR 870 M for the four  rubber cartel cases. A table presents the  fines imposed by the European Commission on price-fixing  cartels in the synthetic  rubber industry since 2004.

The European Commission has hit Bayer A.G. and Zeon Corp. with  fines totaling $50.1 million for price-fixing  of nitrile-butadiene  rubber.

Bayer's fine of $42.2 million was reduced by 30 percent and Zeon's $7.99 million  fine was cut by 20 percent because they cooperated in the investigation, the commission said. However, Bayer's  fine also was increased by 50 percent because the German firm previously had been  fined by the EC
for price-fixing  of rubber chemicals, butadiene and styrene-butadiene  rubber, and chloroprene
rubber.

TD
The commission said Bayer and Zeon between late 2000 and 2002 raised or stabilized prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contact.

It's the fourth time in three years that the EC has  fined companies over cartel actions involving synthetic  rubber.

"I hope this is the last one," said EC Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Buyers of synthetic rubber should be concerned about how much these cartels have cost them. And shareholders should be concerned about how much the  fines have cost them."

DuPont posts 30% rise in Q4 profits
DuPont has posted a 30% increase in fourth-quarter (Q4) pretax operating income to $937m (€637m) on
11% higher sales of $7bn, driven by earnings growth across all business segments. The US-based
company's underlying earnings per share (EPS) rose by 27% to 57 cents, coming in 8 cents ahead of
analyst expectations. DuPont reaffirmed its 2008 full-year EPS outlook of $3.35-3.55 and its Q1 forecast
of $1.12-1.17.

SOLUTIA'S EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY DELAYED

Credit market turmoil has delayed US-based Solutia's emergence from bankruptcy protection, as originally planned, on January 25. The company is having trouble securing the required $2bn (€1.36bn) in exit financing from banks. Unless credit conditions changed drastically since October 25, the banks had a February 29 deadline to complete the financing, Solutia said. The banks argued that credit conditions
have indeed changed.
Evonik expands hydrogen peroxide
Germany-based Evonik Industries has expanded the capacity of its Brazilian hydrogen peroxide plant to
70,000 tonnes/year. The plant, in Barra do Riacho, Brazil, could be expanded further to 100,000
tonnes/year. The company plans to apply the technology used at the Brazilian plant at its sites in either
Gibbons, Canada or Mobile, Alabama, US.
Europe chem stocks hit by rate worries

Europe's chemical makers suffered last Wednesday as the region's stock markets continued to tumble. The Dow Jones Eurostoxx chemicals index was down by 5.1% at the close, with German chemical giants BASF and Bayer among the biggest sector losers. BASF's share price lost 5.84%, with Bayer down
5.66%. Smaller specialty players were not as hard-hit as the market reacted to comments from European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, suggesting Europe might not follow the US in cutting rates.
SABIC opens CANADA research center

US-based SABIC Innovative Plastics has opened a new plastics research center at its manufacturing site in Cobourg, east of Toronto, Canada. The Center for Manufacturing Innovation was supported by
$700,000 (€476,000) in matching funds from the Ontario provincial government and will cooperate with researchers at universities and colleges.

ConocoPhillips Q4 chemical profits drop

ConocoPhillips' Q4 net income in its chemical segment fell by 65% on lower product margins. Net income was $34m (€23m) - excluding a $65m tax benefit - down from $98m year-on-year. The decline was primarily due to lower olefin and polyolefin margins, and to a lesser extent, lower margins for aromatics and styrenics.
Krebs to produce Wacker material

India's Krebs Biochemicals and Industries has approved a manufacturing contract with Germany-based Wacker Chemie for the production of 700 tonnes/year of biotech product L-cystine.

EU emissions bill changes hit industry

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from petrochemicals, ammonia and aluminum manufacturing will be included in the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) after 2013, according to the draft climate change bill published by the  European Commission. The bill suggests adding these industries to the sectors already covered by the ETS, and says greenhouse gases other than CO2 should also be included in Phase 3 of the ETS.
Praxair posts record 2007 profits, sales

US-based Praxair's operating profits for the fourth quarter surged by 23% to $484m (€329m) on 19% higher sales of $2.5bn. Net income rose by 18% to $316m. "We finished an outstanding year with a strong fourth quarter. Sales growth was robust globally, led by South America and Asia," said chairman and CEO Steve Angel. For the full year of 2008, Praxair expects year-over-year sales growth in the range of
10-14%.
Air Products Q1 profits rise 17%

US-based Air Products posted a 17% rise in operating profits for its fiscal first quarter (Q1) ended December 2007 to $372m (€253m) on the back of higher volume growth, improved margins across most segments and a weaker dollar. Sales increased by 9% to nearly $2.5bn, while income from continuing operations surged by 16% to $257m.
MOL completes €560m share sale to CEZ

Hungarian oil and gas firm MOL has sold 7% of its shares to Czech electricity company CEZ for €560m ($816.8m). CEZ, Central and Eastern Europe's largest power supplier, bought 7.68m "A" shares at Hungarian forint (Ft) 30,000/share ($170/share). MOL was using the share sale, together with a wider strategic cooperation, in its ongoing attempt to fend off any hostile takeover bid that could be launched by Austrian rival OMV, analysts said. MOL and its allies now control more than 40% of the share capital.

Kuraray delays Texas EVOH expansion

Japan-based Kuraray has delayed its target for the second-phase expansion of its existing 35,000 tonne/year ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) resin unit in Texas, US, to March 2009, due to weak demand for the product from car manufacturers. Kuraray previously said it had hoped to begin commercial operations by 2008.

German and Japanese groups Bayer and Zeon have been fined EUR 34.23 M by the  European              Commission for having participated in a nitrile butadiene rubber cartel between 2000-2002. The European commissioner for competition pointed out that this was the fourth fine for price-fixing  on the synthetic rubbers market within 3 years. At end 2006 the European Commission fined 5 companies
EUR 519 M for price-fixing  on the butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene rubber market. Bayer was involved in this cartel as well but was granted immunity for having denounced the  cartel.

UNITED STATES HP and Staples Sued Over Anticompetitive Ink Cartridge Agreement Computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard Co. and office supply retailer Staples Inc. face a consumer class action lawsuit for allegedly agreeing to restrict competition in the market for laser printer ink cartridges. In December, a California resident and owner of an HP inkjet printer, Ranjit Bedi, filed a lawsuit against the companies in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Bedi claims that HP and Staples conspired to reduce competition and raise prices in the HP-compatible ink cartridge market. HP is the US market leader for both printers and replacement ink cartridges, but earns higher profits on sales of ink cartridges. The complaint states that HP and Staples violated the antitrust laws when they entered an agreement in 2006 according to which Staples ceased sales of its own brand of HP-compatible printer cartridges in exchange for monetary benefits from HP.

TD
Such benefits allegedly included more than US$100 million in "market development funds." According to the complaint, the HPStaples agreement is a horizontal agreement between direct competitors: "It reduces the output of HP-compatible cartridges, increases the price of HP-compatible cartridges, eliminates interbrand competition between Staples and HP and limits nonprice competition in the market for HPcompatible cartridges." Bedi claims that the HP-Staples agreement is illegal under the Sherman Act because it restrains trade and fixes prices. He has asked the court to certify a class of similarly situated purchasers of HP-compatible ink cartridges. He has also asked for injunctive relief, treble damages, attorneys' fees and court costs. ALJ Dismisses FTC Action Against Michigan Realtors Association Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen J. McGuire has dismissed the complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against Realcomp, a corporation servicing more than 2,100 Michigan real estate brokerage offices. Realcomp, which is owned by a group of realtor boards and associations, operates the multiple listing service (MLS) for Southeastern Michigan. The FTC alleged that by restricting certain brokers' access to the MLS and related public websites, Realcomp unreasonably restrained competition. According to the FTC's complaint, Realcomp restrained trade by blocking information about Exclusive Agency (EA) listings and listings by other nontraditional brokerage services and by preventing the dissemination of this information to public websites that are fed by the MLS. EA listings are produced by agreements whereby the broker receives a commission only if the broker locates the buyer; if the seller locates the buyer, the agent receives no commission. The complaint further alleged that brokers who adopted Realcomp's MLS rules effectively agreed to restrict the manner in which they compete. Moreover, such brokers collectively withheld a valuable resource from their nontraditional broker competitors. In dismissing the FTC's complaint, Chief Judge McGuire ruled that the agency failed to establish an "anticompetitive effect or actionable consumer harm." Specifically, McGuire found that the evidence presented failed to demonstrate that the Realcomp website Policy: "(1) has eliminated or limited consumer choice of a desired product; (2) has excluded discount EA listings from substantial exposure on the Realcomp MLS or other public websites; (3) has unreasonably impeded the ability to discount brokers to compete in Southeastern Michigan; or (4) has forced discount brokers to exit the market or deterred
entry." "Despite the website Policy," McGuire held, "discount brokers offering EA listings have been able to market their products and compete successfully in the Realcomp Service Area, without having to labor under an unreasonable competitive disadvantage." FTC Clears Google-DoubleClick Merger Closing its eight-month investigation of the transaction, the FTC has announced that it will not intervene to block Internet search engine Google from acquiring the Internet advertising firm DoubleClick. Despite
widespread skepticism about the deal, and urgings by members of Congress (see our December 2007 issue) to proceed with caution, the Commission determined by a 4-1 vote (Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbour dissenting) that the proposed acquisition was unlikely to harm competition. In a statement written

Page 56 of 78 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
by FTC Chair Deborah Platt Majoras, the majority of the commissioners expressed their finding that there is no basis for preventing the transaction from going forward. Specifically, the majority found that Google and DoubleClick are not direct competitors in any relevant market. Google sells advertising on its website and through its ad intermediation product, AdSense. DoubleClick sells third party ad serving products, but does not buy or sell advertising. The transaction, the majority held, is therefore "not likely to cause competitive harm by eliminating significant current competition between Google and DoubleClick." The Commission found that there was no evidence suggesting that the merger would eliminate any potential competition or allow Google to leverage market power in one market to harm competition in another. Addressing concerns about online privacy raised by the merger, the majority commented that the FTC lacks authority to block the transaction on such grounds. "The sole purpose of federal antitrust review of merger and acquisitions," the majority noted "is to identify and remedy transactions that harm
competition." Travelers Settles Multistate Bid-Rigging Allegations Insurance firm Travelers Companies, Inc. has entered a consent decree with nine states and the District of Columbia, agreeing to pay US$6 million to settle claims relating to the company's involvement in a nationwide bid-rigging and price-fixing scheme in the market for commercial insurance. Attorneys general from the settling states are part of a multistate task force that is investigating the industry. The states represented on the task force include Hawaii, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Travelers and other insurers were charged with conspiring with insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. to submit artificially inflated bids where the broker had preselected the winning bidder. The scheme created the illusion that customers were selecting policies with premiums derived through competitive bidding. Travelers was also charged with paying "contingent commissions," or profit sharing commissions, in exchange for favorable treatment from brokers. Collectively, such practices resulted in higher insurance premiums paid by insurance customers including companies, nonprofit organizations and public entities. The settlement with Travelers follows similar deals reached with insurers ACE Group Holdings, Inc. in October 2007 and Zurich American Insurance Co. in December 2006. EUROPEAN UNION Commission Sends Statement Of Objection To Air Cargo  Cartel Members On December 21 the European Commission (Commission) sent a Statement of Objection to several airlines that are alleged to have participated in a cartel in the market for international air freight services. Specifically, the airlines are alleged to have agreed on levels of fuel surcharges and other fees applicable to international freight shipments. Although the Commission has not announced which carriers received
the Statement of Objection, officials at British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Scandinavia's SAS have all confirmed their involvement. A Statement of Objection is the procedural document whereby the Commission informs the parties under an antitrust investigation of the objections raised against them. Recipients are entitled to respond to the Commission's objections in writing. In addition, parties may request an oral hearing to present their defense to the charges. The Commission will then issue a decision on whether or not the parties have violated the EC antitrust rules. Commission  Fines Chloroprene Rubber Cartel The European Commission imposed fines totaling €243.2 million on six rubber manufacturers that engaged in a cartel to allocate customers and fix prices for chloroprene rubber. The companies - namely Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh - were charged with violating Article
81 of the EC Treaty, which bans cartels and restrictive business practices. The Commission found that, between 1993 and 2002, the companies agreed on market shares and set prices for chloroprene  rubber. Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic flexible  rubber used in a range of industrial products including hoses,
v-belts, diving equipment and adhesive in shoes. In assessing  fines for violations of Article 81, the Commission considers, among other things, the seriousness of the offense, the amount of affected sales and, in the case of cartels, the "combined market share, the geographic scope, and the actual implementation of the  cartel agreements." The Commission also factors in reductions of  fines for firms that cooperate with the Commission's investigation through its Leniency Program. In this case, the  fines assigned to ENI and Bayer were increased by 60 percent and 50 percent respectively because each company had previously been found by the Commission to have been involved in  cartel activities. Bayer was nevertheless granted full immunity from fines because it was the first applicant under the Commission's Leniency Program; ENI was fined €132 million without reduction. Tosoh and DuPont/Dow were granted fine reductions of 50 percent in the case of Tosoh and 25 percent in the case of DuPont/Dow. As a result, the companies were  fined €4.8 million and €108 million, respectively. The Japan-based firm Denka was  fined €47 million with no reduction. Commission Raids PVC Manufacturers
On December 12 and 13 officials from the  European Commission carried out surprise inspections at the premises of two PVC producers in the UK pursuant to Article 13 of the EC Merger Regulation. The Commission suspects that the companies concerned took steps to implement a merger before the Commission's clearance decision. The companies are alleged to have exchanged business information in violation of the EC rules concerning  cartel behavior and other restrictive business practices. MasterCard Interchange Fees Found To Violate Antitrust Rules The  European Commission has ruled that MasterCard's intra-EEA Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs) for cross-border transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and credit cards constitute a restrictive business practice in breach of Article 81 of the EC treaty. MIFs are transaction fees paid by retailers to banks that issue the payment cards. The Commission determined that the charges inflate the cost of card acceptance by retailers without benefiting consumers or leading to technical and economic efficiencies. The Commission ordered MasterCard to withdraw the MIF system within six months. Should MasterCard fail to comply with
Page 57 of 78 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
such order, the Commission can impose a daily  fine of up to 3.5 percent of MasterCard's daily global turnover during the preceding year. MasterCard has indicated that it plans to appeal the Commission's decision. Commission Improves State Aid Rules The  European Commission has amended the so-called "Implementing Regulation" establishing procedural rules for the application of the EC Treaty State Aid provisions. Among the changes to the Regulation are the introduction of additional notification forms, as well as an electronic notification system and a secure email system to be used by Member States to submit state aid notifications and subsequent correspondence with the Commission. Use of the electronic notification and email system will become mandatory as of July 1, 2008. The Commission estimates that the new notification procedures will significantly streamline its decision-making process. In addition, the
amended Regulation provides that the Commission will publish the full text of approved state aid decisions on its website. AROUND THE WORLD JAPAN - JFTC To Issue First-Ever Cease-And-Desist Order Against Foreign Companies The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has confirmed that it issued prior notices of a ceaseand- desist order against five companies alleged to have formed an international  cartel to fix prices of marine hose. The companies that received notices include Japan's Bridgestone Corporation and Yokohama Rubber Co., the UK's Dunlop Oil and Marine, France's Trelleborg Industries, a Swedish unit of Trelleborg, and Italy's Parker ITR and Manuli  Rubber Industries S.p.A. The JFTC's notices were based on findings from a joint investigation into the marine hose industry conducted with regulators from the US and European Union. Companies that receive notice of a cease-and-desist order may respond through written statements and by submitting evidence in opposition of the action threatened by the JFTC. After examining such responses the JFTC can decline further action or issue an administrative penalty. Although the JFTC has issued cease-and-desist orders against Japan-based companies, the JFTC has until now never taken such action against a foreign company. It is expected that the JFTC will subject only Bridgestone to a surcharge payment order at this time and issue only cease-and-desist orders against Bridgestone's foreign co-conspirators. The JFTC has decided to forego penalizing Yokohama  Rubber Co. because of the company's admission of guilt. JAPAN - JFTC Consults Foreign Antitrust Agencies Over Proposed Merger On December 22, 2007 the JFTC revealed that it entered into discussions with the European Commission and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to evaluate an acquisition by international mining firm BHB Billiton of rival Rio Tinto. The JFTC was concerned that the acquisition would restrain competition in Japan's market for ironstone. According to press reports, it is the first time that the JFTC has requested a consultation about a foreign merger from foreign antitrust
agencies. Under the 1998 amendment to the Antimonopoly Act of Japan, the JFTC may review corporate transactions between foreign companies and issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent transactions that would harm competition in Japan's market. In this case, the JFTC sought consultations with a foreign competition agency because there was no guarantee that the parties would comply with an order by Japan's competition authority blocking the transaction. It has been reported that the JFTC is considering similar consultations with competition agencies in Korea and Taiwan where there are significant imports of ironstone from BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. INDONESIA - State-Owned Investment Firm To Appeal
Antitrust Ruling Indonesia's state-owned investment firm Temasek Holdings has filed an appeal challenging the decision by Indonesia's Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition (KPPU), which found that the firm violated the country's antitrust laws by acquiring majority ownership in rival mobile telecommunications firms. The acquisition involved Indonesia's two largest mobile operators: PT Indosat ( Indosat) and PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel). In November 2007 a five-member panel of the KPPU found that Temasek violated the antitrust laws by indirectly holding a majority interest in both Indosat and Telkomsel through its affiliates Singapore Telecom ( SingTel) and Singapore Technologies Telemedia (Telemedia). The panel ordered Temasek to divest its interest in either Telkomsel or Indosat within two years, and further ordered each of Temasek, SingTel and Telemedia to pay US$4 million in
fines. Under Indonesia's antitrust laws, it is unlawful for an entity to hold a majority stake in more than one company within the same industry. According to Syamsul Ma'arif, head of the KPPU panel that ruled against Temasek, the company's "cross-ownership of the Telkomsel and Indosat has led to Telkomsel committing a monopolistic act and abuse of dominant position through charging excessive tariffs." The companies deny allegations of anticompetitive behavior and argue that the KPPU has misapplied the law. Telemedia and SingTel have each filed separate appeals of the KPPU's ruling. SOUTH KOREA - KFTC Investigates Foreign Luxury Car Makers The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has launched an investigation into the pricing practices of several foreign car makers. In mid-December the competition agency raided the Korean import offices of Mercedes Benz AG, BMW AG, Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division and Volkswagen AG's Audi division, as well as the Korea Automobile Imports & Distributors Association. According to a KFTC spokesperson, the car makers are being investigated for possible anticompetitive conduct that resulted in inflated prices in Korea as compared with other countries. Specifically, the agency is investigating possible coordination among the car makers to interfere with
so-called "gray market" imports. The "gray market" refers to legal imports into a territory that are not conducted or sanctioned by the manufacturer (a form of transshipping). Where there are significant price disparities between territories, distributors or dealers often engage in arbitrage between the territories. www.ssd.com The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

UNITED STATES HP and Staples Sued Over Anticompetitive Ink Cartridge Agreement Computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard Co. and office supply retailer Staples Inc. face a consumer class action lawsuit for allegedly agreeing to restrict competition in the market for laser printer ink cartridges. In December, a California resident and owner of an HP inkjet printer, Ranjit Bedi, filed a lawsuit against the companies in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Bedi claims that HP and Staples conspired to reduce competition and raise prices in the HP-compatible ink cartridge market. HP is the US market leader for both printers and replacement ink cartridges, but earns higher profits on sales of ink cartridges. The complaint states that HP and Staples violated the antitrust laws when they entered an agreement in 2006 according to which Staples ceased sales of its own brand of HP-compatible printer cartridges in exchange for monetary benefits from HP.

TD
Such benefits allegedly included more than US$100 million in "market development funds." According to the complaint, the HPStaples agreement is a horizontal agreement between direct competitors: "It reduces the output of HP-compatible cartridges, increases the price of HP-compatible cartridges, eliminates interbrand competition between Staples and HP and limits nonprice competition in the market for HPcompatible cartridges." Bedi claims that the HP-Staples agreement is illegal under the Sherman Act because it restrains trade and fixes prices. He has asked the court to certify a class of similarly situated purchasers of HP-compatible ink cartridges. He has also asked for injunctive relief, treble damages, attorneys' fees and court costs. ALJ Dismisses FTC Action Against Michigan Realtors Association Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen J. McGuire has dismissed the complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against Realcomp, a corporation servicing more than 2,100 Michigan real estate brokerage offices. Realcomp, which is owned by a group of realtor boards and associations, operates the multiple listing service (MLS) for Southeastern Michigan. The FTC alleged that by restricting certain brokers' access to the MLS and related public websites, Realcomp unreasonably restrained competition. According to the FTC's complaint, Realcomp restrained trade by blocking information about Exclusive Agency (EA) listings and listings by other nontraditional brokerage services and by preventing the dissemination of this information to public websites that are fed by the MLS. EA listings are produced by agreements whereby the broker receives a commission only if the broker locates the buyer; if the seller locates the buyer, the agent receives no commission. The complaint further alleged that brokers who adopted Realcomp's MLS rules effectively agreed to restrict the manner in which they compete. Moreover, such brokers collectively withheld a valuable resource from their nontraditional broker competitors. In dismissing the FTC's complaint, Chief Judge McGuire ruled that the agency failed to establish an "anticompetitive effect or actionable consumer harm." Specifically, McGuire found that the evidence presented failed to demonstrate that the Realcomp website Policy: "(1) has eliminated or limited consumer choice of a desired product; (2) has excluded discount EA listings from substantial exposure on the Realcomp MLS or other public websites; (3) has unreasonably impeded the ability to discount brokers to compete in Southeastern Michigan; or (4) has forced discount brokers to exit the market or deterred
entry." "Despite the website Policy," McGuire held, "discount brokers offering EA listings have been able to market their products and compete successfully in the Realcomp Service Area, without having to labor under an unreasonable competitive disadvantage." FTC Clears Google-DoubleClick Merger Closing its eight-month investigation of the transaction, the FTC has announced that it will not intervene to block Internet search engine Google from acquiring the Internet advertising firm DoubleClick. Despite
widespread skepticism about the deal, and urgings by members of Congress (see our December 2007 issue) to proceed with caution, the Commission determined by a 4-1 vote (Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbour dissenting) that the proposed acquisition was unlikely to harm competition. In a statement written

Page 60 of 78 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
by FTC Chair Deborah Platt Majoras, the majority of the commissioners expressed their finding that there is no basis for preventing the transaction from going forward. Specifically, the majority found that Google and DoubleClick are not direct competitors in any relevant market. Google sells advertising on its website and through its ad intermediation product, AdSense. DoubleClick sells third party ad serving products, but does not buy or sell advertising. The transaction, the majority held, is therefore "not likely to cause competitive harm by eliminating significant current competition between Google and DoubleClick." The Commission found that there was no evidence suggesting that the merger would eliminate any potential competition or allow Google to leverage market power in one market to harm competition in another. Addressing concerns about online privacy raised by the merger, the majority commented that the FTC lacks authority to block the transaction on such grounds. "The sole purpose of federal antitrust review of merger and acquisitions," the majority noted "is to identify and remedy transactions that harm
competition." Travelers Settles Multistate Bid-Rigging Allegations Insurance firm Travelers Companies, Inc. has entered a consent decree with nine states and the District of Columbia, agreeing to pay US$6 million to settle claims relating to the company's involvement in a nationwide bid-rigging and price-fixing scheme in the market for commercial insurance. Attorneys general from the settling states are part of a multistate task force that is investigating the industry. The states represented on the task force include Hawaii, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Travelers and other insurers were charged with conspiring with insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. to submit artificially inflated bids where the broker had preselected the winning bidder. The scheme created the illusion that customers were selecting policies with premiums derived through competitive bidding. Travelers was also charged with paying "contingent commissions," or profit sharing commissions, in exchange for favorable treatment from brokers. Collectively, such practices resulted in higher insurance premiums paid by insurance customers including companies, nonprofit organizations and public entities. The settlement with Travelers follows similar deals reached with insurers ACE Group Holdings, Inc. in October 2007 and Zurich American Insurance Co. in December 2006. EUROPEAN UNION Commission Sends Statement Of Objection To Air Cargo  Cartel Members On December 21 the European Commission (Commission) sent a Statement of Objection to several airlines that are alleged to have participated in a cartel in the market for international air freight services. Specifically, the airlines are alleged to have agreed on levels of fuel surcharges and other fees applicable to international freight shipments. Although the Commission has not announced which carriers received
the Statement of Objection, officials at British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Scandinavia's SAS have all confirmed their involvement. A Statement of Objection is the procedural document whereby the Commission informs the parties under an antitrust investigation of the objections raised against them. Recipients are entitled to respond to the Commission's objections in writing. In addition, parties may request an oral hearing to present their defense to the charges. The Commission will then issue a decision on whether or not the parties have violated the EC antitrust rules. Commission  Fines Chloroprene Rubber Cartel The European Commission imposed fines totaling €243.2 million on six rubber manufacturers that engaged in a cartel to allocate customers and fix prices for chloroprene rubber. The companies - namely Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh - were charged with violating Article
81 of the EC Treaty, which bans cartels and restrictive business practices. The Commission found that, between 1993 and 2002, the companies agreed on market shares and set prices for chloroprene  rubber. Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic flexible  rubber used in a range of industrial products including hoses,
v-belts, diving equipment and adhesive in shoes. In assessing  fines for violations of Article 81, the Commission considers, among other things, the seriousness of the offense, the amount of affected sales and, in the case of cartels, the "combined market share, the geographic scope, and the actual implementation of the  cartel agreements." The Commission also factors in reductions of  fines for firms that cooperate with the Commission's investigation through its Leniency Program. In this case, the  fines assigned to ENI and Bayer were increased by 60 percent and 50 percent respectively because each company had previously been found by the Commission to have been involved in  cartel activities. Bayer was nevertheless granted full immunity from fines because it was the first applicant under the Commission's Leniency Program; ENI was fined €132 million without reduction. Tosoh and DuPont/Dow were granted fine reductions of 50 percent in the case of Tosoh and 25 percent in the case of DuPont/Dow. As a result, the companies were  fined €4.8 million and €108 million, respectively. The Japan-based firm Denka was  fined €47 million with no reduction. Commission Raids PVC Manufacturers
On December 12 and 13 officials from the  European Commission carried out surprise inspections at the premises of two PVC producers in the UK pursuant to Article 13 of the EC Merger Regulation. The Commission suspects that the companies concerned took steps to implement a merger before the Commission's clearance decision. The companies are alleged to have exchanged business information in violation of the EC rules concerning  cartel behavior and other restrictive business practices. MasterCard Interchange Fees Found To Violate Antitrust Rules The  European Commission has ruled that MasterCard's intra-EEA Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs) for cross-border transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and credit cards constitute a restrictive business practice in breach of Article 81 of the EC treaty. MIFs are transaction fees paid by retailers to banks that issue the payment cards. The Commission determined that the charges inflate the cost of card acceptance by retailers without benefiting consumers or leading to technical and economic efficiencies. The Commission ordered MasterCard to withdraw the MIF system within six months. Should MasterCard fail to comply with

such order, the Commission can impose a daily  fine of up to 3.5 percent of MasterCard's daily global turnover during the preceding year. MasterCard has indicated that it plans to appeal the Commission's decision. Commission Improves State Aid Rules The  European Commission has amended the so-called "Implementing Regulation" establishing procedural rules for the application of the EC Treaty State Aid provisions. Among the changes to the Regulation are the introduction of additional notification forms, as well as an electronic notification system and a secure email system to be used by Member States to submit state aid notifications and subsequent correspondence with the Commission. Use of the electronic notification and email system will become mandatory as of July 1, 2008. The Commission estimates that the new notification procedures will significantly streamline its decision-making process. In addition, the
amended Regulation provides that the Commission will publish the full text of approved state aid decisions on its website. AROUND THE WORLD JAPAN - JFTC To Issue First-Ever Cease-And-Desist Order Against Foreign Companies The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has confirmed that it issued prior notices of a ceaseand- desist order against five companies alleged to have formed an international  cartel to fix prices of marine hose. The companies that received notices include Japan's Bridgestone Corporation and Yokohama Rubber Co., the UK's Dunlop Oil and Marine, France's Trelleborg Industries, a Swedish unit of Trelleborg, and Italy's Parker ITR and Manuli  Rubber Industries S.p.A. The JFTC's notices were based on findings from a joint investigation into the marine hose industry conducted with regulators from the US and European Union.

Tokyo, Jan. 30 (Jiji Press)--Japanese chemical maker Tosoh Corp. said Wednesday it has decided to pay fines of 4.8 million euros imposed by the  European Commission for allegedly forming a price-fixing  cartel for synthetic  rubber products.

Tosoh denies taking part in the  cartel, but the company said in a statement that it decided to pay the penalties to avert a prolonged court dispute with the  European Commission, the executive body of the European Union.

TD
The commission in December imposed  fines totaling 243.21 million euros on six firms, including Tosoh and another Japanese chemical maker, Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , alleging that they fixed prices for chloroprene  rubber between 1993 and 2002.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which was  fined 47 million euros, plans to file a suit against the  European     Commission's decision.

The fine imposed on Tosoh was reduced by 50 pct to 4.8 million euros due to the company's cooperation with the commission's investigations.

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Tosoh Corp. (4042) said Wednesday that it will pay a  fine of 4.8 million euro, or about 760 million yen, imposed by the  European Commission for its alleged involvement in rigging synthetic rubber prices.

Tosoh stressed that paying the  fine in full does not mean that it entirely admits to the charges. Rather, it says it made the decision after examining various factors, such as the cost of a prolonged court battle.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061), which faces a fine of 47 million euro in the same case, intends to file a complaint with the courts, denying any cartel charges.

Chloroprene rubber makers Denka, DuPont, Dow Chemical, ENI, Tosoh and Bayer have been ordered by the European Commission (EC) to pay a combined  fine of EUR 243.2 M for operating a  cartel in the European Economic Area. The EC found the companies to be guilty of market sharing and price  fixing from at least 1993-2002. The  fine imposed on Bayer, now Lanxess, has been dropped since the company volunteered information on other participants of the  cartel.

Fines totalling SKR 7.2 bn have been imposed by the  European Commission on rubber producers belonging to two different cartels. Bayer, which chose to act as whistle blower, escaped its  fine of SKR 4 bn. One cartel was involved with two types of synthetic  rubber for tyres and  fines totalling SKR 4.9 bn were imposed on Eni, Bayer, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol, and Trade-Stomil. The other ruling concerned a chloroprene rubber cartel and involved fines toalling SKR 2.3 bn for Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, Eni, and Tosoh.

The European Commission has meted a EUR 34.2 M penalty on Bayer and Zeon groups for nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) price fixing  between late 2000 and 2002. German firm Bayer received a EUR
28.87 M fine, while Japanese company Zeon was  fined EUR 5.36 M in violation of the EC Treaty's and the EEA Agreement's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices. Bayer's penalty was raised by
50% due to its participation in previous  cartel activity. The Bayer and Zeon  fines were also lowered by
30% and 20%, respectively, due to their cooperation with the investigation. NBR is chiefly employed in car
production for fuel and oil handling hoses, seals, o-rings, and water handling uses.

The companies Bayer and Zeon will have to shell out a total of €34.2 million for fixing  the price of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) between late 2000 and 2002, announced the European Commission on 23
January.

Resistant to petroleum fluids, NBR is used predominantly in the motor industry (fuel and oil handling hoses and seals, among others).

TD
The German company Bayer receives a  fine of €28.8 million and the Japanese company Zeon €5.3 million.

The fine is "relatively" low because it only involves two companies and because their collusion lasted "a relatively short time," emphasised a spokesperson. In fact, he reiterated, the Commission made its calculation based on its 2006 guidelines "adapted" to the length of the infringement.

"We can hope that we have arrived at the end of these  rubber cartels," the spokesman added, confirming that the EU executive was not carrying out other investigations in the sector "for the moment".
"Shareholders should be concerned about how much the  fines have cost them," commented Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes. She has always said that she wants to combat cartels more intensely.

Bayer and Zeon, however, benefited from a respective reduction of 30% and 20% for cooperating during the investigation, as set out in the 2002 communication on leniency.
REPEAT OFFENCES

It is the fourth  cartel in the rubber industry that Kroes has taken down in just over three years. The other fines were higher given the number of companies involved and the duration of the cartels: €519 million in November 2006 for synthetic rubber BR-ESBR particularly used in making tyres (see Europolitics 3200) and €243.2 million for chloroprene rubber (adhesives, diving equipment, condoms) in December 2007 (3428). Bayer was involved each time. The Commission nonetheless decided not to take this into account because these repeat offences "took place in a similar period of time and therefore are parallel infringements," it said in a press release.
The fine received by the German manufacturer was increased by 50% because it had been  fined for
cartel activity in the citric acid sector in a previous Commission decision, said the spokesperson.

To recall, the Commission applied guidelines, adopted in 2006, for the calculation of  fines, now based on a percentage of annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years that the infringement has lasted.

HD       Reading the runes at the ECB WC      1,039 words

It may well be harder to interpret the comments of president Jean-Claude Trichet than it was those of
Soviet leaders Brezhnev or Andropov

It's probably easier to get into the Kremlin than it is to penetrate the European Central Bank's Euro Turm (Euro Tower) in Frankfurt. Last week it took me almost a quarter of an hour to get through security after a stony-faced guard at the x-ray machine interrogated me about why I was carrying a ballpoint pen.

TD
It may even be harder to read the runes of ECB statements and of the spoken comments of its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, than it was those of Brezhnev or Andropov. The latter-day Kremlinologists are the journos who, as in the White House press room, take their jealously guarded seats each month and, in a pecking order selected by Trichet, pose a series of elliptical questions for an hour - observed by
ECB-watching economists on EBS (Europe by Satellite) or via the bank's website.

Afterwards, over coffee, water or cigarettes in the smoke-extracting cabin, they shake their heads in confusion and try to work out the line. Last week, after much tortured rumination, the Trichetologists worked it out: the ECB, far from carrying out its threat to raise interest rates to counter medium-term inflationary risks, would cut them - not in March but probably in April. Or maybe May. At the latest.
Well, if that's what Trichet intended to be his message, it wasn't - or so he says. This week has seen the
ECB president and his colleagues, including the hawkish Axel Weber of the Bundesbank, pour cold
water on such interpretations or expectations or hopes. Trichet had said nobody on the ECB's governing
council had argued for a rate rise (or cut, for that matter), he didn't say the bank was ready for
pre-emptive action to contain inflation - and he admitted that the risks to economic growth were real.

It is, as Peer Steinbrück, Germany's stern, liberal finance minister, said after the monthly meeting of EU "ecofin" ministers this week, all a matter of interpretation. Summoning in support Weber, he said he hadn't understood Trichet to be pointing to a shift in policy emphasis - and, anyway, "we need to be
careful that we don't just uncritically adopt what may be important for the US in terms of interest rate cuts and economic stimulus programmes." And he warned off the French from putting political pressure on
the ECB for a rate cut, saying they would be better advised to cut their structural deficit - as he had (masterfully) done in two years to "a big black zero" - and adopt genuine economic reforms. (His French colleague, Christine Lagarde, had gone home early thinking she'd got her government off the hook, yet again, by winning leeway to cut the deficit to zero by, well, 2012 if the economy droops; Steinbrück said, no chance, 2010 remains the target - and so did the rest of his colleagues.)

Nobody has a clue what the outcome of the next few months will be for financial markets, European economic growth or inflation. But one sure bet is that the ECB, while railing against "second-round effects" of higher prices (wage rises), will take a thoroughly pragmatic view about its own policy. If the final quarter growth stats for the eurozone are worse than predicted and its own staff come up with grim prospects next month, after the  European Commission publishes its spring forecast next week, it'll cut borrowing costs.

Political sensitivities, not external political pressure, will prompt it in this direction. The bank is, whatever the Trichet rhetoric about "needle in the compass", less fixated about inflation than is painted. Its president repeatedly points to the millions of jobs it has helped create since its inception. The prospect of it putting that record at risk and of hastening a recession everybody says is not on the cards (yet) is remote. But that's just my interpretation.

Cartel-busters raid the sweetie jar

The cartel-busters and anti-monopoly-hunters are busy across the EU these days, chasing down suspected recidivists in the dawning of liberal free competition. Recently EU and national officials raided the offices of maritime classification (CLASS) firms in the early hours of the morning and this week they descended on chip-maker Intel and retailers such as the DSG group, owners of Currys and PC World, in a long-running case. The raiders helped the EU impose a record &#8364;2bn (£1.5bn) or more in  cartel fines alone last year (money which goes to the community budget).

Some of the busted firms work in the least glamorous segments of industry like synthetic  rubber but, now, it's been confirmed that Germany's federal cartel office has raided some of the world's leading chocolate and sweetie-makers over suspected price-fixing  - including Haribo, the Bonn-based company that makes, inter alia, Gummibärs, the tiny fruit gums left in mini-packets on hotel beds across Europe.

As many as seven firms were raided last week, including Nestlé (makers of KitKat), Kraft (owners of Milka), Ferrero Rocher, Ritter (makers of the square bars) and Storck. Haribo has rejected any suggestion of price-fixing,  saying it hasn't even raised prices so far - though one of up to 3.5% may be due in May.

The German authorities appear to suspect that the firms, which all say they are co-operating, have used the increases in milk prices, driven by booming demand in emerging markets and drought, and in overall commodity costs to collude in imposing increases. The firms say they are merely acting to retain their profit margins.

But some of the price increases have been as much as 20% - and even Trichet last week pointed an accusing finger at food manufacturers, saying they were helping to drive up eurozone inflation through "price-setting" in uncompetitive markets. Maybe he could use his job-creation skills, too, by redirecting the swarms of scowling, rude security personnel towards more constructive work as dawn raiders.

HD           Japanese Watchdog  Fines Bridgestone Over Hose Cartel -Kyodo

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Japan's Fair Trade Commission said Friday it has ordered Bridgestone Corp. (BRDCY) of Japan and four foreign firms to terminate their international  cartel to fix prices and market shares for marine hoses used in oil transportation, Kyodo News reports.

It is the first time that the Japanese antimonopoly watchdog has issued  cartel termination orders to foreign firms, Kyodo said.

TD
The FTC also  fined Bridgestone Y2.38 million but did not impose  fines on the foreign firms because they have never sold marine hoses in Japan.

The FTC also found that Yokohama  Rubber Co. (5101.TO) had joined the international cartel but did not issue an order or impose a  fine as the company had admitted that it was part of the cartel.

The four foreign firms are Dunlop Oil & Marine Ltd. of the U.K., Trelleborg Industries SAS of France, and Parker ITR Srl and Manuli  Rubber Industries SpA of Italy.

Along with Yokohama  Rubber and another firm, which have both withdrawn from the marine hose business, the four companies maintained the  cartel to fix their respective market shares and prices between 1999 and 2007, and monopolized markets close to their head offices, the FTC said, according to Kyodo.

Annual global marine hose sales are estimated at Y15 billion to Y20 billion and are dominated by firms involved in the cartel.

The U.S. Justice Department arrested company executives connected to the international  cartel last May. The FTC searched the offices of Bridgestone and Yokohama  Rubber in coordination with U.S. and European authorities.

The FTC's failure to  fine the foreign firms over the marine hose  cartel contrasts with the  European    Commission's decision in January last year to impose  fines on 10 firms, including two Japanese companies, for their international  cartel to fix prices for electric power transmission equipment.

The European Commission can fine foreign firms even if they have not posted European sales if they are involved in practices to restrict competition in Europe. The Japanese FTC has no legal power to impose fines on foreign firms that have not posted sales in Japan, Kyodo said. [ 22-02-08
