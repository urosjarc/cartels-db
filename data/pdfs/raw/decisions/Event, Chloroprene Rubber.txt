Antitrust authorities of the  European Union will fine DuPont soon over price-fixing of polychloroprene rubber, according to a statement in the company's recently released 10-Q report.

In its Oct. 31 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, DuPont said it anticipates the EU will issue a decision, including the imposition of fines, possibly before the end of 2007. The company said it can't predict the size of the  fines, but it increased its reserves to cover them to
$65 million.

TD
The investigation and fines stem from actions by employees of DuPont Dow Elastomers L.L.C., the former partnership of DuPont and Dow Chemical Co. that dissolved in 2004. DuPont pleaded guilty to  price-fixing of polychloroprene rubber and was fined $84 million by U.S. authorities and
$3.82 million by Canadian antitrust officials.

DuPont said it is paying the U.S.  fine in six annual installments and has paid three of them so far. The company said it expects to recover $13 million of the anticipated EU  fine from its former partner,  Dow Chemical.
The DuPont portion of the business now operates as  DuPont Performance  Elastomers L.L.C.

German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group  Bayer AG has been spared a substantial million euro fine by the European Commission (EC) due to its relation to the  cartel for chloroprene rubber
formed by five other companies between 1993 and 2002 after agreeing to co-operate with the authorities as a main witness.

The five other  rubber producers, Italian oil and gas company  Eni, Japanese food and  fine chemicals producer Asahi Denka Co, Japanese integrated chemicals maker  Tosoh Corporation, U.S. chemical giant DuPont Co and U.S. chemical company  Dow Chemical Co., have been  fined 234.2 mln euro ($355.6 mln).  Eni alone will have to pay a  fine of 132 mln euro ($193 mln) as this is its second violation, German daily Handelsblatt reported on December 5, 2007.

TD
Bayer, which had been  fined earlier as well, could also face a high  fine in case it had not agreed to
co-operate in the investigation.  Bayer has been involved in exchanging commercial information with the
rest five companies. The six companies have allegedly been dividing the  chloroprene rubber market
and have been fixing prices in the period under question.
In November 2006, the EC  fined five leading rubber producers, including  Bayer, with 519 mln  euro
($758.9 mln) for breach of competition rules.

HD      CHEMICALS; Five major manufacturers fined $358M by E.U. for price fixing

The European Union fined chemical makers DuPont Chemical Corp.,  Dow Chemical Co.,  Eni SpA, Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. and  Tosoh Corp. a combined $358 million today for fixing the price of a type of rubber used to make a wide variety of consumer products.
The European Union said that the companies -- which acted as a  cartel between 1993 and 2002 in the
27-member bloc to sell  chloroprene rubber -- colluded on market shares and set prices.

TD
Italy-based  Eni faced the heaviest penalty of $194.6 million followed by Delaware-based  DuPont, which was ordered to pay $87.4 million, and Michigan-based  Dow, which was fined $71.8 million.
Japan-based Denka was fined $69.3 million, and Toshoh was penalized $7 million after cooperating with
E.U. investigators.

DuPont and Dow got 25 percent reductions in their  fines because they cooperated with  European
authorities. Eni's penalty was raised 60 percent because it was a repeat offender.

Germany-based manufacturer  Bayer AG avoided a $300 million fine despite being a repeat offender in the cartel because it helped blow the whistle on the whole price-fixing affair, E.U. spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts and as latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoes.
The E.U. investigation into the  cartel began in 2003 with raids at several companies.
E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said it was "particularly disappointing" that the  rubber
industry "has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels."

According to the  European Commission, which is the E.U.'s executive arm, the companies held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their "illegal agreements."
"These practices constitute very serious infringements of ... antitrust rules," the  European Commission
said (Constant Brand, AP/Houston Chronicle, Dec. 5).

Dow to cut 1,000 jobs globally

Dow Chemical announced yesterday that it will fire 1,000 workers globally and shut down a number of production facilities in an effort to cut costs and direct capital toward businesses with better growth prospects.

The job cuts mean  Dow will incur a $500 million to $600 million charge related to severance costs and asset write-downs. In the long-term, the job cuts will generate annual savings of about $180 million, the company said.

Dow was hurt recently by soaring hydrocarbon feedstock and energy costs. It has been attempting to improve its earnings through a series of joint ventures and by expanding its more profitable specialty businesses.

Brussels, Dec. 5 (Jiji Press)--The  European Commission said Wednesday it has imposed fines totaling 243.21 million euros on six firms, including Japan's Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. and Tosoh Corp. , for forming a price-fixing cartel for synthetic rubber products.
Between 1993 and 2002, the six firms held regular meetings to discuss how to carve out the market
for chloroprene rubber among themselves and fix prices in violation of the EC treaty's ban on cartels
and restrictive business practices, according to the  commission. Chloroprene rubber is used in
hoses and automobile parts.

TD
Denki Kagaku Kogyo was  fined 47 million euros. The fine imposed on Tosoh was reduced by 50 pct to 4.8 million  euros due to the company's cooperation with the comission's investigations.

Bayer AG of Germany, which reported the  cartel activity to the  commission and sought immunity, was granted full immunity.

ENI SpA of Italy was  fined the biggest amount, 132.16 million euros. The U.S. alliance of  DuPont
and Dow Chemical Co. was fined a total of 59.25 million euros.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo officials said the company will consider steps to take, including the possibility of filing an appeal with the  European Court of First Instance.

Tosoh officials said that the company will take appropriate measures after closely examining the
European Commission's decision.

BRUSSELS, Dec. 5 -- The European Commission said Wednesday it has  fined five companies including two Japanese firms -- Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. and Tosoh Corp. -- a total of 243 million euros for establishing an international  price-fixing cartel on synthetic rubber sales.

The three others  fined for infringement of the European Union competition rules are U.S. chemical giants DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co., and Italy's Eni Spa.

TD
For breaking the antitrust rules, the commission finedEni  Spa 132.2 million  euros, Denki Kagaku Kogyo 47 million euros and Tosoh 4.8 million euros. DuPont and Dow Chemical were fined a combined 59.3 million euros.

The commission, the executive body of the European Union, said the five companies coordinated the prices and shares in  Europe of synthetic rubber, which is used in a variety of products from shoes and rubber hose to industrial goods, from 1993 to 2002.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday finedBayer AG (BAYRY), Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. (4561.TO), DuPont Inc. (DD), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), ENI SpA (E) and  Tosoh Corp. (4042.TO) EUR243.2 million for fixing prices in  Europe in connection with the production of chloroprene rubber.

The companies cartel for chloroprene rubber, which is used for products such as condoms, shoe soles and diving equipment, lasted between 1993 and 2002, the  commission said.

TD
Italy's  ENI faces the highest portion of the  fine at EUR132.2 million, after the amount was increased by
60% for repeat offending.
Although  Bayer was also a repeat offender it got full immunity from  fines for blowing the whistle on the
cartel.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behavior," said the antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes.

During the almost decade of regular meetings, the  rubber producers agreed each other's market shares and set prices, also discussing specific clients, the  commission said.

In setting the  fines, the commission looked at the affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share.

Under the new fine guidelines, the commission will also hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat offenders. The fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales, and up to 30% of the specific product market in question.

(Updates with comments from the  commission's antitrust spokesman and  DuPont.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday finedBayer AG (BAYRY), Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. (4561.TO), DuPont Inc. (DD), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), Eni SpA (E) and  Tosoh Corp. (4042.TO) EUR243.2 million for fixing prices in  Europe in connection with the production of chloroprene rubber.

TD
The companies'  cartel for chloroprene rubber, which is used for products such as condoms, shoe soles and diving equipment, lasted between 1993 and 2002, the  commission said.

Italy's  Eni faces the highest portion of the fine at EUR132.2 million, after a 60% increase for repeat offending. The penalty represents the commission's largest-ever increase of a fine. Under the body's new guidelines, it can increase a  fine by 100% for habitual offenders, the commission said.
Although  Bayer was also a repeat offender it got full immunity from  fines for blowing the whistle on the
cartel.

Japan's Tosoh received a 50% reduction for cooperation and faces a EUR4.8 million  fine, while U.S. chemical companies DuPont and Dow were given a 25% reduction on the fine on their joint venture, and now face a EUR59.2 million fine. Japan's Denka faces a EUR47 million fine, with no reductions.

The fines were given in relation to the size of the  chloroprene rubber market, which in 2001 was worth some EUR160 million in  Europe.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behavior," said Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes. This was the third  cartel in the rubber sector in close sequence, said the  commission's antitrust spokesman, Jonathan Todd.

Although it is difficult to assess the exact impact of a  cartel on consumers, Todd said that, according to conservative estimates, customers would end up paying at least 10% more due to  price-fixing.

During the almost decade of regular meetings, the  rubber producers agreed each other's market shares and set prices, also discussing specific clients, the  commission said.

In setting the  fines, the commission looked at the affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share.

Under the new fine guidelines, the commission will also hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat offenders. The fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales, and up to 30% of the specific product market in question.

DuPont said it was "disappointed" with the commission's decision, feeling that the "matter has been wrongly decided." The company added that the fines relate to events prior to 2003, and that it cooperated fully in the investigation and is committed to meeting the "highest standards of ethical and legal compliance."

BRUSSELS, Belgium _ E-U regulators have slapped five companies, including  DuPont and Dow
Chemical, with a total of 358 (m) million in  fines for price-fixing.

The product in question is a type of  synthetic rubber used to make everything from transmission belts to condoms.

TD
The E-U says the companies -- from the U-S, Germany, Italy and Japan -- colluded on market shares and set prices.
Italy's  Eni SpA faced the highest  fine -- 194.6 (m) million dollars.

Chloroprene is a synthetic rubber used mainly to make hoses, transmission belts, and as latex for use in diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles.

According to the  European Commission, the companies held ``regular meetings to discuss prices and exchange sensitive commercial information.''

The European Commission has again imposed million-figure  fines on leading rubber producers. Five producers have to pay fines totalling EUR 243.2 M. As a repeat offender, Bayer was facing a higher  fine, but escaped this because it informed the competition authorities about the cartel. The biggest  fine (EUR
132 M) was imposed on ENI. The others fined were Denka, Tosoh, DuPont and Dow Chemical. The six companies had fixed prices on the chloroprene market from 1993 to 2002.

HD     EC fines five Eur243 million for chloroprene price fixing

The European Commission has fined five companies a total of Eur243.2 million ($357.5 million) for
price-fixing and market sharing  in the European chloroprene rubber sector, it said Wednesday.
The five companies involved are Germany's  Bayer, Japan's Denka, US  DuPont and Dow, Italy's  ENI and
Japan's Tosoh.

TD
The Commission said the groups participated in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in the European Economic Area (EEA) in violation of the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81).

Between 1993 and 2002, the Commission said, these companies shared the market and fixed prices for chloroprene rubber, which is used for rubber components in a range of industrial products, such as latex for the production of diving equipment, condoms and the inner soles of shoes and as adhesive.

The fine of ENI was increased by 60% as it had been  fined previously for similar behavior. The  fine of Bayer would also have been increased for the same reason, but Bayer was the first company to come forward with information about the  cartel under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice and received full immunity from  fines, the EC said.

Tosoh was fined Eur4.8 million,  DuPont Eur59.25 million, of which Eur48.675 was  Dow's fine, ENI's fine
was Eur132.16 million and Denka's was Eur47 million.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behavior"

BRUSSELS, Dec 5, 2007 (AFP) -

EU antitrust regulators said Wednesday they had  fined chemical groups DuPont, Dow, Denka, ENI and Tosoh a combined 243 million euros (358 million dollars) for running an illegal cartel in the rubber market.

TD
The European Commission accused the companies of fixing prices and carving up the market for
chloroprene rubber, used in products ranging from condoms to shoe soles and adhesives.

German chemicals group Bayer also participated in the  cartel, which ran from 1993 to 2002, and would have been fined 201 million euros for its role had it not blown the whistle.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who has made a crackdown on cartels a top priority.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," she added.

With a penalty of 132 million  euros, Italian energy group  ENI received by far the biggest  fine, which was raised by 60 percent because the company is a repeat offender.
US group DuPont received the second biggest fine with 59 million euros in penalties, followed by  Dow
with 49 million euros, Denka with 47 million euros and Tosoh with 4.8 million  euros.

The rubber cartel brought the total amount of  fines the Commission has imposed on such illegal clubs this year to more than 3.3 billion  euros, making 2007 a bumper year.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said it has fined Bayer AG, Denka Group, EI Du Pont de Nemours & Co, Dow Chemical Co, ENI and Tosoh Corp a total of 243.2 mln eur for participating in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber between 1993 and 2002.

The companies involved shared the market and fixed prices for  chloroprene rubber, which is used for rubber components in a range of industrial products such as latex for the production of diving equipment, condoms, and the inner soles of shoes and as an adhesive.

TD
The commission increased ENI's fine by 60 pct as it had already been  fined once for similar behaviour.

Bayer's fine would also have been raised if it had not come forward with information about the  cartel, it said.

Bayer AG, which was also involved in the exchange of sensitive commercial information and other  cartel activities, was spared a 201 mln eur  fine because it "helped clarify the charges" and cooperated with the investigation, a company spokesman confirmed.

HD     EU fines companies €243 million for fixing  rubber prices

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators slapped companies including  DuPont, Eni SpA, Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. and Tosoh Corp. with €243 million (US$358 million) in  fines Wednesday for fixing the price of a kind of rubber used to make everything from shoe soles to condoms.

The EU said the  cartel operated between 1993 and 2002 and that companies from the U.S., Germany, Italy and Japan colluded to agree on each others' market shares and set prices for  chloroprene rubber.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said it was "particularly disappointing" that the  rubber
industry "has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels."

Italy's  Eni SpA faced the highest  fine of €132 million (US$194.6 million), followed by  DuPont, which will pay €48.7 million (US$71.8 million) for the actions of a former joint venture with Dow Chemical called DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC. The operation was disbanded in 2005, when Dow withdrew.  DuPont was separately fined a further €10.6 million (US$15.6 million).
Japan's Denka Seiken was  fined €47 million (US$69.3 million), while  Tosoh received only a €4.8 million
(US$7 million) fine because it cooperated with EU investigators.
German chemical maker Bayer AG, while a repeat  cartel offender, was not  fined this time, EU
spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

"Bayer would have been fined some €201 million (US$296.3 million), but received full immunity, because they were the whistle-blower and brought the  cartel to the attention of the  Commission," said Todd.

DuPont and its joint venture with  Dow Chemical got 25 percent reductions in their  fines because they also cooperated.  Eni's penalty was raised 60 percent because it was a repeat offender.

Eni declined to comment.  DuPont said it was "disappointed" with the  fine.

"We feel this matter has been wrongly decided," the Delaware-based company said in a statement. Dupont said it would "evaluate the ruling and options" once the decision was forwarded to it by the EU. The company added that it had "cooperated fully" in the investigation and was "committed to meeting the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance."

Dow Chemical said in a statement from its British operations base that it was not liable for the  DuPont     Dow Elastomers fine. Under terms agreed to with  DuPont in 2005, it said,  DuPont would take care of "any potential ... antitrust liabilities" for their former joint venture, which was renamed  DuPont
Performance  Elastomers.

Neither Denka Seiken nor  Tosoh offered a comment on the  fines. Tosoh spokesman Etsuya Ikeda said the company had not yet received official notice of the  fine, and would review it carefully with its lawyers once they did.

Bayer spokesman Markus Loeber confirmed that the company had assisted the  Commission, but said he could not comment because  Bayer had also yet to receive a written statement from the EU.

"The company very much regrets the legal violations in the past," Loeber said, adding that  Bayer introduced legal compliance and corporate responsibility guidelines in 1999 and tightened them in 2004. "Violations of this corporate compliance program will not be tolerated."

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts, and as latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles. Todd said consumers and customers of the companies probably saw prices inflated by 10 percent due to the  price fixing.

According to the  European Commission, the companies held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their "illegal agreements."

Todd said the nine-year-long  cartel "was a very serious infringement of our rules," adding it was the third such price-fixing scheme uncovered in the rubber industry. The EU uncovered a  synthetic rubber        cartel in 2006 and a rubber chemicals cartel in 2005.

"These practices constitute very serious infringements of ... antitrust rules," the EU's executive arm said in a statement.
The investigation started in March 2003 with surprise raids at several of the companies.

The charges come two years after U.S. antitrust authorities levied similar charges against  DuPont Dow   Elastomers and Italy's Syndial SpA.Dow Chemical entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to pay a US$84 million (€62 million)  fine. The U.S. Department of Justice also  fined Syndial US$9 million (€6.6 million) for participating in an "international conspiracy" to fix prices from September 1999 to April 2002.
Under EU competition law, the  Commission can order companies found guilty of  price fixing  to pay
fines of up to 10 percent of their worldwide annual turnover.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators levied about $350 million in  fines against DuPont and three other chemical companies on Wednesday for fixing the price of a type of  rubber used to make shoe soles, condoms and other products.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators levied about $350 million in  fines against DuPont and three other chemical companies on Wednesday for fixing the price of a type of  rubber used to make shoe soles, condoms and other products.

The EU said the  cartel operated between 1993 and 2002 and that companies from the U.S., Germany, Italy and Japan colluded to agree on each others' market shares and set prices for  chloroprene rubber.

TD
Italy's  Eni SpA faced the highest  fine of $194.6 million, followed by U.S.-based  DuPont Co., which will pay $71.8 million for the actions of a former joint venture with Dow Chemical Co. called  DuPont Dow       Elastomers LLC. The operation was disbanded in 2005, when Dow withdrew.  DuPont was separately fined an additional $15.6 million.

Japan's Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. was  fined $69.3 million, while  Tosoh Corp. was fined only $7 million because it cooperated with EU investigators.
German chemical maker Bayer AG, while a repeat  cartel offender, was not  fined this time, EU
spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

He said Bayer could have been fined nearly $300 million, but got full immunity "because they were the whistle-blower and brought the cartel to the attention of the  Commission."

DuPont and its joint venture with  Dow Chemical got 25 percent reductions in their  fines because they also cooperated.  Eni's penalty was raised 60 percent because it was a repeat offender.

Eni declined to comment.  DuPont said it was "disappointed" with the  fine.

"We feel this matter has been wrongly decided," the Wilmington, Del.-based company said in a statement. DuPont said it would "evaluate the ruling and options" once the decision was forwarded to it by the EU. The company added that it had "cooperated fully" in the investigation and was "committed to meeting the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance."

Dow Chemical said in a statement from its British operations base that it was not liable for the  DuPont     Dow Elastomers fine. Under terms agreed to with  DuPont in 2005, it said,  DuPont would take care of "any potential ... antitrust liabilities" for their former joint venture, which was renamed  DuPont
Performance  Elastomers.

Neither Denka Seiken nor  Tosoh offered a comment on the  fines. Tosoh spokesman Etsuya Ikeda said the company had not yet received official notice of the  fine, and would review it carefully with its lawyers once they did.

Bayer spokesman Markus Loeber confirmed that the company had assisted the  Commission, but said he could not comment because  Bayer had also yet to receive a written statement from the EU.

"The company very much regrets the legal violations in the past," Loeber said, adding that  Bayer introduced legal compliance and corporate responsibility guidelines in 1999 and tightened them in 2004. "Violations of this corporate compliance program will not be tolerated."

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts, and as latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles. Todd said consumers and customers of the companies probably saw prices inflated by 10 percent due to the  price fixing.

According to the  European Commission, the companies held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their "illegal agreements."

Todd said the nine-year-long  cartel "was a very serious infringement of our rules," adding it was the third such price-fixing scheme uncovered in the rubber industry. The EU uncovered a  synthetic rubber        cartel in 2006 and a rubber chemicals cartel in 2005.

"These practices constitute very serious infringements of ... antitrust rules," the EU's executive arm said in a statement.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said it was "particularly disappointing" that the  rubber
industry "has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels."
Under EU competition law, the  Commission can order companies found guilty of  price fixing  to pay
fines of up to 10 percent of their worldwide annual sales.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -  European Union regulators slapped five companies - including  DuPont and Dow Chemical Co. - with $358 million in  fines for fixing the price of a type of  rubber used to make everything from shoe soles to condoms.

HD       EU fines chemical  giants 243.2 million euros for price fixing

BRUSSELS, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Wednesday hit six chemical companies, including U.S.  Dow Chemical and DuPont, with fines totaling 243.2 million  euros (about
357.79 million U.S. dollars) for fixing prices of a type of rubber.

The European Union (EU)'s antitrust watchdog said in a statement that the six companies operated an illegal cartel from at least 1993 to 2002 in an collusion to coordinate market prices for  chloroprene        rubber, a synthetic rubber mainly used in the rubber industry for the production of hoses, v-belts and power transmission belts, and as latex for the production of diving equipment, and condoms.

TD
Among the six companies, Italy's ENI received the heaviest fine of 132.2 million  euros, followed by DuPont and Dow, with a combined fine of 59.3 million euros. ENI's penalty was increased by 60 percent as it had been  fined previously for similar behavior.

One of the two Japanese companies Denka Seiken was  fined 47 million euros, while Tosoh received only a 4.8 million  euros' fine because it cooperated with EU investigators.

The sixth company Germany's Bayer was fully exempted since it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, although it was also a repeat  cartel offender.

Prompted by an application for immunity lodged by  Bayer, the commission started its probe with surprise inspections in March and July 2003. Investigation revealed that the six companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow-up the implementation of their illegal agreements.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behavior," the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
Two years ago,  Dow and DuPont were fined for similar offenses by the U.S. antitrust authorities. On top of the hefty  fines, the commission said any person or firm affected by the six companies'
behavior may also seek damages before the courts of the EU member states. (1 U.S. dollars = 0.68
euros)

HD      RUBBER INDUSTRY : EU SLAPS HEAVY FINE ON MEMBERS OF RUBBER CARTEL WC     426 words

Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh will be fined €243.2 million for their participation in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in Europe, announced the European Commission on 5 December. The companies shared the European market from "at least" 1993 to 2002, announced the EU executive, and set prices for  rubber used to manufacture adhesives, diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of
shoes and a wide range of industrial goods.
The Commission increased the fine for Italy's  ENI, which had already been  fined for similar activities, by
60% (€132.1 million). Germany's Bayer, also a repeat offender, was given the biggest  fine (€201 million),
but the Commission granted it full immunity because it was the first company to reveal details about the
cartel. The EU executive is entitled to grant such reductions under the 2002 rules on leniency.

TD
The Japanese firm  Tosoh (€4.8 million) and the American group DuPont-Dow  (€59.2 million) were also granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25%, respectively. DuPont, on top of an initial  fine of €10.6 million, will have to share an additional  fine of €48.7 million with Dow, with which it had a joint venture in the cartel, explained the  Commission. Japan's Denka will have to pay its full  fine of €47 million.

"The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal arrangements," explained the Commission.

This is not the first ruling against rubber producers. In November 2006, the Commission fined five companies, among them  ENI and Dow, €519 million for  cartel activities on the synthetic rubber market. Bayer, which had participated, was granted immunity for having blown the whistle.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press release. She will continue tracking down illegal concerted agreements. She recently imposed fines on cartels acting on the European markets for professional videotapes and for flat glass (see Europolitics 3423 and 3417).In this new rubber case, the  fines were decided on the basis of the 2006 guidelines on fines, which are now based on a percentage of the annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years the violation existed. The  fines are intended to better reflect the participation of the different companies concerned and the economic impact of the violation.

German chemicals group  Bayer has avoided a fine for its involvement in a rubber cartel between 1993 and 2002, as it informed the authorities of the cartel. The European Commission has imposed fines totalling 243m euros on Japanese companies Denka and Tosoh, US groups Dow Chemical and Dupont and Italian group Eni. Bayer would have received a fine of 201m euros if it had not informed the authorities of the illegal price agreements, which related to chloroprene rubber, used in the manufacture of cables and adhesives, among other products.

According to the  Commission, this is the third time that  Bayer has been involved in a cartel on the rubber market. If the company had not blown the whistle on this  cartel, it would have received a particularly high fine, as it would have been a repeat offender.

Growth in global airfreight volumes slowed in October, a sign the airline industry is facing more challenging conditions, the International Air Transport Association said. The trade group, which represents about 240 airlines globally, said freight traffic rose 3.6% in October from a year earlier, after growing 5% in September.
EU Fines Five Companies
In Rubber-Cartel Case

European regulators fined five companies on three continents 243.2 million  euros ($355 million) for fixing prices of chloroprene rubber. The European Commission fined Italy-based  Eni SpA,
U.S.-based DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. and Japan-based Denka Seiken Co. and Tosoh Corp. The cartel for chloroprene rubber lasted from 1993 to 2002, the  commission said. DuPont said it was "disappointed." Eni, Denka, Tosoh and Bayer couldn't be reached to comment.
A Judge Lets Stand
Tribe's Harrah's Claim

A federal judge has denied a motion to dismiss a $2.79 billion claim against Harrah's Entertainment Inc. by members of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York. The members seek to enforce a tribal court judgment that found Harrah's predecessor, Park Place Entertainment Corp., interfered in the
tribe's plans to build a casino in the Catskill Mountains. A legal trust fund sought to enforce the judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York this summer. Harrah's moved to dismiss the complaint. The tribal trust's lawyer, Dennis Vacco, who said he was pleased with the court's
decision, added: "The tribe deserves to have its institutions respected." Harrah's called the ruling "procedural" since it allows the Las Vegas casino operator to refile the motion in a different format. Harrah's said it continued to believe the matter had no merit.

BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Makers of chloroprene rubber on three continents were  fined 243.2 million euros ($358.6 million) by European regulators on Wednesday for carving up markets and fixing prices over a decade, the European Commission said.

The EU executive said it imposed the fines on Italy's  ENI , DuPont Co and Dow Chemical Co of the
United States, and  Tosoh Corp and Denki Kagaku Kogyo of Japan for participating in a  cartel.

Between 1993 and 2002 the companies shared the market and fixed prices for  chloroprene rubber, used in a range of industrial products including hoses, condoms and the inner soles of shoes, a Commission statement said.

ENI had its fine hiked by 60 percent for repeat offending. It will have to pay 132.16 million  euros.

Germany's Bayer AG would have faced a 201 million euro fine but instead received full immunity because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the Commission said.

DuPont was fined 59.25 million euros, of which Dow will have to pay 48.675 million  euros. Denki
Kagaku Kogyo was  fined 47 million euros and Tosoh 4.8 million euros.

The Commission said Tosoh and DuPont/Dow  were granted a reduction of their  fines for providing useful information under its leniency programme.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber capable of elastic deformation under stress and returning to its previous size without permanent deformation. (Reporting by Paul Taylor and David Lawsky, editing by Dale Hudson)

BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Makers of  chloroprene rubber on three continents were  fined 243.2 million euros ($359 million) by European regulators on Wednesday for carving up markets and fixing prices over a decade, the European Commission said.

The EU executive said it imposed the fines on Italy's  ENI MI> ,  DuPont Co and Dow Chemical Co of the United States, and  Tosoh Corp and Denki Kagaku Kogyo of Japan for participating in a  cartel.

Between 1993 and 2002 the companies shared the market and fixed prices for  chloroprene rubber, used in a range of industrial products including hoses, condoms and the inner soles of shoes, a Commission statement said.

ENI had its fine hiked by 60 percent for repeat offending. It will have to pay 132.16 million  euros.

Germany's  Bayer AG would have faced a 201 million euro fine but instead received full immunity because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the Commission said.

DuPont was fined 59.25 million euros, of which the  Commission said Dow would have to pay 48.68 million euros.

However, Dow said in a statement that DuPont had agreed three years ago to pay any such costs relating to their former joint venture, DuPont Dow Elastomers (DDE), which manufactured chloroprene rubber.

"As announced between  DuPont and Dow in 2004, DuPont agreed to fund 100 percent of any potential DDE antitrust liabilities and costs up to $150 million, with DuPont also funding more than 75 percent of the excess, if any. Consequently,  Dow's share of this fine against DuPont is not material as to  Dow," it said.

DuPont criticised the EU executive's decision and said it would consider its options after studying the details.

"We are disappointed with today's  European Commission announcement relative to fining the parent company, DuPont, in the ongoing investigation into alleged violations of EU competition law ... We feel this matter has been wrongly decided," a company statement said.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo was  fined 47 million euros and Tosoh 4.8 million euros.

The Commission said Tosoh and DuPont/Dow  were granted a reduction of their  fines for providing useful information under its leniency programme.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels. I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Bayer said it regretted the violations of the past and had taken steps to change course, introducing globally binding policies in 1999, which it tightened in 2004.

"Violations of this corporate compliance programme will not be tolerated," the company said in a statement.

The Wall Street Journal reported that  European regulators fined five companies on three continents EUR 243.2 million ($359 million) for fixing prices of chloroprene rubber. The European Commission   fined Italy-based  Eni S.p.A., U.S.-based DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company and Japan-based Denka Seiken Co. and  Tosoh Corp. The cartel for chloroprene rubber, which is used for products such as condoms, shoe soles and diving equipment, lasted from 1993 to 2002, according to the  commission, the European Union's executive arm. During the near decade of regular meetings, the companies colluded to agree on each others' market shares and set prices for chloroprene rubber, discussing specific clients, the  commission said. Eni S.p.A. faces the highest fine, EUR 132.2 million, after a 60% increase for repeat offending. U.S. chemical companies  DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company,
which operated a joint venture, were given a 25% reduction for cooperating with the  commission and now face a fine of EUR 59.2 million.

HD     EU fines Eni, DuPont, others $358M in chemical  cartel case; Companies  accused of fixing  price of synthetic used in shoe soles, condoms

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS -  Eni SpA, Italy's largest oil company, a joint venture of  Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co., and two rivals were fined a total of $358 million U.S. by  European Union regulators for fixing the price of a synthetic rubber used to make diving equipment, shoe soles and condoms.

TD
The European Commission's actions against Eni, DuPont, Dow, Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK and  Tosoh Corp. marked the third time in two years the commission has fined companies in rubber chemical cartels.
"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons," EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour."

Bayer AG, Germany's largest drugmaker, was given full immunity from a $295-million  fine in the case because it told the commission about the  cartel. The Brussels-based  commission has levied a record
$4.84 billion in penalties in cartel cases this year in industries ranging from glass to beer.

The EU said the chemical companies conspired to fix the price of  chloroprene rubber, which is used to make latex rubber, from at least 1993 to 2002. The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive information and to talk about specific clients, the EU said.

Under revised guidelines on fines, the commission can double penalties for repeat offenders. Companies can appeal commission decisions to European courts in Luxembourg.
In yesterday's case,  Eni's fine was increased by 60 per cent because it was a repeat offender, the
commission said.

The commission's first case against chemical companies for fixing the price of  rubber chemicals was in December 2005. Bayer, Chemtura Corp. and a unit of Repsol Quimica SA were penalized for operating a cartel in a chemical used to make tires. In the second case, the  commission fined Dow and four competitors a total of $762 million in 2006.

Bayer "very much regrets the violation of laws in the past," company spokesman Markus Loeber said in an e-mailed statement.  Bayer passed guidelines in 1999 and tightened them in 2004, Mr. Loeber added, saying that the company doesn't tolerate any violations of its rules.

Several European companies, including Degussa AG and  Bayer, have taken advantage of the EU leniency program to win reductions in  fines. The first company that discloses  cartel activity can receive full immunity.

In March, the  commission charged the chemical makers, including  DuPont and Dow's DuPont Dow      Elastomers LLC joint venture, with breaking antitrust rules.

DuPont spokeswoman Cathleen Branciarol said in an e-mail that the company co-operated fully with the investigation and was "disappointed" with the  fine.

HD        EU fines DuPont, 3 others for running rubber cartel

The Associated Press

BRUSSELS, Belgium -  European Union regulators levied about $350 million in fines against DuPont and three other chemical companies Wednesday for fixing the price of a type of rubber used to make shoe soles, condoms and other products.

TD
The EU said the  cartel operated between 1993 and 2002 and that companies from the United States, Germany, Italy and Japan colluded to agree on each others' market shares and set prices for chloroprene rubber.

Italy's  Eni SpA faced the highest  fine of $194.6 million, followed by U.S.-based  DuPont Co., which will pay $71.8 million for the actions of a former joint venture with Dow Chemical Co. called  DuPont Dow   Elastomers LLC. The operation was disbanded in 2005, when Dow withdrew.  DuPont was separately fined an additional $15.6 million.

Japan's Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. was  fined $69.3 million, while  Tosoh Corp. was fined only $7 million because it cooperated with EU investigators.
German chemical maker Bayer AG, while a repeat  cartel offender, was not  fined this time, EU
spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

He said Bayer could have been fined nearly $300 million, but got full immunity "because they were the whistle-blower and brought the cartel to the attention of the  commission."

DuPont and its joint venture with  Dow Chemical got 25 percent reductions in their  fines because they also cooperated.  Eni's penalty was raised 60 percent because it was a repeat offender.

Eni declined to comment.  DuPont said it was "disappointed" with the  fine.

"We feel this matter has been wrongly decided," the Wilmington, Del.-based company said in a statement.  DuPont said it would "evaluate the ruling and options" once the decision was forwarded to it by the EU. The company added that it had "cooperated fully" in the investigation and was "committed to meeting the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance."

Dow Chemical, which announced plans Tuesday to cut 150 high-paying research and development posts at its plant in South Charleston, W.Va., said in a statement from its British operations base it was not liable for the  DuPont Dow Elastomers fine.

Under terms agreed to with  DuPont in 2005, it said,  DuPont would take care of "any potential ... antitrust liabilities" for their former joint venture, which was renamed  DuPont Performance  Elastomers.

Neither Denka Seiken nor  Tosoh offered a comment on the  fines. Tosoh spokesman Etsuya Ikeda said the company had not yet received official notice of the  fine and would review it carefully with its lawyers once they did.

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts, and as
latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles. Todd said consumers and customers of
the companies probably saw prices inflated by 10 percent because of the  price fixing.

According to the  European Commission, the companies held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their "illegal agreements."

Todd said the nine-year-long  cartel "was a very serious infringement of our rules," adding it was the third such price-fixing scheme uncovered in the rubber industry. The EU uncovered a  synthetic         rubber cartel in 2006 and a rubber chemicals cartel in 2005.

HD        Brussels fines chemical  cartel Euros 243m. BY        By NIKKI TAIT

Half a dozen multinational chemicals groups were yesterday hit with a Euros 243.2m (Dollars 357m) fine for running a nine-year  cartel in Europe's market for chloroprene rubber, which is used in a variety of products from diving equipment to condoms and footwear.
The biggest single  fine is a Euros 132.2m penalty levied on  Eni, Italy's leading oil and gas company.

TD
European Commission officials said the  fine had been increased by a record 60 per cent because the company had been penalised before for similar  price-fixing behaviour.

Under new fining guidelines, which came into force recently and which have been used in only two previous cases, repeat offenders can see their  fines increased by up to 100 per cent.
Under old guidelines, the maximum increase was 50 per cent.

Germany's  Bayer would have suffered a similar fate, but it was the first company to come forward with information on the  cartel, which lasted from 1993 to 2002. It was granted immunity from any  fine under the Commission's leniency arrangements.
Two big US companies -  DuPont and Dow - were also granted reductions of 25 per cent in their  fines
because of their co-operation.
They were ordered to pay  Euros 59.2m and Euros 48.7m respectively.

Tosoh of Japan saw a 50 per cent reduction in its penalty for similar reasons, and was  fined Euros
4.8m.
However, Japan's Denka saw no reduction and faces a  Euros 47m penalty.

The six companies accounted for almost all of the  European market for chloroprene rubber, which was worth about  Euros 160m in 2001.

According to  Commission officials, employees of the companies in question met regularly to discuss prices and specific clients, but used fairly unsophisticated methods - concealing corporate identities by simple codenames.

Lawyers have warned that, under the new fining guidelines,  price-fixing penalties are likely to be particularly severe where large markets or longrunning arrangements are involved.

This is because the new guidelines link  fines more directly to the sales in the manipulated market and the period over which the  cartel persists.

Five leading chemical groups have been hit with fines totalling EUR243.21m (US$353.9m) by the
European Commission for taking part in a cartel for chloroprene rubber.

Bayer from Germany, DuPont/Dow  from the US,  ENI from Italy and  Tosoh and Denka from Japan participated in the illegal cartel from 1993 to 2002, the  Commission said.

TD
The companies “shared the market and fixed prices” for the  rubber, which is used in the inner soles of shoes, among other industrial uses.

ENI was particularly hard-hit, seeing its  fine increased 60% to EUR132.16m because of previous  fines
for similar offences.

Bayer would have seen its  fine increased 50% to EUR201m for the same reason, but was exempted
from all fines as it had been the first company to come forward and tell the Commission about the cartel.

Tosoh saw its fine halved to EUR4.8m because of its co-operation in the investigation, while
DuPont/Dow  had a 25% reduction to EUR59.25m for the same reason.
Denka was fined EUR47m with no reduction.

The Commission said the companies had held regular meetings from 1993 to 2002, discussing prices, exchanging sensitive information, discussing clients and following up the implementation of previous illegal agreements.

“It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels,” said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. “I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour.”

Brussels, 05/12/2007 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has imposed a total of €243 210
000 fines on the Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh groups for participating in a  cartel for
chloroprene rubber in the European Economic Area (EEA) in violation of the EC Treaty (Article 81).
Between 1993 and 2002, these companies shared a market worth €160 million, and in 2001 fixed the
prices for chloroprene rubber. This product is used as an adhesive, such as latex for the production of
diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of shoes and  rubber components in a range of industrial
products. The  fine of ENI was increased by 60% as the companies had been fined previously for similar
behaviour in 1986 and 1994. The cooperation of three groups under the Commission's leniency
programme was rewarded.

Bayer (although a repeat offender) was granted full immunity and  Tosoh and DuPont/Dow  were granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25% respectively. (C.D.)

HD     EU Fines Italian Eni 132.1 Mln Euro Over Rubber Cartel

(ANSA) - Brussels, December 6 - The European Commission imposed to Italian oil and gas giant  Eni SpA a fine of 132.1 mln euro ($193.2 mln) for forming a rubber cartel with another five groups in order to control the prices on the rubber market.
The fines were imposed by the European Commission on the rubber producers for violating the EU
antitrust regulation between 1993 and 2002.

TD
The EC increased the sanctions of  Eni by 60 pct because the company had been  fined before for  cartel
activity.

The total amount of  fines imposed by the EU on all participants in the  cartel is 243.2 ($355.6 mln). Apart from Eni, the companies that were sanctioned are Japanese Tosh with 4.8 mln  euro ($7.0 mln) and Denka with 47 mln euro ($68.7 mln), US DuPont with 19.7 mln  euro ($28.8 mln) and US  Dow with 16.2 mln ($23.7 mln). Dow was previously part of DuPont.

Germany's  Bayer would have been fined 201 mln euro ($294 mln), but saw its  fine abolished because it had collaborated in the EU inquiry into the  cartel. (ANSA).

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators slapped companies including  DuPont, Eni SpA, Denka Seiken Co. Ltd. and Tosoh Corp. with €243 million (US$358 million) in  fines for fixing the price of a kind of rubber used to make everything from shoe soles to condoms.

The EU said Wednesday the  cartel operated between 1993 and 2002 and that companies from the U.S., Germany, Italy and Japan colluded to agree on each others' market shares and set prices for chloroprene rubber.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said it was "particularly disappointing" that the  rubber
industry "has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels."

Italy's  Eni SpA faced the highest  fine of €132 million (US$194.6 million), followed by  DuPont, which will pay €48.7 million (US$71.8 million) for the actions of a former joint venture with Dow Chemical called DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC. The operation was disbanded in 2005, when Dow withdrew.  DuPont was separately fined a further €10.6 million (US$15.6 million).
Japan's Denka Seiken was  fined €47 million (US$69.3 million), while  Tosoh received only a €4.8 million
(US$7 million) fine because it cooperated with EU investigators.
German chemical maker Bayer AG, while a repeat  cartel offender, was not  fined this time, EU
spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

"Bayer would have been fined some €201 million (US$296.3 million), but received full immunity, because they were the whistle-blower and brought the  cartel to the attention of the  Commission," said Todd.

DuPont and its joint venture with  Dow Chemical got 25 percent reductions in their  fines because they also cooperated.  Eni's penalty was raised 60 percent because it was a repeat offender.

Eni declined to comment.  DuPont said it was "disappointed" with the  fine.

"We feel this matter has been wrongly decided," the Delaware-based company said in a statement. Dupont said it would "evaluate the ruling and options" once the decision was forwarded to it by the EU. The company added that it had "cooperated fully" in the investigation and was "committed to meeting the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance."

Dow Chemical said in a statement from its British operations base that it was not liable for the  DuPont     Dow Elastomers fine. Under terms agreed to with  DuPont in 2005, it said,  DuPont would take care of "any potential ... antitrust liabilities" for their former joint venture, which was renamed  DuPont
Performance  Elastomers.

Neither Denka Seiken nor  Tosoh offered a comment on the  fines. Tosoh spokesman Etsuya Ikeda said the company had not yet received official notice of the  fine, and would review it carefully with its lawyers once they did.

Bayer spokesman Markus Loeber confirmed that the company had assisted the  Commission, but said he could not comment because  Bayer had also yet to receive a written statement from the EU.

"The company very much regrets the legal violations in the past," Loeber said, adding that  Bayer introduced legal compliance and corporate responsibility guidelines in 1999 and tightened them in 2004. "Violations of this corporate compliance program will not be tolerated."

Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts, and as latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles. Todd said consumers and customers of the companies probably saw prices inflated by 10 percent due to the  price fixing.

According to the  European Commission, the companies held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their "illegal agreements."

Todd said the nine-year-long  cartel "was a very serious infringement of our rules," adding it was the third such price-fixing scheme uncovered in the rubber industry. The EU uncovered a  synthetic rubber        cartel in 2006 and a rubber chemicals cartel in 2005.

"These practices constitute very serious infringements of ... antitrust rules," the EU's executive arm said in a statement.
The investigation started in March 2003 with surprise raids at several of the companies.

The charges come two years after U.S. antitrust authorities levied similar charges against  DuPont Dow   Elastomers and Italy's Syndial SpA.Dow Chemical entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to pay a US$84 million (€62 million)  fine. The U.S. Department of Justice also  fined Syndial US$9 million (€6.6 million) for participating in an "international conspiracy" to fix prices from September 1999 to April 2002.
Under EU competition law, the  Commission can order companies found guilty of  price fixing  to pay
fines of up to 10 percent of their worldwide annual turnover.

Makers of chloroprene rubber were fined 243.2 million euros, or about $360.8 million (Canadian), by European regulators yesterday for fixing prices over a decade, the  European Commission said.
Italy's  ENI, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. and Dow Chemical Co. of the United States, and  Tosoh
Corp. and Kanto Denka Kogyo Co. of Japan were fined for creating a cartel. Between 1993 and
2002 the companies shared the market and fixed prices for chloroprene rubber, used in a range of
products including hoses, condoms and the inner soles of shoes.

Germany's  Bayer AG would have faced a 201-million  euro fine, but it received immunity after it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

The European Union yesterday fined Italian oil and energy giant  Eni 132.16m euros for its part in a
price-fixing cartel for chloroprene rubber that ran from 1993 to 2002, involving five  rubber producers.

The total  fine was 243.2m euros, with the rest being spread between Tosoh, DuPont, Dow and Denka. Eni's punishment was the most severe, according to Competition Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd, because it had been found guilty of similar practices on two previous occasions. Although involved in the cartel, Germany's  Bayer was exempted because it was the first to provide Brussels with
information on the scam. The Italian company said that it would appeal, adding that the charges relate to a period before the arrival of current CEO Paolo Scaroni, who has introduced strict antitrust compliance measures.

The EU Commission has fined four producers of chloroprene rubber a total of €243.21 million ($356 million) for price-fixing offenses across the European Economic Area (EEA) over a 10-year period to 2002.

Italy's  Eni must pay €132.2 million, including a 60% surcharge reflecting past offenses. DuPont and Japanese firms Denka and Tosoh were also fined. Part of DuPont's fine is charged to Dow Chemicals. A fifth company, Bayer, would have been fined €201 million but blew the whistle, so was excused.

TD
Chloroprene rubber is used for components in a range of industrial products -- as latex for the production of diving equipment, condoms and the inner soles of shoes, and as adhesive.

Only last week,  Eni's appeal against a €117 million  fine over rigged jet fuel pricing was thrown out by an Italian court (IOD Dec.4,p8). A year ago, Eni was among five firms  fined for a separate
price-fixing cartel on sales of synthetic rubber used in car tires, sports goods and floor coverings
(IOD Nov.30'06,p8).

HD        More Firms Taking EU To Court Over Huge Cartel Fines

BRUSSELS (Nikkei)--A growing number of companies that have been slapped with  fines by the European Union for price-fixing are taking their cases before the  European Court of Justice to object to those decisions.

According to European Commission spokesperson Jonathan Todd, many penalized firms are lining up to take the commission to court.

TD
The reason for this trend is the sharp rise in the amount of fines being imposed as the European
Commission cracks down on cartels. In 2005, the average fine was about 17 million euros, or roughly
2.76 billion yen, per firm, but this figure climbed to about 39 million  euros the following year. This year,
the total has exceeded 3.3 billion  euros, and the per-company average has ballooned to about 74
million euros.

Many Japanese firms' sales in  Europe are small compared with their tallies in North America and Asia. In the case of the YKK Corp. group, the figure for  Europe, the Middle East and Africa combined is less than a 10th of its consolidated worldwide sales. Such discrepancies are stirring up deep discontent over the European Commission's policy of setting  fines based on global sales.

According to the European Court of Justice, five Japanese businesses have filed suits against the European Commission this year over cartel fines, including Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) and Toshiba Corp. (6502). Huge  fines had been imposed on each of these firms for fixing the prices of transmission facilities used by utilities. Although the European Commission determined that the companies had engaged in cartel activities in dividing up the market with European businesses, the Japanese firms claim this is untrue because they do not even sell transmission facilities in  Europe.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061), which was ordered to pay a  fine for fixing the price of  synthetic          rubber, noted in a statement Wednesday that it will deal with the situation, including possibly bringing the matter to court.

In the European Commission's view, stiff  fines help prevent antitrust violations. Japanese companies doing business in Europe will likely continue to face tough penalties and court battles over this tough stance.

China will give subsidies to oil refiners to help offset the gap between high international crude oil prices and controlled domestic fuel prices, state media reported.

The companies will receive rebates and will be exempt from paying oil import duties, the official New China News Agency reported, citing the National Development and Reform  Commission. The report gave no dollar figure for the subsidies, which are intended to help entice state-owned refiners to raise output.
Unrest in Nigeria Stalls Oil Production

Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, halted about 900,000 barrels a day of crude output as a result of unrest in the Niger Delta and oilfield closures, the nation's minister of state for petroleum said. The figure includes about 500,000 barrels a day shut in by militant attacks in the Niger Delta.

Five chemicals companies have been penalized a combined EUR 243 M by the European Commission (EC) for their alleged involvement in a price fixing  cartel for chloroprene rubber. Italian firm ENI has been hit the most, taking the bulk of the fine at EUR 132 M for being a repeat offender. DuPont and Dow, which were previously partners in a jv, were ordered to pay EUR 59 M and EUR 49 M, respectively. The penalties of the USA-based companies, together with Japanese firm  Tosoh, which was fined EUR 5 M, were reduced because of an EC leniency programme. Denka, however, was imposed a full penalty of
EUR 47 M. Germany's  Bayer also participated in the  cartel, but was not  fined since it assisted in the
commission's investigation.

• CONSUMER PROTECTION

ORLANDO, FLA. (AP) -- A Florida state jury has ordered consumer-credit reporting agency Equifax Inc. to pay nearly $3 million in the case of a woman who said the company ruined her credit in an identity mix-up.

TD
Angela P. Williams said she spent more than a decade trying to get the company to fix the error. The jury decided that Atlanta-based Equifax must pay her $219,000 in actual damages and $2.7 million in punitive damages for negligent violation of federal credit reporting laws. Williams claimed Equifax repeatedly confused her with someone who had a similar name but had debt problems.
• EMPLOYER LIABILITY

CLEVELAND (AP) -- An Ohio federal jury has awarded $17 million to a welder who claimed he got sick from inhaled fumes.

This is a rare victory for welders who say companies that made the welding products gave them little warning about the dangers of inhaling the fumes. Welding companies had won 16 of 17 of such cases. Jurors found that Lincoln Electric Holdings Inc. and four other companies showed negligence by not warning Jeff Tamraz of the toxicity of manganese in their products.
• PERSONAL INJURY

MIAMI -- A Florida state jury has found Report Investment Corp., a property ownership firm, liable for the medical expenses and lost earnings of Sami Barrak, a waiter aboard a SeaEscape cruise ship, and awarded him $102.7 million.

Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Report Investment owns the parking lot adjacent to recently sold Tootsie's Cabaret, a strip club Barrak visited with a friend. While Barrak sat alone in the driver's seat of his car, an unidentified man approached Barrak, screamed something at him and shot him in the neck while trying to rob him. The assailant escaped and was never caught.

Barrak now lives on a ventilator in Tunisia and is a quadriplegic. He sued Report Investments and Tootsie's, alleging that the firm had negligently maintained an unsafe environment by not keeping the mall's parking lot safe at night.
• REGULATORY ACTION

BRUSSELS (AP) -- European Union (E.U.) regulators slapped five companies -- including E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. and Dow Chemical Co. -- with $358 million in  fines for fixing the price of a type of  rubber used to make everything from shoe soles to condoms.

The E.U. said the cartel colluded on market shares and set prices for  chloroprene rubber. Chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber mainly used to make hoses, transmission belts, and as latex used to make diving equipment, condoms and shoe soles. According to the  European Commission, the companies

held "regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information" and to review their
"illegal agreements."
• SECURITIES

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former United Health CEO William McGuire agreed last week to give back hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options tainted in a backdating scandal.

McGuire agreed to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange  Commission valued at $468 million, including giving back $320 million in stock options. He had already agreed to reprice some stock options, reducing their value by another $200 million. That and a $7 million civil penalty was enough to get the
SEC to settle with him. But the SEC said its probe of the company is continuing, as is a review by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
• SEX ABUSE

DES MOINES, IOWA (AP) -- The Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport, Iowa, has agreed to pay $37 million to more than 150 sex abuse victims under a settlement that requires the bishop to apologize personally to any accusers or relatives who ask.

The deal will address the claims of 156 victims of sex abuse who have come forward. The agreement completes a necessary step for the Davenport diocese, which filed for bankruptcy last year.
• WRONGFUL DEATH

PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona state jury determined that Swift Transportation Co. must pay $36.5 million to the family of a man killed in an April 2004 traffic accident.

Kevin Jones, the driver of a Swift rig, was going 65 mph, drove across three sets of rumble strips designed to warn of an approaching stop sign, ran the stop sign, and crashed into Thomas Steven's car, killing him. Swift failed to produce driver logs the company was required to keep under federal regulations. The logs may have shed light on whether the Swift driver was fatigued.

On 5 Dec 2005 the  European Commission fined 6 chloroprene rubber producers a total EUR 243.2 M for price fixing  between 1993 and 2002. The original article lists the individual fines, with comments. The companies are DuPont, Dow, Denka, Tosoh, Bayer and ENI. According to the Commission, other companies may have been involved, and it is disappointing that the rubber industry seems not to be
taking notice of the ban on price agreements.  Fines for price fixing  were imposed earlier, including one in Nov 2006, on some of the same producers.

BRUSSELS - A growing number of companies that have been slapped with  fines by the EU for fixing prices are appealing their cases before the  European Court of Justice.

According to European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd, many penalized firms are lining up to take the commission to court.

TD
The reason for this trend is the sharp rise in the severity of fines being imposed as the European
Commission cracks down on cartels. In 2005, the average fine was about 17 million euros per firm,
but the figure climbed to about 39 million  euros the following year. This year, the total has exceeded 3.3
billion euros, and the per-company average has ballooned to about 74 million  euros.

Many Japanese firms' sales in  Europe are small compared with their tallies in North America and Asia. In the case of the YKK group, the figure for  Europe, the Middle East and Africa combined is less than one-tenth of its consolidated worldwide sales. Such discrepancies are stirring up deep discontent over the European Commission's policy of setting  fines based on global sales.

According to the European Court of Justice, five Japanese businesses have filed suits against the European Commission this year over cartel fines, including Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Toshiba Corp. Huge fines had been imposed on each of these firms for fixing the prices of transmission facilities used by utilities. Although the commission determined that the companies had engaged in  cartel activities in dividing up the market with European businesses, the Japanese firms claim this is untrue because they do not even sell transmission facilities in  Europe.

Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK, which was ordered to pay a  fine for fixing the price of  synthetic rubber, announced in a statement Dec. 5 that it will deal with the situation, including possibly bringing the matter to court.

Still, in the European Commission's view, heavy  fines help prevent antitrust violations. Japanese companies doing business in Europe could continue to face tough penalties and court battles as a result of this tough stance.

a combined fine of EUR 243.2 M ($357 M). Bayer's EUR 201 M was cancelled because it was the first

The European Commission has inflicted a 243.5mn  euro fine on Eni, on US firms DuPont and Dow Chemical, and the Japanese firms Tosoh and Kanto Denka for having created a cartel in the chloroprene synthetic rubber field. Eni's share of the  fine is 132.15mn. EU antitrust authorities affirm that between 1993 and 2002 the companies split up the market and agreed on  chloroprene prices; chloroprene is used in making rubber pipes and shoe soles.  Eni's fine was increased 60% because it was judged guilty of an analogous violation on another occasion. In fact, almost a year ago, the company was fined 272mn euros for a cartel in the synthetic rubber field along with  Bayer, Shell,  Dow,
Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil. Bayer would also have been fined this latest time, but in exchange for its willingness to collaborate with the authorities it got immunity.

Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh will be fined €243.2 million for their participation in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in Europe, announced the European Commission on 5 December. The companies shared the European market from "at least" 1993 to 2002, announced the EU executive, and set prices for  rubber used to manufacture adhesives, diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of
shoes and a wide range of industrial goods.
The Commission increased the fine for Italy's  ENI, which had already been  fined for similar activities, by
60% (€132.1 million). Germany's Bayer, also a repeat offender, was given the biggest  fine (€201 million),
but the Commission granted it full immunity because it was the first company to reveal details about the
cartel. The EU executive is entitled to grant such reductions under the 2002 rules on leniency.

TD
The Japanese firm  Tosoh (€4.8 million) and the American group DuPont-Dow  (€59.2 million) were also granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25%, respectively. DuPont, on top of an initial  fine of €10.6 million, will have to share an additional  fine of €48.7 million with Dow, with which it had a joint venture in the cartel, explained the  Commission. Japan's Denka will have to pay its full  fine of €47 million.

"The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal arrangements," explained the Commission.

This is not the first ruling against rubber producers. In November 2006, the Commission fined five companies, among them  ENI and Dow, €519 million for  cartel activities on the synthetic rubber market. Bayer, which had participated, was granted immunity for having blown the whistle.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press release. She will continue tracking down illegal concerted agreements. She recently imposed  fines on cartels acting on the European markets for professional videotapes and for flat glass.In this new  rubber case, the fines were decided on the basis of the 2006 guidelines on  fines, which are now based on a percentage of the annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years the violation existed. The  fines are intended to better reflect the participation of the different companies concerned and the economic impact of the violation.

The European Commission has fined producers of chloroprene rubber more than $354 million for participating in market sharing  and price fixing.

Denka Seiken Co.,  DuPont, Dow Chemical Co., ENI S.p.A. and Tosoh Group were fined various amounts for participating in a cartel for chloroprene rubber in the European Economic Area in violation of the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.

TD
Bayer (now Lanxess A.G.) itself would have been  fined $295 million but received full immunity when it was the first company to come forward with information about the  cartel under the EC's
2002 Leniency Notice.

ENI received the biggest  fine, about $195 million, which included a 60-percent penalty because it had been fined previously for anti-competitive activities, notably in EPDM.

DuPont was fined about $87 million, which included a 25-percent reduction because of the firm's cooperation. The bulk of that  fine will be paid by Dow Chemical, DuPont's former partner in DuPont Dow Elastomers.

Denka in Japan was fined about $69 million, while Japan's  Tosoh was hit with a $7 million  fine, which included a 50-percent reduction for the firm's cooperation.

"It is particularly disappointing that the  rubber industry has still not learned its lessons about avoiding cartels," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement announcing the fines. "I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behavior."

The commission said that from at least 1993 to 2002, the producers of  chloroprene rubber operated a cartel in which they agreed on each other's market shares and set prices. The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal agreements.

The investigation started with surprise inspections in March and July 2003, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by  Bayer.

The EC noted that anyone who may have suffered because of the  cartel's action can sue the participating companies for damages.
