BRUSSELS -- The European Commission's antitrust chief Mario Monti is expected to  fine four of
Germany's biggest banks for repeatedly refusing to lower their  euro-conversion rates.

Dresdner Bank AG, Commerzbank AG, HVB Group and Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG probably will be declared guilty today of fixing  conversion rates for euro-zone currencies in violation of the European ban on cartel agreements, according people familiar with the matter. These people said the fines
could run into the double-digit millions of  euros. Mr. Monti's spokeswoman declined to comment.

TD
In August 2000, the  commission announced that warnings had been sent to a long list of  banks, singling out Commerzbank, Dresdner and Fortis NV's unit GWK Bank NV, following similar warnings to banks in Belgium, Finland, Portugal and Ireland. The commission launched its antitrust suit in seven European countries last April. Most of the suits have since been dropped, as the  banks involved agreed to lower their rates. But investigations are continuing in  Germany and Austria.
Now, two weeks before the introduction of the  euro, German banks are still clinging to their fee of 3%
of exchanged amounts, arguing that administrative costs have to be passed on to customers.
"The charge of price-fixing is absolutely absurd. We'll take this matter to the  European Court of
Justice if the  European Commission fines us," said an HVB spokeswoman.

"Banks are free to set the level of  charges for exchanging currencies, but they cannot get together to fix those charges," Mr. Monti said. "This would be an infringement of competition rules which would be severely punished if it appeared that consumers had lost out as a result."

Mr. Monti also confirmed that a decision on tax breaks for Italian banks, which Italy has suspended due to the investigation, would also be made today at a commission meeting.

HD         EUROPE: German banks fined over charges

The European Commission yesterday fined five German banks a total of  Euros 100.8m (Pounds
63m) for fixing charges for exchanging eurozone currencies - its fourth decision against a  cartel in a
month.

The Brussels authorities levied a penalty of Euros 28m each on Commerzbank, Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Hypo und Vereinsbank, a Euros 14m fine on Deutsche Verkehrsbank and Euros 2.8m on Vereins und Westbank.

TD
The Commission's investigation found the  banks conspired to fix  charges on the exchange of the 12 eurozone currencies in 1997 in an attempt to recover some fees they would have lost with the introduction of the euro.

Mario Monti, the  European competition commissioner, said the  banks' behaviour had been "outrageous since it caused harm to consumers in  Germany and it may have damaged confidence in the single currency".

HVB Group,  Germany's second biggest bank, and Commerzbank, the third largest listed  bank, said they would appeal against the Commission fine. Commerzbank denied it had ever taken part in an agreement with other  banks and said the fine was completely unjustified. A spokesman said the ruling lacked "any comprehensible legal basis".
The Commission also ordered Italian  banks to pay back to the government hundreds of millions of
euros in tax breaks to encourage mergers and acquisitions.

The Commission ruled the incentives, paid between 1998 and 2000 to a number of Italian  banks, were illegal state aid.

Mr Monti yesterday launched a wide-ranging set of proposals to change the way the Brussels authorities scrutinise mergers and acquisitions. He said the EU antitrust rules needed to be adapted "to meet the challenges posed by global mergers, monetary union, market integration, (EU) enlargement and the
need to co-operate with other (regulators)".

Mr Monti's paper opens a debate on whether  European authorities should use the same test as their US counterparts to decide whether a merger should be blocked in an attempt to avoid divergences among the world's top regulators.

Five of Germany's leading banks were yesterday fined #63m for operating an "outrageous"
price-fixing cartel on foreign exchange transactions calculated to compensate for the introduction of
the euro.
In a scam which the European commission said might have dented confidence in the single
currency itself, the five banks colluded in 1997 to fix a minimum  charge of 3% for a three-year period
for the exchange of banknotes from all the countries which were to adopt the  euro.

TD
The banks' aim, according to the EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti, was to compensate themselves for the loss of one of their biggest money-spinners - the lucrative buying and selling of different eurozone currencies which often involved making a profit on the spread between different national currencies.

The launch of the  euro on January 1 1999 was the trigger for the  banks to collude. The  banks set themselves "a recovery target" of 90% of the income which they made on  currency speculation and then proceeded to squeeze  German consumers for the extra money.

"This behaviour was illegal, caused direct and irreparable damage to consumers and also dealt a blow to citizens' confidence in the  European single currency," said Mr Monti yesterday. The  fines are the eighth largest that Brussels has ever imposed.

"Banks are free to set the level of charges for exchanging currencies or other services but they cannot get together to fix those charges. This behaviour is particularly outrageous," he said.

Commerzbank, Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Hypo und Vereinsbank were  fined #17.5m each, while Deutsche Verkehrsbank was fined #8.75m and Vereins und Westbank #1.75m. At least two of the banks signalled yesterday that they would appeal the  commission's decision on the grounds that it was "not justified".
Brussels' resolve to get tough with the banks follows a massive investigation last year into more than
100 banks across the 12-nation eurozone.

The matter is particularly sensitive since the abolition of exchange rate fees is touted as one of the main advantages of signing up to the  euro.

HD       EU fines six German banks for exchange rate conspiracy. BY       By DEREK SCALLY BERLIN.

The European Commission has fined six German banks more than EUR100 million (#79 million) for conspiring to keep exchange rate charges on euro-zone currencies artificially high.

Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank and Bayerische HypoVereinsbank were  fined EUR28 million each and the Deutsche Verkehrsbank (DVB) was  fined EUR14 million. The  fines were based on the size of the banks, with a smaller  bank, the Vereins-und-Westbank, fined EUR2.8 million. The  Commission said the banks agreed in 1997 to impose a 3 per cent charge on euro-zone foreign exchanges. They deliberately did not pass on to customers the lower cost of euro-zone currency transfers, something the Commission called "a clear violation of  European antitrust rules".

TD
"This behaviour was illegal, caused direct and irreparable damage to consumers and also gave a blow to citizens' confidence in the  European single currency," said Mr Mario Monti, the Competition Commissioner. "I am disappointed that the five banks did not reduce their charges ... as was done by other banks in Germany and in other member-states," he said. Three of the banks, Commerzbank, HypoVereinsbank and DVB, said yesterday they would appeal the  fine.

In early 1999, the Commission began investigating allegations that  banks in seven states, including Ireland, agreed to fix bank charges on euro-zone foreign exchange. The agreed charges would "recover about 90 per cent of the 'exchange margin'" on foreign exchange within the euro zone in the two-year period between fixing of rates in 1999 and the introduction of the euro bank notes next year. By this summer, the Irish  banks under investigation and others around Europe agreed to reduce or eliminate these  charges for their customers. "This reduction of charges and the deviation of the  banks from their collusive behaviour not only produced immediate benefits for consumers but will also contribute to a smooth changeover to the  euro," said Mr Monti.

The Commission continued its investigation after five German banks declined to reduce their  charges. The EUR100.8 million  fine imposed yesterday is the eighth-largest cartel fine ever imposed by the Commission. A spokesperson for Hypovereinsbank said yesterday the charges were "groundless", while Commerzbank said in a statement that the  fine was "not justified" and maintained that it fixed its bank charges "independently based on market forces and economic decisions".

Despite the fixed exchange rates of  euro-zone currencies, the bank said the judgment ignored the fact that "transport, insurance, handling and storage charges" on the euro-zone currencies remained the same.

BRUSSELS -- Cracking down on alleged euro profiteering, the EuropeanCommission fined five
German banks a total of 100.8 million euros for fixing the price of euro-zone currency conversions.

The fines followed a yearlong investigation that once targeted more than 100 banks in seven European Union member states for charging fixed fees for the  conversion of bank notes from the 12 nations scheduled to introduce euro banknotes and coins on Jan. 1. The exchange rates for  euro-zone currencies have been fixed since Jan. 1, 1999, but the Germanbanks -- Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Bayerische Hypo- & Vereinsbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG and Vereins- & Westbank AG -- kept  charging customers no less than 3% to convert the cash.

TD
"This behavior is particularly outrageous," said Mario Monti, the European Commissioner responsible for antitrust policy, because it caused "direct harm to consumers in Germany," the largest EU member state and one whose citizens were among the most skeptical about adapting the  euro. The commission agreed to drop its case against the vast majority of  banks earlier this year -- an unusual move justified on the basis of expediency and boosting consumer confidence in the  euro -- after the banks agreed to waive or reduce the disputed fees.

The fine was the eighth-largest  cartel fine ever levied by the commission, reflecting what Mr. Monti called a "very serious infringement" of EU competition law. The price-fixing agreement was found to have been reached in late 1997 and covered the three years from the fixing of  euro-zone exchange rates in 1999 to the introduction of  euro notes and coins in January.

Three of the banks -- Commerzbank, Hypo-Vereinsbank and Verkehrs-Bank -- immediately said they would appeal the commission's finding. Commerzbank denied engaging in price-fixing, insisting that it set its 3.75% fee for converting  euro-zone banknotes on its own, and said it still incurs higher costs for transporting, insuring and storing foreign banknotes despite the elimination of exchange-rate risk.
Dresdner Bank, a unit of insurer Allianz AG Holding, said it is checking the legal basis for the  fine, while
Vereins- & Westbank wasn't immediately available for comment.

Companies almost always appeal  cartel fines to the European Court of Justice. The court occasionally reduces fines on technicalities, but rarely dismisses them altogether.

The commission doesn't deny that handling foreign cash costs more than handling domestic notes and coins, but says the problem was collusion among  banks that led to substantially similar fees in
Germany and elsewhere -- not the size of the fees themselves.

"Banks are free to set the level of charges for exchanging currencies or other services, but they cannot get together to fix those charges," said Mr. Monti.

German and European consumer groups welcomed Mr. Monti's move. BEUC, the main consumer lobby in Brussels, called the  bank charges "the latest and worst case of  banks conspiring together to deny consumers the benefits of fixed exchange rates."

(ECSC Treaty, Art. 65(5)) Summary:
1. Where there is a dispute as to the existence of an infringement of the competition rules, it is incumbent on the Commission to prove the infringements which it has found and to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating to the requisite legal standard the existence of circumstances constituting an infringement

However, once it has been established that an undertaking has participated in meetings of a manifestly anti-competitive nature between undertakings, it is incumbent on that undertaking to put forward evidence to establish that its participation in those meetings was without any anti-competitive intention by demonstrating that it had indicated to its competitors that it was participating in those meetings in a spirit
that was different from theirs. In the absence of proof of such distancing, the fact that that undertaking does not abide by the outcome of those meetings is not such as to relieve it from full responsibility for the fact
that it participated in the  cartel.
( see paras 29-30 )

2. With regard to cartels which are no longer in operation, it is sufficient, for Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now Article 81 EC) and, by analogy, Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, to be applicable, that they continue to produce their effects after they have formally ceased to be in force. The same applies a fortiori where the effects of the agreement lasted until the adoption of the decision finding the infringement without the agreement having been formally brought to an end.
( see para. 63 )

3. The Commission is not required to appraise the gravity of an infringement of the principle of the prohibition of cartels by reference to the turnover of each of the companies concerned: no such criterion is imposed by Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty or by the applicable guidelines. It is clear from both Article
65(5) of the ECSC Treaty and the guidelines that the turnover of the undertakings concerned is to be considered by the Commission only for the purpose of observing the maximum limit on the final amount of the fine.

In that connection, any reference to the previous decision-making practice of the  Commission is irrelevant. First, that practice, however consistent, cannot in itself provide a legal framework for the method of calculating fines since, as the infringements are covered by Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, that method is defined by Article 65(5). Second, in view of the discretion granted to the  Commission by Article 65(5) of
the ECSC Treaty, the Commission cannot be criticised for having introduced a new method for calculating fines, provided that the fines do not exceed the maximum limit laid down by Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty.
( see paras 82-85 )

4. The factors on the basis of which the gravity of an infringement may be assessed may, depending on the circumstances, include the volume and value of the goods in respect of which the infringement was committed and the size and economic power of the undertaking.

In that regard, whilst it is true that an undertaking's market shares may be relevant in order to determine what influence it may exert on the market, they cannot be a decisive factor in concluding that an undertaking belongs to a powerful economic entity.
( see paras 88-89 )

5. The purpose of the compulsory publication of lists of prices under Article 60(2) of the ECSC Treaty is, first, as far as possible to prevent prohibited practices; second, to enable purchasers to learn exactly what prices will be charged and be able themselves to check whether any discrimination has taken place, and; third, to enable undertakings to have accurate knowledge of the prices of their competitors so as to enable them to align their prices. However, the prices appearing in the price lists must be fixed by each
undertaking independently, without any agreement, even tacit, between them. In particular, the fact that the


Page 14 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
provisions of Article 60 tend to restrict competition does not prevent application of the prohibition of agreements under Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.
( see paras 107-108 )

6. The prohibition of agreements which, directly or indirectly, involve price fixing also extends to agreements relating to the fixing of a part of the final price.
( see para. 115 )

7. As regards appraisal of the cooperation shown by undertakings during an administrative procedure initiated in relation to a prohibited agreement, the  Commission is not entitled to disregard the principle of equal treatment, a general principle of Community law which is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified.

The mere fact that one of the undertakings participating in the cartel was the first to acknowledge the contested facts in response to the questions put by the Commission cannot constitute an objective reason for treating them differently. The appraisal of the extent of the cooperation shown by undertakings cannot depend on purely random factors, such as the order in which they are questioned by the  Commission. The extent of the cooperation provided by the undertakings concerned must be regarded as comparable, in so far as those undertakings provided the  Commission, at the same stage of the administrative procedure
and in similar circumstances, with similar information concerning the conduct imputed to them.

APPLICATION for the annulment of  Commission Decision 98/247/ECSC of 21 January 1998 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty (Case IV/35.814 - Alloy Surcharge) (OJ 1998 L 100, p.
55),
THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (First Chamber),
composed of: B. Vesterdorf, President, M. Vilaras and N.J. Forwood, Judges, Registrar: G. Herzig, Administrator,
having regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 11 October 2000 gives the following
Judgment Grounds: Facts
1 Compañía Española Para La Fabricación de Aceros Inoxidables SA (hereinafter Acerinox or the applicant) is a company incorporated under Spanish law operating in the stainless steel sector, producing flat products in particular. It controls the Spanish producer of stainless steel long products, Roldán SA, and a United States producer of stainless steel flat products.

Page 15 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
2 Stainless steel is a type of special steel whose main property is resistance to corrosion. This resistance is achieved by the use of different alloying materials (chrome, nickel, molybdenum) in the production process. Stainless steel is used in the form of flat products (plates or coils, cold or hot rolled) or long products (bars, wire rod, sections, hot rolled or finished). Flat products account for 82% of sales of finished stainless steel products. Most of those products are ECSC products within the meaning of Article 81 of the Treaty.

3 On 16 March 1995, following reports in the specialised press and complaints from several consumers, the Commission, under Article 47 of the Treaty, asked a number of stainless steel producers for information concerning the application by those producers of a general price increase known as the alloy surcharge.

4 The alloy surcharge is a price supplement which is calculated on the basis of the prices of the alloying materials and is added to the basic price for stainless steel. The cost of the alloying materials used by stainless steel producers (nickel, chromium and molybdenum) forms a very large proportion of the total production costs. The prices of those materials are extremely volatile.

5 The methods used for calculation of the alloy surcharge have varied depending on the period and the producer. In the course of inspections carried out under Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty and in certain letters to the Commission, the producers of stainless steel flat products stated that they had used the same formula for calculating the alloy surcharge, with the exception of the reference values (or trigger values), since 1988. However, in 1991, following a drop in the prices of alloying materials below the trigger values, the producers applied a zero alloy surcharge.

6 On the basis of the information obtained, and particularly copies of circulars sent by the producers concerned to their customers announcing a change to the bases used to calculate the alloy surcharge, the Commission served a statement of objections on 19 undertakings on 19 December 1995. The replies given by those undertakings prompted the  Commission to undertake further investigations under Article
47 of the ECSC Treaty.

7 In December 1996 and January 1997, after the  Commission had carried out a number of inspections, lawyers or representatives of a number of undertakings, including Acerinox, informed the  Commission of their wish to cooperate. For that purpose, statements were sent to the  Commission: on 17 December
1996 by Acerinox, ALZ NV, Avesta Sheffield AB (Avesta), Krupp Thyssen Nirosta GmbH (KTN), Usinor SA (Usinor or Ugine), and on 10 January 1997 by Acciai Speciali Terni SpA (AST).

8 The Commission served a new statement of objections replacing the statement of 19 December 1995 on those undertakings and on Thyssen Stahl AG on 24 April 1977.

9 On 21 January 1998 the  Commission adopted Decision 98/247/ECSC relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty (Case IV/35.814 - Alloy surcharge) (OJ 1998 L 100, p. 55, hereinafter the Decision).

10 According to the Decision, the prices for alloys and stainless steel fell sharply in 1993. When nickel prices started to rise in September 1993, producers' profits were considerably reduced. To remedy this, the producers of stainless flat products, other than Outokumpu, agreed, at a meeting held in Madrid on 16
December 1993 (hereinafter the Madrid meeting), to increase their prices on a concerted basis by changing the parameters for calculating the alloy surcharge. To that end they decided to apply, as from 1 February
1994, an alloy surcharge based on the method last used in 1991, taking for all producers the September
1993 prices as reference values, when the price of nickel had reached its historical low.

11 Thus, according to the Decision, producers calculated the amount of the alloy surcharge to be applied in a given month (M) in the different Community  currencies as follows: they calculated the average price of nickel, chromium and molybdenum in the two months preceding the month before the month of calculation (in other words, M-2 and M-3). Then they compare the values thus obtained with the reference values (or trigger values) since February 1994, namely: ECU 3 750/tonne for nickel, ECU 5 532/tonne for
molybdenum and ECU 777/tonne for chromium. Under that system, if the difference between the average prices and the reference values is positive, a price supplement is added to the basic price of the steel concerned for the month M. If it is negative, no increase is applied. There is thus no negative alloy surcharge. Such a situation occurred between 1991 and 1993, when alloy prices fell below the trigger values then applicable and producers applied a zero alloy surcharge. The amounts reflecting a positive difference are multiplied by the percentage of each alloy in the quality of steel concerned.
12 According to the Decision, the alloy surcharge calculated on the basis of the newly determined
reference values was applied by all producers for their sales in  Europe as from 1 February 1994, except in
Spain and Portugal. In Spain the new alloy surcharge was applied in June 1994, Acerinox having indicated
at the Madrid meeting that the immediate application of the new alloy surcharge in Spain would not help to
increase demand and would not have a positive effect on Spanish industry, which was in the depths of a

Page 16 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
severe crisis. However, Acerinox too applied the new alloy surcharge as from 1 February 1994 in the other Member States, and Denmark in particular. According to the Decision, that agreement led to a virtual doubling of stainless steel prices between January 1994 and March 1995.
13 The operative part of the Decision contains the following provisions: Article 1
[Acerinox], ALZ NV, [AST], [Avesta], Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG ([KTN] as from 1 January 1995), Thyssen Stahl AG ([KTN] as from 1 January 1995) and [Ugine] infringed Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, in the case of [Avesta] from December 1993 to November 1996 and, in the case of the other undertakings, up to the date of this Decision, namely by modifying and by applying in a concerted fashion the reference values used to calculate the alloy surcharge, such practice having both the object and the effect of restricting and distorting competition within the common market.
Article 2
The following  fines are hereby imposed in respect of the infringements described in Article 1: [Acerinox] ECU 3 530 000
ALZ NV ECU 4 540 000 [AST] ECU 4 540 000 [Avesta] ECU 2 810 000 [KTN] ECU 8 100 000 [Usinor] ECU 3 860 000
Article 3
...
Article 4

[Acerinox], ALZ NV, [AST], [KTN] and [Usinor] shall immediately put an end to the infringements referred to in Article 1 and shall inform the  Commission within three months of being notified of this Decision of the measures they have taken to that end.

The undertakings referred to in Article 1 shall refrain from repeating the acts or conduct specified in the said article and from adopting any measure having an equivalent effect.

14 By fax of 21 January 1998 the Commission notified the operative part of the Decision to the applicant. By decision of 2 February 1998 the Commission replaced by other numbers the  bank account number appearing in the first paragraph of Article 3 of the operative part of the Decision notified on 21 January
1998 into which the  fines imposed were required to be paid. On 5 February 1998, the Decision, thus amended, was formally notified to its addressees.
Procedure

15 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 18 March 1998 the applicant instituted the present proceedings. Krupp Thyssen Stainless GmbH, formerly KTN, and AST also brought proceedings against the Decision (Cases T-45/98 and T-47/98 respectively).

16 Upon hearing the report of the Judge-Rapporteur, the Court of First Instance (First Chamber) decided to open the oral procedure. As a measure of organisation of procedure, it asked the  Commission to answer a number of written questions.

17 The parties presented oral argument and answered the questions put to them by the Court at the hearing on 11 October 2000.
Forms of order sought
18 The applicant claims that the Court of First Instance should:
- annul the Decision;
- in the alternative, substantially reduce the  fine imposed;
Page 17 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- order the Commission to pay the costs.
19 The Commission contends that the Court of First Instance should:
- dismiss the action;
- order the applicant to pay the costs. The claim for annulment of the Decision
20 In support of its claim for annulment of the Decision, the applicant raises two pleas in law: first, that it did not participate in the infringement and, second, that the infringement was sporadic in nature.
1. The first plea: non-participation in the infringement
Arguments of the parties

21 The applicant maintains, first, that no agreement was concluded at the Madrid meeting relating to the application of the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market. As is clear from paragraphs 27, 44 and 54 of the Decision, at that meeting the applicant informed its competitors of its intention not to apply the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market in view of the critical situation prevailing there.

22 It maintains that the  Commission did not demonstrate or even claim that there was any agreement or concerted practice relating to application of the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market.

23 In the applicant's view, the argument that a statement made by it at the Madrid meeting did not in any way detract from the principle of the agreement or the concerted practice but was merely indicative of deferment of the introduction of the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market is not only without merit but is also inadmissible, having been raised for the first time before the Court of First Instance (Joined Cases
T-371/94 and T-394/94 British Airways and Others and British Midland Airways v  Commission [1998] ECR II-2405).

24 In any event, the statement by Avesta in its fax of 14 January 1994 according to which Acerinox have announced that surcharges will be applied from 1 April 1994 (paragraph 33 of the Decision) merely confirms the absence of any agreement or concerted practice relating to deferred implementation of the alloy surcharge in Spain. As to the finding in paragraph 82 of the Decision that the applicant reintroduced the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market in June 1994, the Decision does not explain why there was no other plausible explanation for such conduct than implementation of an agreement reached at the Madrid meeting.

25 As regards, second, the application of the alloy surcharge in the other countries of  Europe, the applicant states that since all the other undertakings notified to the  Commission the amounts of the alloy surcharges which they intended applying with effect from 1 February 1994, it was itself able to take account of them in order to adopt parallel conduct. The right of operators to adapt themselves intelligently to the conduct of their competitors is upheld by the case-law (Joined Cases 40/73 to 48/73, 50/73, 54/73 to 56/73,
111/73, 113/73 and 114/73 Suiker Unie and Others v  Commission [1975] ECR 1663, paragraphs 173 and
174, and Joined Cases C-89/85, C-104/85, C-114/85, C-116/85, C-117/85 and C-125/85 to C-129/85
Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v  Commission [1993] ECR I-1307, paragraph 71). In this case such
conduct was accounted for by the oligopolistic structure of the market in stainless steel flat products in
Europe and by the transparency rules in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty. In particular, the applicant
maintains that the parallel conduct in which it engaged was based on public announcements made by its
competitors under the ECSC Treaty rules, which were also widely reported in the specialised press as early
as January 1994. Although it in fact applied the alloy surcharge in Denmark as from February 1994, it did
so only because the negotiations with its Danish customers took place during that period.

26 Finally, the applicant submits that if the  Commission considered that Outokumpu should be excluded from the action against the  cartel even though, despite not having taken part in the Madrid meeting, it had been fully informed of the results thereof by Ugine's faxes of 20 December 1993 and 11 January 1994 (paragraphs 28 and 32 of the Decision) and adjusted its market conduct accordingly, the  Commission should a fortiori have reached the same conclusion regarding the applicant which, although having taken part in that meeting, expressed its intention not to follow the approach discussed and did not do so on the market.

27 The Commission replies that, although the applicant did not immediately apply the alloy surcharge on its domestic market, it nevertheless did so on the other markets, particularly in Denmark, as from 1
February 1994 (see paragraphs 37 and 82 of the Decision). Moreover, the applicant's participation in the agreement is also apparent from Avesta's abovementioned fax of 14 January 1994. According to the Commission, those facts indicate that an agreement came into being at the Madrid meeting or, at the very

Page 18 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
least, a concerted practice, in which the applicant participated in the same way as all the other addressees of the Decision, but which did not affect the Spanish market to the same extent.

28 According to the  Commission, the applicant's argument that application of the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market in June 1994 was a reaction independent of the decisions of its competitors is not convincing. First, the applicant's announcement in May 1994 of the application of a new alloy surcharge in Spain as from June 1994 should not be seen in isolation since that announcement was preceded by the Madrid meeting, by the application of the alloy surcharge in other Member States as from 1 February 1994 and by the announcement to Avesta that it would apply the alloy surcharge as from 1 April 1994. Second, following the statement made by the applicant at the Madrid meeting, none of the other producers applied the new alloy surcharge in Spain, and that course of action was consistent with the attitude adopted whereby on each national market producers would follow the domestic or leading producer. Consequently, when the applicant applied the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market in June 1994 it was not engaging in parallel conduct but was signalling that the time had come to start applying the agreed increase there as well because the market circumstances had now made it possible to do so.
Findings of the Court

29 It must be borne in mind that, where there is a dispute as to the existence of an infringement of the competition rules, it is incumbent on the  Commission to prove the infringements which it has found and to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating to the requisite legal standard the existence of circumstances constituting an infringement (Case C-185/95 P Baustahlgewebe v  Commission [1998] ECR I-8417, paragraph 58).

30 However, once it has been established that an undertaking has participated in meetings of a manifestly anti-competitive nature between undertakings, it is incumbent on that undertaking to put forward evidence to establish that its participation in those meetings was without any anti-competitive intention by demonstrating that it had indicated to its competitors that it was participating in those meetings in a spirit that was different from theirs (Case C-199/92 P Hüls v  Commission [1999] ECR I-4287, paragraph 155, and Case C-235/92 P Montecatini v  Commission [1999] ECR I-4539, paragraph 181). In the absence of proof of such distancing, the fact that an undertaking does not abide by the outcome of those meetings is not such as to relieve it from full responsibility for the fact that it participated in the  cartel (Case T-347/94
Mayr-Melnhof v Commission [1998] II-1751, paragraph 135, Joined Cases T-25/95, T-26/95, T-30/95 to
T-32/95, T-34/95 to T-39/95, T-42/95 to T-46/95, T-48/95, T-50/95 to T-65/95, T-68/95 to T-71/95, T-87/95,
T-88/95, T-103/95 and T-104/95 Cimenteries CBR and Others v  Commission [2000] ECR. II-491 -
hereinafter the Cement judgment - paragraph 1389).

31 In this case, it is not disputed that the applicant participated in the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993 during which, as is clear from the Decision and the statements of various participants at that meeting, certain producers of stainless steel flat products agreed to use, from the same date, identical reference values for calculation of the alloy surcharge and, therefore, as to the determination of part of the final price of those products, contrary to Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

32 It is necessary to consider, however, whether the applicant has satisfactorily established that it distanced itself from that agreement and cannot therefore be accused of infringing Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

33 As regards, first, the arguments put forward by the applicant to show that the concertation between producers was not concerned with the application, on the Spanish market, of the alloy surcharge calculated in accordance with the method defined at the Madrid meeting, it should be observed that the  Commission does not dispute that, at that meeting, Acerinox expressed its wish not to apply the alloy surcharge in Spain owing to the economic situation prevailing there.

34 In that connection, paragraph 27 of the Decision mentions, but does not challenge, the applicant's statement of 17 December 1996 in response to questions from the  Commission, according to which at the meeting Acerinox said it did not plan to apply the surcharge in Spain because it considered the measure would not help to increase demand and would not have a positive effect on Spanish industry which was in the depths of a severe crisis.

35 Since it is therefore common ground that, at the date of the Madrid meeting, the applicant distanced itself from the agreement on the alloy surcharge in so far as it related to the Spanish market, the mere fact that it took part in that meeting is no basis for treating it as a party to an agreement whose object was to fix the reference values for the alloy surcharge on that market, contrary to Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

36 Since the aim of such an agreement was, at that date, contrary to Acerinox's interests, in so far as it related to the Spanish market, only proof of a commitment by that undertaking to apply the alloy surcharge


Page 19 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
on its domestic market would therefore represent adherence by it to an agreement concerning Spain (see, to that effect, the Cement judgment, paragraph 3444).
37 It is clear from the file that, as pointed out in paragraph 33 of the Decision, Avesta, by fax of 14 January
1994, informed its subsidiaries, including the one in Spain, of the position taken by some of its competitors
concerning the date for application of the alloy surcharge on their domestic markets. With regard more
specifically to Acerinox, it is stated: Acerinox have announced that surcharges will apply from 1 April 1994
(yes, April!).

38 The applicant does not contest the truth of the statements attributed to it but confines itself to asserting that that statement shows even more clearly that no agreement or concerted practice existed at the date of the Madrid meeting concerning deferred application of the alloy surcharge in Spain. The fact nevertheless remains that such a statement constitutes evidence of the fact that, on 14 January 1994, Acerinox had in any event expressed its intention to apply an alloy surcharge in Spain in line with the terms agreed by the undertakings concerned at the Madrid meeting and had thus complied with that agreement.

39 That conclusion is not undermined by the argument that the applicant did not thereafter apply the alloy surcharge on the Spanish market until 1 June 1994, rather than on 1 April 1994. Even if it were to be accepted that that postponement of two months might indicate that the applicant's conduct on the Spanish market was not in conformity with the conduct agreed upon, that would in no way affect its liability under Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, in view of its prior adherence to the agreement no later than 14 January
1994 (Mayr-Melnhof, cited above, paragraph 135, and Cement, paragraph 1389).

40 As regards, second, the applicant's arguments as to the absence of proof of its participation in the agreement on the alloy surcharge in so far as it related to the other countries of the  European Community, they are based on a misapprehension as to the requirements concerning proof laid down by Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

41 The Court holds that the applicant has not proved that, at the Madrid meeting, it distanced itself from the other participants in the meeting by stating its intention not to apply the alloy surcharge in the countries of the European Community other than Spain. It is clear from the file that, on the contrary, in its statement of
17 December 1996, in response to questions from the  Commission, the applicant did not contend that, at the Madrid meeting, it had adopted the same attitude as the one decided upon regarding application of the alloy surcharge in Spain but conceded that [a] majority of those present was in favour of applying the surcharge as soon as possible (paragraph 2.4 of the statement mentioned above and paragraph 26 of the Decision).

42 Moreover, it is clear from that same statement that the applicant applied an alloy surcharge to its products as from February 1994 in Denmark; then, in March, in  Germany, Norway and Sweden; then, in April, in Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Italy; and, finally, in France and Belgium in May 1994.

43 The applicant's claim that the alignment of its alloy surcharges with those applied by the other producers operating on those markets derived from mere parallelism of conduct attributable to the oligopolistic structure of the market in stainless steel flat products and to the transparency rules in Article 60 of the
ECSC Treaty is unconvincing. Whilst it may follow from the case-law that parallel conduct cannot be regarded as furnishing proof of concertation unless concertation constitutes the only plausible explanation for such conduct (Ahlström Osakehtiö and Others, cited above, paragraph 71), the fact nevertheless remains, in this case, that the  Commission has produced proof of prior concertation between the undertakings concerned, which involved the use and application of identical reference values in the formula for calculating the alloy surcharge.

44 The argument that no action was taken against Outokumpu has no bearing on the appraisal of the present infringement. Even if the situation of that undertaking could be compared with that of the applicant, the fact that no finding of infringement was made against it by the  Commission could not in any event be a ground for setting aside the finding of an infringement by the applicant, assuming that it was properly established (Ahlström Osakehtiö and Others, paragraph 146).

45 It follows that the applicant must be regarded as having participated in the agreement, in so far as it related to the application, in the Member States of the Community other than Spain, of an alloy surcharge calculated on the basis of reference values agreed between undertakings as from 16 December 1993, the date of the Madrid meeting, and, in so far as that agreement related to the application of the alloy
surcharge in Spain, as from its adherence to the agreement, no later than 14 January 1994. The duration of its participation in the agreement will be examined in relation to the second plea.

46 In short, as the applicant's participation in the agreement has been proved, the plea is unfounded and must be rejected.
2. The second plea: the sporadic nature of the infringement
Page 20 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Arguments of the parties

47 The applicant maintains that, even if it could be regarded as having participated in an infringement, it was merely a sporadic infringement.

48 It states that the  Commission has not proved that the infringement consisted, in addition to application of the alloy surcharge as from 1 February 1994, in keeping it in force after that date for an indefinite period. In the absence of contacts between the undertakings, mere parallel behaviour cannot be sufficient to establish that the concerted practice continued beyond 1 February 1994 (Case 41/69 ACF Chemiefarma v Commission [1970] ECR 661, paragraph 153). Moreover, in the absence of evidence capable of directly establishing the duration of infringement, the  Commission must, at least, produce evidence of facts sufficiently proximate in time for it to be reasonable to accept that the infringement continued uninterruptedly between two specific dates (Case T-43/92 Dunlop Slazenger v  Commission [1994] ECR
441, paragraph 79). Otherwise, the presumption of innocence militating in favour of the applicant requires that it be assumed that the infringement has terminated (Case T-30/91 Solvay v  Commission [1995] ECR II-1775, paragraphs 73 to 75, and Case T-36/91 ICI v  Commission [1995] ECR II-1847, paragraphs 83 to
85).

49 According to the applicant, the concertation can be said to have lasted at most until July 1994 when nickel prices had returned to their original level. On the other hand, the  Commission has no grounds for considering that the mere introduction of a different formula from the one which had been traditionally used in the industry was capable of bringing the alleged infringement to an end (see paragraph 70 of the Decision).

50 Finally, the applicant submits that the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Case T-327/94 SCA Holding v Commission [1998] ECR II-1373, paragraph 95, cited by the  Commission, has no relevance to this case since the view was taken that the effects of the concertation lasted until the adoption of the Decision without its having been formally brought to an end.

51 The Commission contends that the applicant's reasoning regarding the duration of the infringement misrepresents the nature of the infringement and the evidence available.

52 As regards evidence, the  Commission did not try to prove an infringement solely on the basis of parallel behaviour. On the contrary, it has direct evidence of the agreement decided upon at the Madrid meeting and of its implementation in most of the Member States as from February 1994 and in Spain as from June 1994. On the date of adoption of the Decision, moreover, only Avesta had stopped applying the alloy surcharge thus agreed.

53 As regards the nature of the infringement, the  Commission maintains that the agreement at issue, designed to introduce the alloy surcharge based on fixed reference values, was concluded for an indefinite period or at least until further notice, in contrast to traditional price agreements which are necessarily reviewed regularly in accordance with market conditions.

54 The Commission concludes from this that where, as in this case, the infringement consists of an agreement or concerted practice decided upon at one point in time but to be executed over a prolonged period, the whole period of application should be regarded as included in the duration of the infringement. To hold otherwise would imply that most infringements of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty and of Article 85 of the EC Treaty would last only for one day, namely the day the agreement or concerted practice was concluded or decided upon. In any event, according to the case-law regarding cartels that are no longer in operation, it is sufficient, for Article 85 to be applicable, that they continue to produce their effects after they have formally ceased to be in operation (SCA Holding v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 95).
Findings of the Court

55 As is clear from the case-law, it is incumbent on the Commission to prove not only the existence of the agreement but also its duration (see Dunlop Slazenger v Commission, cited above, paragraph 79, and Cement, cited above, paragraph 2802).
56 It is therefore necessary in this case to consider whether the  Commission, having found in paragraph
50 of the Decision that the concertation continued until the date of adoption of the Decision, discharged the
burden of proof which lay upon it.

57 It should be remembered that in the Decision, and in particular in paragraph 44, the  Commission considered that the agreement commenced at the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993, because it was on that date that the participating undertakings agreed to apply an alloy surcharge as from 1 February
1994, taking as the reference values for the alloying materials in the calculation method used for the last time in 1991 the values they had reached in September 1993.

Page 21 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
58 The Decision then found that, as from that date, the undertakings actually applied the alloy surcharge, thus agreed and calculated, to their sales in  Europe. In the particular case of the applicant, it complied with the decision taken at the Madrid meeting by applying the abovementioned alloy surcharge as from 1
February 1994 to its sales in the other Member States, and particularly in Denmark (paragraphs 54 and 82 of the Decision).

59 As regards the date on which the infringement ceased, the  Commission relied in paragraph 50 of the Decision on the fact that only Avesta had announced, in November 1996, that it was bringing the agreement to an end by using another method for calculation of the alloy surcharge.

60 In that connection, the Court would point out that the applicant does not deny that the reference values for the alloy surcharge, as agreed at the Madrid meeting, were not changed before the Decision was adopted. Thus, as the applicant and the other undertakings concerned continued in practice to apply the reference values on which they had agreed at that meeting, the fact that no express decision was taken at that time as to the period of implementation of the agreement cannot prove that the agreement was sporadic rather than continuous.

61 The applicant's argument that the application of an alloy surcharge derived from price transparency and parallelism of behaviour on the part of the undertakings concerned is unfounded and must be rejected. The infringement attributed to the applicant consisted not in the application of an alloy surcharge as such but in the determination of its amount on the basis of a calculation method embodying reference values identical to those of its competitors, determined jointly with other producers and in concertation with them. Accordingly, the fact that the applicant maintained those reference values in its calculation method for the alloy surcharge cannot be accounted for otherwise than by the existence of such concertation.

62 Similarly, the applicant's argument that the agreement lasted, at most, until July 1994 when nickel prices reached their original level is entirely irrelevant and must be rejected. Since the reference values of the alloying materials to which the infringement related remained unchanged, the inference to be drawn from
the fact that, on a given date, the price of nickel reached its original level is certainly not that the infringement then ceased to have anti-competitive effects but simply that the calculation of the alloy surcharge then had to take account of that development.

63 Finally, it must be borne in mind that, with regard to cartels which are no longer in operation, it is sufficient, for Article 85 of the EC Treaty to be applicable, and, by analogy, Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, that they continue to produce their effects after they have formally ceased to be in force (Case 51/75 EMI Records [1976] ECR 811, paragraph 30, Case 243/83 Binon [1985] 2015, paragraph 17, Case T-2/89
Petrofina v  Commission [1991] II-1087, paragraph 212, and SCA Holding v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 95). The same applies a fortiori where, as in this case, the effects of the agreement lasted until the adoption of the Decision, without the agreement having been formally brought to an end.

64 It follows that, in so far as the applicant had not abandoned the application of the reference values agreed at the Madrid meeting before the adoption of the Decision, the  Commission was fully entitled to consider that the infringement lasted until that date.
65 The fact that in the applicant's case the date of commencement of the infringement cannot be fixed until
14 January 1994, rather than 16 December 1993, in so far as the agreement concerned the application of
the alloy surcharge in Spain (see paragraph 45 above) cannot, in those circumstances, affect the validity of
the Decision. Because the Decision was adopted on 21 January 1998, the  Commission in any event
considered, for the purposes of calculating the  fine, that the duration of the infringement attributable to the
applicant was four years. Consequently, in paragraph 78 of the Decision, the  Commission proceeded, in
accordance with its Guidelines on the method of setting  fines imposed pursuant to Article 15(2) of
Regulation No 17 and Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty (OJ 1998, C 9, page 3, hereinafter the Guidelines),
to apply an increase of 10% for each year that had elapsed, amounting in this case to an increase of 40%.
Moreover, it must also be remembered that, since the agreement in which the applicant participated also
covered the other Member States of the Community, the  Commission was fully entitled to consider that
the infringement commenced on 16 December 1993, the date of the Madrid meeting.
66 It follows that the plea alleging that the infringement was merely sporadic must be rejected. The claim that the amount of the  fine should be reduced
A - The pleas alleging miscalculation of the  fine
1 - The gravity of the infringement
Arguments of the parties


Page 22 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
67 The applicant maintains, first, that the  fines imposed by the Commission do not take account of the comparative importance of the parties.

68 It states that, as a departure from its earlier practice of reflecting the gravity of the infringement by calculating the  fines as a percentage of the turnovers of the companies involved, the  Commission decided to adopt, in this instance for the purpose of the gravity of the infringement, a uniform starting point
for calculation of the  fine for all the parties concerned of ECU 4 million, because the companies concerned were all large, albeit with significant differences in their sizes.

69 The applicant provided the following table in order to compare the turnovers of the companies concerned for 1996 :
1996
>lt>0

Unlike the Commission, the applicant considers that the relevant turnover for the purpose of calculating the fine is that of the companies and not that of the undertakings, given that the companies are the addressees of the Decision and they are the economic entities which are to pay the  fines.

70 The applicant also provided a table showing the parties' respective shares of the relevant market as follows:
>lt>1

71 As a result, by taking the same starting point for all the participating companies, the  Commission in fact imposed a much heavier sanction on those companies with a smaller turnover and a more limited market share. On the basis of that table, the market shares of Ugine, AST and Avesta exceed the applicant's market share by 63.8%, 35.9% and 19.4% respectively.

72 The applicant thus maintains that the  Commission should have relied on the turnover and market share of each company covered by the Decision, which would have enabled it to avoid making the  fines imposed disproportionate to the size of the undertaking and to take adequately into account the size and economic power of the 'undertakings concerned' and therefore their influence on the market (Joined Cases 100/80 to
103/80 Musique Diffusion Française and Others v  Commission [1983] ECR 1825, paragraphs 119 and
120).

73 The Commission observes, first, that the Decision is one of the first in which the Guidelines have been applied.

74 It explains that, under the Guidelines,  fines are no longer set as a percentage of the turnover of the undertakings concerned but take as a starting point an absolute figure, calculated according to the gravity of the infringement. Moreover, for a  fine to be imposed on undertakings which have together committed
only one infringement, differentiation is based on the respective roles (leadership or follower role) played by each of the undertakings and the respective degrees of co-operation with the  Commission's investigation. The new method also takes account of the considerable disparities in the size of undertakings.

75 The Commission adds that the second feature of the new method of setting  fines is that it takes into account more systematically the duration of the infringement. Finally, as indicated in the Guidelines, the Commission continues to take into account all relevant aggravating or extenuating circumstances and to apply its leniency policy, in accordance with its Notice on the non-imposition or reduction of  fines in cartel cases (OJ 1996 C 207, p. 4, hereinafter the Notice on Cooperation).

76 In this case, the applicant's argument that the  Commission failed, in the Decision, to take account of the different sizes of the undertakings concerned is unfounded, in that the Commission took the view that all the undertakings concerned were large (paragraph 77 of the Decision). The Commission emphasises that the first table produced by the applicant relates to companies and not to undertakings. However, only the concept of undertaking is relevant for the purpose of applying the competition rules. Consequently, only the second table produced by the applicant, which shows that the undertakings concerned have
comparable market shares, is relevant to this case.
Findings of the Court

77 It must be borne in mind first of all that in the Decision the  Commission determined the amount of the fines imposed on the undertakings concerned, and particularly on the applicant, by applying the method defined in the Guidelines.



Page 23 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
78 Under that method, the  Commission takes as the starting point a given amount determined by reference to the gravity of the infringement. The appraisal of the gravity of the infringement must take account of the actual nature of the infringement, its specific impact on the market, where it can be measured, and the size of the relevant geographical market (Section 1 A, first paragraph). In that context, infringements are divided into three categories, namely minor infringements, for which the likely  fines are between ECU 1 000 and ECU 1 million, serious infringements, for which the likely  fines are between ECU
1 million and ECU 20 million, and very serious infringements for which the  fines are likely to exceed ECU
20 million (Section 1 A, first to third indents). Within each of those categories, and in particular the
categories described as serious and very serious, the scale of  fines allows differential treatment to be
applied to undertakings according to the nature of the infringements committed (Section 1 A, third
paragraph). It is also necessary to take account of the effective economic capacity of the offenders to
cause significant damage to other operators, in particular consumers, and to set the amount of the  fine at a
level which ensures that it has a sufficiently deterrent effect (Section 1 A, fourth paragraph).

79 Next, account may be taken of the fact that large undertakings have in most cases infrastructures capable of providing them with legal and economic information on the basis of which they can better appreciate the unlawful nature of the conduct and the consequences stemming from it under competition law (Section 1 A, fifth paragraph).

80 Within each of the three abovementioned categories, it may be appropriate in particular cases to apply weightings to the amounts decided on so as to take account of the specific weight and therefore the real impact on competition of the unlawful conduct of each undertaking, especially where there is considerable disparity in the sizes of the undertakings that have committed an infringement of the same nature and to make consequential adjustments to the basic amount depending on the specific characteristics of each undertaking (Section 1 A, sixth paragraph).

81 In this case, the Commission considered, having regard to the gravity of the infringement, that the basic amount of the fines should be set at ECU 4 million for all the undertakings concerned (paragraph 76 of the Decision). In making that appraisal, the  Commission took account of the nature of the infringement which, aiming as it did at a uniform increase of a price component by almost all the producers of stainless steel flat products, constituted a serious infringement of Community law (paragraph 74 of the Decision). However, in view of the economic and legal elements of the agreement and the relative gravity of the offence, the  Commission did not consider that it should involve very substantial  fines. Finally, in considering whether there was considerable disparity between the undertakings involved in the infringement, the  Commission considered that all the undertakings were large and that, consequently, it was not necessary to vary the amounts of the  fine for the infringement (paragraph 77 of the Decision).

82 Contrary to the applicant's assertion, the  Commission was not required to appraise the gravity of the infringement by reference to the turnover of each of the companies concerned: no such criterion is imposed by the by Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty or by the Guidelines.

83 It is clear from Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty that the turnover of the undertakings concerned is to be considered by the Commission only for the purpose of observing the maximum limit on the final amount of the fine, which is defined as twice the turnover on the products [in question]... however, ... this maximum may be raised to 10% of the annual turnover of the undertakings in question ..., as is also stated in Section
5(a) of the Guidelines. However, it has not been alleged, or a fortiori shown, that the  fine finally imposed on the applicant exceeded the limit thus defined.

84 In that connection, any reference to the previous decision-making practice of the  Commission is irrelevant.

85 First, that practice, however consistent, cannot in itself provide a legal framework for the method of calculating fines since, as the infringements are covered by Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, that method is defined by Article 65(5). Second, in view of the discretion granted to the  Commission by Article 65(5) of
the ECSC Treaty, the Commission cannot be criticised for having introduced a new method for calculating fines, provided that the fines do not exceed the maximum limit laid down by Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty.

86 Furthermore, it must be remembered that, according to settled case-law, the gravity of infringements falls to be determined by reference to numerous factors including, in particular, the specific circumstances and context of the case, and the deterrent character of the  fines; moreover, no binding or exhaustive list of the criteria which must be applied has been drawn up (order of 25 March 1996 in Case C-137/95 P SPO and Others v Commission [1996] ECR I-1611, paragraph 54; Case C-219/95 P Ferriere Nord v Commission [1997] I-4411, paragraph 33; see also Case T-295/94 Buchmann v  Commission [1998]
II-813, paragraph 163). Thus, the Community judicature has found to be lawful a calculation method under which the Commission first determines the overall amount of the  fine to be imposed and then divides that total among the undertakings concerned depending on their activities in the sector concerned (Joined

Page 24 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Cases 96/82 to 102/82, 104/82, 105/82, 108/82 and 110/82 IAZ and Others v  Commission [1983] 3369, paragraphs 48 to 53).

87 The applicant's argument that the  fines imposed do not take account of the respective strengths of the undertakings concerned on the basis of their market shares must be also rejected.
88 It is true that an undertaking's market shares may be relevant in order to determine what influence it
may exert on the market but they cannot be a decisive factor in concluding that an undertaking belongs to a
powerful economic entity (see Baustahlgewebe v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 139).

89 However, according to settled case-law, the factors on the basis of which the gravity of an infringement may be assessed may, depending on the circumstances, include the volume and value of the goods in respect of which the infringement was committed and the size and economic power of the undertaking (Musique Diffusion Française and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraphs 120 and 121; Case
T-77/92 Parker Pen v  Commission [1994] II-549, paragraph 94, and SCA Holding v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 176).

90 Accordingly, in this case, the  Commission was fully entitled to rely, inter alia, on the size and economic strength of the undertakings concerned, having found them all to be large on the basis that the six undertakings concerned accounted for more than 80% of  European production of finished stainless steel products (paragraph 9 of the Decision). In that regard, the comparison drawn by the applicant between its market share of about 11% and those of Ugine, AST and Avesta of about 18%, 15%, and 14% respectively is not such as to disclose any considerable disparity between those undertakings, within the meaning of Section 1 A, sixth paragraph, of the Guidelines, such as to render differentiation necessary in the appraisal of the gravity of the infringement.

91 In those circumstances, the amount of the  fine imposed on the applicant cannot be regarded as disproportionate, given that the starting point for calculation of the amount of the  fine, determined by reference to the gravity of the infringement, is justified in the light of the criteria laid down in the Guidelines, as adopted by the  Commission for appraisal of the nature and subject-matter of the infringement, its impact on the market and the size of the undertakings concerned.
92 It follows that this plea in law is unfounded and must be rejected.
2 - The duration of the infringement
Arguments of the parties

93 The applicant maintains that since the infringement was sporadic or of short duration, the  Commission should have reduced the  fine and not increased it by ECU 1.6 million in respect of the allegedly long duration of the infringement.

94 The Commission replies that the increase takes account of the duration of the infringement which, in applicant's case, and in that the most of the other addressees of the Decision, was four years.
Findings of the Court

95 In determining the amounts of  fines, account must be taken of the duration of the infringements and of all factors capable of affecting the assessment of their gravity (see in particular Musique Diffusion Française and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 129).

96 As regards the duration of the infringement, the Guidelines draw a distinction between infringements of short duration (in general less than one year), for which the amount relating to gravity of the infringement should not be increased, infringements of medium duration (in general 1 to 5 years), for which that amount may be increased by up to 50%, and infringements of long duration (in general more than five years), for which that amount may be increased by 10% for each year (Section 1 B, first to third indents).
97 In this case, it is important to remember that, as stated in paragraphs 64 and 65 above, the
Commission properly considered that the infringement lasted until the date of adoption of the Decision, 21
January 1998, so that the duration of the applicant's participation in the infringement was necessarily
estimated as four years.
98 Consequently, the Commission was correct to apply, in accordance with the Guidelines, an increase of
10% of the amount of the fine imposed for gravity of the infringement for each year that had elapsed,
namely an increase of 40% reflecting the actual duration of the infringement.
99 It follows that this plea must be rejected.
3 - Extenuating circumstances
Page 25 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Arguments of the parties

100 The applicant maintains that the Commission did not take account of a number of extenuating circumstances which should have justified a lower fine than that imposed. It refers to the oligopolistic structure of the steel market, the transparency of that market resulting from the rules on publication of prices in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty, the existence of the same method for calculation of the alloy surcharge for over 25 years and the fact that it was known to most customers, and, finally, the relatively small part of the final prices of stainless flat products represented by the alloy surcharge.

101 The Commission considers, first, that this plea in law is not in any way substantiated or explained and must be rejected as inadmissible.

102 In any event, the  Commission contends that the oligopolistic structure of a market is not capable of having an impact on the amount of the  fines and that the other circumstances referred to by the applicant were examined and rejected in paragraphs 55, 56, 58, 59, 64, 65 and 66 of the Decision, in so far as they did not call in question in the existence of the infringement. However, the  Commission took account of those same circumstances in appraising the gravity of the infringement and, in particular, the amount of the fines, even if it did not formally describe them as extenuating circumstances (see paragraphs 74 and 75 of the Decision).
Findings of the Court
103 At the outset, the Court holds that this plea meets the requirements of Article 44 of the Rules of
Procedure of the Court of First Instance and must therefore be declared admissible.

104 In this case, the Court concludes that the  Commission was entitled to take the view that none of the circumstances relied on by the applicant justified any further decrease of the basic amount of the  fine imposed on it.

105 In the first place, the Court would point out that the oligopolistic structure of the market in stainless steel flat products cannot constitute an extenuating circumstance for the purpose of determining the amount of the  fine. As the  Commission found in paragraph 48 of the Decision, the fact that the undertakings participating in the agreement accounted for almost 90% of the sales of such products
considerably exacerbated the restriction of competition on the market resulting from the concerted increase in the price of stainless steel brought about by the joint determination of reference values for alloying materials.

106 The Court observes, next, that the rules in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty cannot justify participation in an agreement or a concerted practice designed to coordinate the amount of the alloy surcharge.

107 In that connection, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the purpose of the compulsory publication of prices under Article 60(2) of the ECSC Treaty is, first, as far as possible to
prevent prohibited practices; second, to enable purchasers to learn exactly what prices will be  charged and be able themselves to check whether any discrimination has taken place, and; third, to enable undertakings to have an accurate knowledge of the prices of their competitors so as to enable them to align their prices (Case 1/54 France v High Authority [1954] ECR 1, p. 9, and Case 149/78 Rumi v  Commission [1979] ECR
2523, paragraph 10).

108 However, the prices appearing in the price lists must be fixed by each undertaking independently, without any agreement, even tacit, between them. In particular, the fact that the provisions of Article 60
tend to restrict competition does not prevent application of the prohibition of agreements under Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty (France v High Authority, cited above, p. 14, and Case T-141/94 Thyssen Stahl v Commission [1999] II-347, paragraph 312).

109 Moreover, Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty does not provide for any contact between undertakings prior to publication of the price lists, for the purpose of exchanging information on their future prices. In so far as such contacts prevent those price lists being fixed independently, they are liable to distort normal competition within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the Treaty (Thyssen Stahl v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 313).

110 In this case, it may indeed be undisputed that, pursuant to Article 60(2)(a) of the ECSC Treaty, the stainless steel producers released themselves from the obligation to publish their prices and conditions of sale by sending details of them regularly to the  Commission and that, on that basis, those undertakings each notified the  Commission of the amounts of the alloy surcharges which they were going to apply as from 1 February 1994 (paragraph 37 of the Decision).

111 However, the alignment of the reference values intended to be used in the calculation of the alloy surcharge undertaken by the applicant in the Member States of the Community derived not from publication
Page 26 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of the price lists by the  Commission but from prior concertation between producers whereby it was agreed to adopt identical reference values with a view to facilitating upward harmonisation of the alloy surcharges.

112 Accordingly, the applicant cannot invoke, as an extenuating circumstance, the transparency of the market resulting from the rules in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty.

113 As regards the fact that the method for calculating the alloy surcharge had existed for 25 years, it need merely be pointed out that the purpose of the contested agreement was not the use of the same calculation formula, which was not proved to have derived from concertation as such, but the use in that formula, as from the same date and by all the undertakings, of identical reference values with a view to securing higher prices (paragraphs 47 and 56 of the Decision). Furthermore, the fact that some of the customers of those undertakings may have been aware of the calculation method used is irrelevant, particularly since it was precisely on the basis of complaints from certain customers that the  Commission undertook investigations under Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty.

114 As regards the fact that the agreement related to only one element of the final price of stainless steel flat products, that too is not capable of justifying, in this case, a further reduction of the amount of the  fine.

115 It must be borne in mind that Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits, in particular, agreements and concerted practices between undertakings tending directly or indirectly to prevent, restrict or distort normal competition within the common market and, in particular, to fix or determine prices. As is clear from the case-law, the prohibition of agreements which, directly or indirectly, involve price fixing also extends to agreements relating to the fixing of a part of the final price (Case T-29/92 SPO and Others v  Commission [1995] ECR II-289, paragraph 146).

116 Since, moreover, it has been found that the increase of price stemming from the alloy surcharge could amount to up to 25% of the final price of the products (paragraph 48 of the Decision), the agreement's restrictive effect on competition cannot be underestimated.
117 For those reasons, this plea in law must be rejected.
4 - Cooperation by the applicant during the procedure
(a) Preliminary observations

118 In paragraph 96 of the Decision, the  Commission expressed the view that all the undertakings might benefit to varying degrees from the provisions of Section D of the Notice on Cooperation, entitled Significant reduction in a  fine.

119 In that connection, the Decision records the fact, first, that only Usinor and Avesta admitted the existence of the infringement. Moreover, Avesta forwarded to the  Commission on 31 October 1996 documents evidencing the existence of contacts between the undertakings concerned and it is the only undertaking to have brought the infringement to an end before the adoption of the Decision. Usinor, for its part, was the first to inform the  Commission of the Madrid meeting (paragraph 97 of the Decision). Second, with respect to the other undertakings and, in particular, Acerinox, the Decision indicates that the latter's statements and its reply to the statement of objections provided nothing new and denied its involvement in the infringement (paragraphs 99 and 100 of the Decision).

120 In the Decision, the  Commission infers from this that Usinor and Avesta cooperated extensively but nevertheless did so very belatedly. As regards the other undertakings, and Acerinox in particular, their cooperation was regarded as more limited than that of the first-mentioned undertakings since no documentary evidence not already in the possession of the  Commission was supplied and those undertakings did not acknowledge the infringement (paragraph 100 of the Decision).

121 In paragraph 101 of the Decision, the  Commission concluded that those factors justified a reduction of the fine by 10% for all the undertakings, with the exception of Avesta and Usinor, to which it applied a reduction of 40%.

122 The applicant criticises the  Commission for granting it a reduction of only 10% of its  fine on the incorrect basis that its statements and its reply to the statement of objections, first, provided no new documentary evidence and, second, denied the existence of the infringement.
(b) The failure to provide new information in the administrative procedure

123 The applicant submits that the  Commission infringed the principle of equal treatment by taking the view that its statement provided nothing new in that it furnished no new documentary evidence or facts not already in the possession of the  Commission.

124 The applicant states that, in its statement to the  Commission of 17 December 1996 in response to the question sent to it, it acknowledged the facts and, in particular, the holding of the Madrid meeting, in the same way as Usinor. Moreover, the more limited extent of its cooperation, as compared with that of Avesta and Usinor, was accounted for by its more limited knowledge of the operation of the contested agreement,
a situation which inevitably had repercussions on the value and nature of its participation in the Commission investigation. However, the applicant considers that it should not be penalised for failing to produce documentary evidence which it did not possess.

125 The Commission contends that it was not until 17 December 1996 that the applicant manifested its wish to co-operate, that is to say eight days after Usinor informed the  Commission of the Madrid meeting, without thereby having ever acknowledged its involvement in the infringement or even provided evidence not already in possession of the  Commission.
Findings of the Court

126 It must be borne in mind, as a preliminary point, that in its Notice on Cooperation the Commission defined the conditions under which undertakings co-operating with it in an investigation into a cartel may be exempted from a  fine or benefit from a reduction of the  fine they would otherwise have had to pay (see Section A(3) of the Notice on Cooperation).

127 As regards the applicant's case, it is not contested that it does not fall within the scope of Section B of the Notice on Cooperation, which deals with cases where an undertaking has reported a secret  cartel to the Commission before the Commission has initiated an investigation (in which case there may be a reduction of at least 75% of the fine) or within Section C of that notice, which is concerned with undertakings that have reported a secret  cartel after the  Commission has undertaken an investigation which has failed to disclose sufficient grounds for initiating the procedure leading to a decision (in which case there may be a reduction of 50 to 75% of the  fine).

128 Consequently, as is clearly indicated in paragraphs 93 to 96 of the Decision, since the applicant did not fulfil the conditions for the application of either Section B or Section C of the Notice on Cooperation, its conduct must be appraised by reference to Section D of that notice, entitled Significant reduction in a  fine.

129 According to Section D(1), [w]here an enterprise cooperates without having met all the conditions set out in Sections B or C, it will benefit from a reduction of 10% to 50% of the  fine that would have been imposed if it had not cooperated.
130 Section D(2) states:
Such cases may include the following:

- before a statement of objections is sent, an enterprise provides the  Commission with information, documents or other evidence which materially contribute to establishing the existence of the infringement;

- after receiving a statement of objections, an enterprise informs the  Commission that it does not substantially contest the facts on which the  Commission bases its allegations.

131 As regards appraisal of the cooperation shown by undertakings, the  Commission is not entitled to disregard the principle of equal treatment, a general principle of Community law which is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified (Case T-311/94 BPB de Eendracht v Commission [1998] ECR II-1129, paragraph 309 and the case-law there cited).

132 In this case, it is common ground that before the issue of the statement of objections on 24 April 1997, the applicant provided the  Commission with information that helped confirm the existence of the infringement, in accordance with the first indent of Section D 2 of the Notice on Cooperation.

133 The Commission observes in paragraph 92 of its Decision that [s]tatements acknowledging the facts were sent to the Commission by those undertakings on 17 December 1996 (Acerinox, ALZ, Avesta, Krupp and Thyssen [KTN], [Usinor]) and on 10 January 1997 (AST). As is clear from the file, Acerinox's statement admitted, in particular, the holding of the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993.

134 However, the  Commission considered that the cooperation shown by Acerinox was more limited than that of Avesta and Usinor since its statement disclosed nothing new. In that connection, it found that Usinor had been the first to inform the  Commission of the Madrid meeting (paragraph 97 of the Decision) and that

Page 28 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the other undertakings, such as the applicant, had thus not provided any documentary evidence or facts not already in the possession of the  Commission (paragraph 100 of the Decision).

135 It is necessary to determine whether, by making that finding, the  Commission infringed the principle of equal treatment and, therefore, misapplied Section D(2) of the Notice on Cooperation.

136 It is clear from the file, first, that, as the  Commission confirmed during the written procedure, Usinor informed it on 10 December 1996 of the holding of the Madrid meeting in response to a questionnaire given to it by Commission staff during an inspection carried out at the headquarters of that undertaking.

137 By way of measure of organisation of procedure, the Court of First Instance asked the  Commission to state whether it had sent to all the addressees of the Decision the same questions as those put to Usinor.
In its written reply, the  Commission confirmed that all the addressees of the Decision had in fact received the same questionnaire. It stated in particular that those questions were put to Acerinox on 10 December
1996 at a meeting with  Commission staff.

138 Moreover, it is important to point out that it has not been shown, or indeed alleged, that Acerinox was apprised of the answers given by Usinor which, by their nature, had to remain confidential, when it sent to the Commission its statement acknowledging the facts, in particular the holding of the Madrid meeting.

139 It is clear from the above that the extent of the cooperation provided by the applicant and Usinor must be regarded as comparable, in so far as those undertakings provided the  Commission, at the same stage of the administrative procedure and in similar circumstances, with similar information concerning the conduct imputed to them.

140 Accordingly, the mere fact that one of those undertakings was the first to acknowledge the contested facts in response to the questions put by the  Commission cannot constitute an objective reason for treating them differently. The appraisal of the extent of the cooperation shown by undertakings cannot depend on purely random factors, such as the order in which they are questioned by the  Commission.

141 It follows that, in so far as it considered that the applicant had provided it with no new information, the Commission failed to observe Section D 2 of the Notice on Cooperation and infringed the principle of equal treatment.
142 Consequently, the first part of the plea must be upheld. (c) Acknowledgement of the existence of the infringement Arguments of the parties
143 The applicant maintains that it should have benefited from the same reduction of 40% of the  fine as was granted to Avesta and Usinor for having acknowledged the existence of the infringement. According to the applicant, the  Commission could not accuse it of failing to acknowledge its involvement in an agreement when it manifestly was not even accused of having participated in it.
144 The Commission replies that the applicant's situation is not comparable to those of Avesta and
Usinor. Unlike those two undertakings, which acknowledged the existence of concertation (see paragraph
97 Decision), the applicant always denied its implication in the infringement (see paragraphs 87 and 100 of
the Decision).
Findings of the Court

145 Since the applicant claims that its cooperation during the administrative procedure justified the same reduction of 40% of the  fine as that granted to Avesta and Usinor, it is necessary to determine whether the Decision is vitiated by any error of fact or manifest error of assessment on this point.

146 It is important to bear in mind that, according to the Decision, [o]nly Usinor and Avesta acknowledged the existence of the concerted action (paragraph 97 of the Decision). With respect to the applicant, the Decision, after indicating that the applicant categorically denied having received any information (paragraph
87 of the Decision), then finds that, in its response to the statement of objections of 24 April 1997, Acerinox
... acknowledges ... that concerted action was taken, but denied its involvement (paragraph 99 of the
Decision). The  Commission inferred, in particular, that the cooperation shown by the applicant, which had
not acknowledged its implication in the infringement, had been more limited than that of Usinor and Avesta
and therefore justified only a reduction of 10% of the  fine (paragraphs 100 and 101 of the Decision).

147 It must be pointed out that, whilst it is undisputed that the applicant admitted the materiality of the facts on which the Commission relied, justifying a reduction of 10% of the  fine, there is nothing in the file to


Page 29 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
show, contrary to the applicant's assertion, that it too expressly acknowledged its involvement in the infringement.

148 According to settled case-law, a reduction of the  fine is justified only if the conduct of the undertaking concerned enabled the  Commission to establish the infringement more easily and, as the case may be, to put an end to it (BPB de Eendracht v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 325, Case T-338/94 Finnboard v Commission [1998] II-1617, paragraph 363, confirmed on appeal in Case C-298/98 P Finnboard v Commission [2000] I-10157, and Mayr-Melnhof v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 330). No
reduction is justified where, in its response to the statement of objections, the undertaking denies any participation in the infringement (BPB de Eendracht v  Commission, paragraph 326).

149 Accordingly, the  Commission was correct to consider that, by giving that answer, the applicant had not behaved in such a manner as to justify an additional reduction of the  fine for cooperation during the administrative procedure.
150 It follows that the second part of the applicant's plea must be rejected.
151 Accordingly, the first part of the applicant's plea must be upheld.

152 Consequently, having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the Court of First Instance, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, considers that, in respect of its cooperation during the administrative procedure, the applicant should have been granted a reduction of 20% of the  fine, as determined by the Decision before such cooperation was taken into account, because that undertaking informed the Commission of the holding of the Madrid meeting on the same basis as Avesta and Usinor but, unlike those undertakings, denied any participation in the infringement.
B - The plea alleging breach of the principle of equal treatment
Arguments of the parties

153 The applicant maintains that it was discriminated against as compared with Outokumpu, which was not even one of the addressees of the Decision despite having been involved in the procedure. Whilst it is true that Outokumpu did not participate in the Madrid meeting, it was nevertheless informed of the agreement concluded at that meeting and consequently adopted the method for calculating the alloy surcharge (paragraph 33 of the Decision). The fact that Outokumpu provided decisive evidence as to the existence of the agreement during a  Commission investigation carried out on 17 October 1996 could, at most, justify a reduction of the  fine to be imposed on it of 50% to 75% in accordance with Section C of the Notice on Cooperation, but not total exoneration.

154 The Commission states that although Outokumpu was excluded from the procedure, that was not because it cooperated but because it did not attend the Madrid meeting. In any event, the  Commission considers that the plea relating to the treatment of Outokumpu is irrelevant in this case, having regard to the case-law (Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 146).
Findings of the Court

155 According to settled case-law, the principle of equal treatment is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified (see paragraph 131 above).

156 Furthermore, it is important to remember that, according to the case-law, where an undertaking has acted in breach of Community competition law, it cannot escape being penalised altogether on the ground that another trader has not been  fined, when that trader's circumstances are not even the subject of proceedings before the Court (see, in particular, Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 197).

157 The allegation that the  Commission wrongly decided not to proceed against Outokumpu is therefore irrelevant to this case and must be rejected.
Exercise by the Court of its unlimited jurisdiction

158 The Court has upheld the first part of the applicant's plea concerning reduction of the  fine for its cooperation during the administrative procedure (see paragraphs 126 to 142 above). For the reasons already given (see paragraph 152 above), the Court considers that it is appropriate to grant the applicant a reduction of 20% of the  fine in that regard.

159 According to the Decision, before the deduction of 10% in respect of the applicant's cooperation during the procedure (paragraph 101 of the Decision), the basic amount of its  fine was set, in view of the gravity

Page 30 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and duration of the infringement, at ECU 5.6 million and was then reduced by 30% in respect of extenuating circumstances (paragraph 84 of the Decision), namely a sum of ECU 3 920 000.

160 For the reasons given above, it is appropriate to grant the applicant a reduction of 20% of the intermediate amount of ECU 3 920 000 in respect of its cooperation during the procedure, which is equivalent to a reduction of ECU 784 000. Consequently, the total amount of the  fine imposed on Acerinox will be set at ECU 3 136 000.

161 In view of the foregoing considerations and of the entry into force on 1 January 1999 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the  euro (OJ 1997 L 162, p. 1), the amount of those  fines must be expressed in euro.
Decision on costs: Costs
162 Under Article 87(3) of its Rules of Procedure, the Court of First Instance may, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, order that the costs be shared. In this case, it is appropriate to order the applicant to bear its own costs and two-thirds of those incurred by the  Commission.
Operative part:
On those grounds,
THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (First Chamber)
hereby:
1. Sets the amount of the  fine imposed on Compañía Española para la Fabricación de Aceros Inoxidables
SA at EUR 3 136 000;
2. For the rest, dismisses the application;

3. Orders Compañía Española para la Fabricación de Aceros Inoxidables SA to bear its own costs and to pay two-thirds of the  Commission's costs and orders the  Commission to bear one-third of its own costs.

(ECSC Treaty, Art. 65(5)) Summary:
1. Under Article 64(3)(d) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance, the adoption of measures of organisation of procedure may be proposed by the parties at any stage of the procedure and they may consist of requests that documents or any papers relating to the case be produced. However, to enable the Court to determine whether it is conducive to the proper conduct of the procedure to order the production of certain documents, the party requesting production must not only identify the documents requested but also provide the Court with at least minimum information indicating the utility of those documents for the purposes of the proceedings.
( see paras 30-31 )
2. The purpose of Article 23 of the ECSC Statute of the Court of Justice, concerning the transmission to the
Community judicature of documents relating to the case before it, is to enable the Community judicature to

Page 35 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
review the legality of the contested decision whilst ensuring that the rights of the defence are observed, and not to guarantee unconditional and unlimited access for all parties to the administrative file.

In particular, in the course of the proceedings before the Court internal  Commission documents are not to be communicated to the applicants unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional and the applicants make out a plausible case for the need to do so.
( see paras 33-34 )

3. For the purpose of applying the competition rules of the EC Treaty, the purpose of access to the file is in particular to enable the addressees of a statement of objections to acquaint themselves with the evidence in the Commission's file, so that they can express their views effectively, on the basis of that information, on the conclusions reached by the  Commission in its statement of objections. It follows that the Commission has an obligation to make available to the undertakings to which a statement of objections has been addressed all documents, whether in their favour or otherwise, which it had obtained during the
course of the investigation, with the exception of confidential documents, such as the internal documents of the Commission.

Those considerations are equally valid for the purpose of applying the competition rules of the ECSC Treaty.
( see paras 45-46 )

4. Just as the general principles of Community law governing, in competition cases, the right of access to the Commission's file during the administrative procedure do not apply, as such, to the procedure before Court, the provisions governing the procedure before the Court cannot be applied to the administrative procedure before the  Commission. Therefore, the  Commission is not obliged to make internal documents available during the administrative procedure.
( see paras 47-48 )

5. It falls, in principle, to the legal or natural person managing the undertaking in question when the infringement of the Community competition rules was committed to answer for that infringement, even if, when the decision finding the infringement was adopted, another person had assumed responsibility for running the undertaking.

That is not the case, however, when the person subsequently managing the undertaking in question makes a statement accepting responsibility for the conduct for which his predecessor was criticised. Such a statement, which in particular takes account of economic considerations specific to concentrations of undertakings, implies that the legal person within whose sphere of responsibility the business of another legal person was brought after the date of the infringement deriving from that business should be required
to be answerable for it, even though, in principle, it is incumbent upon the natural or legal person running the undertaking concerned at the time of the infringement to answer for it.

However, in so far as it constitutes an exception to the principle that a natural or legal person may be penalised only for acts imputed to it individually, such a statement must be interpreted strictly. In particular, unless he gives some indication to the contrary, the person making such a statement cannot be presumed to have waived the right to exercise his rights of defence and, in particular, his right to be heard regarding the acts imputed to his predecessor in the statement of objections notified to the latter.
( see paras 57, 62-64 )

6. The operative part and reasoning of the decision imposing a  fine for infringement of the competition rules, as notified to the addressee or addressees of the decision, must correspond to those of the decision adopted by the College of Commissioners, exception being made for any corrections merely of spelling and grammar which may still be made to the text of an act after its formal adoption by that college.
( see para. 73 )

7. The purpose of the compulsory publication of price lists and conditions of sale under Article 60(2) of the ECSC Treaty is, first, as far as possible to prevent prohibited practices; second, to enable purchasers to learn exactly what prices will be  charged and be able themselves to check whether any discrimination has taken place; and, third, to enable undertakings to have accurate knowledge of the prices of their competitors so as to enable them to align their prices. However, the prices on the lists must be fixed by each undertaking independently, without any agreement, even tacit, between them. In particular, the fact
that the provisions of Article 60 tend to restrict competition does not prevent application of the prohibition of agreements under Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

( see paras 116-117 )

8. In an action for annulment, a plea alleging absence of reasons or inadequacy of the reasons stated for the adoption of a Community act involves a matter of public policy which must be raised by the Community judicature of its own motion and, consequently, may be raised by the parties at any stage of the procedure.
( see para. 125 )

9. The statement of reasons required by Article 15 of the ECSC Treaty must, first, be such as to enable the person concerned to ascertain the matters relied upon to justify the measure adopted so that, if necessary, he can defend his rights and verify whether the decision is well founded and, secondly, enable the Community judicature to exercise its power of review of legality. The requirement of a statement of reasons must be viewed in the context of the circumstances of the case, in particular the terms of the measure in question, the nature of the reasons relied on and the context in which the measure was adopted.
( see para. 129 )

10. The Commission is not obliged to demonstrate that there was an adverse effect on competition in order to establish an infringement of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty provided that it has established the existence of an agreement or concerted practice intended to restrict competition.
( see para. 154 )

11. The prohibition of agreements and concerted practices which directly or indirectly fix prices also extends to agreements relating to the fixing of a part of the final price.
( see para. 157 )
12. With regard to cartels which are no longer in force, it is sufficient, for Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now
Article 81 EC), and by analogy Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, to be applicable that they continue to
produce their effects after they have formally ceased to be in force. The same applies a fortiori where, as in
this case, the effects of the agreement lasted until adoption of the Decision finding the infringement, without
the agreement having been formally brought to an end.
( see para. 181 )

13. The gravity of infringements of the competition rules falls to be determined by reference to numerous factors including, in particular, the specific circumstances and context of the case and the deterrent character of the  fines; moreover, no binding or exhaustive list of the criteria which must be applied has been drawn up. In that connection, factors relating to the intentional aspect, and thus to the object of a course of conduct, may be more significant than those relating to its effects, particularly where they relate to infringements which are intrinsically serious, such as price-fixing. In particular, an infringement of the competition rules may be regarded as having been committed intentionally if the undertaking could not have been unaware that the object of its conduct was the restriction of competition. It is not therefore necessary for an undertaking to have been aware that it was infringing those rules.
( see paras 198-200 )

14. As regards appraisal of the cooperation shown by undertakings during an administrative procedure initiated in relation to a prohibited agreement, the  Commission is not entitled to disregard the principle of equal treatment, a general principle of Community law which, according to settled case-law, is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified

In that regard, the mere fact that one of the undertakings participating in the cartel was the first to acknowledge the contested facts in response to the questions put by the Commission cannot constitute an objective reason for treating them differently. The appraisal of the extent of the cooperation shown by undertakings cannot depend on purely random factors, such as the order in which they are questioned by the Commission. The extent of the cooperation provided by the undertakings concerned must be regarded as comparable, in so far as those undertakings provided the  Commission, at the same stage of the administrative procedure and in similar circumstances, with similar information concerning the conduct imputed to them.
( see paras 237, 245-246 )

15. The criteria of coordination and cooperation necessary for determining the existence of a concerted practice are to be understood in the light of the concept inherent in the Treaty provisions on competition,


Page 37 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
according to which each trader must determine independently the policy which he intends to adopt on the common market and the conditions which he intends to offer to his customers.
( see para. 264 )

16. A reduction of a  fine is justified only if the conduct of the undertaking concerned enabled the Commission to establish the infringement more easily and, where relevant, bring it to an end. However, in the absence of an express statement that it is not contesting the  Commission's allegation of a concerted practice, an undertaking does not facilitate the  Commission's task of finding and bringing to an end infringements of Community competition law.

APPLICATION for the annulment of  Commission Decision 98/247/ECSC of 21 January 1998 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty (Case IV/35.814 - Alloy Surcharge) (OJ 1998 L 100, p.
55),
THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (First Chamber),
composed of: B. Vesterdorf, President, M. Vilaras and N.J. Forwood, Judges, Registrar: G. Herzig,
having regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 11 October 2000, gives the following
Judgment Grounds: Facts
1 Krupp Thyssen Nirosta GmbH (KTN), a company incorporated under  German law, came into being on 1
January 1995 as a result of a merger between Thyssen Stahl AG and Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch Krupp
(Krupp), which manufactured stainless steel flat products resistant to acids and high temperatures. On 16
September 1997 its name was changed to Krupp Thyssen Stainless GmbH (KTS).

2 Acciai Speciali Terni SpA (AST), a company incorporated under Italian law, whose principal activities include the production of stainless steel flat products, was set up on 1 January 1994 when the steel-making activities of the Italian group ILVA were split up into three undertakings with a view to subsequent sale. On
21 December 1994 the  Commission authorised the joint acquisition of AST by Krupp, Thyssen Stahl, AFL Falck, Tadfin SpA and FI.RE. Finanziaria SpA (Riva group) (Commission Decision 95/421/EC of 21
December 1994 declaring a concentration to be compatible with the common market (Case No IV/M.484 - Krupp/Thyssen/Riva/Falck/Tadfin/AST, OJ 1995 L 251, p. 18). In December 1995 Krupp increased its share in AST from 50% to 75% and then acquired all the shares in AST on 10 May 1996 (Commission Decision of 2 May 1996 declaring a concentration to be compatible with the common market (Case No IV/M.740 - KRUPP (II), OJ 1996 C 144, p.3). Those shares were then transferred to KTN, which had become KTS.

3 Stainless steel is a type of special steel whose main property is resistance to corrosion. This resistance is achieved by the use of different alloying materials (chrome, nickel, molybdenum) in the production process. Stainless steel is used in the form of flat products (plates or coils, cold or hot rolled) or long products (bars, wire rod, sections, hot rolled or finished). Flat products account for 82% of sales of finished stainless steel products. Most of those products are ECSC products within the meaning of Article 81 of the Treaty.

4 On 16 March 1995, following reports in the specialised press and complaints from consumers, the Commission, under Article 47 of the Treaty, asked a number of stainless steel producers for information concerning the application by those producers of a general price increase known as the alloy surcharge.

5 The alloy surcharge is a price supplement which is calculated on the basis of the prices of alloying materials and is added to the basic price for stainless steel. The cost of the alloying materials used by stainless steel producers (nickel, chromium and molybdenum) forms a very large proportion of the total production costs. The prices of those materials are extremely volatile.

6 The methods used for calculation of the alloy surcharge have varied depending on the period and the producer. In the course of inspections carried out under Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty and in certain letters to the Commission, the producers of stainless steel flat products stated that they had used the same formula for calculating the alloy surcharge, with the exception of the reference values (or trigger values), since 1988. However, in 1991, following a drop in the prices of alloying materials below the trigger values, the producers applied a zero alloy surcharge.

7 On the basis of the information obtained, and particularly copies of circulars sent by the producers concerned to their customers announcing a change to the bases used to calculate the alloy surcharge, the Commission served a statement of objections on 19 undertakings on 19 December 1995. The replies given by those undertakings prompted the  Commission to undertake further investigations under Article
47 of the ECSC Treaty.

8 In December 1996 and January 1997, after the  Commission had carried out a number of inspections, lawyers or representatives of a number of undertakings, including Krupp and AST, informed the Commission of their wish to cooperate. For that purpose, statements were sent to the  Commission: on
17 December 1996 by Compañía Española para la Fabricación de Aceros Inoxidables SA (Acerinox), ALZ NV, Avesta Sheffield AB (Avesta), KTN and Usinor SA (Usinor or Ugine, and on 10 January 1997 by AST.
9 On 24 April 1997 the  Commission served a new statement of objections replacing the statement of 19
December 1995 on those undertakings and on Thyssen Stahl.

10 On 21 January 1998 the  Commission adopted Decision 98/247/ECSC relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty (Case IV/35.814 - Alloy surcharge) (OJ 1998 L 100, p. 55, hereinafter the Decision).

11 According to the Decision, the prices for alloys and stainless steel fell sharply in 1993. When nickel prices started to rise in September 1993, producers' profits were considerably reduced. To remedy this, the producers of stainless flat products, other than Outokumpu, agreed, at a meeting held in Madrid on 16
December 1993 (hereinafter the Madrid meeting), to increase their prices on a concerted basis by changing the parameters for calculating the alloy surcharge. To that end they decided to apply, as from 1 February
1994, an alloy surcharge based on the method last used in 1991, taking for all producers the September
1993 prices as reference values, when the price of nickel had reached its historical low.

12 Thus, according to the Decision, producers calculated the amount of the alloy surcharge to be applied in a given month (M) in the different Community  currencies as follows: they calculated the average price of nickel, ferro-chromium and molybdenum in the two months preceding the month before the month of calculation (in other words, M-2 and M-3). Then they compared the values thus obtained with the reference values (or trigger values) since February 1994, namely: ECU 3 750/tonne for nickel, ECU 5 532/tonne for molybdenum and ECU 777/tonne for chromium. Under that system, if the difference between the average prices and the reference values is positive, a price supplement is added to the basic price of the steel concerned for the month M. If it is negative, no increase is applied. There is thus no negative alloy surcharge. Such a situation occurred between 1991 and 1993, when alloy prices fell below the trigger values then applicable and producers applied a zero alloy surcharge. The amounts reflecting a positive difference are multiplied by the percentage of each alloy in the quality of steel concerned.
13 According to the Decision, the alloy surcharge calculated on the basis of the newly determined
reference values was applied by all producers for their sales in  Europe as from 1 February 1994, except in
Spain and Portugal. In Spain the new alloy surcharge was applied in June 1994, Acerinox having indicated
at the Madrid meeting that the immediate application of the new alloy surcharge in Spain would not help to
increase demand and would not have a positive effect on Spanish industry which was in the depths of a
severe crisis. However, Acerinox too applied the new alloy surcharge as from 1 February 1994 in the other

Page 39 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Member States, and Denmark in particular. According to the Decision, that agreement led to a virtual doubling of stainless steel prices between January 1994 and March 1995.
14 The operative part of the Decision contains the following provisions: Article 1
[Acerinox], ALZ NV, [AST], [Avesta], Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG ([KTN] as from 1 January 1995), Thyssen Stahl AG ([KTN] as from 1 January 1995) and [Ugine] infringed Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, in the case of [Avesta] from December 1993 to November 1996 and, in the case of the other undertakings, up to the date of this Decision, namely by modifying and by applying in a concerted fashion the reference values used to calculate the alloy surcharge, such practice having both the object and the effect of restricting and distorting competition within the common market.
Article 2
The following  fines are hereby imposed in respect of the infringements described in Article 1: [Acerinox] ECU 3 530 000
ALZ NV ECU 4 540 000 [AST] ECU 4 540 000 [Avesta] ECU 2 810 000 [KTN] ECU 8 100 000 [Usinor] ECU 3 860 000
Article 3
...
Article 4

[Acerinox], ALZ NV, [AST], [KTN] and [Usinor] shall immediately put an end to the infringements referred to in Article 1 and shall inform the  Commission within three months of being notified of this Decision of the measures they have taken to that end.

The undertakings referred to in Article 1 shall refrain from repeating the acts or conduct specified in the said Article and from adopting any measure having an equivalent effect.

15 By fax of 21 January 1998 the Commission notified the operative part of the Decision to the applicants. By decision of 2 February 1998 the Commission replaced by other numbers the  bank account number appearing in the first paragraph of Article 3 of the operative part of the Decision notified on 21 January
1998 into which the  fines imposed were required to be paid (the decision of 2 February 1998). On 5
February 1998, the Decision, thus amended, was formally notified to its addressees.
Procedure

16 By applications lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 11 March 1998 (Case T-45/98) and 13 March 1998 (Case T-47/98) KTS and AST instituted the present proceedings. Acerinox also brought proceedings against the Decision (Case T-48/98).

17 Upon hearing the report of the Judge-Rapporteur, the Court of First Instance (First Chamber) decided to open the oral procedure. As a measure of organisation of procedure, it asked the  Commission to answer a number of written questions.

18 The parties presented oral argument and answered the questions put to them by the Court at the hearing on 11 October 2000.

19 After the views of the parties were heard on the matter, the Court of First Instance decided that the present cases should be joined for the purposes of the judgment in accordance with Article 50 of the Rules of Procedure.
Forms of order sought
20 The applicant in Case T-45/98 claims that the Court of First Instance should:

Page 40 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- Annul the Decision, as amended by the defendant's decision of 2 February 1998, in so far as it concerns the applicant;

- In the alternative, cancel the  fine imposed on the applicant by Article 2 of the Decision and annul the combined provisions of Article 4 and Article 1 of the Decision;

- In the further alternative, reduce the  fine imposed on the applicant by Article 2 of the Decision and annul the combined provisions of Article 4 and Article 1 of the Decision;
- Grant its request for measures of organisation of procedure;
- Order the Commission to pay the costs.
21 The Commission contends that the Court of First Instance should:
- Dismiss the action;
- Reject the request for measures of organisation of procedure;
- Order the applicant to pay the costs.
22 The applicant in Case T-47/98 claims that the Court of First Instance should:
- Annul the Decision in so far as it concerns the applicant;
- In the alternative, annul Articles 2 and 4 of the Decision in so far as they relate to the applicant;
- In the further alternative, reduce the  fine imposed on the applicant;
- Adopt the measures of organisation of procedure applied for;
- Order the Commission to pay the costs.
23 The Commission contends that the Court of First Instance should:
- Dismiss the action as unfounded;
- Order the applicant to pay the costs.
The requests for measures of organisation of procedure relating to  Commission internal documents
Arguments of the parties

24 During the written procedure, KTS and AST asked the Court to order the Commission to produce its internal documents relating to the Decision in so far as they might show that the Commission was aware of the application of the alloy surcharge. In support of their applications, they maintain that, because price lists were regularly notified to  Commission officials in accordance with the ECSC Treaty, those officials were or should have been aware of the use of the single formula for calculation of the alloy surcharge.

25 AST adds that access to those documents would also enable it to contest the allegation in paragraph 50 of the Decision that the price concertation dated not from 1993 but from 1988.

26 Furthermore, KTS, after consulting the file forwarded to the Registry on 17 December 1998 by the Commission, requested, by letter lodged at the Registry on 10 June 1999, that, by way of measure of organisation of procedure, the  Commission should be called on to prepare a complete list of the documents contained in folders XIX to XXII and to indicate, in each case, the reasons for which those documents could not be disclosed to it. In support of its application, KTS claims that such a measure is necessary to enable it to check whether those folders contained relevant documents which might justify its being granted access to them.

27 The Commission replies that it had no knowledge either of the single method of calculating the alloy surcharge or of the conditions for applying it, which were never notified to it, as the undertakings concerned merely notified to it the alloy surcharges applied by them respectively. Moreover, it is inappropriate to seek access to internal documents to verify the statement in paragraph 50 of the Decision that the infringement dated from about 1988 since, in the absence of adequate evidence, the Decision indicates that the infringement commenced in December 1993, the date of the Madrid meeting.

28 As regards KTS's application submitted by letter of 10 June 1999, the  Commission, in the observations which it lodged at the Registry on 25 August 1999, requested that it be rejected on the grounds, first, that it is not required to supply a detailed list of its internal documents to which access is not authorised and,
Page 41 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
second, that it is not required to specify, for each document, the overriding reasons for which access to those parts of the file must be refused to the undertakings concerned. It contends, in that connection, that the order of the Court of First Instance of 10 December 1997 in Joined Cases T-134/94, T-136/94,
T-137/94, T-138/94, T-141/94, T-145/94, T-147/94, T-148/94, T-151/94, T-156/94, and T-157/94 NMH Stahlwerke and Others v  Commission [1997] ECR II-2293 (hereinafter the Beams II order) does not impose any such obligation on it.
Findings of the Court

29 Article 64(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Court of First Instance provides [t]he purpose of measures of organisation of procedure shall be to ensure that cases are prepared for hearing, procedures carried out and disputes resolved under the best possible conditions.

30 According to Article 64(2)(a) and (b) of those rules, the purpose of measures of organisation of procedure is, in particular, to ensure efficient conduct of the written and oral procedure and to facilitate the taking of evidence and also to determine the points on which the parties must present further argument or which call for measures of inquiry. Under Article 64(3)(d) and (4) of those rules, the adoption of such measures may be proposed by the parties at any stage of the procedure and they may consist of requests that documents or any papers relating to the case to be produced.

31 However, to enable the Court to determine whether it is conducive to the proper conduct of the procedure to order the production of certain documents, the party requesting production must not only identify the documents requested but also provide the Court with at least minimum information indicating the utility of those documents for the purposes of the proceedings (Case C-185/95 P Baustahlgewebe v Commission [1998] I-8417, paragraph 93).

32 As regards, first, the requests for access to internal  Commission documents in the course of the proceedings before the Court, it must first be borne in mind that Article 23 of the ECSC Statute of the Court of Justice, which is applicable to the Court of First Instance by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 46 thereof, requires the defendant to transmit to the Community Court all the documents relating to the case before the Court and not just the documents which the defendant itself considers relevant in the light of the factual and legal arguments raised by the parties. Accordingly, the  Commission was under an obligation - which it fulfilled - to forward to the Court all the documents relating to the administrative procedure prior to adoption of the Decision, including its internal documents.

33 However, the purpose of Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice is to enable the Community judicature to review the legality of the contested decision whilst ensuring that the rights of the defence are observed, and not to guarantee unconditional and unlimited access for all parties to the administrative file (Beams II order, paragraph 32).

34 In particular, according to settled case-law internal documents are not to be communicated to the applicants unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional and the applicants make out a plausible case for the need to do so (order of the Court of Justice of 18 June 1986 in Joined Cases 142/84 and
156/84 BAT and Reynolds v  Commission [1986] Rec. p. 1899, paragraph 11, Case T-35/92 Deere v
Commission [1994] ECR II-957, paragraph 31, and the Beams II order, paragraphs 35 and 36).

35 In the circumstances of this case, the arguments of KTS and AST that access to the internal documents of the Commission would enable them to show that the  Commission was or should have been aware of the use of the calculation method for the alloy surcharge by the stainless steel producers are not based on any sound evidence, nor do they show the existence of exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the case-law cited above.

36 As stated by the  Commission in paragraph 61 of the Decision, in response to a similar argument put forward in the administrative procedure, the undertakings concerned disclosed to it only the amounts of the alloy surcharges applied by each of them. However, they never disclosed the calculation method itself or the conditions for its application. That finding, which is not contested, shows to be entirely unfounded the claim that the  Commission was aware of the infringement at issue, which, moreover, derived not from the use of a single method for calculation of the alloy surcharge incorporating variable calculation rates but
from the introduction into that calculation method, as from the same date and by all the undertakings concerned, of the same reference values for the alloying materials (chrome, nickel and molybdenum) with a view to securing a price increase.

37 As regards AST's argument that access to the  Commission's internal documents would enable it to contest the accusation that concertation began in 1988, it is entirely irrelevant, since in its Decision the Commission treated the concertation as dating back to December 1993, in the absence of adequate evidence (paragraphs 50 and 56 of the Decision).


Page 42 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
38 Consequently, it must be held that KTS and AST have neither made out a plausible case nor demonstrated the existence of exceptional circumstances such as to justify an exception to the general rule that internal  Commission documents are not available to applicants. Since they have thus failed to show that the measures applied for would be useful, the application must be rejected.

39 As regards, second, the separate application by KTS for production of a list of  Commission internal documents, it must be pointed out that KTS made that application solely to establish whether the documents concerned were ones to which it considered that it should have access. Since that argument is also insufficient to prove the utility of the measure applied for, the application cannot be upheld.
40 It follows that the applications for measures of organisation of procedure relating to  Commission
internal documents must be rejected.
The claim for annulment of Article 1 of the Decision
I - The pleas alleging breach of the rights of the defence
A - Access to the file
Arguments of the parties

41 The applicants maintain that they did not have sufficient access to the file during the administrative phase, particularly in the case of documents classified as internal. In particular, KTS claims that the Commission likewise failed to give it any indication as to the content of the documents kept from it. As regards the other internal documents which were placed in the file after 8 November 1995, the Commission likewise failed to give any information as to the number, importance and content of those documents, or even a list of them.
42 According to the applicants, the  Commission did not comply with the case-law of the Court of First
Instance on that point (order of the Court of First Instance of 19 June 1996 in Joined Cases T-134/94,
T-136/94, T-137/94, T-138/94, T-141/94, T-145/94, T-147/94, T-148/94, T-151/94, T-156/94 and T-157/94
NMH Stahlwerke and Others v  Commission [1996] ECR II-537, hereinafter the Beams I order, paragraphs
62 to 78, and the Beams II order, paragraphs 30 to 39). Access to those  Commission internal documents
is relevant in order to demonstrate the complicity of  Commission staff who were, or should have been,
aware of the use of the method for calculating the alloy surcharge by the stainless steel producers.
According to KTS, it is also contrary to the principle of economy of procedure for its right of access to
Commission internal documents to be exercisable only at the stage of court proceedings and not during
the administrative phase.

43 The Commission contends that the applicants are not entitled to be granted access to its internal documents (Case T-7/89 Hercules Chemicals v Commission [1991] ECR II-1711, paragraph 54). As regards the Beams I and Beams II orders, the Commission states that they concerned the scope of Article
23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and in particular the question of the conditions under which applicants may have access to its internal documents in the context of proceedings before the Court.
Findings of the Court

44 It must be borne in mind, at the outset, that the general principles of Community law governing the right of access to the  Commission file are intended to ensure effective exercise of the rights of the defence, including the right to be heard (Case C-51/92 P Hercules Chemicals v  Commission [1999] ECR I-4325, paragraph 76), which, in the case of competition proceedings initiated under the ECSC Treaty, is provided for in the first paragraph of Article 36 of that Treaty, according to which the  Commission, before taking a decision imposing one of the pecuniary sanctions provided for in that Treaty, must allow the person concerned an opportunity to submit his observations.

45 For the purpose of applying the competition rules of the EC Treaty, it is clear from settled case-law that the purpose of access to the file is in particular to enable the addressees of a statement of objections to acquaint themselves with the evidence in the  Commission's file, so that they can express their views effectively, on the basis of that information, on the conclusions reached by the Commission in its statement of objections (C-310/93 P BPB Industries and British Gypsum v Commission [1995] I-865, paragraph 21, Baustahlgewebe v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 89, and Case C-51/92 P Hercules Chemicals v Commission, cited above, paragraph 75).

46 It follows that the  Commission has an obligation to make available to the undertakings to which a statement of objections has been addressed all documents, whether in their favour or otherwise, which it had obtained during the course of the investigation, with the exception of confidential documents, such as the internal documents of the  Commission (Case T-65/89 BPB Industries and British Gypsum v Commission [1993] II-389, paragraph 29, as confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Justice in BPB
Page 43 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Industries and British Gypsum v Commission, cited above, paragraph 25; see also the judgment of 17
December 1991 in Hercules Chemicals v Commission, cited above, paragraph 54, Case T-221/95
Endemol v Commission [1991] ECR II-1299, paragraph 66). Those considerations are equally valid for the
purpose of applying the competition rules of the ECSC Treaty.

47 In this case, it must be held that the applicants, which do not contest having had access to the documents in the file on which the  Commission based the Decision, are merely claiming that they should also have had access to the internal documents of the  Commission during the administrative procedure. However, as has been stated, the  Commission is not obliged to make such documents available during the administrative procedure.

48 That conclusion is not undermined by the argument based on the Beams I and Beams II orders. It must be borne in mind that those orders concern the application of Article 23 of the ECSC Statute of the Court of Justice and, in particular, the conditions for access to internal  Commission documents during proceedings before the Court. However, just as the general principles of Community law governing the right of access to the Commission's file during the administrative procedure do not apply, as such, to the procedure before Court (Baustahlgewebe v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 90), the provisions governing the
procedure before the Court cannot be applied to the administrative procedure before the  Commission.

49 KTS's argument that it is contrary to the principle of economy of procedure not to grant access to internal Commission documents until the stage of proceedings before the Court is clearly irrelevant since, as already stated (see paragraphs 29 to 40 above), the conditions imposed by the case-law for such access to be available during the procedure before the Court are not, in any event, fulfilled.
50 It follows that the present plea is unfounded and must therefore be rejected.
B - Infringement of KTS's right to be heard regarding the conduct of Thyssen Stahl
Arguments of the parties

51 KTS maintains that the  Commission infringed the first paragraph of Article 36 of the ECSC Treaty on the ground that its right to be heard regarding the conduct imputed to Thyssen Stahl was not observed. It states that KTN, to which it was the successor, acquired as from 1 January 1995 the business of Thyssen Stahl in the stainless steel flat products sector and agreed, as purchaser, to accept liability for any infringements committed by that undertaking.

52 However, KTN never waived the right to be the subject of a new procedure in the event of the Commission imposing a fine on it for the conduct of Thyssen Stahl. It states, in that connection, that, during an inspection at the premises of KTN on 8 October 1996, the Commission did not disclose that the procedure against Thyssen Stahl would concern it as from that time. The Commission even notified the new statement of objections of 24 April 1997 not only to KTN but also to Thyssen Stahl, and the two undertakings expressed their views on it separately. In its reply of 30 June 1997 to the statement objections, KTN also expressly indicated that its views related only to the  charges concerning it.

53 The Commission points out that, by letter of 23 July 1997, KTN declared that, following the takeover of Thyssen Stahl's stainless steel flat products business, it accepted liability for any conduct of the latter in respect of products covered by the present procedure and also for the period dating back to 1993.

54 According to the  Commission, it was precisely because it conducted a dual administrative procedure that it then asked KTN whether it was prepared to assume liability for the conduct of which Thyssen Stahl was accused. At the date of KTN's statement, Thyssen Stahl had moreover already expressed its views on the statement of objections. Accordingly, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, KTN's statement could relate only to the state of advancement of the procedure at that time, the reference number thereof being expressly mentioned in its statement. Consequently, according to the  Commission, that statement was concerned not with the assumption of liability to pay any  fine that might be imposed on Thyssen Stahl but with the acceptance of liability for any conduct on the part of Thyssen Stahl relating to stainless steel
flat products. That interpretation is confirmed by the fact that, if KTN had answered in the negative the question whether it assumed liability for Thyssen Stahl's conduct, the  Commission would merely have imposed a fine on the latter but would not have initiated a new procedure against KTN.
Findings of the Court

55 The rights of the defence on which KTN relies are, in this case, safeguarded by the first paragraph of Article 36 of the ECSC Treaty, pursuant to which, before imposing any pecuniary sanction provided for by the Treaty, the  Commission must give the party concerned the opportunity to submit its comments.

56 According to settled case-law, respect for the rights of the defence in all proceedings in which sanctions may be imposed is a fundamental principle of Community law which must be observed in all
Page 44 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
circumstances, even if the proceedings in question are administrative proceedings. The proper observance of that general principle requires that the undertaking concerned be afforded the opportunity, from the
stage of the administrative procedure, to make known its views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the documents relied on by the Commission in support of its allegations (Joined Cases 100/80 to 103/80 Musique Diffusion Française v Commission [1983] ECR 1825, paragraph
10; see also Case T-30/91 Solvay v Commission, [1995] II-1775, paragraph 59, and the case-law there cited). It follows, in particular, that the Commission may rely only on facts on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to make known their views (Musique Diffusion Française, paragraph 14).

57 It must also be borne in mind that it falls, in principle, to the legal or natural person managing the undertaking in question when the infringement was committed to answer for that infringement, even if, when the decision finding the infringement was adopted, another person had assumed responsibility for
running the undertaking. (see, in particular Case C-279/98 P Cascades v  Commission [2000] ECR I-9693, paragraph 78).

58 In this case, it is clear from the file, first, that on 24 April 1997, KTN and Thyssen Stahl were each addressees of the statement of objections and that each of those undertakings replied to it separately by letters from their respective representatives on 30 June 1997. In its reply to the statement of objections, KTN also expressly stated that it was submitting its observations in the name and on behalf of KTN.
59 Second, it is clear that KTN, which was succeeded by the applicant KTS, agreed by its letter of 23 July
1997 to the  Commission to be held liable for conduct imputed to Thyssen Stahl for the period from 1993,
even though Thyssen Stahl's business in the product sector concerned had not been transferred to it until 1
January 1995.
60 In fact, in its abovementioned letter, KTN expressly stated:

With regard to the abovementioned proceeding [Case IV/35.814 - KTN], you made a request to the legal representative of Thyssen Stahl ... that [KTN] should expressly confirm that it took over liability for any acts done by Thyssen Stahl following the transfer of Thyssen Stahl's stainless steel flat products business, in so far as the stainless steel flat products at issue in these proceedings are concerned, and this also applies to the period dating back to 1993. We hereby expressly give you that confirmation.

61 Finally, in paragraph 102 of the Decision, the  Commission inferred from that statement that account should be taken of it in the operative part of the Decision. Consequently, the  Commission considered KTN to be responsible for those acts of Thyssen Stahl which were regarded as contrary to Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty (Article 1 of the Decision) and therefore imposed on it a fine relating also to the acts imputed to Thyssen Stahl (Article 2 of the Decision). In that connection, the Commission expressed the view, in paragraph 78 of the Decision, that the duration of the infringement imputed to Thyssen Stahl extended from December 1993, the date of the Madrid meeting at which the concertation between the producers of stainless steel flat products commenced, to 21 January 1995, the date on which Thyssen Stahl ceased business in that sector.

62 It must be emphasised that it is undisputed that, in view of the statement made by KTN on 23 July 1997, the Commission was, by way of exception, entitled to impute to KTN liability for the unlawful conduct of which Thyssen Stahl was accused between December 1993 and 1 January 1995. It must be concluded
that such a statement, which in particular takes account of economic considerations specific to concentrations of undertakings, implies that the legal person within whose sphere of responsibility the business of another legal person was brought after the date of the infringement deriving from that business should be required to be answerable for it, even though, in principle, it is incumbent upon the natural or legal person running the undertaking concerned at the time of the infringement to answer for it.

63 However, in so far as it constitutes an exception to the principle that a natural or legal person may be penalised only for acts imputed to it individually, such a statement must be interpreted strictly. In particular, unless he gives some indication to the contrary, the person making such a statement cannot be presumed to have waived the right to exercise his rights of defence.

64 However, contrary to what, in essence, the  Commission contends, KTN's statement of 23 July 1997 could not be interpreted as implying, in addition, a waiver of its right to be heard regarding the acts imputed to Thyssen Stahl in the statement of objections notified to Thyssen Stahl on 24 April 1997, for which KTN agreed from that time to be held responsible for the purposes of the imposition of any  fine.

65 That is particularly true since the statement of objections was sent separately to KTN and Thyssen Stahl and, quite clearly, that statement did not attribute to KTN liability for the acts alleged against Thyssen Stahl.

66 It must therefore be held in this case that the  Commission did not give KTN an opportunity to submit its comments on the reality and relevance of the acts imputed to Thyssen Stahl and that, consequently, KTN was not able to exercise its rights of defence in that connection.
Page 45 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
67 Accordingly, as is clear from the case-law, the Commission was not entitled to attribute liability for the acts of Thyssen Stahl to KTN or, consequently, to impose a fine on KTN in respect of the acts attributed to Thyssen Stahl when, on that point, the statement of objections was addressed only to the latter (see Joined Cases C-395/96 P and C-396/96 P Compagnie Maritime Belge Transports and Others v  Commission [2000] ECR I-1365, paragraph 146).

68 In view of the foregoing, KTN's plea must be declared well founded and therefore Article 1 of the Decision must be annulled to the extent to which it imputes to KTN the infringement of which Thyssen Stahl was accused.
II - The plea alleging a formal defect
Arguments of the parties

69 The applicants maintain that the Decision was not properly adopted, on the ground that it was corrected and amended by the decision of 2 February 1998 without details being given of the errors of law affecting the Decision and without any indication being given whether those errors had been removed, which constitutes an infringement of the  Commission's Rules of Procedure.

70 In addition, AST maintains that paragraph 38 and 40 of the Decision were omitted in the copy notified to it, which constitutes a severe formal defect in that AST was thus not in a position to be fully apprised of the Commission's reasoning and to defend itself.

71 Not having had access to the file in the administrative phase of the procedure, the applicants request that measures of organisation of procedure be ordered by the Court for that purpose.

72 The Commission states that the alleged error of law corrected by the decision of 2 February 1998 related to the indication in the first paragraph of Article 3 of the Decision of the numbers of the  bank accounts into which the  fines imposed were to be paid. It emphasises that, in its letter of 5 February 1998 accompanying the formal notification of the Decision to the applicants and to the other undertakings, that correction was expressly mentioned. Moreover, the Decision, as forwarded to the parties by fax on 21
January 1998, was absolutely identical to the one served on them by letter of 5 February 1998.
Findings of the Court

73 It is clear from the case-law that the operative part and reasoning of the decision notified to the addressee or addressees of the decision must correspond to those of the decision adopted by the College of Commissioners, exception being made for any corrections merely of spelling and grammar which may still be made to the text of an act after its formal adoption by that college (Case C-137/92 P  Commission v BASF and Others [1994] ECR I-2555, paragraphs 62 to 70).

74 In this case, the first paragraph of Article 3 of the operative part of the Decision, as forwarded to the parties on 21 January 1998, contained a bank account number for payment of the  fines imposed. By its decision of 2 February 1998 the Commission replaced that number by several different account numbers. That change, the only one made by the decision of 2 February 1998, was included in the text of the Decision formally notified to the applicants on 5 February 1998 together with a letter in which the correction made by the College of Commissioners was also expressly mentioned. It is undisputed that no other change was made to the Decision. Consequently, since the Decision, as notified to the applicants, corresponds to the one adopted by the College of Commissioners, the argument alleging irregularities in
the adoption of the Decision is unfounded.

75 As regards the alleged omission of paragraphs 38 and 40 of the Decision, as notified to AST, it need merely be stated that it derived from a simple error of numbering to which no importance can be attached because, in the text of the Decision notified to AST, those paragraphs corresponded to the second subparagraphs of paragraph 37 and paragraph 39 respectively.

76 In those circumstances, the present plea must be rejected and there is no reason to grant the request for measures of organisation of procedure.

III - The pleas alleging inadequacy of the statement of reasons, manifest errors of assessment of the facts and errors in law
A - The origin of the infringement
Arguments of the parties

77 The applicants maintain that the Decision is vitiated by errors of assessment and misuse of powers in that it is based on unproven statements concerning the origin of the method of calculating the alloy

Page 46 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
surcharge that were capable of influencing the appraisal of the infringement penalised by the Decision and the amount of the  fine decided upon.

78 The applicants criticise the  Commission for indicating, in paragraphs 19, 50 and 56 of the Decision, that a single method for calculating the alloy surcharge had been used by stainless steel producers since
1988 and was the result of concertation, so that the concerted change of the reference values, from 1994, was merely a development of that process. In that connection, they criticise it, in particular, for referring to Commission Decision 90/417/ECSC of 18 July 1990 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty concerning an agreement and concerted practices engaged in by  European producers of
cold-rolled stainless steel flat products (OJ 1990 L 220, p. 28).

79 In addition, AST considers that the  Commission's statement in paragraph 55 of the Decision that the calculation values included in the alloy surcharge formula can be compared to recommendations within the meaning of the  Commission notice concerning agreements, decisions and concerted practices in the field of cooperation between enterprises (Journal Officiel 1968 C 75, p. 3, hereinafter the 1968 notice) was
made solely in order to imply that the purpose of the agreement was considerably more serious that it was in fact.

80 In order to examine the matters on which the  Commission based all those findings, AST asks the Court to order production of the  Commission's internal documents.

81 The Commission replies that no infringement of the competition rules is attributed to the applicants for the period before 1993. Moreover, the appraisal of facts dating back beyond that date had no impact on the assessment of the infringement or calculation of the  fine.
Findings of the Court

82 It must be pointed out that the subject-matter of the agreement described, in particular, in paragraph 47 of the Decision was the use with effect from the same date by all the producers of stainless steel flat products of identical reference values in the method for calculating the alloy surcharge, a method that had been used previously, with a view to securing an increase in the price of stainless steel flat products.

83 Moreover, with regard to the duration of the infringement, it is important to note that the  Commission stated, in paragraph 50 of the Decision, that although there were indeed reasons for thinking that the agreement originated in 1988, the date on which the undertakings used an identical calculation method for the alloy surcharge, the facts were not sufficiently established on that point. It inferred that the agreement, deriving from a concerted change in the reference values in that calculation method, had commenced at the Madrid meeting in December 1993 and continued until the date on which the Decision was adopted.
Accordingly, with regard to the duration of the infringement, the  Commission adopted a period of only four years, representing the period between the date of the Madrid meeting and the date of adoption of the Decision, except in the case of Avesta and Thyssen Stahl, for which it considered that the duration of the infringement was shorter (paragraph 78 of the Decision).

84 It follows that, contrary to the applicants' assertion, the fact that the  Commission may have considered that the origin of the agreement dated back to 1988, when the undertakings used an identical formula for calculating the alloy surcharge, had no legal repercussions on either the characterisation of the infringement or the calculation of the  fine. Consequently, that consideration is not such as to affect the legality of the Decision.

85 The same applies to the reference, in paragraphs 19 and 56 of the Decision, to Decision 90/417/ECSC, which, it must be held, was made only in order to describe the circumstances in which the method for calculating the alloy surcharge was used, and not in order to assess the purpose, effect or duration of the agreement covered by the Decision, or to calculate the  fine.

86 The argument that the reference to the 1968 notice sought to establish that the purpose of the agreement was considerably more serious than it in fact was must also be rejected.

87 It must be concluded that the  Commission referred to that notice in order to show that, contrary to the assertion of the undertakings concerned, its position on agreements concerning calculation models was necessarily known to them. In paragraphs 62 and 63 of the Decision, it thus observed that, under the 1968 notice, agreements having as their sole object the joint preparation of calculation models are not to be regarded as restricting competition but, that, on the other hand, that is not the case where such models contain specified rates of calculation. Referring, on that point, to its decision-making practice, it stated that models of that kind were comparable to recommendations restricting competition, in so far as such models are liable, by enabling undertakings to calculate their costs, to influence their pricing policy.



Page 47 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
88 In this case, AST has not produced any evidence such as to indicate that those findings are not well founded, nor has it demonstrated that the  Commission was pursuing any aim other than that of showing that the agreement covered by the Decision restricted competition.

89 Finally, it must be observed that AST has not made out any plausible case or demonstrated the existence of exceptional circumstances such as to justify an exception to the general rule that internal Commission documents are not available to applicants. Consequently, its request for the production of such documents must be rejected.
90 It follows from all the foregoing that the present plea must be rejected. B - The purpose of the agreement and the characterisation of it
1. The description of the Madrid meeting
Arguments of the parties

91 The applicants maintain that the purpose of the Madrid meeting is incorrectly and imprecisely described in paragraph 44 of the Decision. The description given implies that the undertakings concerned acted in concert regarding not only the introduction and application of the reference values for the alloys covered by the calculation method for the alloy surcharge but also the adoption of an identical calculation method.
Such a finding contradicts the statement that the use of an identical method dated back to about 1988.

92 AST adds that the purpose of the agreement is described in a contradictory and imprecise manner. Whilst the wording of paragraph 70 of the Decision is correct, in that it indicates that the purpose of the agreement was only to change the reference values in the method of calculation of the alloy surcharge, without any commitment as to their being maintained thereafter, Article 1 of the operative part nevertheless defines the infringement as deriving not only from the change but also from the application of those values in a concerted manner. However, there is nothing to show that the Madrid meeting was also concerned
with maintaining the reference values whose use had been decided upon.

93 The Commission considers that the applicants' arguments concerning the true purpose of the Madrid meeting are unfounded since it did not express any view in the Decision on the adoption of a single method for calculating the alloy surcharge but commented on the use, in the existing calculation method, of
identical new reference values for all the undertakings in question. As regards AST's argument, it purports to deny the continuous nature of the infringement.
Findings of the Court
94 It must be pointed out that paragraph 44 of the Decision states:

... the Madrid meeting had a single aim: to secure an across-the-board increase in stainless steel prices to offset the rise in the price of alloys. A discussion took place of the different methods used in the past to calculate the alloy surcharge and, following the meeting, all the undertakings took identical action. They applied to their sales in  Europe, except in Spain and Portugal, from 1 February 1994, an alloy surcharge based on the method last used in 1991, taking the September 1993 prices as reference values. ....

95 As is also confirmed by paragraph 45 the Decision, which refers to the reintroduction by the stainless steel producers of the alloy surcharge by deliberately identical methods as to value and date, the Commission's appraisal thus related not to the use of a single calculation method as such, whose origin pre-dated 1993, but to the incorporation in that calculation method of identical reference values for all the undertakings.

96 As already stated (see paragraph 82 above), it inferred, in paragraph 47 of the Decision, that the purpose of the agreement was the use by all the undertakings, as from the same date, of identical reference values in the method of calculating the alloy surcharge, a method used previously, with a view to securing an increase in stainless steel prices.

97 It follows that the Madrid meeting is not described, in the Decision, as relating to the adoption of a method for calculating alloy surcharge but as being concerned with the incorporation in that method of identical reference values for all the producers.

98 As regards AST's argument that the purpose of the agreement is defined in a contradictory and imprecise manner, in so far as there is no proof that it also related to maintenance of the reference values incorporated in the method of calculating the alloy surcharge, it too must be rejected. By stating that the purpose of the agreement was the use of the same reference values in that calculation method, the Commission necessarily took the view that the undertakings concerned were pursuing the aim of actually applying those values. The question whether the  Commission has shown, to the requisite legal standard,

Page 48 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
that that was the case is a matter to be examined in relation to the plea concerning the duration of the infringement (see paragraphs 174 to 184 below).
99 The present plea must therefore be rejected.
2. The alignment of prices and alloy surcharges
Arguments of the parties

100 The applicants consider that the  Commission's findings concerning the way the alloy surcharge was applied in practice are irrelevant. They maintain that the Decision is vitiated by a manifested error of assessment of the facts and by an error in law on this point, in so far as it criticises the undertakings for having aligned their prices for stainless steel flat products, outside their national market, on the prices charged by a single producer (third subparagraph of paragraph 39 of the Decision).

101 The applicants claim that Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty expressly provides for a mechanism for the alignment of prices under which, for prices applied outside their national market, producers align their prices on those of the national producer or, in the absence thereof, those of the main supplier. Since the alignment of prices is a result of independent conduct, it has no probative value as evidence to support a finding of the existence of an agreement within the meaning of Article 65 of that Treaty. Accordingly, the statements made by AST, cited in paragraphs 38 and 40 of the Decision, are also irrelevant in so far as they referred only to prices being aligned, and moreover not uniformly aligned, according to paragraph 40 of the Decision.

102 AST also maintains that those views on the alignment of the prices of stainless steel flat products show that the  Commission committed a manifest error of assessment regarding the purpose of the agreement
by taking the view that it was also concerned with the prices of flat products rather than with the alloy surcharge alone.

103 Finally, the applicants consider that the erroneous and unreasoned nature of the Decision as regards assessment of the conduct of the undertakings on the market is confirmed by the linguistic differences between the  German and Italian versions of the Decision. The  German version of the Decision indicates in paragraph 39 that the undertakings reached agreement (geeinigt) on the price list of the same producer, whereas according to the Italian version those undertakings aligned themselves (si sono allineate). The German version of the Decision is manifestly incorrect on this point since it does not correspond with
AST's statements cited in support of that proposition either. In its reply, KTS states that the Commission itself admits that the expression geeinigt may be misleading, but considers that the Commission does not draw the necessary inferences regarding the contradictory nature of the statement of reasons.

104 The applicants request, in any event, that an expert opinion be obtained under Article 25 of the Statute of the Court of Justice with a view to establishing whether substantial differences exist between the various language versions of the Decision and, in particular, between the  German and Italian versions.

105 The Commission replies that the Decision is concerned not with an agreement as to the application of an identical price list for flat products but with an agreement concerning the use, under identical conditions, of the alloy surcharge calculation method. In that context, paragraph 39 of the Decision gives only one example of the way in which the alloy surcharge formula is applied and the question whether the undertakings did or did not agree on the prices for flat products is of no importance, particularly with regard to calculation of the  fine. In that connection, it is clear from paragraphs 29 to 36 of the Decision that, following the Madrid meeting, the undertakings decided to apply the alloy surcharge on all markets, both domestic and foreign, as is confirmed, moreover, by the memorandum from AST referred to in paragraph
38 of the Decision. As is clear, also, from paragraph 42 et seq. of the Decision, those arrangements for applying the alloy surcharge meant that every producer was in a position to know in advance the attitude which would be adopted by all the undertakings.

106 In those circumstances, the price alignment mechanism provided for in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty was not in any way disregarded and paragraph 39 of the  German version of the Decision could only have been misleading if considered in isolation.
Findings of the Court

107 It is necessary first to consider whether, as the applicants claim, the Decision was vitiated by errors of assessment regarding its description of the practical arrangements for applying the alloy surcharge, set out in paragraphs 37 to 41 of the Decision.

108 It must be pointed out at the outset that, contrary to their assertion, the Decision does not find against applicants for an infringement deriving from an agreement on the prices of stainless steel flat products but only, as has been stated (see paragraph 82 above), for their participation in an agreement concerning the
Page 49 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
introduction and application, in a concerted manner, of the same reference values for alloys in the formula for calculating the alloy surcharge.

109 Accordingly, the fact that reference was made in the third subparagraph of Article 39 of the Decision to the alignment by the undertakings concerned of prices for stainless steel flat products, outside their domestic markets, on the basis of the price list applied by one of the producers had no impact on the legal assessment of the infringement carried out by the  Commission or on the determination of the  fines, a fact which, moreover, the applicants do not dispute.

110 It should next be noted that, in the Decision, the  Commission described the practical arrangements for application of the alloy surcharge by reference to circumstances other than those relating to the alignment of prices for stainless steel flat products, which was only one aspect of the context in which concertation took place.

111 The Decision relies principally on an Avesta memorandum of 17 January 1994 describing, following the Madrid meeting, the arrangements for applying the alloy surcharge, which states, in particular, as follows (paragraph 38 of the Decision): We will follow the rules set by the home producer in any given producer market, including applying the surcharge they declare. According to the Decision, that memorandum also stated (paragraph 40 of the Decision): In the national markets in which [Avesta] was
neither the domestic producer nor, in markets with no domestic producer, the leading supplier, typically, but not uniformly, [Avesta] would align on the domestic producer or leading supplier as was traditional in the stainless steel industry generally.

112 It is also stated, in paragraph 41 of the Decision, that several producers sent letters to their customers announcing, following the Madrid meeting, changes to the reference values to be used for calculation of the alloy surcharge. In one of those letters, dated 31 January 1994, one of the producers indicates, in
particular, that we have no choice but to implement alloy surcharges on all stainless flat products in line with all other manufacturers.

113 In the light of the above evidence, it has not therefore been shown that the Decision, in finding that the undertakings concerned in fact voluntarily aligned the alloy surcharges following the Madrid meeting, is vitiated by errors of assessment.

114 Since, in addition, the Decision clearly set out the  Commission's reasoning in reaching that conclusion, the argument that the statement of reasons was inadequate on that point cannot be upheld.

115 It is necessary, second, to consider whether, as claimed by the applicants, the Decision is vitiated by an error of law in that it disregarded the mechanism for the alignment of prices provided for by Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty.

116 In that connection, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the purpose of the compulsory publication of prices under Article 60(2) of the Treaty is, first, as far as possible to prevent prohibited practices; second, to enable purchasers to learn exactly what prices will be  charged and be able themselves to check whether any discrimination has taken place; and, third, to enable undertakings to have accurate knowledge of the prices of their competitors so as to enable them to align their prices (Case 1/54
France v High Authority [1954] ECR 7, p. 9, and Case 149/78 Rumi v  Commission [1979] ECR 2523, paragraph 10).

117 However, the prices on the lists must be fixed by each undertaking independently, without any agreement, even tacit, between them. In particular, the fact that the provisions of Article 60 tend to restrict competition does not prevent application of the prohibition of agreements under Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty (France v High Authority, cited above, p. 14, and Case T-141/94 Thyssen Stahl v  Commission [1999] II-347, paragraph 312).

118 Moreover, Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty does not provide for any contact between undertakings, prior to the publication of price lists, for the purpose of exchanging information on their future prices. In so far as such contacts prevent price lists being fixed independently, they are liable to distort normal competition within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the Treaty (Thyssen Stahl v  Commission, cited above, paragraph
313).

119 In this case, it may indeed be undisputed that, pursuant to Article 60(2)(a) of the ECSC Treaty, the stainless steel producers released themselves from the obligation to publish their prices and conditions of sale by sending details of them regularly to the  Commission and that, on that basis, those undertakings each notified the  Commission of the amounts of the alloy surcharges which they were going to apply as from 1 February 1994 (paragraph 37 of the Decision).

120 However, the applicants cannot properly invoke the alignment mechanism provided for by the abovementioned provisions since the alignment of the reference values to be used in calculating the alloy
Page 50 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
surcharge referred to in the documents cited by the  Commission in paragraphs 38, 40 and 41 of the Decision resulted not from the publication of price lists but from prior concertation between producers, at the Madrid meeting, whereby it was agreed to adopt identical reference values with a view to facilitating upward harmonisation of the alloy surcharges.

121 It follows that the  Commission did not disregard the mechanism for price alignment provided for in Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty and that, therefore, the Decision is not vitiated by any error of law in that respect.

122 As regards the argument concerning differences between the  German and Italian versions of the Decision, it need merely be pointed out that the wording used in paragraph 39 of the  German version of the Decision regarding alignment of the prices of stainless steel flat products had no influence on the
characterisation of the conduct imputed to the undertakings in question which, as already stated, related to the arrangements for applying the method of calculating the alloy surcharge and not to the final price of the abovementioned products. Therefore, the request for an expert opinion must be rejected.
123 It follows from the foregoing considerations that the present plea is unfounded and must be rejected.
3. Inadequacy of the statement of reasons concerning the definition of agreement or concerted practice
Admissibility of the plea

124 The Commission contends that, since this plea was not raised by KTS until the stage of its reply, it is a new plea which must be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance.

125 According to the case-law, a plea alleging absence of reasons or inadequacy of the reasons stated involves a matter of public policy which must be raised by the Community judicature of its own motion (Case C-367/95 P  Commission v Sytraval and Brink's France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 67) and, consequently, may be raised by the parties at any stage of the procedure (Case C-166/95 P  Commission v Daffix [1997] ECR I-983, paragraph 25).
126 The plea is therefore admissible. The substance of the plea
Arguments of the parties

127 KTS maintains, in its reply, that the  Commission infringed Article 15 of the ECSC Treaty, which requires it to give reasons for its decisions, since it merged the  charges concerning a concerted practice and an agreement.

128 The Commission replies that the fact of defining a consensus as an agreement and, in the alternative, as a concerted practice does not constitute an ambiguous statement of reasons within the meaning of the case-law (Case T-1/89 Rhône-Poulenc v  Commission [1991] ECR II-867, paragraphs 119 to 124).
Findings of the court

129 The statement of reasons required by Article 15 of the ECSC Treaty must, first, be such as to enable the person concerned to ascertain the matters relied upon to justify the measure adopted so that, if necessary, he can defend his rights and verify whether the decision is well founded and, secondly, enable the Community judicature to exercise its power of review of legality. The requirement of a statement of reasons must be viewed in the context of the circumstances of the case, in particular the terms of the measure in question, the nature of the reasons relied on and the context in which the measure was adopted (Case T-57/91 NALOO V  Commission [1996] ECR II-1019, paragraphs 298 and 300).

130 In this case, it is necessary to decide whether the definition of the consensus as an agreement and, in the alternative, as a concerted practice, within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, constitutes a sufficient statement of reasons. To that end, it is necessary to consider whether the Decision adequately explains whether the preconditions for using each of those two terms are fulfilled.

131 As regards the characterisation of the consensus as an agreement, the Decision states that Article 65 of the Treaty is infringed if the parties reach a consensus which limits or is likely to limit their commercial freedom by determining the lines of their mutual action on the market or abstention from action on the market, adding that no contractual sanctions or enforcement procedures are required, nor is it necessary for such a consensus to be made in writing (paragraph 43 of the Decision).

132 With regard to the facts of this case, paragraph 44 of the Decision indicates the elements which show the existence of a consensus between the undertakings concerned. In that connection, it states first that
Page 51 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the aim of the Madrid meeting was to secure an across-the-board increase in stainless steel prices to offset the rise in the price of alloys and that, at that meeting, a discussion took place of the different methods
used in the past to calculate the alloy surcharge. It then states that, after that meeting, all the undertakings took identical action, consisting of the application to their sales in  Europe as from 1 February 1994, except in Spain and Portugal, of an alloy surcharge based on the method used in 1991, taking the September
1993 prices of alloying materials as reference values.
133 Finally, the Decision observes that the consensus was confirmed in the fax from Ugine of 20
December 1993 addressed to all the producers present at the Madrid meeting, and to Outokumpu, which
reflects the conclusions of that meeting, giving details of the calculation of the alloy surcharge, including the
trigger values, the ECU/USD and USD/ECU rates of exchange for alloying materials (nickel, chrome,
molybdenum), the reference months and the standard alloy contents.

134 In that connection, the Decision also mentions that the characterisation of the consensus as an agreement is confirmed by the contents of the circulars referred to in paragraph 41 of the Decision by
which the various producers announced to their customers the reintroduction of the alloy surcharge. In one of those letters, dated 28 January 1994, Ugine Savoie UK indicated that ... it has therefore been decided at a European level to reactivate the surcharge system to take into account the increase in alloy costs since September 1993, and this surcharge will be applied generally from 1 February 1994. In another letter,
dated 31 January 1994, Thyssen  Fine Steels Ltd announced to its customers that we have no choice but to implement alloy surcharges on all stainless flat products in line with all other manufacturers. As in the previous surcharge situation, a clear basis for surcharge has been agreed to account for the changes in relationship between prices and costs.

135 As regards, next, characterisation of the consensus as a concerted practice, the Decision emphasises, in paragraph 45, that in any event, if the definition of the consensus as an agreement is disputed, the reintroduction by the stainless steel producers of the alloy surcharge by deliberately identical methods as to value and date is at the very least and without any doubt a concerted practice. In that connection, it is
stated that anti-competitive collusion, by which undertakings inform each other in advance of the attitude each intends to adopt, so that each can regulate its commercial conduct in the knowledge that its competitors would behave in the same way cannot escape the prohibition of concerted practice.

136 Consequently, it is clear from those paragraphs of the Decision that it adequately explained the principal elements of fact and of law which prompted the  Commission to take the view that the consensus in question could be defined as an agreement or, in the alternative as a concerted practice within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty. In particular, contrary to KTS's claim, the Decision clearly distinguishes between the definitions of agreement and concerted practice by characterising the constituent elements of each of them.
137 It follows that the present plea must be rejected. C - The effects of the agreement on prices Arguments of the parties
138 The applicants submit that the  Commission has not sufficiently proved the effects of the alloy surcharge formula on the price of stainless steel flat products and, therefore, the alleged restriction of competition. They consider that the reasons given on that point are incorrect and, in any event, inadequate.

139 According to KTS, the  Commission merely found, in paragraph 48 of the Decision, that the alloy surcharge might represent up to 25% of the total price of stainless steel. However, that assessment overlooks the fact that, in practice, each customer is free to purchase products on a fixed-price, rather than a variable-price, basis.

140 AST, for its part, states that the alloy surcharge is only one of the components of the final price of stainless steel and takes account of variations in the prices of the alloys only above a certain level. The major part of the final price of stainless steel was not the subject of any agreement.

141 It also considers that the  Commission made unreasoned and unsupported allegations. Thus, it did not respond to the argument that the increase in stainless steel prices as from 1994 was largely attributable to the very strong increase demand - about 30% - recorded at that time. Nor did it take account of the fact that the change to the reference values agreed in Madrid ceased to have any effect as from June 1994 since
the prices of alloying materials returned to the values originally specified in the calculation formula for the alloy surcharge before they were changed.

142 AST also maintains that, when assessing the restrictive effects of an agreement, account must be taken of the actual application of the new prices to customers and not of the date on which those new

Page 52 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
prices were notified to the  Commission. AST did not start applying the alloy surcharge until April 1994, that is to say more than two months later than the other producers.

143 Finally, the applicants maintain that the contradictory nature of the statement of the reasons on which the Decision was based, regarding the effects of the agreement on prices, is confirmed by the differences between the  German and Italian versions of paragraph 49 of the Decision. According to the  German version of the Decision, the change to the alloy surcharge reference values was not the cause of the increase in price levels for stainless steel which occurred between January 1994 and March 1995, whereas, according to the Italian version, there was a specific causal link between that increase and the change in the alloy surcharge reference values. Consequently, KTS requests that an expert opinion be
obtained under Article 25 of the ECSC Statute of the Court of Justice, and AST seeks the production of any relevant documents pursuant to Article 24 of the Statute of the Court Justice.

144 The Commission replies that the Decision is not vitiated by any error of assessment or any inadequacy of reasoning on that point.
145 In particular, the Decision explained clearly that the alloy surcharge constitutes a component of the
final price of the products concerned and that, consequently, the aim of the agreement is to fix a part of the
price. The  Commission observes that it is not disputed that the alloy surcharge may represent up to 25%
of the final price of the products. The information disclosed during the administrative procedure shows, in
any event, that, in March 1995, the alloy surcharge accounted for 24% of the final price of cold rolled
sheets and 25% of the final price of hot rolled sheets and that, for other steel qualities with a higher nickel
content, the price component represented by the alloy surcharge was even higher.

146 KTS's efforts to minimise the economic importance of the infringement are negated by the statements made by KTN during the procedure to the effect that the agreement was intended to cope with a catastrophic economic situation. Moreover, the fact that the Decision does not contain any express indication that customers might buy on a fixed-price rather than a variable-price basis does not mean that the Commission did not take that into account. However, according to the case-law, the  Commission is not required to discuss, in a decision, all the points of fact and law relied on by the parties during the administrative procedure.

147 The Commission also contends that the effects of the agreement on the final price of their products were not exaggerated since the Decision indicates, in that connection, that the considerable increase in stainless steel prices cannot be attributed solely to changes in the trigger values for the alloy surcharge, even if there is also a finding that the latter nevertheless made a considerable contribution to it.

148 As regards AST's alleged delay in applying the new reference values, the  Commission replies that AST itself officially informed it that the new figure for the alloy surcharge, calculated on the basis of the new reference values, would be applied as from 1 February 1994. In any event, that alleged delay in implementing the agreement cannot detract from its participation in the agreement.

149 The applicants' argument based on the alleged linguistic differences in paragraph 49 of the  German and Italian versions of the Decision has no basis. Even if it were accepted that the second sentence of paragraph 49 of the  German version of the Decision did not indicate a causal link between application of the method for calculating the alloy surcharge and the price increase which ensued, the fact remains that the next sentence expressly states that although admittedly the increase in the price of stainless steel cannot be attributed (zurückgeführt) only to changes in the trigger levels for the alloy surcharge, the latter nevertheless made a considerable contribution to it.
Findings of the Court

150 Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits [a]ll agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices tending directly or indirectly to prevent, restrict or distort normal competition within the common market ..., and in particular those tending:
(a) to fix or determine prices;
...

151 According to settled case-law relating to the application of Article 85 (1) of the EC Treaty, there is no need to take account of the concrete effects of an agreement once it appears that it has as its object the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the meaning of that article (Case C-49/92 P Commission v Anic Partecipazioni [1999] ECR I-4125, paragraph 99, Case C-199/92 P Hüls v Commission [1991] ECR I-4287, paragraph 178, and Case C-235/92 P Montecatini v  Commission [1991] ECR I-4539, paragraph 122).


Page 53 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
152 Similarly, concerted practices are prohibited, regardless of their effect, when they have an
anti-competitive object. Although the very concept of a concerted practice presupposes conduct by the
participating undertakings on the market, it does not necessarily mean that that conduct should produce the
specific effect of restricting, preventing or distorting competition (Commission v Anic Partecipazioni,
paragraphs 123 and 124, Hüls v Commission, paragraphs 164 and 165, and Montecatini v  Commission,
paragraphs 124 and 125). Also, where the Commission has established to the requisite legal standard
that an undertaking has taken part in concertation intended to restrict competition, it does not have to
adduce evidence that such concertation had manifested itself in conduct on the market or that it had effects
restrictive of competition. On the contrary, it is for the undertaking concerned to prove that the concertation
did not have any influence whatsoever on its own conduct on the market (Commission v Anic
Partecipazioni, paragraph 126, and 124, and Hüls v  Commission, paragraph 167).

153 Those principles also apply to the application of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty. Since that provision refers to agreements tending to distort normal competition, it must be concluded that that expression includes the formula have as their object found in Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty (Thyssen Stahl v Commission, cited above, paragraph 277).

154 It follows that the  Commission is not obliged, in order to establish an infringement of Article 65(1) of the ESCS Treaty, to demonstrate that there was an adverse effect on competition, provided that it has established the existence of an agreement or concerted practice intended to restrict competition (Thyssen Stahl v Commission, paragraph 277).

155 In this case, the applicants' various arguments, which merely assert that there has been no adverse effect on competition, must be rejected, in so far as they are based on a misconceived view of the evidential requirements laid down by Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty. The applicants do not contest the
truth of the findings in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the Decision to the effect that the purpose of the agreement at issue was to restrict competition.

156 However, before examining, for the sake of completeness, the anti-competitive effects of the agreement, the  Commission rightly considered that it constituted a  cartel caught by the prohibition laid down by Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, since its aim was to fix a component of the final price of stainless steel flat products through the use by the producers concerned, as from the same date, of the same reference values for alloying materials in the method for calculating the alloy surcharge.

157 As is confirmed by the case-law on the application of Article 85(1)(a) of the EC Treaty, the prohibition of agreements and concerted practices which directly or indirectly fix prices also extends to agreements relating to the fixing of a part of the final price (see, in particular, Case T-29/92 SPO and Others v Commission [1995] ECR II-289, paragraph 146). It follows, in particular, that AST's argument that most of the final price of stainless steel was not the subject of an agreement is irrelevant.

158 In this case, the  Commission also found, in paragraph 48 of the Decision, that the agreement was liable to affect competition considerably, since, first, the undertakings concerned represented more than
90% of sales of stainless steel flat products and, second, the increase brought about by the alloy surcharge could represent up to 25% of the final price of those products.

159 It must be observed that the applicants do not contest the truth of that assessment. In that connection, KTS merely argues that the portion of the final price accounted for by the alloy surcharge was less than
25% when its customers made fixed-price rather than variable-price purchases. However, apart from the fact that such an argument does not change the fact that the price supplement represented by the alloy surcharge, calculated on the basis of the reference values agreed at the Madrid meeting, was, in principle, likely to represent a substantial part of the final price of the products, KTS does not deny that the alloy surcharge thus calculated actually had an impact on the final price of its products when its customers did not make fixed-price purchases.

160 In any event, it is important to note that the applicants have not demonstrated that the Decision is vitiated by a an error of assessment in so far as it relates to the real effects of the agreement on the market.

161 In particular, there are no grounds for alleging that the  Commission exaggerated or, on the contrary, disregarded the effects of the agreement on the final price of the products. In that connection, it took the view, in paragraph 49 of the Decision, including the  German version thereof, that the near doubling of the price of stainless steel between January 1994 and March 1995 could not be attributed solely to the change to the reference values for the alloy surcharge but that that change had nevertheless made a considerable contribution to it. Therefore, the argument that the  German version of the Decision does not indicate a causal link between the agreement and the price rise must be rejected, and there is no need to grant the applicants' request for an expert opinion or the production of documents.


Page 54 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
162 The argument that the change to reference values agreed in Madrid ceased to take effect when the prices of the alloying materials returned to where they stood before they were changed must also be rejected. As the  Commission observed in paragraph 70 of the Decision, the fact that the price of an alloy component reached its former reference values is irrelevant since the increase in the price resulting from the alloy surcharge was necessarily higher than if the reference values had not been changed.

163 AST's argument that it applied the new reference values after a time-lapse of two months cannot be upheld. It is undisputed that AST officially informed the  Commission that it would apply the new alloy surcharge with effect from 1 February 1994. Moreover, even if it were substantiated, that argument would only prove that the concertation, in which it does not deny having participated, actually influenced its own conduct on the market (see paragraph 151 above).

164 Finally, since the Decision clearly set out the reasoning followed by the  Commission, the argument that the statement of reasons was inadequate must be rejected.
165 It follows from all the foregoing that the present pleas must be rejected. D - The duration of the infringement
Arguments of the parties

166 The applicants maintain that the  Commission did not properly assess the duration of the infringement and did not explain its assessment in the Decision, taking the view that the concertation commenced at the Madrid meeting in December 1993 and continued until the day on which the Decision was adopted. According to the applicants, the change to the reference values in the alloy surcharge formula decided on
at the Madrid meeting was sporadic rather than continuous.

167 In that connection, they state that, neither during that meeting nor at any later stage was there any discussion concerning the maintenance of those values. It is wrong to take the view that a concerted practice continues until it is expressly brought to an end. In this case, once the price was increased, the undertakings were free to decide on their price levels taking account of market conditions, the latter being the same for all the undertakings.

168 KTS submits, in particular, that, whilst it admitted that the uniform change at the Madrid meeting to the reference values contained in the alloy surcharge formula could be regarded as a concerted practice within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, that concertation was merely sporadic because subsequently it regularly took individual decisions changing the amounts of the alloy surcharges and the final prices. Moreover, with regard to the assessment of the duration of the infringement, the decisive factor is determination not of the alloy surcharge as a component of the final price but of the final price itself, as it is applied on the market. The infringement could not therefore be regarded as ongoing.

169 KTS adds that the  Commission was not entitled to rely on its own contacts with other producers after the Madrid meeting. Paragraph 33 of the  German version of the Decision contains, in that regard, a translation error which gives the impression that the author of the fax in question was still awaiting information from Krupp concerning the alloy surcharges that Krupp was going to apply (noch keine Informationen), whereas it merely stated that it had no information (we have no current information).

170 AST, for its part, claims that, although the reference values in the alloy surcharge formula were not changed following the Madrid meeting, that fact is attributable not to any agreement to prolong the infringement but to the ECSC system of price transparency and to the parallel conduct of the undertakings concerned.

171 As regards the case-law cited by the  Commission, it is irrelevant since it relates to situations in which the agreements penalised continued to produce effects after they came to an end.

172 The Commission replies that, after the Madrid meeting, the alloy surcharge reference values were not changed by the applicants. The only plausible explanation for the maintenance of those values must be
that the parties to the agreement continued to agree that they would not change them again. That, moreover, is confirmed by the fact that only Avesta brought the infringement to an end before the Decision, by radically changing the method for calculating the alloy surcharge, whereas KTS and AST did not
formally bring the infringement to an end until 1 April 1988, when, pursuant to Article 4 of the Decision, they applied new trigger levels for the alloying materials for the purpose of calculating the alloy surcharge. All
the other price changes referred to by the applicants are irrelevant since they concern only the final prices of the stainless steel flat products  charged to their customers.

173 Finally, the  Commission contends that, in any event, it is clear from the case-law on Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty that that article is applicable if parallel conduct by certain undertakings, originally deriving

Page 55 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
from an agreement, continues even after the agreement has come to an end (Case 51/75 EMI Records
[1976] ECR 811, paragraph 30). That applies, by analogy, to Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.
Findings of the Court

174 As is clear from the case-law, it is incumbent on the  Commission to prove not only the existence of the agreement but also its duration (see Case T-43/92 Dunlop Slazenger v  Commission [1994] ECR
II-441, paragraph 79, and Joined Cases T-25/95, T-26/95, T-30/95 to T-32/95, T-34/95 to T-39/95, T-42/95 to T-46/95, T-48/95, T-50/95 to T-65/95, T-68/95 to T-71/95, T-87/95, T-88/95, T-103/95 and T-104/95
Cimenteries CBR and Others v  Commission [2000] ECR II-491, paragraph 2802).

175 In this case, it is therefore appropriate to consider whether the  Commission, in finding in paragraph 50 of the Decision that the concertation continued until the date on which the Decision was adopted,
discharged the burden of proof attaching to it and included an adequate statement of reasons in the
Decision.

176 It is important, first, to bear in mind that the purpose of the agreement was to ensure that, in the method for calculating the alloy surcharge, the producers of stainless steel flat products used identical reference values with a view to raising the final price, of which the alloy surcharge constitutes a significant part.

177 As is clear from the Decision, in particular paragraph 44, that agreement commenced at the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993, on which date the participating undertakings decided to apply the alloy surcharge thus calculated as from 1 February 1994. It also found that, as from the latter date, those undertakings, which included KTS and AST, had in fact applied to their sales in  Europe, with the exception of Spain and Portugal, an alloy surcharge calculated in accordance with the method based on the
reference values agreed at the Madrid meeting. Finally, it observed in paragraph 50 of the Decision that only Avesta had announced, in November 1996, that it would use a different method for calculating the alloy surcharge.

178 It must be observed that the applicants do not deny, and did not deny during the administrative procedure, that the reference values for the alloy surcharge, as agreed at the Madrid meeting, were not changed before the adoption of the Decision. Since the undertakings in question continued actually to
apply the reference values on which they had agreed at that meeting, the fact that no express decision was then taken regarding the period for which the agreement would be applied cannot prove that the agreement was sporadic rather than continuous.

179 In that connection, the argument that the undertakings regularly changed the prices charged to their customers is irrelevant since it concerns the final price for stainless steel flat products charged by the undertakings, of which the alloy surcharge is merely one component. Similarly, regular changes to the alloy surcharge itself do not constitute proof that the agreement came to an end, since those changes were merely the result of calculations made on the basis of the formula containing the same reference values for all producers. The alleged translation error referred to by KTS as demonstrating the absence of contacts with the other producers after the Madrid meeting likewise has no probative force, it having been admitted, moreover, that the undertaking in question calculated the alloy surcharge in accordance with the arrangements agreed at that meeting.

180 AST's argument that maintenance of the reference values agreed at the Madrid meeting is a result of price transparency and parallel conduct on the part of the undertakings concerned must also be rejected. Whilst it is true that, according to the case-law, parallel conduct cannot be regarded as furnishing proof of concertation unless concertation constitutes the only plausible explanation for such conduct (Joined Cases C-89/85, C-104/85, C-114/85, C-116/85, C-117/85 and C-125/85 to C-129/85 Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-1307, paragraph 71), the fact remains that, in this case, the maintenance by the undertakings in question of the same reference values in the calculation formula for the alloy surcharge is accounted for by concertation since those values were determined jointly in the course of discussions between producers in December 1993.

181 Finally, it is important to bear in mind that, with regard to cartels which are no longer in force, it is sufficient, for Article 85 of the EC Treaty, and by analogy Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, to be applicable that they continue to produce their effects after they have formally ceased to be in force (EMI Records, cited above, paragraph 15, and Case 243/83 Binon [1985] 2015, paragraph 17; Case T-2/89 Petrofina v Commission [1991] II-1087, paragraph 212, and SCA Holding v  Commission, cited above, paragraph
95). The same applies a fortiori where, as in this case, the effects of the agreement lasted until adoption of the Decision, without the agreement having been formally brought to an end.




Page 56 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
182 It follows that, since KTS and AST did not cease applying the reference values agreed at the Madrid meeting before the adoption of the Decision, the  Commission was entitled to take the view that the infringement had lasted until that date.

183 Since, moreover, the Decision clearly set out the reasoning followed by the  Commission in reaching that conclusion, the argument alleging inadequacy of the statement of reasons on that point cannot be upheld.
184 It follows that the present pleas must be rejected.
The claims, in the alternative, that Article 2 of the Decision should be annulled or the amount of the  fine
should be reduced
I - The pleas alleging incorrect calculation of the  fines A - The imposition of different  fines on KTS and AST Arguments of the parties
185 The applicants criticise the  Commission for not having taken account of the group relationship between them for the purposes of calculating the  fine, even though it was aware of that situation.

186 They consider that, since the  Commission did not set the amount of the  fine by reference to the turnover of the undertakings concerned but took as a basis a fixed sum of ECU 4 million for each of them, it was necessary to impose a single  fine on KTS covering at the same time its business, that of ATS and the business taken over from Thyssen Stahl. In this case, the course followed was misconceived and discriminatory in that in practice it led to three  fines being imposed on a single economic entity, namely KTN. Therefore, the Decision is vitiated by an error of law.

187 As regards the  Commission's argument that KTN and AST always acted independently throughout the duration of the agreement, KTS replies that that fact does not mean that separate  fines of the same amount can be imposed on them. AST, for its part, states that it is undeniable that KTN did not determine its conduct, but that the  Commission should not thereby regard them as equivalent entities for purpose of calculating the  fine.

188 The Commission replies that separate  fines were imposed on KTS and AST because those companies were independent from each other when the agreement came into being, at the Madrid meeting. Moreover, even after KTN acquired all the shares in AST on 10 May 1996, AST continued to act independently on the market. Finally, the argument concerning KTN's control of AST was not raised at any
time during the administrative procedure. In particular, AST never stated that its decisions were attributable to its parent company. It follows, in the  Commission's view, that, in so far as the subsidiary's conduct remained independent of that of the parent company, it was proper to impose separate penalties.
Findings of the Court

189 According to settled case-law, the anti-competitive conduct of an undertaking can be attributed to its parent company where it has not decided independently upon its own conduct on the market, but has carried out, in all material respects, the instructions given to it by that undertaking, having regard in particular to the economic and legal links between them (Case 48/69 ICI v  Commission [1972] ECR 619, paragraphs 132 and 133, Case 107/82 AEG v Commission [1983] ECR 3151, paragraph 49, and, most recently, Case C-294/98 P Metsä-Serla and Others v Commission [2000] I-10065, paragraph 27).

190 In this case, it must be remembered, as has already been stated (see paragraph 2 above) that AST was taken over by Krupp and an Italian consortium jointly. Subsequently, in December 1995, Krupp increased its interest in AST from 50% to 75% and then acquired all the shares in AST on 10 May 1996. Those shares were then transferred to KTN, and then to KTS.

191 However, the applicants have not claimed or, a fortiori, proved that, after it was taken over, AST participated in the agreement covered by the Decision on the basis of instructions given by its parent company rather than independently. It must be observed, on the contrary, that they do not deny having acted independently throughout the duration of the agreement.
192 This plea must therefore be rejected. B - The gravity of the infringement Arguments of the parties

193 First, KTS criticises the  Commission for refusing to impose only a symbolic  fine on it, on the ground that the infringement was blatant. That criterion gives no indication as to the need for a penalty, or even the amount of the  fine, since any infringement which, as in this case, is acknowledged by its perpetrators or proved by evidence must be regarded as blatant. Moreover, that criterion is not included in the Guidelines on the method of setting  fines imposed pursuant to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 and Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty (OJ 1998 C 9, p.3, hereinafter the Guidelines).

194 In response to the argument that the blatant nature of the infringement reflects its intentional nature, KTS states that a feature of any infringement of that kind is that it is committed intentionally, since the undertakings are aware of it. It is impossible to infringe Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty negligently.

195 Second, KTS claims that the  Commission took account of the gravity of the infringement twice in calculating the  fine. Even though the gravity of the infringement had already been considered in paragraphs 74 to 77 of the Decision in order to fix the basic amount of the  fine as ECU 4 million, the
Commission then applied that criterion again in paragraph 79 of the Decision to justify an increase of ECU
1.6 million over that basic amount.

196 The Commission contends, first, that symbolic  fines are not justified in this case in view of the gravity and duration of the infringement and the belated and limited cooperation shown by KTS. The reference to the blatant nature of the infringement merely shows that the undertakings could not have been unaware that the infringement was contrary to competition law.

197 Second, with regard to the gravity of the infringement being considered twice, the  Commission replies that, despite the clerical error in paragraph 79 of the Decision, it is clear from the reasoning in paragraphs
78 to 80 that the contested increase was imposed in respect of the duration of the infringement.
Findings of the Court

198 According to settled case-law, the gravity of infringements falls to be determined by reference to numerous factors including, in particular, the specific circumstances and context of the case and the deterrent character of the  fines; moreover, no binding or exhaustive list of the criteria which must be applied has been drawn up (order of 25 March 1996 in Case C-137/95 P SPO and Others v  Commission [1996] ECR I-1611, paragraph 54 and Case C-219/95 P Ferriere Nord v  Commission [1997] I-4411, paragraph 33).

199 In that connection, factors relating to the intentional aspect, and thus to the object of a course of conduct, may be more significant than those relating to its effects (see the Opinion of Judge Vesterdorf, acting as Advocate General in Rhône-Poulenc v  Commission, cited above, [1991] ECR II-869, especially at 1022, which covered the Polyproplylene judgments: Cases T-2/89, T-3/89, T-4/89, T-6/89, T-7/89,
T-8/89, [1991] ECR II-1087, II-1177, II-1523, II-1623, II-1711 and II-1833 respectively, and T-9/89 to
T-15/89, [1992] ECR II-499, II-629, II-757, II-907, II-1021, II-1155 and II-1275 respectively) particularly
where they relate to infringements which are intrinsically serious, such as price-fixing (Thyssen Stahl v
Commission, cited above, paragraph 636, and Case T-157/94 Ensidesa v  Commission [1999] ECR
II-707, paragraph 508).

200 In particular, an infringement of the competition rules may be regarded as having been committed intentionally if the undertaking could not have been unaware that the object of its conduct was the restriction of competition. It is not therefore necessary for an undertaking to have been aware that it was infringing those rules (Case T-143/89 Ferriere Nord v  Commission [1995] II-917, paragraph 41).

201 Finally, under the fourth and fifth indents of Section 3 of the Guidelines, the existence of reasonable doubt on the part of the undertaking as to whether the restrictive conduct constitutes an infringement or the fact that the infringement was committed as a result of negligence or unintentionally may constitute extenuating circumstances justifying reduction of the basis amount of the  fine calculated by the Commission.

202 In this case, the  Commission took the view in paragraph 75 of the Decision that the infringement was blatant, after pointing out in paragraph 74 that the agreement aimed at a uniform increase of a cost component and therefore constituted a serious infringement of Community law, involving almost all the producers of stainless steel flat products. Since the  Commission thus found that the undertakings in question had committed a serious infringement intentionally, without entertaining any doubts as to the unlawful nature of their conduct, the  Commission's refusal to impose merely a symbolic  fine cannot be regarded as vitiated by an error of law.
203 Accordingly, KTS's argument must be rejected.

204 As regards the argument alleging that the gravity of the infringement was taken into account twice, it need merely be stated that the use of the word gravity instead of duration in paragraph 79 of the Decision,
Page 58 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in the part entitled Duration of the infringement, can only be regarded as a clerical error and did not give rise to a further increase of the  fine.
205 It follows that this plea must be rejected. C - The duration of the infringement Arguments of the parties
206 The applicants argue that, since the infringement was of short duration, the  Commission should have reduced rather than increased the fine. A reduction of the  fine is particularly justified since it was not until it adopted the Decision that the Commission took the view, for the first time, that the infringement was of long duration. At no time during the administrative procedure did the  Commission explain to them that the duration of the infringement included the duration of that procedure, which, according to AST, constitutes
an infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.

207 AST adds that, by failing to treat the infringement as sporadic, the  Commission did not properly take account, by way of extenuating circumstances, of the critical situation in the sector. The infringement was in fact of only short duration, limited to the time of the Madrid meeting, since the critical economic situation in the sector necessarily had a much greater impact than that alleged by the  Commission.

208 AST also claims that, in the Decision, the  Commission does not take account of the fact that AST did not itself apply the change to the reference values in the alloy surcharge formula until April 1994, namely after a delay of two months, a fact which should also have justified a reduction of the  fine.

209 The Commission replies that the infringement committed by the applicants lasted four years and was therefore of medium duration of such as to give rise to an increase of up to 50% of the amounts determined solely by reference to the gravity of the infringement, hence the increase of 10% (ECU 400 000) applied in this case for each year of the infringement. Contrary to the applicants' contention, the  Commission never gave the impression that the infringement was of short duration and had even emphasised, in the
statement of objections notified to the applicants, that the infringement was continuing.

210 As regards AST's argument concerning the economic situation in the sector, it is based on the incorrect assumption that the infringement was of short duration. However, the economic situation in the sector was not critical until the very moment at which concertation commenced, and it subsequently improved.
Findings of the Court

211 In determining the amounts of  fines, it is necessary to take account of the duration of the infringements and of all the factors capable of affecting the assessment of their gravity (see, in particular, Musique Diffusion Française and Others, cited above, paragraph 129).

212 As regards the factor of the duration of the infringement, the Guidelines draw a distinction between infringements of short duration (in general less than one year), for which the amount determined in respect of gravity is not to be increased, infringements of medium duration (in general from 1 to 5 years), for which that amount may be increased by up to 50%, and infringements of long duration (in general over five years), for which the amount may be increased by 10% for each year (Section 1 B, first to third indents).

213 In this case the  Commission found in the Decision that the duration of the applicants' infringement was four years and increased the amount decided on for the gravity of the infringement by 40%, namely
10% for each year.

214 As has already been observed (see paragraphs 174 to 184 above), the  Commission correctly calculated the duration of the infringement attributed to the applicants.

215 It cannot be criticised for taking the view that the infringement was continuous, without informing applicants of that fact during the administrative procedure. In fact, in paragraph 50 of the statement of objections notified to them on 24 April 1997, the  Commission clearly stated that concertation began at the Madrid meeting in December 1993 and has been pursued. Since the  Commission subsequently found that the infringement had continued during the administrative procedure, the duration of that procedure necessarily had to be included in the duration of the infringement.

216 Similarly, AST's argument that it did not apply the change to the values in the alloy surcharge method until April 1994 is not such as to call in question the duration relied on for the purpose of calculating the fine. It must be borne in mind that the starting point of the infringement committed was the date of the concertation between producers at the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993 and not the date on which


Page 59 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
their decisions were actually put into effect on the market. Consequently, the  Commission was fully entitled to consider that the infringement lasted four years until the adoption of the Decision.

217 As regards AST's argument that insufficient account was taken, by way of extenuating circumstance, of the economic situation in the sector, it must be pointed out, first, that the applicant does not deny that that situation was not critical until the end of 1993, the date on which concertation commenced between
producers, and the infringement did not end until four years later, and, second, that that situation was taken into account by the Commission by way of extenuating circumstance (see paragraphs 83 and 84 of the Decision). Accordingly, the Commission took sufficient account of the particular situation in the sector in taking the view that such a situation did not arise until the very commencement of the infringement.
218 It follows that this plea must be rejected.
D - Cooperation during the administrative procedure
1. Preliminary observations

219 In paragraph 96 of the Decision, the  Commission expressed the view that all the undertakings concerned might benefit to varying degree years from Section D, entitled Significant reduction in a  fine, of the Commission notice on the non-imposition or reduction of  fines in cartel cases (OJ 1996, C 207, p. 4, hereinafter the Notice on Cooperation).

220 In that connection, the Decision records the fact, first, that only Usinor and Avesta admitted the existence of the infringement. Moreover, Avesta forwarded to the  Commission on 31 October 1996 documents evidencing the existence of contacts between the undertakings concerned and Avesta is the only undertaking to have brought the infringement to an end before the adoption of the Decision. Usinor, for its part, was the first to inform the  Commission of the Madrid meeting (paragraph 97 of the Decision). On the other hand, with respect to the other undertakings and, in particular, KTN and AST, the Decision states that their statements and replies to the statement of objections provided nothing new and denied involvement in the infringement (paragraph 98 of the Decision).

221 In the Decision, the  Commission infers from this that the cooperation of Usinor and Avesta was extensive but nevertheless very belatedly. As regards the other undertakings, in particular KTN and AST, their cooperation was regarded as more limited than that of the first-mentioned undertakings since no documentary evidence or any facts not already in the possession of the  Commission were supplied and those undertakings did not acknowledge the infringement (paragraph 100 of the Decision).

222 In paragraph 101 of the Decision, the  Commission concluded that those factors justified a reduction of the fine by 10% for all the undertakings, with the exception of Avesta and Usinor, to which it applied a reduction of 40%.

223 The applicants criticise the  Commission for granting them a reduction of only 10% of the amount of their fines on the incorrect basis that their statements and their replies to the statement of objections, first, provided no new documentary evidence and, second, denied the existence of the infringement.
2. The failure to provide new information in the administrative procedure
Arguments of the parties

224 The applicants submit that the  Commission disregarded Section D of the Notice on Cooperation and the principle of equal treatment by taking the view that their statements provided nothing new in that they furnished no new documentary evidence or facts not already in the possession of the  Commission.

225 In the applicants' opinion, where several undertakings reply, at the same time or successively, to questions from the  Commission in which they disclose facts that confirm its suspicions, the order in which the information requested is provided is not such as to justify treating the undertakings differently for the purpose of reducing the  fine. Section D of the Notice on Cooperation takes account only of the fact that undertakings must have provided information contributing to establishing the existence of the infringement and not of the order in which such information was disclosed to the  Commission. Moreover, even where the same information is provided simultaneously, cooperation on the part of the undertakings in question is definitely of interest to the  Commission since its allegations thereby gain probative force. Otherwise the Commission would not consider it helpful to put the same questions to the various undertakings concerned.
226 In this case, KTN and AST, in their statements to the  Commission of 17 December 1996 and 10
January 1997 respectively, in response to the questionnaires sent to them, acknowledged the facts and in
particular the holding of the Madrid meeting, in the same way as Usinor. The fact that the latter disclosed
the same facts first is not decisive since the  Commission merely chose to question it first in the course of

Page 60 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
an inspection. Only if that undertaking had provided that information of its own free will would that privileged treatment have been justified.

227 KTS adds that, when KTN acknowledged the facts, it was unaware of the extent of the  Commission's knowledge because the  Commission does not disclose the answers provided by the other undertakings. AST also considers that, in so far as all the relevant documents were the same, the  Commission could not require it to provide new ones.

228 The Commission replies that, for a  fine to be reduced, nothing prevents it from attaching more importance to the disclosure of new facts than to mere confirmation of what it knows already. In that connection, according to section D, first indent, of the draft Notice on Cooperation (OJ 1995, C 341, p. 13), the Commission may grant a reduction of the  fine where, in particular, the undertaking is the first to come forward.

229 An undertaking which cooperates fully with the  Commission by disclosing unknown facts to it contributes more to the finding of an infringement than an undertaking which merely confirms subsequently matters of which the  Commission already has knowledge. Since the information concerned is provided in the course of an investigation, the applicants have no right to ask the  Commission to grant equality of opportunity by questioning all the undertakings concerned simultaneously and then drawing a distinction according to whether or not an undertaking was able to produce additional documents. Moreover, there is no rule that the assessment of the cooperation shown by undertakings must be influenced by whether or not those undertakings were aware of what knowledge the  Commission possessed.

230 In this case, the  Commission points out that KTN did not give a detailed account of the facts until its letter of 17 December 1996, when the inspections at the various undertakings had already been completed. Moreover, that letter was accompanied by no documentary evidence and the information in it was already known to the  Commission. As regards AST, it was only on 10 January 1997 that it gave details of its participation in the Madrid meeting.
231 In contrast, Usinor was the first to inform it of the Madrid meeting and did so as early as 10 December
1996. KTN's argument that it would have been the first to disclose the Madrid meeting if the  Commission
had questioned it rather than Usinor first is irrelevant since it is a matter of speculation and is not supported
by any facts.
Findings of the Court

232 It must be borne in mind, as a preliminary point, that in its Notice on Cooperation the Commission defined the conditions under which undertakings co-operating with it in an investigation into a cartel may be exempted from a  fine or benefit from a reduction of the  fine they would otherwise have had to pay (see Section A 3 of the Notice on Cooperation).

233 As regards the application of the Notice on Cooperation to the applicant's case, it is not contested that it does not fall within the scope of Section B of that notice, which deals with cases where an undertaking has reported a secret  cartel to the Commission before the Commission has initiated an investigation (in which case there may be a reduction of at least 75% of the fine) or within Section C of that notice, which is concerned with undertakings that have reported a secret cartel after the  Commission has undertaken an
investigation which has failed to disclose sufficient grounds for initiating the procedure leading to a decision
(in which case there may be a reduction of 50% to 75% of the  fine).

234 Consequently, as is clearly indicated in paragraphs 93 to 96 of the Decision, since the applicant did not fulfil the conditions for the application of either Section B or Section C of the Notice on Cooperation, its conduct must be appraised by reference to Section D of that notice, entitled Significant reduction in a  fine.

235 According to Section D(1), where an enterprise cooperates without having met all the conditions set out in Sections B or C, it will benefit from a reduction of 10% to 50% of the  fine that would have been imposed if it had not cooperated.
236 Section D(2) states:
Such cases may include the following:

- before a statement of objections is sent, an enterprise provides the  Commission with information, documents or other evidence which materially contribute to establishing the existence of the infringement;

- after receiving a statement of objections, an enterprise informs the  Commission that it does not substantially contest the facts on which the  Commission bases its allegations.



Page 61 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
237 As regards appraisal of the cooperation shown by undertakings, the  Commission is not entitled to disregard the principle of equal treatment, a general principle of Community law which is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified (Case T-311/94 BPB de Eendracht v Commission [1998] ECR II-1129, paragraph 309 and the case-law there cited).

238 In this case, it is common ground that before the issue of the statement of objections on 24 April 1997, the applicant provided the  Commission with information that helped confirm the existence of the infringement, in accordance with the first indent of Section D(2) of the Notice on Cooperation.

239 The Commission observes in paragraph 92 of its Decision that [s]tatements acknowledging the facts were sent to the Commission by those undertakings on 17 December 1996 (Acerinox, ALZ, Avesta, Krupp and Thyssen [KTN], [Usinor]) and on 10 January 1997 (AST). As is clear from the file, KTN's and AST's statements admitted, in particular, the holding of the Madrid meeting of 16 December 1993.

240 However, the  Commission considered that the cooperation shown by KTN and AST was more limited than that of Avesta and Usinor since the applicants' statements disclosed nothing new (paragraph 98 of the Decision). In that connection, it found that Usinor had been the first to inform the  Commission of the
Madrid meeting (paragraph 97 of the Decision) and that the other undertakings, such as KTN and AST, had thus not provided any documentary evidence or facts not already in the possession of the  Commission (paragraph 100 of the Decision).

241 It is necessary to determine whether, by making that finding, the  Commission infringed the principle of equal treatment and, therefore, misapplied Section D(2) of the Notice on Cooperation.

242 It is clear from the file, first, that, as the  Commission confirmed during the written procedure, Usinor informed it on 10 December 1996 of the holding of the Madrid meeting in response to a questionnaire given to it by Commission staff during an inspection carried out at the headquarters of that undertaking.

243 By way of measure of organisation of procedure, the Court of First Instance asked the  Commission to state whether it had sent to all the addressees of the Decision the same questions as those put to Usinor.
In its written reply, the  Commission confirmed that all the addressees of the Decision had in fact received the same questionnaire. It stated in particular that those questions were put to KTN on 12 December 1996 and to AST on 18 December 1996.

244 Moreover, it is important to point out that it has not been shown, or indeed alleged, that KTN and AST were apprised of the answers given by Usinor which, by their nature, had to remain confidential, when it sent to the  Commission its statement acknowledging the facts, in particular the holding of the Madrid meeting.

245 It is clear from the above that the extent of the cooperation provided by KTN, AST and Usinor must be regarded as comparable, in so far as those undertakings provided the  Commission, at the same stage of the administrative procedure and in similar circumstances, with similar information concerning the conduct imputed to them.

246 Accordingly, the mere fact that one of those undertakings was the first to acknowledge the contested facts in response to the questions put by the  Commission cannot constitute an objective reason for treating them differently. The appraisal of the extent of the cooperation shown by undertakings cannot depend on purely random factors, such as the order in which they are questioned by the  Commission.

247 In that connection, the  Commission's argument based on the draft Notice on Cooperation is, in itself, irrelevant since it refers to a provision that does not now appear in Section D of the Notice on Cooperation. Moreover, it is clear from the foregoing considerations alone that an undertaking cannot be regarded as having been the first to cooperate with the  Commission where it has provided the  Commission, at the same stage of the administrative procedure as the other undertakings questioned and in similar circumstances, with information identical to that provided by the latter.

248 It follows that, in so far as it considered that KTN and AST had provided it with no new information, the Commission failed to observe Section D(2) of the Notice on Cooperation and infringed the principle of equal treatment.
249 Consequently, the first part of the plea must be upheld.
3. Acknowledgement of the existence of the infringement
Arguments of the parties



Page 62 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
250 The applicants contest the findings in paragraphs 97 and 98 of the Decision to the effect that Usinor and Avesta are the only undertaking to have admitted concertation, whereas KTN and AST denied the existence thereof in their statements and replies to the statement of objections. They consider, in that connection, that they were subjected to discriminatory treatment.

251 According to KTS, it is clear from its observations of 11 April 1996 and its letter of 30 June 1997 in response to the statement of objections that it not only confirmed the facts alleged but also expressly admitted the existence of a concerted practice. In that connection, it cannot be contended that its statements were ambiguous. By its repeated statements, it recognised that its representative at the Madrid meeting indicated to the other producers that the contested price increase could not be excluded and that that increase was then decided upon independently. That description of the Madrid meeting constitutes an admission of a concerted practice. The fact that it contested the existence of an agreement should not be regarded as decisive. Avesta's statement, cited by the  Commission, likewise does not admit the existence of an agreement but merely that of liability within the meaning of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty. Moreover, the operative part of the Decision itself does not refer to the existence of an agreement.

252 For its part, AST contends that, in its memorandum of 2 July 1997, whilst it did maintain that the concertation deriving from the Madrid meeting could not be described as an agreement within the meaning of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, it did not, however, contest the fact that its conduct might be described as a concerted practice. Such failure to contest that point is tantamount to an admission on its part of one of the two charges contained in the statement of objections.

253 In any event, the applicants maintain that the failure by undertakings to object to the legal characterisation of the facts made by the  Commission should not constitute a factor for reducing  fines. Under Section D of the Notice on Cooperation, the condition imposed for availability of a reduction of the fine is that, as in this case, after receiving a statement of objections, an enterprise informs the Commission that it does not substantially contest the facts on which the  Commission bases its allegations. Therefore, the fact of granting of a reduction of the  fines to Usinor and Avesta on the ground that they admitted the existence of the infringement, with the consequent penalisation of the applicants, is contrary to the Notice on Cooperation.

254 Moreover, according to KTS, the  Commission's method runs counter to fundamental legal principles since its practical effect is to prevent the undertaking concerned from submitting its observations on the legal aspects of the facts which it has admitted.

255 According to AST, the  Commission's assessment of the extent of its cooperation also runs counter to the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. It submits that if it had known that the Commission wished to differentiate between operators who admitted the facts and those who also accepted the Commission's legal characterisation of the facts, it would have taken a different attitude in order to benefit from a maximum reduction of the  fine.

256 The Commission replies that only Usinor and Avesta clearly and unambiguously admitted an infringement of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty.

257 In KTS's case, the  Commission contends that, in KTN's letter of 30 June 1997 in response to the statement of objections, there was no clear and frank statement admitting the infringement. Admittedly, KTN acknowledged in that letter the conduct attributed to it and indicated that it had already admitted the existence of a concerted practice in an earlier letter dated 17 December 1996. However, it continued to be equivocal by denying the existence of an agreement, stating that the undertakings concerned had decided independently to increase prices and that the information obtained in Madrid had only possibly played a role. It was therefore normal for the Commission to have taken account of the greater frankness of Usinor and Avesta in calculating the reduction of their fine.

258 As regards AST, the  Commission concedes that it did admit certain important facts and, to that extent, thus admitted the concertation underlying the infringement, which justified a reduction of the  fine. However, AST always persisted in denying the illegality of the facts which it admitted.

259 As regards the applicants' argument that it penalised them because they did not admit the existence of an infringement, the  Commission replies that it did not increase the  fines but simply declined to reduce them by more than 10%.
Findings of the Court

260 It is necessary to determine, first, whether the Decision is vitiated by an error of fact or an error of assessment as to whether the applicants admitted the existence of an infringement of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty during the administrative procedure.


Page 63 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
261 It is important to bear in mind that, according to the Decision, only Usinor and Avesta acknowledged the existence of the concerted action (paragraph 97 Decision). As regards KTN and AST, the Decision finds, on the contrary, that their statements and replies to the statement of objections dispute the existence of concerted action (paragraph 98 of the Decision) and that consequently [those undertakings] did not acknowledge the infringement (paragraph 100 of the Decision). The  Commission inferred from that fact in particular that the cooperation shown by the applicants was more limited than that shown by Usinor and Avesta and therefore justified a reduction of only 10% of their respective  fines (paragraphs 100 and 101 of the Decision).

262 As regards the cooperation shown by KTN during the administrative procedure, it is clear from the file that neither in its letter of 30 June 1997 in response to the statement of objections nor in its earlier correspondence with the  Commission did it admit the existence of an agreement within the meaning of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty between the producers of stainless steel flat products present at the Madrid meeting but merely recognised the materiality of the facts alleged by the  Commission.

263 In particular, KTN cannot validly claim to have denied the existence of an agreement whilst at the same time acknowledging its participation in a concerted practice. In that connection, the fact that KTN indicated that, at the Madrid meeting, its representative had envisaged the possibility of an increase of the reference values for the purpose of calculating the alloy surcharge but that the increase had then been decided upon and applied by it on an independent basis cannot constitute an express admission of the existence of a concerted practice.

264 According to settled case-law, the criteria of coordination and cooperation necessary for determining the existence of a concerted practice are to be understood in the light of the concept inherent in the Treaty provisions on competition, according to which each trader must determine independently the policy which he intends to adopt on the common market and the conditions which he intends to offer to his customers (Case C-7/95 P Deere v  Commission [1998] ECR I-3111, paragraph 86, and the case-law there cited). By maintaining that the decision to change the reference values for the alloy surcharge had been adopted
independently, KTN, by implication but undeniably, gave the impression that the criteria of coordination and cooperation specific to a concerted practice were absent and, in any event, did not exclude it.

265 Moreover, it must be noted that, in its reply to the statement of objections, KTN used contradictory expressions in stating, in particular, that it had taken its decisions independently (paragraph III.2 of the letter of 30 June 1997), that the infringement, if such exists... did not commence in 1988 and, a fortiori, did not continue until today (paragraph III.4 of the abovementioned letter), or again that the use of a formula, and likewise an identical price... may also, as is the case here, be the result of independent adjustment to the market and... is even lawful in such circumstances (paragraph III.4 of the abovementioned letter).

266 In that context, the fact that it indicated, in its response to the statement objections, that it had already in its letter of 17 December 1996 disclosed all the facts and... recognised the existence of a concerted practice cannot be regarded as an express admission of its participation in the infringement because neither that letter nor the arguments put forward in its response to the statement of objections enabled the Commission to corroborate such an interpretation.

267 It follows that the  Commission was fully entitled to consider that KTN had denied the existence of concertation and, a fortiori, denied the existence of any infringement of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty.

268 As regards the cooperation shown by AST during the administrative procedure, it is not disputed that AST also admitted the materiality of the facts on which the  Commission relied, which justified a reduction of 10% of the  fine imposed. However, contrary to AST's contention, there is nothing in the file to show that it admitted the existence of concertation.

269 In that connection, AST's argument that such an admission stems from the fact that it did not deny that its conduct might be described as a concerted practice cannot be upheld.

270 A reduction of the  fine is justified only if the conduct of the undertaking concerned enabled the Commission to establish the infringement more easily and, where relevant, bring it to an end (BPB de Eendracht v Commission, cited above, paragraph 325, Case T-338/94 Finnboard v Commission [1998] II-1617, paragraph 363, confirmed on appeal on that point in Case C-298/98 P Finnboard v Commission
[2000] I-10157, and Mayr-Melnhof v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 330). However, in the absence of an express statement that it was not contesting the  Commission's allegation of a concerted practice, AST did not facilitate the Commission's task of finding and bringing to an end infringements of Community competition law (BPB de Eendracht v Commission, paragraph 325, and Mayr-Melnhof v  Commission, paragraph 332).

271 Accordingly, the  Commission was right to consider that, by a giving that answer, the applicant had not behaved in such a manner as to justify an additional reduction of the  fine for cooperation during the administrative procedure.

272 Second, in so far as the applicants still claim that the undertakings' failure to object to the legal characterisation of the facts made by the  Commission should not constitute a factor to be relied on for reducing fines, it is necessary to determine whether, as they assert, the reduction made in that respect was contrary to the Notice on Cooperation and infringes the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations and the rights of the defence.

273 In the first place, it must be pointed out that, although section D(2), of the Notice on Cooperation does in fact refer to a case in which, following the statement of objections, an undertaking informs the Commission that it does not dispute the materiality of the facts on which the  Commission bases its accusations, it cannot be interpreted as relating solely to that type of cooperation.

274 The list of the types of cooperation in Section D(2), of the Notice on Cooperation is merely indicative, as is confirmed by a the use of the expression may include.

275 It must also be remembered that that notice also covers cases in which one of the undertakings concerned has reported a  cartel to the Commission, either before the  Commission has carried out an investigation (Section B of the notice) or after the Commission has conducted an investigation but has been unable to find a sufficient basis to justify initiating the procedure for the adoption of a decision (Section C of the notice). The fact that the notice thus expressly provides for the possibility of admitting an infringement at that stage of the administrative procedure does not mean that it cannot be admitted at a later stage.

276 Moreover, admission of the existence of a  cartel facilitates the  Commission's work in an investigation more than the mere admission of the materiality of the facts.

277 Since the  Commission was required to assess the extent of the cooperation shown by the undertakings without infringing the principle of equal treatment, AST therefore had no reason to entertain any legitimate expectation that there would be no differentiation as between undertakings which admitted the facts and those which also admitted the existence of a  cartel.

278 Finally, KTN's argument that the  Commission in fact penalised undertakings which availed themselves of their rights of defence cannot be accepted. It has not been alleged that, by reducing the amount of the  fines on account of cooperation, the  Commission in this case compelled KTN to provide answers whereby it might have had to admit the existence of the infringement (see BPB de Eendracht v Commission, cited above, paragraph 324).
279 Accordingly, the second part of the plea raised by KTN and AST must be rejected.
280 Accordingly, only the first part of the plea put forward by KTN and AST must be upheld.

281 Consequently, having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the Court of First Instance, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, considers that, in respect of their cooperation during the administrative procedure, the applicants should be granted a reduction of 20% of the  fine, as determined by the Decision before such cooperation was taken into account, since those undertakings informed the  Commission of the holding of the Madrid meeting in circumstances similar to those surrounding the provision of the same information by Usinor.
II - Breach of general principles of law in setting the amount of the  fine A - Breach of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations Arguments of the parties
282 KTS maintains that, since the  Commission was already aware of the existence of the alloy surcharge formula, as is apparent from paragraphs 60 to 63 of the Decision and the reference made to  Commission Decision 80/257/ECSC of 8 February 1980 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty in respect of a price-fixing system for the sale of rolled steel products ex stock by stock holders on the German market (OJ 1980 L 62, p. 28), and never expressed any adverse views in that connection, it could not impose a fine on it without giving the reasons for which that formula was now to be regarded as involving unlawful conduct. The Decision is therefore vitiated by breach of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.

283 The Commission states that the argument alleging its complicity and its knowledge of the alloy surcharge formula was rejected in paragraphs 61 to 63 of the Decision.

Findings of the Court

284 It must be borne in mind that, as the  Commission found in paragraph 61 of the Decision, in response to a similar argument advanced in the administrative procedure, the undertakings concerned notified it only of the amounts of the alloy surcharges applied by them. On the other hand, they never disclosed the calculation formula itself or the conditions for its implementation. That finding, which, moreover, is not disputed, shows to be entirely untrue the claim that the  Commission was aware of the infringement at issue, which involved not the use of a single formula for calculating the alloy surcharge but the inclusion in that formula, as from the same date and by all the undertakings concerned, of the same reference values for the alloying materials, with a view to securing a price increase.

285 Furthermore, the extract from Decision 80/257 cited by the  Commission in paragraph 63 of the Decision specifically shows that the  Commission did not criticised the undertakings concerned for adopting a single formula for calculating the alloy surcharge as such (see paragraph 87 above).
286 Accordingly, this plea must be rejected.
B - Breach of the principle of equal treatment
Arguments of the parties

287 The applicants maintain that they suffered unfavourable treatment compared with the other undertakings involved in the procedure, namely Usinor, Outokumpu and Acerinox.

288 With regard to Usinor, they refer to their arguments concerning the reduction of 40% granted to that company for cooperating in the administrative procedure and claim that they cooperated in the same way.

289 As regards Outokumpu, the  Commission did not set out in the Decision the reasons for which it decided not to impose a  fine on it, despite the fact that it had been informed of the discussions at the Madrid meeting and was involved in the contested practices in the same way as all the undertakings. In that connection, AST asks the Court to order the  Commission to produce all its internal documents relating to the treatment accorded to Outokumpu.

290 As regards Acerinox, the applicants object to the reduction of 30% granted to it in respect of extenuating circumstances, contending that it was the main organiser of the Madrid meeting.

291 Finally, AST also claims to have suffered discriminatory treatment compared with Avesta. The latter was granted a reduction of 40% on the ground that it brought the infringement to an end in 1996. However, that reduction was based on an incorrect assessment of the duration of the infringement.

292 The Commission considers that the applicants have not suffered any unfavourable treatment compared with that accorded to the other undertakings involved in the procedure.

293 As regards Usinor, it refers to the arguments already put forward relating to the cooperation shown by the applicants in the administrative procedure.

294 As regards Outokumpu, the  Commission states that it did not send it a statement of objections because it did not have sufficient information to demonstrate that undertaking's participation in the infringement. Moreover, it did not take part in the Madrid meeting.

295 As regards Acerinox, the  Commission considers that its later application of the alloy surcharge on its domestic market was of greater importance in assessing the amount of its  fine than the mere fact that it was responsible for logistic organisation of the Madrid meeting, which did not necessarily imply that it was the instigator of the meeting.
Findings of the Court

296 According to settled case-law, the principle of equal treatment is infringed only where comparable situations are treated differently or different situations are treated in the same way, unless such difference of treatment is objectively justified (BPB de Eendracht v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 309 and the case-law there cited).

297 As regards the alleged discrimination by comparison with Usinor, it must be recalled that the Court has already upheld the first part of the applicants' plea concerning reduction of the  fine for their cooperation in the administrative procedure. For the reasons stated (see paragraphs 232 to 249 and 281 above), the
Court considered that a reduction of 20% should be granted to them for their cooperation because they provided information similar to that provided by Usinor concerning the Madrid meeting.


Page 66 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
298 As regards the alleged discrimination by comparison with Outokumpu, it is important to remember that, according to the case-law, where an undertaking has acted in breach of Community competition law, it cannot escape being penalised altogether on the ground that another trader has not been  fined, when that trader's circumstances are not even the subject of proceedings before the Court (see, in particular,
Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraph 197).

299 The allegation that the  Commission wrongly decided not to proceed against Outokumpu or did not give reasons for the failure to take action against it is therefore irrelevant to this case and must be rejected. Accordingly, the application for measures of organisation of procedure submitted in that connection by AST must also be rejected.

300 Similarly, the argument that Acerinox wrongly benefited from a reduction of 30% of the basic amount of the fine, by reason of extenuating circumstances, cannot be upheld. It must be remembered that the Commission stated in paragraph 82 of the Decision that that additional reduction was justified by the fact that Acerinox had not applied the alloy surcharge on its domestic market until a later stage. Even if it is assumed that such a reduction could be regarded as excessive in the circumstances of this case, the applicants do not in any event claim that they were in a similar situation to Acerinox.

301 As regards AST's complaint of discriminatory treatment as compared with Avesta, it must be stated, first, that it seeks once more to challenge the assessment of the duration of the infringement made by the Commission, which has, moreover, been accepted as correct and, second, that it fails to mention all the reasons for the 40% reduction granted to that undertaking and, in particular, the fact that it expressly admitted its participation in the concertation penalised.
302 This plea must therefore be rejected.
The claim for annulment of the combined provisions of Articles 1 and 4 of the Decision
Arguments of the parties

303 The applicants claim, first, that Article 4 of the Decision, ordering them to put an end to the infringements found in Article 1, is unlawful since, when the Decision was adopted, those infringements had already ceased.

304 Second, they assert that Article 4 of the Decision is imprecise since it is not apparent either from the operative part or from the grounds of the Decision what course of conduct should be followed in order to comply with it.

305 Finally, the combined provisions of Articles 1 and 4 of the Decision, in so far as they require them to adopt a particular course of conduct in the future, have no legal basis. Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty confers on the  Commission only power to impose  fines or periodic penalty payments on undertakings which have infringed the competition rules.

306 The Commission states, first, that the applicants' argument that the infringement was of a sporadic nature, so that Article 4 of the Decision is invalid, is unfounded.

307 Second, the infringement which the applicants are required to bring to an end is clearly defined in Article 1 of the Decision, namely the change to and application in a concerted manner of the reference values in the formula for calculating the alloy surcharge. It follows that, in order to comply with the Decision, the applicants should no longer apply the reference values decided on at the Madrid meeting in December
1993. The applicants clearly understood the meaning of that obligation since, in their letters of 11 March
1998, they informed the  Commission that they had decided to apply new reference values for the alloying
materials as from 1 April 1988 when calculating the alloy surcharge.

308 Third, the  Commission denies that the instruction contained in Article 4 of the Decision unlawfully calls in question the future conduct of the applicants. It submits that the legality of that instruction derives from its power to determine  fines or periodic penalty payments under Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty.
Findings of the Court

309 It must be pointed out that Article 65(4) of the ECSC Treaty confers exclusive power on the Commission, subject to a right of appeal before the Community Court, to determine whether the agreements, decisions and concerted practices referred to in that article comply with its provisions. The Commission also has exclusive power to impose  fines or periodic penalty payments to sanction the conduct mentioned in Article 65(1).




Page 67 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
310 It is clear from the scheme of those provisions that the  Commission is empowered to establish, by a decision, any infringement of Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty, as it did with regard to the applicants and the other undertakings concerned in Article 1 of the Decision.

311 By requiring the applicants, in Article 4 of the Decision, to put an end to the acts or conduct at issue and to refrain from repeating them and from adopting any measure having an equivalent effect, the Commission merely indicated the consequences, regarding their future conduct, of the finding of illegality in Article 1 (see, to that effect, Ahlström Osakeyhtiö and Others v  Commission, cited above, paragraph
184).

312 That instruction was, moreover, sufficiently precise since the grounds of the Decision indicate the basis on which the Commission found to be illegal all the conduct referred to in Article 1 of the Decision. Moreover, as the Commission rightly emphasised, the applicants clearly understood the scope of their obligations since each of them applied new reference values as from 1 April 1998 for the purpose of calculating the alloy surcharge.

313 As regards the argument that the infringements had already ceased when the Decision was adopted, it need merely be pointed out that it seeks again to call in question the  Commission's assessment of the duration of the infringement, which has in fact been upheld.
314 It follows that the applicants' claims for annulment of the combined provisions of Articles 1 and 4 of the
Decision must be rejected.
Exercise by the Court of its unlimited jurisdiction

315 The Court has already annulled Article 1 of the Decision in so far as it imputes to KTN responsibility for the infringement of Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty for which Thyssen Stahl is criticised (see paragraph 55 et seq., above). Accordingly, for the purpose of calculating KTN's  fine, it is inappropriate to take account of
the fine imposed on it for the infringement committed by Thyssen Stahl. In that connection, the Decision indicates that the  fine set by the Commission in respect of the infringement committed by Thyssen Stahl was ECU 3 564 000. The basic amount of Thyssen Stahl's  fine had been set at ECU 4.4 million in respect of the gravity and duration of the infringement (paragraph 80 of the Decision), less 10% in respect of extenuating circumstances relating to the situation in the sector (paragraph 84 of the Decision), and 10% for its cooperation during the procedure (paragraph 101 of the Decision).

316 The Court has also upheld the first part of the applicants' plea regarding reduction of the  fine in respect of their cooperation in the administrative procedure (see paragraphs 232 to 249). For the reasons already given (see paragraph 281), the Court considers that it is appropriate to grant KTN and AST in that regard a reduction of 20% of the amount of the  fine.

317 According to the Decision, before a reduction of 10% was made in respect of their cooperation during the procedure (paragraph 101 of the Decision), the basic amount of the  fines, by reason of the gravity and duration of the infringement, had been set at ECU 5.6 million for KTN (regardless of the  fine imposed on Thyssen Stahl) and for AST (paragraph 80 of the Decision), then reduced by 10% in respect of extenuating circumstances relating to the situation in the sector (paragraph 84 of the Decision), giving a sum of ECU 5
040 000 for each of those undertakings.

318 For both KTN and AST it is appropriate, for the reasons given above, to grant a reduction of 20% of the latter amount, being equivalent to a reduction of ECU 1 008 000. Consequently, the total  fine imposed on KTN and that imposed on AST will be set at ECU 4 032 000.

319 In view of the foregoing considerations and of the entry into force on 1 January 1999 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the  euro (OJ 1997 L 160, p. 1), the amount of those  fines must be expressed in euro.
Decision on costs: Costs
320 Under Article 87(3) of its Rules of Procedure, the Court of First Instance may, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, order that the costs be shared.

321 In the present circumstances, it is appropriate in Case T-45/98 to order the parties to bear their own costs and, in Case T-47/98, to order the applicant to bear its own costs and two-thirds of those incurred by the Commission.
Operative part:

HD         UPDATE 2-SGL Carbon to shed 430 jobs in global revamp. BY          By Steven Silber

FRANKFURT, Dec 19 (Reuters) - SGL Carbon AG on Wednesday unveiled a global restructuring plan aimed at cutting debt and improving cash flow as the  German graphite maker strives to counter the slump in the U.S. steel industry.

But the restructuring's one-off  charge of 41 million euros ($36.8 million) in the fourth quarter sent the company's stock down more than nine percent.

TD
SGL, a leading producer of graphite electrodes for steel production, said it would cut 430 jobs and close its Niagara Falls plant in New York State to obtain savings of 22 million  euros in 2002 and 32 million in 2003. It would take the one-time  charge to cover the costs of the one-year plan.

"Its key purpose is to align the company's structures and costs to increase efficiency and to respond to the ongoing globalisation of the customer base," SGL said in a statement.

The restructuring includes the loss of 200 jobs in  Europe and 230 jobs at the group's North American operations. SGL had more than 8,000 employees at the end of 2000.

By 1610 GMT SGL shares were down 9.51 percent at 22.07  euros, compared with a 0.2 percent fall on the mid-cap MDAX index.

The slump in the U.S. steel sector had already sent SGL shares down 66 percent from their February 6 year high of 72.80  euros, prompting Chief Executive Robert Koehler to announce in November that the firm would cut net debt by reducing working capital and investments.
MAINTAINING CAPACITY

SGL will realign its carbon and graphite business area into focused factories, it said, adding that its plant in Morganton, North Carolina, would take over production from Niagara Falls.

"We are maintaining the same volume but taking the complete overhead of that old plant out of the system with all the costs related to it," CEO Koehler told a conference call.

"We can conduct the same manufacturing process of those 5,000 tonnes approximately without having to employ additional people. This is why the savings are so vast."

Chief Financial Officer Bruno Toniolo said he expected the 41 million  euro charge to be tax-deductible, but the tax aspect was not likely to have a major impact on the firm's cash flow.

After nine months, SGL made a pre-tax loss of about 27 million  euros, versus a 20 million euro profit last year.
Deutsche Bank analyst Klaus Soer said he expected SGL's full-year pre-tax loss to come in at around
60 million euros, also taking into consideration 35 million  euros in provisions for fines by cartel
authorities.

SGL was fined 80.2 million euros by the European Commission earlier this year, part of 219 million
euros in fines against the company and rivals in Germany, Japan and the United States for
price-fixing of graphite electrodes.

The Wiesbaden-based group is also currently developing two "new economy" divisions - corrosion protection and fibres and composites, which focus on fuel cell materials, high-performance brake systems and components for semiconductors.

OIL & GAS
*OPEC Chief Says Does Not Know Decision on Output Cuts

ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC's president, Chakib Khelil of Algeria, said on Wednesday he did not know whether the group would agree to cut oil production or not when it meets next week in Egypt.

Khelil, who is his government's energy and mines minister, also declined to express an opinion about non-OPEC producers' pledges to cut output as part of a drive to shore up oil prices.

"I cannot tell you what decision OPEC will take during its meeting on Dec. 28 in Cairo. I do not know if we will reduce output or not because the decision belongs to the organization as a whole," he told reporters.
*Non-OPEC Oman to Cut Output by 40,000 Barrels a Day From January

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (Reuters) - Independent Gulf producer Oman said on Thursday it would increase its oil production cut to 40,000 barrels a day from January to June 2002 to help OPEC bolster prices.

The official Oman News Agency (ONA) quoted Oil Minister Mohammad bin Hamad bin Seif al-Rumhy as saying the deeper cut was intended to "stabilize oil prices on the international market".

Oman's higher commitment means five non-OPEC nations have pledged reductions totaling 462,500 barrels a day, just short of the 500,000 barrels a day OPEC is looking for to trigger its own 1.5 million barrels a day of cuts from January 1.

Rumhy told Reuters last week that non-OPEC Oman had already cut output by 25,000 barrels a day from December 1.
*Libya Told Buyers to Prepare for Oil Cut

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC producer Libya has told its oil customers to prepare for less contract volumes starting from January 1, an industry source said on Thursday.

The source said Libya was expecting OPEC to cut supplies under a supply curb deal with its rival producers so it had informed customers of lower volumes.
"I am not sure of the size of Libya's cut but customers have been informed," the source told Reuters. OPEC will hold an emergency meeting in Cairo on December 28 to decide output policy after
non-OPEC producers pledged supply curbs to help the  cartel shore up prices.
*U.S. Says Vessel Boarded in Gulf is Belize-flagged

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon disputed an Iranian report on Wednesday that U.S. naval forces in the Gulf attacked an oil tanker bound for an Iranian port and said the vessel boarded was a Belize-flagged oil tanker suspected of violating sanctions against Iraq.
It said one crew member was slightly injured in the incident.

Iran's state television had said the tanker was an Iranian-registered Saudi ship and that two people were hurt.

U.S. Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Lapan said the tanker was allowed to proceed after being inspected and found not to be breaking sanctions.
*First of New Iraq Oil Contracts Avoids U.S. Firms

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies again were excluded as the first batch of eight new oil contracts were signed, despite the fact that the United States is by far the largest consumer of Iraqi crude, U.N. sources said.

Chinese companies led the way, accounting for 8 million barrels of the 20 million barrels in the first batch of contracts for the new phase.
One of the two contracts to Chinese firms was awarded to the British arm of Chinese trading firm
Sinochem.
*Russian Government Questions Gazprom Spending Plans
Page 77 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian government, trying to exercise more control over its mammoth gas producer Gazprom, refused on Thursday to approve a $5.0 billion 2002 investment program and asked for cuts in planned spending.

Gazprom, in which the state has 38%, has been accused in the past of wasteful spending and improper use of resources, but the government now seems to be trying to rein it in.

"A list of investments which do not raise questions from the government will be confirmed soon, presented again by January 10 and be approved by (the cabinet) on January 20," said Deputy Economy and Trade Minister Andrei Sharonov.

He said Gazprom wanted to invest 161 billion rubles ($5.31 billion) in 2002, 72% more than in 2001, while the government said 140 billion rubles was enough.
*German Cartel Office Sets Conditions on Petrol Joint Ventures

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Germany's cartel office on Thursday approved two petrol station mergers involving the country's biggest utilities RWE AG and E.ON AG, subject to a number of strict conditions.

The two deals involve Royal Dutch/Shell, which aims to tie up its petrol stations with the DEA chain owned by Germany's second biggest utility RWE.

The other part of the deal involves leading utility E.ON's plan to swap its production unit Veba Oel - which incorporates the market leading filling station chain Aral - for BP's 25.5% stake in the country's top gas importer and distributor Ruhrgas and a cash payment.
This is a crucial step for E.ON, which aims to take majority control of Ruhrgas.
*Kazakhstan Eyeing New Crude Oil Export Routes

ALMATY, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is seeking new export routes to carry oil output that will reach an annual 120 million tons by 2015 and is discussing with China, Iran and Turkey possible pipeline plans, a top oil official said on Wednesday.

Timur Kulibayev, head of TNG, the state oil and gas transport company, told a briefing that Kazakhstan was currently producing about 40 million tons of oil a year and exporting about 70% of that volume.

He said the country now used a pipeline through Russia with a capacity of 15 million tons a year, as well as the railways and sea transport to carry its oil exports.
*Finland's Fortum Admits to Baltic Oil Spills

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's largest energy group Fortum could face  fines after it said on Thursday that two recent oil spills off Finland's Western coast had come from its Naantali refinery.

"The latest (spill) was on Sunday and there are very many opinions about (the origin of) that. The first was from our refinery and the other one has come from the same origin," refinery spokesman Pekka Vennonen told Reuters. He said no oil was leaking from the refinery at present.

As a result of the spills Fortum will likely have to pay compensation, said Martti Koivisto, criminal inspector in charge of the incident, but he declined to speculate on the size of a possible  fine.
*RWE Acquires U.K. Gas Producer Highland Energy
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  German utility RWE AG said on Thursday it had agreed to acquire British
gas producer Highland Energy Holdings in a move which will give it access to gas reserves in the North
Sea.
No financial details were given.

The acquisition, which still requires official clearance, continues RWE's expansion in the  European gas market following its acquisition earlier this week of Czech gas import monopoly Transgas together with stakes in eight regional distributors.

RWE said the Highland acquisition increased the gas reserves available to its RWE-DEA energy unit by more than a third to 47 billion cubic meters.
*ChevronTexaco Establishes Lubricants Company

SAN RAMON, Calif. (Reuters) - ChevronTexaco, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, on Wednesday unveiled a lubricants company aimed at offering cut-priced oils and greases directly to U.S. customers.

Gulf Lubricants Co., as the unit is known, is headquartered in San Ramon, California and currently has distribution facilities in Houston and Chicago, ChevronTexaco said.
Financial details surrounding the launch of the company were not disclosed.

Gulf Lubricants products will be available to customers in the central U.S., with the company expanding its delivery capabilities across the country in 2002, ChevronTexaco said.
************************************** POWER & UTILITY
*Judge Sends Dynegy vs. Enron Suit to Texas Court

HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday handed Dynegy Inc. an early victory in its fight to take a lucrative pipeline from  bankrupt Enron Corp., granting the power trader's request to have its lawsuit heard in a state court.

U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon's ruling significantly speeds up the progress in Dynegy's suit seeking control of the Northern Natural Gas pipeline, which was its consolation prize in its busted merger with Enron.

A speedy takeover of the pipeline is critical for Dynegy, since credit rating agencies consider the legal brawl a potentially major negative issue that could lead them to junk the trader's credit.

The uncertainty around the litigation has also sheared off roughly half of Dynegy's stock value since it pulled out of its $9 billion rescue merger with Enron on Nov. 28.
*U.K. BNFL Says Starts Up Controversial Nuclear Plant
LONDON (Reuters) - State-owned British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) said on Thursday it was starting up a
472 million pound ($797 million) nuclear fuel manufacturing plant that has been the focus of several
legal challenges to stop it opening.

"BNFL has today commenced the first stage of active plutonium commissioning of the Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP)," the company said in a statement.

The news that highly toxic plutonium is being introduced into SMP will come as a blow to opponents of the plant, including environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and the government of Ireland.
All three have attempted to block the plant from opening via the courts.
*PG&E Cites California Laws Hampering Reorganization

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp., owner of  bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co., said on Wednesday it would file an amended reorganization plan citing 37 California laws hampering its plans to transfer key assets of its regulated utility to deregulated subsidiaries.
Those assets include the utility's vast hydroelectric power system in Northern California and the giant
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on the state's central coast.

The amended plan, sent to the federal  bankruptcy court here, differs little from its initial Sept. 20 filing. But PG&E warned that preempting certain state laws was essential to its overall effort to nurse the company back to financial health.

"Unless preempted, these specific CPUC (California Public Utilities  Commission) laws and regulations could restrict the transfer of property and issuance of new securities required to implement the plan,"
the company said.
************************************** REGULATORY & ENVIRONMENT
*U.S. FERC Mulls Rules for Energy Derivatives


Page 79 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission said on Wednesday it may adopt new financial reporting rules that would require energy firms such as Enron Corp. to file an annual snapshot of their derivatives exposure.

FERC commissioners, who voted unanimously to seek public suggestions on whether such new rules were needed, did not mention Enron by name but repeatedly said "recent events" had caused them to take a closer look at the agency's reporting rules

Derivatives were widely used by Enron, which ranked as the nation's biggest trader of electricity and natural gas contracts until it sought  bankruptcy protection earlier this month.
*U.K. Power Industry Backs Government Over Market Abuse

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's electricity generators welcomed the government's rejection of energy regulator Ofgem's calls for greater powers to curb manipulation of wholesale prices.

The Association of Electricity Producers (AEP) in a statement said it backed a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) decision to throw out Ofgem's proposal to write a market-abuse condition into generators' operating licenses.

"The license condition would have allowed the regulator, after the event, to deem normal commercial behavior to be 'abuse' and with no independent appeal, to  fine companies heavily," said AEP chief David Porter.

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Wednesday said it did not consider Ofgem's worries about possible power market manipulation sufficient to justify modifying generators' operating licenses.
*U.K. Utilities Face  Fines if Too Many Power Cuts

LONDON (Reuters) - British electricity distributors will face  fines if they fail to meet targets to improve services and reduce the number of power cuts, said regulator Ofgem on Wednesday.

Companies could be fined up to 1.75% of their revenue if they fail to meet the targets, but if they beat them, then they can earn extra revenue depending on the improvement in services over the next three years.

The 14 distribution firms also face penalties of up to 0.125% of revenue for poor quality of telephone responses to complaints.

The fines will be on top of compensation companies already have to pay to customers if their power supplies are cut.
*Midwest ISO to Run Vast Transmission Grid

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday approved the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc as the nation's first regional transmission organization (RTO) to manage a vast electricity grid stretching from North Carolina to North Dakota and down to Texas.

The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission also said rival Alliance RTO must combine its resources with the Midwest ISO to form a single transmission manager.
Alliance "lacks sufficient scope and size" to exist as a stand-alone RTO, FERC said.

The Midwest ISO may need eventually to change its name because it will control the transmission lines for a "broad market" encompassing a vast section of the United States, said FERC Chairman Pat
Wood. States included in the Midwest ISO include all of the Midwest and Plains states plus Texas, Arkansas and part of the Southeast.
*FERC Re-opens El Paso Natural Gas Case in California

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission on Wednesday reopened an investigation into whether El Paso Corp. improperly manipulated the California natural gas market last year.

Natural gas is widely used to fuel electricity generating plants in California. Record-high prices for natural gas last year and early this year were blamed for contributing to the state's electricity shortages.




Page 80 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The commission finds that the public interest requires it to re-examine the issue in order to protect California customers," FERC said in an order. "The proceeding is remanded to a chief law judge for the purpose of re-examining the record."

An agency administrative law judge must hold a pre-hearing conference on the El Paso case within 20 days, FERC said.
*FERC Oks $700 Million Millennium Natural Gas Pipeline

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission approved on Wednesday the controversial Millennium pipeline project that would bring 700 million cubic feet of natural gas a day
from Canada to the suburbs of New York City.

The $700 million pipeline is co-owned by NiSource unit Columbia Gas Transmission, MCN Energy Inc., TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy.
FERC said the operators of the project must still negotiate a final route for the end of the pipeline in
Mount Vernon, N.Y. with town officials and submit a plan within 60 days.

If the parties cannot reach an agreement, FERC said it will decide the Mount Vernon stretch of the pipeline. Mount Vernon, a city of 70,000 people on just over four square miles, is the ninth most densely populated municipality in the United States. City residents have opposed the pipeline route, which would cut through several parks, schools and apartment buildings.
*FERC OK's Islander East Pipeline in Connecticut, New York

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) on Wednesday gave an initial okay to the Islander East pipeline project to transport natural gas in Connecticut and New
York.

The $150 million project would be able to transport 260 million cubic feet of natural gas a day over a 51 mile (80 kilometer) pipeline. The pipeline would be operated by Islander East, a limited liability
company that is equally owned by Duke Energy and KeySpan Corp.

FERC said it must still review the environmental impact of the pipeline before it can make a final decision.
*Algeria MPs Lift Monopoly on Power Generation

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's lower house of parliament has voted a key electricity law, ending the state monopoly on the power generation industry, officials said on Thursday.
The law, which was passed by an overwhelming majority of the 380 member parliament later on
Wednesday, lifts the monopoly held for decades by state-owned electricity and gas firm Sonatrach.

"The law voted yesterday separates the state from investors and guarantees the egality between investors, locals as well as foreigners," a senior energy minister official said.

The government said the law is aimed at helping it raise private funds to finance an ambitious $12 billion investment in the energy sector over the next decade, including modernizing electricity production and transport facilities.

BRUSSELS (MktNews) - The EU carbonless paper sector became the latest victim of the European Commission's crackdown on cartels, with the  commission imposing a 313.7 million euro fine on 10 companies in the sector.
The fine is the second biggest ever announced by the Brussels agency and closes a record year for
cartel-busting by the  commission. There have been 10 decisions taken to fine cartels this year, including
the vitamins sector (855.23 million  euros); graphite electrodes (218.8 million euros); citric acid (135.22
million euros); German banks (108 million euros - for operating a  cartel on euro conversion charges).
Also fined were firms in the Belgian and Luxembourg beer markets, and the zinc phosphate and sodium
gluconate sectors.

TD
The paper cartel involved companies from the UK, Spain,  Germany and France over the years
1992-1995. The commission's probe started in 1996. Standing out among those  charged is the UK's
Arjo Wiggins Appleton Plc, fined 187.27 million of the total.

EU Competition Commissioner said the latest  fine "comes at the end of a year in which the  commission has taken a long line of decisions against cartels of all kinds. This unprecedented level of activity shows two things: first that these secret practices are widespread, but also that the  commission has given itself the wherewithal to detect and pursue such offences and impose effective penalties."

MEGA MOVIE GUIDE 2001
A.I. (PG-13)

TD
Director: Steven Spielberg. With Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, Jude Law, William Hurt. (140 min.)

Sterritt *** The time is the distant future, and 11-year-old David is a new kind of android whose "artificial" intelligence is programmed with "authentic" emotions. But what if David's human love proves incompatible with his robotic nature? Spielberg took over this fantasy from the late Stanley Kubrick, but his own approach favors the pure fantasy styles of "E.T." and "Pinocchio," bringing the results closer to a high-tech joyride than a thought-provoking parable. Be warned that the violence-prone Spielberg of "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindler's List" is also on display.
Staff ** Pointless, shallow characters, stale.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 20 scenes, one quite violent torture scene. Profanity: 1 expression, mild. Drugs: None.
The Affair of the Necklace (R)
Director: Charles Shyer. With Hilary Swank, Jonathan Pryce, Adrien Brody, Simon Baker, Christopher
Walken, Brian Cox, Joely Richardson. (120 min.)

Sterritt ** Check off the ingredients for an old-fashioned historical melodrama: an orphan with noble blood, a secretly sinful churchman, an imperious queen, a mystic who may or may not know the future, and a piece of spectacular jewelry that becomes the center of an explosive 18th-century scandal. This sort of material goes back to D.W. Griffith and beyond, and Swank's persona seems too modern to compete with Lillian Gish on her own turf. The movie has almost enough corny appeal to offset its lack of originality, though, and Walken is fun as Cagliostro, the court's great prognosticator and all- around weirdo.
Sex/Nudity: 10 scenes, half innuendo. Violence: 8 scenes. Profanity: 10 mostly mild expressions. Drugs:
12 scenes with alcohol, 1 with drugs.
A Love Divided (PG)
Director: Sydney McCartney. With Nicole Bohan, Melissa Bolger, Sarah Bolger, Orla Brady. (98 min.) Staff *** A Protestant woman marries into a Catholic family in a small Irish village, and consequently
agrees to raise her daughter Catholic. But when the village priest insists that their eldest daughter attend
a Catholic school, the woman flees with both her little girls. The family's strife soon seeps into the town
and the undercurrent of tension between the two groups comes to the surface. While the plot is nothing
new, the genuine acting in this true story brings a freshness to an old problem. By Lane Hartill

Staff *** Nuanced, inspiring, overwrought. Sex/Nudity: 1 implied sex scene. Violence: 6 mild scenes. Profanity: 16 mild and harsh expressions. Drugs: 3 scenes with cigarettes, 7 with alcohol.
About Adam (R)
Director: Gerard Stembridge. With Kate Hudson, Stuart Townsend, Frances O'Connor. (105 min.) Staff **1/2 Adam (Townsend) doesn't mean any harm as he woos bookworm O'Connor and bored
housewife Bradley - both of them sisters of his fiancee (Hudson). In a storytelling technique dating back
to at least 'Citizen Kane' and 'Rashomon,' we see each sister's version of the tale. Writer-director
Stembridge's light touch and his comedy ensemble work to keep things fresh. But what this movie says
about infidelity will prove more than a little dismaying to viewers. By M.K. Terrell.

Sex/Nudity: 6 sex scenes, brief nudity. Violence: None. Profanity: 48 often- harsh expressions. Drugs: 13 scenes of drinking, 4 scenes with smoking.
All the Pretty Horses (PG-13)
Director: Billy Bob Thornton. With Matt Damon, Henry Thomas, Penelope Cruz, Ruben Blades, Robert
Patrick, Sam Shepherd, Lucas Black. (116 min.)

Staff **1/2 An all-but-orphaned Texan (Damon) who hungers for horses and a land without borders, flees to Mexico with his childhood pal where he finds lessons in love, death, and revenge. Or perhaps they find him, in this morally wrought drama. At times, the themes loom like Plato's absolutes, larger than the vast expanses. Occasional surprises in the camerawork and direction barely keep the adventure from slipping into tiresome epic formula. Lucas Black shines in his role as the young and pesty tagalong. By Samar Farah

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes, no nudity. Violence: 10 scenes, including torture, stabbing, fights. Profanity: 42 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 3 scenes with drinking, 12 scenes with smoking.
Along Came A Spider (R)
Director: Lee Tamahori. With Morgan Freeman, Monica Potter, Michael Wincott, Jay O. Sanders, Dylan
Baker, Raoul Ganeev. (104 min.)

Staff **1/2 Morgan Freeman is back as Washington detective Dr. Alex Cross in this well-paced thriller, which is technically the prequel to "Kiss the Girls." He's on the trail of an intelligent and cunning villain - Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) - who has kidnapped the daughter of a US senator. "Along Came a Spider" is filled with surprising twists, which often evoke a smile. It contains scenes of fairly graphic violence, including one car crash and several shootings. By Steven Savides
Staff * Stale dialogue, ridiculous twists, Morgan Freeman is about the only redeeming aspect of this film. Sex/Nudity: 1 reference to sex. Violence: 9 instances, with mostly brief gun shots. Profanity: 9 harsh
expressions. Drugs: 1 cigarette.
Amelie (R)

Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Arthus de Penguern. (121 min.)

Sterritt *** Amelie is a waitress who anonymously helps a stranger, observes the happiness this brings him, and becomes an eager do-gooder for people who never asked her to barge into their lives. Jeunet is never happy with a scene until he's directed it half to death with manic camera work and editing. But the lighthearted plot of this romantic French comedy balances his overeager style, and Tautou's acting is amiable enough to shine through any amount of cinematic fuss. In French with English subtitles
Staff ***1/2 Unconventional, delightful, mischievous, visually stunning.

Sex/Nudity: 8 scenes with implied sex, innuendo and brief nudity. Violence: 4 mild scenes of comic violence. Profanity: None. Drugs: 9 scenes with alcohol, 1 scene with a cigarette.
American Desi (Not rated)

Director: Piyush Dinker Pandya. With Deep Katdare, Purva Bedi, Ronobir Lahiri, Anil Kumar, Kal Penn. (100 min.)



Page 84 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt ** A loosely knit group of Indian-American students pursue learning, chase romance, and come to terms with their Indian heritage in this boisterous comedy set in an American university. The subject is likable and the story has possibilities, but why does every single performance sink into a self-indulgent mess of hammy overacting?
American Outlaws (PG-13)
Director: Les Mayfield. With Colin Farrell, Scott Caan, Ali Larter, Timothy Dalton, Kathy Bates. (90 min.) Staff DUD This depiction of the rise of notorious outlaw Jesse James wasn't meant to be overly serious,
but Colin Farrell and his dastardly gang have all the screen presence of a bunch of frat boys playing
cowboys and learning how to ride horses. Comparing the film to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"
as Warner Brothers has done, is like comparing "Rambo" to "Apocalypse Now." Except that "Rambo"
actually made a splash. This dud will be forgotten by fall. By Matthew MacLean
American Pie 2 (R)

Director: J.B. Rogers. With Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott. (104 min.)

Sterritt ** It's summer vacation, the "American Pie" alumni are now college kids, and all they can think of is still - you guessed it - sex, sex, sex. This energetic sequel moves from one gross-out set piece to another, with occasional moments of teenpic sentimentality to cleanse the palate. It delivers all the raunch and ribaldry its designated audience could hope for, but others may find it more deliberately disgusting than effervescently outrageous.

Sex/Nudity: 19 scenes of graphic innuendo or implied sex, 1 sex scene with nudity. Violence: 2 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: 124 very harsh expressions. Drugs: 20 scenes with alcohol, 1 with smoking.
America's Sweethearts (PG-13)
Director: Joe Roth. With Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, Christopher
Walken, Alan Arkin, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci. (109 min.)

Sterritt * To build enthusiasm for an expensive production, a Hollywood publicist (Crystal) asks a feuding movie-star couple (Cusack and Zeta-Jones) to fake a reconciliation, helped by an assistant (Roberts)
who has her own personal stakes in the situation. This story is complicated enough to look interesting on paper, but it falls flat on screen, weighed down by far-fetched plot twists and touches of needlessly crude comedy. Not even the stellar cast can sweeten this sour-hearted satire.
Staff ** Formulaic, funny (at times), half-baked.

Sex/Nudity: 6 scenes of innuendo, 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 3 scenes, including a fight. Profanity: 31 harsh expressions. Drugs: 1 scene with smoking, 9 scenes with drinking, 2 scenes with pilltaking.
Amores Perros (Not rated)
Director: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. With Gael Garcia Bernal, Goya Toledo. (153 min.)

Sterritt *** Dogs and a cataclysmic car accident play key roles in this sometimes enticing, frequently savage Mexican drama, which weaves three stories into a sustained look at the complicated lives of a canine named Cofi and his human companions. Gonzalez Inarritu is a highly promising new talent, although his depictions of animal travails will put this movie way off-limits for many viewers. In Spanish with English subtitles
An Everlasting Piece (R)

Director: Barry Levinson. With Barry McEvoy, Brian O'Byrne, Anna Friel, Billy Connolly, Ruth McCabe, Pauline McLynn. (103 min.)

Staff *** Two barbers (McEvoy and O'Byrne) meet while cutting hair in an asylum and hatch a plan to sell hairpieces. Before they can get the exclusive franchise for Northern Ireland, however, they must get past their religious differences, a rival outfit (Toupee or Not Toupee), the Royal Constabulary, the IRA, a
wig-hungry rottweiler, and a spunky girlfriend (Friel). McEvoy's understated screenplay is full of wit and subtle surprises. By M.K Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes, including male backside nudity. Violence: 6 scenes including man biting an ear. Profanity: 126 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with drinking, 9 scenes with smoking.

Angel Eyes (R)
Director: Luis Mandoki. With Jennifer Lopez, Jim Caviezel, Sonia Braga, Shirley Knight. (104 min.) Staff ** When a stranger (Caviezel) saves South Chicago cop (Lopez) from a dangerous situation, she
thinks she may have met the perfect man until she tries to find out about his past. This unconventional
love story captivates early on, but even Lopez's surprisingly good acting can't rescue this slow- paced
yarn. By Joshua S. Burek
Staff ** Contrived, emotional, sweet moments.

Sex/Nudity: 1 mild sex scene. 3 instances of innuendo and several sexual references. Violence: 7 scenes, including a fistfight. Profanity: 62 often- harsh expressions. Drugs: 3 scenes of smoking, 3 scenes of drinking.
The Animal (PG-13)

Director: Luke Greenfield. With Rob Schneider, Colleen Haskell, Edward Asner, Cloris Leachman. (77 min.)
Sterritt * After a car crash, a mad doctor patches up a bumbling young man with spare parts from
animals, and the patient starts reacting to human situations with beastly behavior. This comic fantasy has
amusing bits of social satire, but they're crowded out of the stable by lots of bathroom and barnyard
humor.
Staff * Lazy humor, featherweight, bananas, base.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes of innuendo. Violence: 13 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: 18 expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with drinking, 2 with smoking.
The Anniversary Party (R)
Directors: Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason-Leigh. With Alan Cumming, Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Jennifer
Beals, Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates. (115 min.)

Staff ** A successful young novelist (Cummings) and his actress wife (Jason- Leigh) celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary by inviting a few select guests, welcome and unwelcome, to their home. Prodded by alcohol and drug- taking, they all reveal their hidden hopes and fears. Cumming and Jason-Leigh
codirect themselves and a passel of stars in effective cameo roles. Contains brutally frank and sexually explicit talk, but also some worthwhile insights into the contemporary male-female dynamic. By Gregory M. Lamb
Staff ** Drags a bit, baroque, actor's picnic.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo, 4 scenes with female nudity, 2 nongraphic sex scenes. Violence: 2 scenes. Profanity: 85 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 1 scene with marijuana, 8 with drinking.
Antitrust (PG-13)

Director: Peter Howitt. With Tim Robbins, Ryanne Phillippe, Claire Forlani, Rachael Leigh Cook. (120 min.)

Staff **1/2Robbins (the man you love to mistrust) plays a Bill Gates-type computer magnate fending off the Federal Trade  Commission while creating a new system to monopolize global communications. When his newly recruited programming whiz (Phillippe) realizes his boss is more sinister than even the government suspects, he sets out to expose him. Flashy editing and visuals make this a fun ride, but can't overcome the sheer unbelievability of it all. Still, it's refreshing to see young computer geniuses portrayed as something resembling normal people. By M.K. Terrell
Apocalypse Now Redux (R)

Director: Francis Ford Coppola. With Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Christian Marquand. (196 min.)

Sterritt **** Coppola has restored 53 minutes of material trimmed from the original 1979 release of "Apocalypse Now," his legendary drama about the Vietnam War, and reedited the movie as a whole. The story, based on Joseph Conrad's haunting 1898 novella "Heart of Darkness," hasn't changed: A young soldier (Sheen) travels up a jungle river to find and assassinate a renegade military officer (Brando)
who's gone insane and established a private kingdom ruled by terror. The film is episodic and uneven,

Page 86 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
but it has moments of great emotional power and stands as a key document for anyone hoping to understand American ambivalence toward the Vietnam War and its soul- searching aftermath.
The Art of Amalia (Not rated)
Director: Bruno de Almeida. With Amalia Rodrigues, David Byrne. (90 min.)

Sterritt *** Rock star Byrne introduces this tuneful look at the life of singer Rodrigues, an internationally renowned interpreter of Portugal's impassioned "fado" songs, so called because of their preoccupation with melancholy turns of fate. A wide range of concert and media clips lend vigor and variety to the documentary. In English and Portuguese with English subtitles
Atlantis: The Lost Empire (PG)
Directors: Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. With the voices of Michael J. Fox, James Garner. (96 min.)

Staff **1/2 "Atlantis" is an attempt at an action-adventure tale set in the early 1900s - part "Indiana Jones" and part Jules Verne. Milo Thatch is a nerdish academic invited to join a submarine mission to find the
lost city of Atlantis, but unforeseen dangers lurk. Fairly entertaining, but hardly a classic Disney cartoon. By Stephen Humphries
Staff **1/2 Exciting, heartening, energetic.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 7 scenes. Profanity: None. Drugs: 6 scenes with smoking. Audition (Not rated)
Director: Miike Takashi. With Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Jun Kunimura, Tetsu Sawaki. (115 min.)

Sterritt ** A middle-age widower takes a cue from the entertainment media and "auditions" women who might make good romantic partners. His selection turns out to be a very strange candidate, however, whose behavior grows more ominous the more he learns about her. The most startling aspect of this slow- building horror movie is how unexpectedly it morphs from a quietly romantic suspense yarn to a
flat-out tale of terror that may have some viewers hiding under their seats. Stay far away unless you're in the mood for very violent surprises. In Japanese with English subtitles
Baby Boy (R)
Director: John Singleton. With Tyrese Gibson, Ving Rhames, Taraji P. Henson, Omar Gooding, Snoop
Dogg. (132 min.)
Sterritt *** This melodrama centers on a young African-American named Jody who lives with his
36-year-old mother and her new boyfriend. The movie begins on an intellectual note, stating a
psychologist's theory that years of racism have made many black men see themselves as overgrown
children. This gives us a clue to Jody's way of life, and kicks off the Oedipus theme that gallops through
the story. Singleton still has a keen eye for harrowing details of urban life.
Staff **1/2 Insightful, compassionate, grave.
Sex/Nudity: 13 quite graphic instances. Violence: 11 scenes including fights and shootings. Profanity:
451 very harsh expressions. Drugs: 20 scenes with smoking, 8 scenes with drinking, 5 scenes with
marijuana.
Band of Outsiders (Not rated)
Director: Jean-Luc Godard. With Anna Karina, Sami Frey, Claude Brasseur. (97 min.)

Sterritt **** "All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun," quipped French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, but in this mercurial crime- tragicomedy- romance he shows that exhilarating doses of style, imagination, and sheer energy also come in handy. Made in 1964, this isn't a legendary Godard masterpiece like "Breathless" and "Contempt," which have also been successfully reissued. It offers 10 times more pleasures than the average picture, though. Originally titled "Bande a parte." In French with English subtitles
Bandits (PG-13)
Director: Barry Levinson. With Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, Troy Garity. (109 min.)



Page 87 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff ** Mildly amusing is probably not what veteran director Barry Levinson was going for when he teamed macho-man Bruce Willis with chatterbox- hypochondriac Billy Bob Thornton as odd-couple  bank robbers in this quirky caper. The talented Cate Blanchett adds spice to the proceedings in her role as a runaway wife who falls for both men at once. But the Billy Bob hypochondriac jokes and Willis's omnipresent wry grins wear thin pretty fast, and the film runs out of gas. Newcomer Troy Garity, who plays the getaway driver and master of pyrotechnics, is a delight, but ultimately it's an offbeat comedy that's a few beats off. By John Kehe
Banoo (The Lady) (Not rated)

Director: Dariush Mehrjui. With Ezatollah Entezami, Gohar Kheirandish, Bita Farrahi, Ferdos Kaviani. (113 min.)

Sterritt *** After learning that her husband has taken a second wife, a young Iranian woman seeks spiritual comfort by helping a series of strangers with illnesses and other challenges in their lives. This well-produced Iranian drama has a poignant story and a fascinating theme, but it doesn't scale the emotional heights or plumb the psychological depths that Mehrjui reached in his earlier "Leilah," a richer and more engrossing film. In Farsi with English subtitles
Baran (Not rated)

Director: Majid Majidi. With Hossein Abedini, Mohammad Reza Naji, Zahra Bahrami, Hossein Rahimi. (105 min.)

Sterritt **** The unglamorous setting is an Iranian construction site, and the unlikely hero is a young Iranian man who falls in love with an Afghan woman after a string of misadventures with an illegal immigrant who works alongside him. Majidi became one of Iran's most internationally famed filmmakers with "Children of Heaven" and "The Color of Paradise," but he far surpasses those sappy melodramas with this expressively filmed story of rivalry, romance, and cultural conflict. In Farsi with English subtitles
Behind Enemy Lines (PG-13)
Director: John Moore. With Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, David Keith, Joaquim de Almeida. (105 min.) Staff ** Comedian Owen Wilson in the role of a naval navigator whose plane is shot down over Bosnia?
You'd be forgiven for thinking that there was a casting- agent strike going on in Hollywood. Fortunately
Wilson's likeability goes a long way toward tempering the film's Rambo-like heroics as he evades Serbs
on his way to a rendevouz with a rescue team. First-time director Moore does a sterling job with stylish
camerawork, but cartoonish characterization and the score's unsubtle attempts to elicit a patriotic
response from the audience are a liability. By Stephen Humphries
Staff **1/2 "The Fugitive" goes to war, gripping, melodramatic end, well-acted.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 6 gory scenes. Profanity: 18 mild expressions. Drugs: 7 scenes with smoking.
Black Knight (PG-13)
Director: Gil Junger. With Martin Lawrence, Tom Wilkinson, Marsha Thompson, Vincent Regan. (95 min.) Staff ** Jamal (Martin Lawrence), a dispirited worker at Medieval World, a run- down amusement park,
reaches for a medallion in the park's moat and hurtles back in time to 14thcentury England. There, his
street smarts and a previously hidden streak of courage mobilize a ragtag bunch of rebels to depose the
corrupt king. The movie is a lot better than you think it's going to be, thanks to Lawrence's energy, witty
lines, and a good-natured take on old cliches. By M.K. Terrell.

Sex/Nudity: 9 scenes of innuendo, 1 with implied sex. Violence: 8 scenes. Profanity: 42 harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with drinking.
The Blackout (Not rated)
Director: Abel Ferrara. With Matthew Modine, Claudia Schiffer, Dennis Hopper, Beatrice Dalle. (100 min.) Sterritt ** A movie star relocates from Hollywood to Miami, develops contrasting relationships with two
different women named Annie, and suffers the consequences of a night so dissolute that he retains no
memory of what happened. This isn't a Ferrara classic like "King of New York," but even his less-
memorable pictures carry an eccentric kick no other director could duplicate.
Blow (R)
Page 88 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Ted Demme. With Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Ray Liotta, Paul Reubens, Rachel Griffiths, Franka Potente. (119 min.)

Sterritt ** The fact-based story of George Jung, a small-time California crook who became a big-time associate of Pablo Escobar's notorious Colombia drug  cartel. The story is inherently stale, especially since Martin Scorsese did it better in the 1990 hit "GoodFellas," but Depp evokes surprising emotional depth with a characteristically subtle performance, and Demme elicits  fine acting from the strong supporting cast.
Staff *** Realistic, compelling, thought-provoking.

Sex/Nudity: Brief nude shots in a photo collage, topless women in a pool, and backside shots of nude women. Violence: Graphic fighting scenes with guns and 1 slap to a woman. Profanity: 134 harsh expressions. Drugs: 31 scenes with alcohol and 39 with drugs.
Blow Dry (R)
Directed by Paddy Breathnack. With Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Rachael Leigh Cook, Josh
Hartnett, Rachel Griffiths. (105 min.)
Staff **1/2 In the quirky style of 'Strictly Ballroom,' Simon Beaufoy, writer of 'The Full Monty,' brings us
'Blow Dry,' the outrageous yet simple story of the competitively hair-obsessed. When the National
Hairdressing Competition comes to a small town in England, a hair-styling family, long ago broken by a
'mom-gone- lesbian' relationship, must decide to come together to win back the championship. It's
bizarre, but the use of odd-shock humor keeps it fun as the story of the never-ending relationship
process unfolds. By Christy Ellington

S/N: 4 scenes of implied sex; including 1 scene with nudity. V: None. P: 22 harsh and mild expressions. D: 5 instances of alcohol; 5 scenes with smoking.
The Blue Angel (Not rated)
Director: Josef von Sternberg. With Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings, Kurt Gerron, Hans Albers. (98 min.) Sterritt **** A fussy old schoolteacher named Professor Unrath falls in love with a slinky nightclub singer
named Lola Lola, whereupon his life falls apart in ways that are poignant as they are predictable. First
released in 1930, this great masterpiece of  German film is evocative and inventive from its first shot to its
last, with brilliant use of sound and astonishing performances from two of Europe's most gifted stars.
Dietrich's acting here is what made her a motion- picture legend. In German with English subtitles
Bob le Flambeur (Not rated)

Director: Jean-Pierre Melville. With Roger Duchesne, Isabelle Corey, Daniel Cauchy, Guy Decomble. (100 min.)

Sterritt **** Set in Montmartre's nightclub district, this 1955 comedy-drama follows the adventures of a high-rolling gambler who gets tired of losing money at the casino and decides to rob the place instead. This isn't one of the greatest French crime dramas, like Melville's own "Le Doulos" and "Le Samurai," both made in the '60s. But its dark-toned cinematography by Henri Decae still packs a wallop, and the screenplay has a refreshing sense of humor, reflecting Melville's concept of the picture as less a straightforward cops-and-robbers story than a scruffy comedy of manners. In French with English subtitles.
Boys to Men (Not rated)
Directors: Phillip Bartel, Duncan Tucker, Dan Castle, Carl Pfirman. With Ema A. Tuennerman, Brett
Chukerman, John Sloan, Paul Dawson, Wayne Danner. (75 min.)
Sterritt **
An anthology of four short films about gay-related subjects. "Crush" is a gentle but ordinary
coming-of-age story. Neither "The Mountain King" nor "...lost" has much of interest to say. By contrast,
"The Confession," about a man returning to religion late in his life, is extraordinarily sensitive and original,
marking Pfirman as a highly promising talent.
Bread and Roses (R)

Director: Ken Loach. With Pilar Padilla, Adrien Brody, Elpidia Carrilo, George Lopez, Alonso Chavez.(110 min.)
Page 89 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt *** Pitting his moral ideals against hard realities, a young American social worker helps two
Mexican immigrant sisters and their freinds with a strike they hope will improve their lives as
economically exploited office- building janitors. This socially alert drama is Loach's first production shot in
the United States and while it doesn't measure up to his best British movies, it continually strives to do
the ethically right thing.
Staff *** Inspiring, whimsical, impassioned. Bread and Tulips (PG-13)
Director: Silvio Soldini. With Licia Maglietta, Bruno Ganz, Giuseppe Battiston, Antonio Catania. (104 min.)

Sterritt *** A new life blossoms for a 40-year-old Italian housewife when she misses a bus, gets separated from her husband and children, and decides she'd rather explore the wonders of Venice - and the friendship of offbeat new acquaintances - than return to her old routine of worn-out domesticity. Maglietta gives a magical performance in this lightweight but flavorsome comedy. In Italian with English subtitles.
Bridget Jones's Diary (R)
Director: Sharon Maguire. With Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Jim Broadbent. (94 min.) Sterritt ** A romantic Englishwoman searches for a man who won't mind her slightly bulky figure and
slightly dissolute habits, and finds herself dallying with her cocky boss while dodging the company of a
lawyer who'd be a duller but more dignified partner. This lightweight comedy evidently sees itself as a
Jane Austen spinoff in the "Clueless" vein, and fans of the genre will enjoy it if they're not distracted by
trite plot twists, Firth's one-note formality, or Zellweger's on-and-off English accent.
Staff ***1/2 Exaggerated, v.g. (very good), very British.

Sex/Nudity: 3 sex scenes, no nudity. 3 instances of innuendo and several sexual references. Violence: 1 scene with a fistfight. Profanity: 35 including many harsh expressions. Drugs: 15 scenes of smoking and drinking.
Brigham City (PG)

Director: Richard Dutcher. With Richard Dutcher, Matthew A. Brown, Carrie Morgan, Wilford Brimley. (118 min.)

Sterritt ** A brutal crime is investigated by a Utah sheriff who's also a Mormon bishop. He wants to solve the case, but he cares as much about protecting the psychological serenity of his flock as ferreting out the evildoer, and there are signs that naivete may be blinding him to hard realities. Few movies have
sought this particular blend of detective-story melodrama and religious sensitivity, but the result would be more impressive if its ideas matched its sincerity, and if Dutcher had cast a more compelling actor than himself as the crime-solving clergyman.
Brother (R)
Director: Takeshi Kitano. With Beat Takeshi, Omar Epps, Claude Maki. (112 min.)
Sterritt ** On the run from murderous rivals, a Tokyo thug relocates to Los Angeles, takes over a
relative's drug racket, and strikes up a complex relationship with a new African-American crony. As usual,
Kitano's deadpan style serves him better as an actor than a director. Kitano stars in this melodrama
under the name Beat Takeshi, which he uses in his popular Japanese television shows - but his first
production made outside Japan has enough odd twists to be mildly interesting. Look out for a good deal
of stinging violence, though. In Japanese with English subtitles
The Brothers (R)
Director: Gary Hardwick. With Bill Bellamy, Morris Chestnut, D.L. Hughley, Shemar Moore. (103 min.) Staff ** Commitment suddenly becomes an issue in the lives of four 30-ish African-American buddies
when it dawns on them that they could be taking a more mature approach to relationships with women.
The results for them and their loved ones are dramatic and sometimes hilarious. Despite predictable
plotting, uneven acting and direction, and sexual banter more raunchy than necessary, positive values
shine through. By M.K. Terrell

Bubble Boy (PG-13)
Director: Blair Hayes. With Jake Gyllenhaal, Swoosie Kurtz, Marley Shelton, John Lynch. (84 min.) Staff * You've probably heard the controversy. Protesters say that "Bubble Boy," a tale of an immunity
deficient boy quarantined for life inside his home, makes fun of the disabled. They're wrong. The boy is
portrayed as a resourceful role-model. It's racial minorities who ought to be offended by their portrayal.
When the boy builds a hermetically sealed bubble so he can leave the home to find the girl of his
dreams, everyone he encounters on his road trip is a freak. The story would have been more interesting
if the main character had emerged into something approximating the real world. By Stephen Humphries

Sex/Nudity: 6 instances of innuendo. Violence: 10 scenes, including gory killing of a cow. Profanity: 29 occasionally harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with smoking, 2 scenes with drinking.
Bully (Not rated)
Director: Larry Clark. With Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner, Nick Stahl, Bijou Phillips, Michael Pitt, Kelli
Garner. (106 min.)

Sterritt *** Beset by verbal and physical abuse from a relentlessly aggressive friend, a group of teenagers decide to solve their problem by taking the bully out of town and killing him. Based on a real-life incident, this grim drama follows in the footsteps of Clark's notorious "Kids," combining information and titillation by showing a youthful cast enacting youth-culture behavior at its most destructive. The movie's somber message is worth heeding, and the acting is mostly excellent.
Captain Corelli's Mandolin (R)

Director: John Madden. With Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz, Christian Bale, Irene Papas, John Hurt. (125 min.)

Sterritt ** Cage plays a music-loving Italian officer who's garrisoned on a lovely Greek island during World War II, where he falls for a young woman (Cruz) who resists him at first, but eventually succumbs to his mischievous yet manly charm, dismaying the simple fisherman she's engaged to marry. While this romantic fantasy has a fair amount of shooting and killing, its heart is in the ill- starred love affair that dominates most of the plot. This would be  fine, if the romance were well enough written, directed, and acted to capture our hearts as well. But the only aspect that emerges a winner is the gorgeous Mediterranean scenery.
Staff ***1/2 Beautiful, miscast, heavy hearted, jerky, beautiful scenery.

Sex/Nudity:4 scenes of nudity, 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 8 gory war scenes. Profanity: 5 harsh expressions. Drugs: 9 scenes with alcohol, 3 with cigarettes.
Cats & Dogs (PG)
Director: Lawrence Guterman. With Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock, voices of Tobey
Maguire, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin. (87 min.)

Sterritt * Goldblum plays a scientist working on an anti-allergy medicine, but the real action centers on wicked cats who want to take over the world and resourceful dogs who want to save us all. The plot pants so hard to please all conceivable tastes - touching every base from "Babe: Pig in the City" and "101 Dalmatians" to "Chicken Run" and the "Austin Powers" pictures - that it makes less sense than the average pet-food commercial.
Staff **1/2 A casual joy, not quite purrfect, witty.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 16 scenes of cartoon-like violence. Profanity: 4 very mild. Drugs: None. The Caveman's Valentine (R)
Director: Kasi Lemmons. With Samuel L. Jackson, Aunjanue Ellis, Colm Feore, Ann Magnuson, Sean
MacMahon, Tamara Tunie, Anthony Michael Hall. (103 min.)
Sterritt ** Jackson gives a lively and generally credible performance as the unlikely hero: a homeless
man with a deranged mind, a talent for music, and enough clues to solve a murder if the world would just
pay attention to him. More psychological realism and less showy cinema would have made this offbeat
melodrama more memorable, though.
Center of the World (Not Rated)
Director: Wayne Wang. With Peter Sarsgaard, Molly Parker, Carla Gugino. (88 min.)

Staff * A young millionaire pays a stripper to accompany him to Las Vegas for the weekend in this grim and ultimately flat attempt to dissect the difference between money, sex, emotions, and what's really real. Director Wayne Wang relies on a self-consciously arty digital film style and brutally direct sex scenes - some of which border on pornographic - to make his film appear groundbreaking, but it ultimately leaves its audience as cold as its lifeless characters. By Amanda Paulson
Staff * Devoid of passion, pretentious, sophomoric script, hollow.

Sex/Nudity: 14 scenes, often exceptionally graphic. Violence: 1 instance of beating. Profanity: 48 harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with smoking; 8 scenes with alcohol.
Chunhyang (Not rated)
Director: Im Kwon Taek. With Lee Hyo Jung, Cho Seung Woo, Kim Sung Nyu. (120 min.)

Sterritt **** The mythic tale of a courtesan's daughter who falls in love with a ruler's son, then suffers a thousand torments when a selfish governor decides he wants her for himself. Told through an
imaginative blend of ravishing camera work and chanted "pansori" storytelling, this astoundingly beautiful
Korean production is poignant, original, and engrossing. In Korean with English subtitles
La Cienaga (Not rated)

Director: Lucrecia Martel. With Mercedes Moran, Martin Adjemian, Graciela Borges, Leonora Balcarce. (103 min.)

Sterritt ** The lives of two dysfunctional households in a small Argentine town during the hottest, stickiest summer anyone can remember. Martel shows great promise as a visual stylist and a director of strong performances, vividly etching her characters and condensing the experiences of three generations into a single economical story. But her screenplay gives little of interest, once the novelty of meeting these people has worn off. The title means "The Swamp," and you may feel you're in one after 103 minutes
with such a generally unlikable gang. In Spanish with English subtitles
The Circle (Not rated)
Director: Jafir Panahi. With Fereshteh Sadr Orafai, Maryiam Parvin Almani. (91 min.)
Sterritt **** A pregnant woman in despair, two women running from a prison sentence, and a
grandmother who dreads her family's reaction to the birth of a baby girl are among the main characters of
this suspenseful and ingeniously directed drama about problems of women in Iran today. Banned in its
own country, the film stands with the most compelling movies ever made about specifically female
challenges and tribulations. In Farsi with English subtitles
Staff *** Naturalistic, bare-bones acting, unsettling, not sentimental.
Sex/Nudity: 5 mild inferences. Violence: None. Profanity: 4 mild. Drugs: 1 instance of smoking.

The Claim (R)

Director: Michael Winterbottom. With Peter Mullan, Sarah Polley, Wes Bentley, Nastassja Kinski. (120 min.)

Sterritt ** An offbeat adaptation of Thomas Hardy's great novel, "The Mayor of Casterbridge," about a self-made man whose privileged existence masks two secrets: a sordid episode in his past, and an unstable personality that threatens to reemerge when his protege turns into a rival. It's not clear why Winterbottom has moved the story to California in 1869. In any case, his version seems more clever than heartfelt, and whether you enjoy it may depend on how much you like Robert Altman's eccentric western "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," which it uncannily resembles.
Staff **1/2 Atmospheric, epic, a snowed-in western.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes of implied sex and partial or full nudity. Violence: 9 scenes including a brawl, gunfights and a suicide. Profanity: 7 including many harsh expressions. Drugs: 9 scenes of smoking. 7 scenes of drinking.
The Closet (Not Rated)

Director: Francis Veber. With Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, Michel Aumont, Jean Rochefort. (84 min.)

Staff *** Brian Francois Pignon's life is falling apart. Not only has his wife left him, but he is about to lose his job in a condom factory. Desperate, he pretends he's gay to save his job. And thus begins his trajectory from superbly dull, utterly conventional bore to a man suddenly more interesting to his co- workers, his family, and himself. Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu star in this delightful farce, in the tradition of "La Cage Aux Folles," which, at its best, is laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly warm-hearted. In French with English subtitles. By Amanda Paulson
Code Unknown (Not rated)

Director: Michael Haneke. With Juliette Binoche, Alexandre Hamidi, Ona Lu Yenke, Luminita Gheorghiu, Thierry Neuvic. (117 min.)

Sterritt *** Two emigres and a Frenchman have a streetside scuffle in Paris, and this fragmented drama traces the far-reaching ramifications of what might have seemed a fleeting, if unfortunate, encounter. Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story, expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections. The overall effect is sometimes powerful, often puzzling, and generally less robust than single-minded Haneke films such as "The Seventh Continent" and the indelible "Funny Games." Originally titled "Code Inconnu." In French with English subtitles
crazy/beautiful (PG-13)
Director: John Stockwell. With Kirsten Dunst, Jay Hernandez, Bruce Davison. (95 min.)

Staff ** Here's an antidote to the Freddie Prinze Jr. teen films. This tale is about a love affair between a rebellious rich girl and a Hispanic boy who travels four hours a day to attend her school. The film avoids overplaying their cultural differences and there's a pleasing naturalistic feel throughout. Dunst also impresses with the energy and the nuances she brings to a suprisingly sexually explicit role. It's a pity there isn't enough of a compelling plot to capitalize on a promising premise. By Stephen Humphries
Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (PG)
Director: Simon Wincer. With Paul Hogan, Linda Kozlowski. (92 min.)

Staff * You'll sooner find snow on Ayers Rock than you will laughs in this third outing of the Crocodile Dundee series. The flimsiest plot device sends Dundee, his girlfriend, and child from the Australian outback to Los Angeles. Dundee then wanders about L.A. from one flat episode to another. Stay home and watch the real crocodile hunter, Steve Irwin, on the cable's "Animal Planet" instead. By Stephen Humphries
Cupid's Mistake (Not rated)

Director: Young Man Kang. With Susan Petry, Everardo Gil, Toya Cho, Ken Yasuda, Young Man Kang. (70 min.)


Page 93 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt * Los Angeles lovers pair off with one another on the rebound in this contemporary version of the old "La Ronde" idea. The acting is uneven and most of the romancing seems so mismatched that it's not surprising when things fall apart time after time. But there are appealing moments along the way, and the director gets impressive mileage with a budget that can only be called minuscule.
Cure (Not rated)

Director: Kiyoshi Kurosawa. With Koji Yakusho, Masato Hagiwara, Anna Nakagawa, Tsuyoshi Ujiki. (115 min.)

Sterritt *** A police officer tries to figure out the mystery behind a series of savage murders perpetrated by a widely varying group of people who have no memory of the crimes they've committed. The story dawdles and meanders, but Kurosawa's visual imagination keeps it cinematically stimulating. Be warned that, like some other Japanese productions of the late '90s and early '00s, it contains quite a few grisly and ghastly images. In Japanese with English subtitles
The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (PG-13)
Director: Woody Allen. With Woody Allen, Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Charlize Theron, David Ogden
Stiers, Brian Markinson, Elizabeth Berkley, Wallace Shawn. (93 min.)

Sterritt ** Allen falls back on fast-talking comedy and old-movie nostalgia in this parody of 1940s melodrama, with Woody as an insurance investigator trying to unravel a crime that he committed himself after a session with a sinister nightclub hypnotist. There are lots of plot twists and romantic angles. What's lacking is laughs.
Staff *** Superb period detail, Slow start but great finish, good fun.
Sex/Nudity: 11 instances of innuendo. Violence: 1 comic scene. Profanity: 13 mild expressions. Drugs:
10 scenes with alcohol, 21 with cigarettes.
The Day I Became a Woman (Not rated)
Director: Marziyeh Meshkini. With Fatemeh Cheragh, Shabnam Toloui, Azizeh Seddighi. (75 min.) Sterritt **** This exquisitely filmed Iranian drama tells three separate stories focusing on women's lives.
One heroine is a nine- year-old girl deciding how to spend the last remaining hour before she officially
becomes a woman by the standards of her culture; another is a wife who decides to assert her
independence despite opposition from her husband, and the third is an elderly woman trying for a
different kind of independence by making whimsical use of money that's fallen into her hands. Every
episode is charged with humanity and compassion. In Farsi with English subtitles
The Deep End (R)
Directors: Scott McGehee, David Siegel. With Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan Tucker, Peter
Donat. (99 min.)

Sterritt ** Trying to protect her teenage son from the sinister influence of an ill-chosen older friend, a woman finds herself covering up a death and negotiating with a tenacious blackmailer. Swinton has some affecting moments as the mom, but the rest of the acting is second-rate, and the directors (previously known for "Suture," which also promised more than it delivered) give it little originality or oomph. The same story was told vastly better in the 1949 melodrama "The Reckless Moment," directed by the Max Ophuls and starring James Mason in one of his most indelible roles.
The Devil's Backbone (R)

Director: Guillermo del Toro. With Eduardo Noriega, Marisa Paredes, Federico Luppi, Inigo Garces. (106 min.)

Sterritt *** Sent to a boarding school for orphans during the Spanish Civil War, a homeless boy deals with intrigues among students and teachers, and confronts two dark mysteries: Is there lurking danger in an undetonated bomb standing like a grim statue just outside the school's doors, and is there more menace in the ghost of a murdered pupil who haunts its rooms and corridors? This moody ghost story follows generally familiar lines despite its unusual historical setting, but it's imaginatively filmed and builds a
sense of brooding emotional power.
Diamond Men (Not rated)


Page 94 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Daniel M. Cohen. With Robert Forster, Donnie Wahlberg, Bess Armstrong, Jasmine Guy. (100 min.)

Sterritt ** An aging diamond dealer (Forster) goes on the road with a protege (Wahlberg), who insists on behaving like the hero of a sleazy traveling- salesman joke. This modest comedy-drama begins as a mildly engaging tale of two conflicting but basically decent personalities, then loses its way in a crime- movie subplot and a less-than-believable love affair. Forster is always a pleasure to watch, though.
The Dish (PG-13)

Director: Rob Sitch. With Sam Neill, Tom Long, Kevin Harrington, Patrick Warburton, Genevieve Mooy. (104 min.)
Sterritt ***

Fact-based comedy about the triumphs and tribulations of the men who ran the enormous Australian broadcast receiver that transmitted live pictures around the world when American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon. The acting and screenplay are amusing, but director Sitch might have taken a more adventurous approach to a tale with such an adventurous subject.
Divided We Fall (PG)
Director: Jan Hrebejk. With Bolek Polivka, Csongor Kassai, Jaroslav Duslek, Anna Siskova. (123 min.) Staff ** "You wouldn't believe what abnormal times can do to normal people," says one character in this
film. Well maybe you can. There's no time for heroes in this small Czech town torn apart by Nazi
occupation. This is a typical tale of an unexceptional couple, risking their lives for the Jew hiding out in
the basement, while they desperately try to hold onto a sense of normalcy in unusually troubled times.
With a tasteless combination of horror and humor, "Divided We Fall" is a semi-successful, but unoriginal,
portrayal of the strength of human character. By Deborah Henderson
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 8 scenes, extremely violent. Profanity: 11 expressions. Drugs: None. Djomeh (Not rated)
Director: Hassan Yektapanah. With Rashid Akbari, Valiollah Beta, Mahbobeh Khalili. (94 min.)

Sterritt **** The title character is an Afghani immigrant who works at a small Iranian dairy farm, where he shares his memories and hopes with his sympathetic boss. Their relationship grows more complicated when Djomeh falls in love with an Iranian woman and needs help winning her affection - no easy matter, given the strictness of Iranian courtship customs and the fact that he doesn't fit the local profile for a desirable catch. The performances of this quiet Iranian drama are utterly genuine, and the story is a delicate blend of slice- of-life realism and soft-spoken social commentary. In short, it's as smart and entertaining as they come. In Farsi with English subtitles
Don't Say a Word (R)
Director: Gary Fleder. With Michael Douglas, Brittany Murphy, Sean Bean, Famke Janssen. (110 min.) Sterritt ** Douglas plays a New York psychiatrist treating a troubled teenager who's been faking most of
her afflictions for years; then his daughter gets kidnapped by a twisted criminal who's after a crucial
number buried in the teen's memory. The movie has promise as a psychological thriller, but the
filmmakers show far more interest in chases and shoot-outs than characters and ideas.
Double Take (PG-13)
Director: George Gallo. With Orlando Jones, Eddie Griffin, Gary Grubbs, Daniel Roebuck. (88 min.)

Staff **1/2 Hardly anything is what it seems in this Hitchcock spoof (call it "South by Southwest"). A New York banker (Jones) wrongly suspected of murder, trades identities with a crazy con artist from the streets (Griffin) and flees the city for Mexico, pursued by drug dealers, police, FBI, and a little dog with sharp teeth. Not a good picture, but the two leads often rise above the convoluted plot, sloppy continuity, ethnic stereotyping, and excessive violence to provide some genuinely funny moments. By M.K. Terrell
Down to Earth (PG-13)

Directors: Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz. With Chris Rock, Chazz Palminteri, Greg  Germann, Regina King. (95 min.)

Page 95 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff ** Lance (Rock), a bike messenger and aspiring comedian, is hit and killed by a truck when on his route while ogling a beautiful woman at the cross- walk. When the angels in heaven discover that it wasn't "his time" yet, they offer him a temporary body (that of an old, wealthy white man), until they can find a more appropriate one for him. With this "second chance," good-hearted Lance takes advantage of the opportunities this new body allows him, also proving that it's not what someone looks like, it's who they are that is important. There is a good moral message to this movie, but it's too crude for younger viewers and Rock's comedy is a little on the weak side. By Heidi Wilson

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes with innuendo. Violence: 8 instances, including a suicide and attempted murder. Profanity: 75 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 7 scenes with alcohol, 1 scene with smoking.
Downtown 81 (Not rated)
Director: Edo Bertoglio. With Jean Michel Basquiat, Deborah Harry, Walter Steding. (77 min.)

Sterritt ** A young artist looks for money, security, and affection during a long day when he almost gets evicted from his New York apartment. This scruffy, streetwise drama was shot in the early 1980s, but wasn't released for 20 years because of financial and technical problems. Its main value is the prolonged look it gives of the late artist Basquiat, who was 19 when he played the leading role, and looks uncannily like the actor Jeffrey Wright, who played him in the later bio-pic "Basquiat."
Dr. Dolittle 2 (PG)

Director: Steve Carr. With Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wilson, and voices of Steve Zahn, Lisa Kudrow. (90 min.)

Staff *1/2 The writers must have thought, "Hey, if we can feature a mafia-type raccoon, a drinking monkey, and a Latino chameleon that can talk, this movie will write itself!" They were so wrong. Murphy reprises his 1998 role as Dr. Dolittle who must help save a forest from money-hungry loggers. It delivers a few laughs with contemporary phrases such as "whaazzzuuuup," "Hasta la vista, baby," and "Hello, Clarice," but that's about it. The writers rely on crude humor for cheap laughs. By Lisa Leigh Parney
Staff *** Family fun, rapid-fire humor, upbeat.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: 10 mild expressions. Drugs: 2 with alcohol. Driven (PG-13)
Director: Renny Harlin. With Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds, Estelle Warren, Gina Gershon. (120 min.)

Sterritt **1/2 Actor, writer, and producer Sylvester Stallone and director Renny Harlin hope to re-create the success they had with "Cliffhanger" in this well-done, but flat, action-drama. The story of this
racing-car tale is pure formula: A young rookie beats all odds to come out on top, and finds out what he's made of. But it's the racing scenes that take center stage, and the crashes are among the most realistic ever put on film. By Alex Kaloostian
Staff DUD Predictable, insipid, hokey, overwrought, belongs on the scrap heap.

Sex/Nudity: 4 instances of innuendo and numerous shots of scantily clad women. Violence: 7 scenes of video game-like car crashes, no gore. Profanity: 11 mild expressions. Drugs: 3 scenes with alcohol.
Enemy at the Gates (R)

Director: Jean-Jacques Annaud. With Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law, Eva Mattes, Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins. (133 min.)

Sterritt * Rivalry flares between a Soviet sniper and his Nazi counterpart as they hone their skills, stalk their prey, and ultimately turn their sights on each other during World War II's cataclysmic Battle of Stalingrad. Annaud seems more interested in epic visual sweep than deep-rooted human emotion, though, and interesting troupers like Harris and Law just go through the motions. Add a megadose of bombastic James Horner music and a perfunctory love- affair subplot and you have a movie that's its own worst enemy.
Staff ** Shallow, authentic-feeling, suspenseful.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scenes with partial nudity. Violence: 15 instances, including gory war scenes. Profanity: 6 mild expressions. Drugs: 11 scenes with smoking. 4 scenes with alcohol.
Eureka (Not rated)

Page 96 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Shinji Aoyama. With Yakusho Koji, Miyazaki Aoi, Miyazaki Masaru, Saitoh Yohichiroh. (217 min.)

Sterritt **** After surviving a violent crime, two youngsters set off on a meandering odyssey through the Japanese countryside with an eccentric bus driver they've befriended, only to discover that ongoing eruptions of violence are traveling in their wake. Filmed in a style at once intimate and expansive, with understated acting and brilliant use of wide-screen black-and-white cinematography, Aoyama's celebrated movie is an ambitious psychological drama and a probing look at the intersections of kinship and friendship. In Japanese with English subtitles
Everybody's Famous (R)

Director: Dominique Deruddere. With Josse de Pauw, Werner De Scmedt, Victor Low, Thekla Reuten. (97 min.)

Staff *** Suddenly out of work when a factory closes down, a Belgian bottle inspector hatches a plan to launch his career as a songwriter and make his unprepossessing daughter a singing star. His scheme is to hold the country's top singer hostage until her manager gives him the backing he needs. This perfectly cast dig at fame and the entertainment industry, filled with misfits, look-alikes and wannabes, takes its potshots gently, with subtle delights and surprises at every fun. In Flemish with English subtitles. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes of implied sex, with nudity; 2 instances of innuendo. Violence: 2 mild scenes. Profanity: 15 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with smoking, 4 scenes with drinking, 1 scene with pilltaking.
Everything Moves Alone (Not rated)
Director: Mike Aransky. With Philip Guerette, Thomas Edward Seymour, Mike Aransky. (100 min.) Sterritt * A young man moves to a small town, makes a couple of unlikely friends, and finds himself
involved in a bizarre quarrel between his new acquaintances. This comedy-drama means well, but it'll be
a long time before you see more self-indulgent screenwriting and unpersuasive acting in a single movie.
Evolution (PG-13)

Director: Ivan Reitman. With David Duchovny, Julianne Moore, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott. (105 min.)

Sterritt *** Two scholars from a community college discover a microscopic horde of newly arrived aliens. They have to stop the menace once the cute little critters become ugly big critters. At its best, this unevenly paced comedy is an amusing parody of monster movies.
Staff ** "Ghostbusters" redux, dumb, good video rental.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo, 1 with partial male nudity. Violence: 7 scary scenes, but not too gory. Profanity: 40 mostly mild expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with smoking, 2 with drinking.
Exit Wounds (R)
Director: Andrzej Bartkowiak. With Steven Seagal, DMX, Anthony Anderson, Jill Hennessey. (117 min.) Staff **
Pandemonium reigns in Seagal movies. Here he's a Detroit detective who saves the US vice president from a kidnapping plot. His extreme tactics don't amuse the department's top brass, however, and they reduce him to daytime traffic details and nighttime rage-management classes. But when he sniffs out a drug ring on his beat, he's right back to his old tricks. Plot twists (when plot intrudes on anarchy) and unusual casting (rapper DMX's compassionate drug dealer) keep this one from being a total cliche. Occasional flashes of humor offer respite from the havoc. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo; 2 scenes with nudity. Violence: 12 scenes. Profanity: 136 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 5 instances of drinking; 1 scene with smoking; 4 scenes with drug deals.
Faat Kine (Not rated)

Director: Ousmane Sembene. With Venus Seye, Mame Ndumbe Diop, Ndiagne Dia, Mariame Balde. (118 min.)


Page 97 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt **** This gently told Senegalese comedy-drama centers on an ordinary woman who works in a service station and devotes her spare time to her college- age children and aging mother. The story touches on an enormously wide range of subjects - some personal, like the challenges of marriage in a society where men often have multiple wives, and others cultural or political, like the influence of Islamic traditions and the social uncertainties of a postcolonial African country. Sembene has opened up a whole new world of African cinema during his illustrious career, and this intelligent yet easy- going masterpiece ranks close to his best work. In French and Wolof with English subtitles
Faithless (R)

Director: Liv Ullmann. With Erland Josephson, Lena Endre, Krister Henriksson, Thomas Hanzon, Michelle Gylemo, Johan Rabaeus, Stina Ekblad, Juni Dahr, Philip Zanden, Marie Richardson. (155 min.)

Sterritt *** An intense, claustrophobic drama of love and infidelity, as seen through the eyes of an actress whose seemingly contented life as a wife and mother is tragically tested by romantic temptations touched off by her husband's closest friend. The film's tone is so intimate that one of the characters is
screenwriter Ingmar Bergman himself, who sets the story in motion by having a conversation with the female protagonist he's conceived in his imagination. On one level, "Faithless" is a probing look at love, marriage, loyalty, and other emotional issues. On other levels, it's about the complex relationships between bedrock human feelings and the process of exploring these through art.
Fallen Angels Paradise (Not rated)
Director: Ossama Fawzi. With Mahmoud Hemida, Lebleba, Caroline Khalil, Safwa. (79 min.)

Sterritt ** The death of a low-life drug dealer sets his accomplices scheming to profit from his demise, but then his family gets into the act, sparking unexpected revelations about his surprisingly respectable early life. It's rare for an Egyptian movie to look so closely and unflinchingly at class conflict and other forms of social disarray, but lively acting keeps the story engaging even when it wanders and meanders. In Arabic with English subtitles
The Family Man (PG-13)
Director: Brett Ratner. With Nicholas Cage, Tea Leoni, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven. (125 min.)

Staff *** This film, about a high executive businessman (Cage) given the opportunity to catch a glimpse of what his life would be like had he married his college sweetheart (Leoni), is pure Christmas. Not one offbeat word, glance, or gesture falls from their charming performances. They remain two snowflakes among holiday performances, which can oftentimes be more Scrooge than Kringle. By Christy Ellington
Staff **1/2 Slow, nice message, mushy. Fast and the Furious (PG-13)
Director: Rob Cohen. With Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordanna Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez. (140 min.)

Staff **1/2 Faster than "Gone in 60 Seconds," flashier than "Driven," and more supercharged race cars and actual driving than both put together. What has to go? Well, plot and characterization, but you'll be too busy tapping your feet and gripping your seat to notice. Here's the deal: Brian, a not-so-hot rookie detective goes undercover to get to the bottom of a rash of truck hijackings. But will Brian learn how to double-pump the clutch before he blows out another set of piston rings? And did I mention there are lots of neat car chases? By Alex Kaloostian

Sex/Nudity: 3 instances of innuendo. Violence: 11 scenes, including fighting. Profanity: 58 harsh expressions. Drugs: 3 scenes with smoking, 3 scenes with drinking.
Fat Girl (Not rated)
Director: Catherine Breillat. With Anais Reboux, Roxane Mesquida, Libero de Rienzo. (93 min.) Sterritt *** During a family vacation, an attractive 15-year-old falls in love with a seductive older man,
sparking complicated feelings in her younger sister, an overweight girl whose ability to cope with sibling
rivalry may eventually reach its limits. Breillat has probed issues of youthful sexuality before, most
notably in her excellent "36 Fillette," and she's an expert at coaxing strong performances from actors with
little experience. This disturbing drama has many telling moments, but it ends with an out-of-the-blue
shock episode that raises more questions than it answers about the story's overall psychological
perspective. Originally titled "A Ma soeur!" In French with English subtitles
Fellini Satyricon (Not rated)
Page 98 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Federico Fellini. With Martin Potter, Hiram Keller, Max Born. (129 min.)

Sterritt **** One of Italy's greatest filmmakers dreamed up this flamboyantly uninhibited visit to ancient Rome, and the results of his whimsy have been startling, shocking, and engrossing moviegoers ever since its 1969 release. See it if your most outrageous dream is to see your most outrageous dreams made visible on the wide screen. Stay far away if that prospect seems too daring or daunting for comfort.
Fever (Not rated)
Director: Alex Winter. With Henry Thomas, David O'Hara, Bill Duke, Teri Hatcher, John Tracy. (93 min.) Sterritt ** A murder in a rundown apartment building sparks a series of strange events in the life of a
psychologically unsteady man. This offbeat drama has more atmosphere than logic, but a few sequences
are strikingly well acted and filmed.
15 Minutes (R)
Director: John Herzfeld. With Robert De Niro, Edward Burns, Kelsey Grammer, Karel Roden, Oleg
Taktarov, Avery Brooks. (120 min.)

Sterritt ** A homicide cop and an arson investigator get into a New York tussle with two thugs from Eastern  Europe who think their violent schemes will bring fame and fortune as long as the media play into their hands. The premise is promising, but Herzfeld cares more about sensationalism than substance, and portions of the picture are far nastier than they had to be.
Staff ** Uneven tone, well edited, silly.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex with nudity. Violence: 17 often gruesome scenes. Profanity: 90 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 10 instances of alcohol; 14 scenes with smoking.
Final Fantasy (PG-13)
Director: Hironobu Sakaguchi. With the voices of Alec Baldwin, Ming Na, James Woods, Donald
Sutherland, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames. (106 min.)

Sterritt ** It's the distant future (yet again) and Earth has been decimated by aliens. The military wants to blast them into oblivion, but the brainy and beautiful Dr. Aki Ross thinks she can solve things with a more high-minded approach. The movie is noteworthy because it's the first major Hollywood release to feature an entire cast of human characters generated completely through computer animation. While this is a striking technical feat, it poses an artistic problem. On one hand, the movie abandons the anything-goes imaginativeness of animation by slavishly imitating real-life human traits. On the other, it abandons the expressive power of genuine human performances by artificially creating all its images. Skeptics may feel that in its own small way, this sort of cinema is as dehumanizing as the aliens who serve as its intergalactic bad guys.
Staff ** Creative, pantheistic, Digitally sophisticated, intense.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 14 instances, quite intense. Profanity: 18 harsh expressions. Drugs: 1 instance of drinking.
Finding Forrester (PG-13)
Director: Gus Van Sant. With Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham. (136 min.) Sterritt ** Unlikely friendship develops between a gifted black high school student and a curmudgeonly
old author who won a youthful Pulitzer Prize and then slipped into sullen seclusion. The premise is more
interesting than the movie, which takes several wrong turns on its way to an unconvincing conclusion.
Brown gives a smartly understated performance, though, and Paquin's talent continues to blossom.
Staff *** Gentle, predictable, inspiring.

Sex/Nudity: 5 incidences of innuendo. Violence: 2 scenes with youths tussling. Profanity: 54 expressions, both mild and harsh. Drugs: 8 scenes with drinking, 3 scenes with smoking.
The Fluffer (Not rated)
Directors: Richard Glatzer, Wash West. With Michael Cunio, Roxanne Day, Scott Gurney. (96 min.)

Sterritt ** A young man goes to work in the porn-movie business and gets more involved with his favorite star than he expected or intended. This satirical drama tries to be an updated "Boogie Nights," but it
would have more heft if the filmmakers had been supplied with talented stars, original ideas, and a barely adequate budget. A wry peek at the porn industry is all it has to offer.
Focus (PG-13)
Director: Neal Slavin. With William H. Macy, Laura Dern, David Paymer, Meat Loaf Aday. (100 min.) Sterritt *** Macy plays a 1940s businessman who doesn't worry much about anti- Semitism until some
people get the idea that he looks sort of Jewish himself, sparking events that cause him to lose his job.
Neighbors are also angry at a local Jewish shopkeeper, and he's tempted to regain their trust by joining
in their attacks. Slavin treats the tale as a philosophical fable about the never- ending struggle between
good and evil. The result would be an important drama if the screenplay (based on an early Arthur Miller
novel) didn't lapse into preachiness and imprecision at times.
Freaks, Glam Gods and Rockstars (Not rated)
Director: John T. Ryan. With Jackie Beat, Justin Bond, Michael Musto, Jayne County. (74 min.)

Sterritt * A survey and celebration of New York City's underground rock scene, interviewing small-time celebrities and providing brief glimpses of their often outrageous acts. Traditional music fans won't find much to enjoy here, but the movie has value as an anthropological visit to a strange and thriving milieu.
From Hell (R)

Directors: The Hughes Brothers. With Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane. (137 min.)

Sterritt *** Depp plays a 19th-century police inspector whose hunt for Jack the Ripper smokes out an enormous number of complications. The movie works well as a straight-out horror yarn, proving that the Hughes Brothers are more versatile than their previous "ghetto pictures" suggest. But it lacks the
near-cosmic resonance of the book it's based on, a "graphic novel" by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell that makes far more interesting speculations on mysteries of myth and history, space and time, good and evil, life and death.
Staff *** Amazing ambience, gritty, gory.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes including sex and nudity. Violence: 26 highly gory scenes. Profanity: 24 harsh expressions. Drugs: 15 scenes with alcohol, 7 scenes with cigarettes, 5 scenes with drugs.
Get Over It (PG-13)

Director: Tommy O'Haver. With Kirsten Dunst, Ed Begley Jr., Sisqo, Martin Short, Swoosie Kurtz. (90 min.)
Staff *1/2 Berke tries out for the school play, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," hoping to win his
ex-girlfriend back from her new boyfriend/costar. His best friend's little sister (Dunst), also in the play,
helps him with his acting, but secretly loves him too. Thus their on-stage roles oddly mirror their off- stage
lives. Short's over the top drama teacher, Sisqo's stagehand dancing, and Begley and Kurtz as ultra-'70's
parents lend their support, but this grab bag of dreams, fantasies, and musical numbers, though amusing
at times, never really falls together. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes of innuendo. Violence: 8 scenes, including car accident. Profanity: 46 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 4 instances of drinking; 1 scene with marijuana.
Ghost World (R)
Director: Terry Zwigoff. With Thora Birch, Steve Buscemi, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Renfro. (111 min.) Sterritt *** Reluctant to enter the ordinary adult world, which they find shallow and tedious, two girls just
out of high school strike up a smirky relationship with an older man who has antisocial tendencies of his
own, leading to various emotional complications. Zwigoff's first fiction film recalls his 1994 documentary
"Crumb" in the sympathy it shows for marginalia of American life that most people overlook and
undervalue. While this isn't a showy or flashy movie, it has social, psychological, and ultimately mystical
overtones that raise it leagues above most other teen-centered comedies.
Staff **1/2 Realistic coming-of-age tale, engagingly cast, intelligent humor.

Page 100 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex, 4 scenes of innuendo. Violence: 2 scenes. Profanity: 89 harsh expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with drinking.
Ghosts of Mars (R)

Director: John Carpenter. With Ice Cube, Natasha Henstridge, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Clea Duvall, Joanna Cassidy. (98 min.)

Sterritt * Earthlings living in a Martian colony battle hostile forces who resent this alien invasion of their desolate red planet. Carpenter pulls out all the action-adventure stops, but he and coscripter Larry Sulkis forgot to write dialogue the audience could listen to without howling in disbelief. Henstridge is fun to
watch as the Martian cop, though, and Ice Cube still has a powerful screen presence, even when he isn't bothering to act.

Sex/Nudity: 4 instances of nudity. Violence: 24 gory scenes. Profanity: 65 harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with cigarettes, 4 scenes with drugs.
Ginger Snaps (Not rated)
Director: John Fawcett. With Emily Perkins, Katharine Isabelle, Mimi Rogers, Kris Lemche. (108 min.) Sterritt *** Ginger and Brigitte are sisters who pride themselves on being different, so when other teens
head for the dating and party scenes, they sit around the house thinking up gory ways to die. Then a
mysterious creature invades their neighborhood, biting Ginger and turning her into a budding werewolf.
(Hence the title.) This sardonic thriller blends teen-pic satire with  finely tuned fright and a dark- toned
view of teenage sexuality. If you can take its explicit violence, it's a monsterfest that rarely loses it bite.
The Glass House (PG-13)

Director: Daniel Sackheim. With Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard, Trevor Morgan. (111 min.)

Staff * When Ruby and Rhett Baker's parents die in a mysterious car accident, they are taken under the legal guardianship of Erin and Terry Glass, who happen to live in a home constructed of glass. It isn't long before Ruby - played by the ever-sullen Leelee Sobieski - begins to realize that there's something creepy about their adoptive parents. This is one of those thrillers where lightning flashes ominously in a
dark house; where the girl drops the car keys just as the killer is approaching the vehicle; where there's a false ending because the killer has to be killed twice. 'The Glass House' is too transparent to be effective. By Stephen Humphries
The Gleaners and I (Not rated)
Director: Agnes Varda. With Agnes Varda. (82 min.)

Sterritt **** A fascinating nonfiction voyage into rural and urban France, focusing on idiosyncratic individuals who live off things the rest of us throw away, from food to furniture. Varda carries this concept a step further by recognizing that she herself has been a gleaner during her long filmmaking career, capturing images and situations that usually go unnoticed by people living busy lives. Originally called "Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse." In French with English subtitles
The Golden Bowl (R)

Director: James Ivory. With Nick Nolte, Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Northam, Uma Thurman, James Fox, Anjelica Huston. (130 min.)

Sterritt *** Henry James's psychologically dense novel inspired this introspective drama about an American businessman and his daughter, who discover that their new spouses share a hidden past. Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and produced by Ismail Merchant, the film will be too staid and stolid for audiences on the hunt for easy entertainment. Ivory gives it a sumptuous visual style and an exquisitely crafted early-20th-century milieu, though, offering  fine pleasures for the eye and the imagination.
Staff ***
Elegantly opulent, self-consciously arty, more surface than subtlety.

Sex/Nudity: 1 sex scene, no nudity. Violence: None. Profanity: 2 mild. Drugs: 9 instances of smoking, 6 instances of drinking.

The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick (Not rated)

Director: Mark Steensland. With Robert Anton Wilson, Paul Williams, Miriam Lloyd, Ray Nelson. (80 min.)
Sterritt ***

Admirers of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and other Dick literature will enjoy this nonfiction look at the writer, his career, and his eccentricities, some of which were as bizarre as his fiction. Don't expect much depth in this brief portrait, though.
Greenfingers (R)
Director: Joel Hershman. With Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, David Kelly. (91 min.)

Staff *** Good conduct gets a British felon (Owen) into an experimental "open" prison, where he discovers a flair for gardening. When a horticultural maven (Mirren) sees what he and his buddies have wrought, she soon has them in a national competition. The pro- rehabilitation message may be a bit obvious and the story a little pat (wouldn't you know, the botanical guru has a pretty daughter?), but the characters are charming. By M.K. Terrell
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (PG)

Director: Chris Columbus. With Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith. (150 min.)

Sterritt *** This richly produced fantasy stays true to the letter and spirit of J.K. Rowling's lively novel about an 11-year-old boy who discovers he's a natural-born wizard, enrolls in a school to learn magic and enchantment, and finds himself battling the sinister sorcerer who killed his parents when he was a
baby. Columbus fills the screen with colorful images that make a world of spells seem as solid as the one we travel every day. What you won't find are qualities a truly great movie adaptation might have offered - new layers of meaning, perspectives on the story that only film images could provide, and fresh insights into the tale's moral and ethical questions.
Staff **1/2 Stirs childhood memories, a bit ordinary, enchanting, top-notch effects.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 8 scenes, quite intense for small children. Profanity: 1 mild expression. Drugs: 1 scene with alcohol.
Hannibal (R)

Director: Ridley Scott. With Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, Frankie R. Faison, Francesca Neri. (131 min.)

Sterritt *** Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector, the brilliant psychiatrist with a sadistic personality, a weakness for cannibalism, and an odd affection for FBI agent Clarice Starling, this time played by Moore in a performance as inventive as Jodie Foster's in "The Silence of the Lambs" a decade earlier. Scott has directed the picture with his usual heavy touch - even the boisterous "Lambs" seems subtle by comparison - and much of the action is as ponderous as it is predictable. Lector fans will get their fill, but be warned that the menu contains at least two scenes with over-the-top excesses that Hannibal himself might not want to swallow.
Staff **1/2 Extremely gory, good sequel, intelligent dialogue, opulent sets.

Sex/Nudity: 15 scenes with innuendo. Violence: 15 exceptionally violent scenes including cannibalism. Profanity: 5 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 9 scenes with smoking; 8 scenes with alcohol.
Happenstance (Not rated)
Director: Laurent Firode. With Audrey Tautou, Faudel, Eric Feldman, Irene Ismailoff, Eric Savin. (96 min.) Sterritt ** A department-store clerk, an elderly woman, and a sidewalk philosopher are among the diverse
characters of this French fantasy-romance about lives that intersect by chance, in keeping with the notion
that a hurricane in the Pacific might be caused by a butterfly beating its wings on the Atlantic days
before. The movie has magical moments, but it's too contrived to gather much comic or dramatic power.
Originally titled "Le battement d'aile du papillon." In French with English subtitles
Hardball (PG-13)


Page 102 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Brian Robbins. With Keanu Reeves, Diane Lane, John Hawk, D.B. Sweeney. (90 min.)

Staff **1/2 His life threatened by bookies, Connor O'Neill (Reeves) agrees in desperation to coach Little League. In a world where "don't nobody's father come back," O'Neill earns the boys' trust by showing up. Initially, O'Neill's only reason for coaching is to collect his weekly check. But the harsh realities of life in the projects won't let him, or the viewer, remain callous for long. Meanwhile, the young cast of "Hardball" pitches laughs and tears, making sure both you and O'Neill think twice about how to live. By Nathan Smith
Head Over Heels (PG-13)
Director: Mark Waters. With Monica Potter, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brendan Beiser, Sarah O'Hare, China
Chow. (127 min.)

Staff DUD An art-restoration expert (Potter), moves into an apartment with "the last four models in New York who don't smoke." She soon develops a crush on Jim (Prinze) who lives in an adjacent building across the way, until, in a "Rear Window"-ish twist, she thinks she sees him commit a murder. This romantic comedy is so awfully misjudged and ineptly executed in every department that, while it isn't
quite a contender for the "so bad it's good" category, this critic was nonetheless dabbing tears of laughter from his eyes. By Stephen Humphries

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of implied sex; 5 incidences of innuendo. Violence: 6 scenes, including fistfights. Profanity: 15 harsh expressions, 14 mild expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with alcohol.
Heartbreakers (R)
Director: David Mirkin. With Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Ray Liotta, Jason
Lee, Anne Bancroft. (124 min.)

Staff ** A mother (Weaver) and daughter (Hewitt) use their looks and low-cut dresses to scam their way through life. The senior partner marries millionaires and then, before the marriage can be consummated, gets the daughter to tempt the groom to ensure a speedy divorce with a big payoff. The cast is better
than the material, especially Gene Hackman as a chain-smoking tobacco company executive in constant self-denial about the dangers of cigarettes. At over two hours long, you may be left feeling a little bit conned by the end. By Stephen Humphries
Staff ** Predictable, not funny, unoriginal, vapid

Sex/Nudity: 11 scenes of mostly innuendo and frank talk. Violence: 11 scenes of slapstick violence. Profanity: 53 expressions, some harsh. Drugs: 6 instances of drinking; 25 scenes with smoking.
Hearts in Atlantis (PG-13)

Director: Scott Hicks. With Anthony Hopkins, Hope Davis, Anton Yelchin, Mika Boorem, David Morse. (98 min.)

Sterritt *** A mysterious stranger (Hopkins) rents a room above the home of an 11-year-old boy and his self-absorbed mother, then asks the child to keep an eye out for menacing enemies who want to capture him. The movie takes on a lot of material, from the boy's problems with bullies and romance to the stranger's clairvoyant powers. Hicks doesn't always keep the story clear and compelling, but Hopkins is
in top form.

Sex/Nudity: 3 instances of innuendo, including implied rape. Violence: 6 scenes including beatings. Profanity: 13 expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with smoking, 2 scenes with drinking.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch (R)
Director: John Cameron Mitchell. With John Cameron Mitchell, Miriam Shor, Stephen Trask. (94 min.) Sterritt *** The hero was named Hansel during his East Berlin childhood. But after changing his sex and
moving to the United States, he's become Hedwig the transgendered rock singer, playing in small-time
restaurants and dreaming of revenge against Tommy Gnosis, a protege who stole his songs. Cameron's
imaginative directing and screen-shaking performance give this rock musical plenty of oomph, although
some may find it a coolly calculated effort at instant cult- film fame.
Heist (R)
Director: David Mamet. With Gene Hackman, Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo, Patti LuPone, Danny
DeVito, Ricky Jay. (107 min.)
Page 103 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt *** An aging thief (Hackman) assembles his accomplices (Lindo, Jay) and wife (Pidgeon) for an unusually ambitious crime. Complicating the job is the cantankerous crook they work for (DeVito) and the sleazy young thug (Rockwell) he forces them to team up with. At once a purebred caper movie and a loving tribute to that popular genre, the picture has plenty of tried-and-true elements, from its "one last
job" scenario to the untried youngster who messes up the scam. It's fun watching the master criminal turn his worst mistakes into crafty comebacks, just as Mamet turns the most familiar ingredients into unpredictable jolts and reverse-twist surprises.
Staff **1/2 Inscrutable, crisply directed, tired plot.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 2 scenes. Profanity: 92 harsh expressions. Drugs: 15 scenes with cigarettes, 3 scenes with alcohol.
Hidden Wars of Desert Storm (Not rated)

Directors: Gerard Ungerman, Audrey Brohy. With John Hurt, Ramsey Clark, Norman Schwarzkopf. (64 min.)

Sterritt *** An informative look at the Persian Gulf conflict, with emphasis on its cost in human lives and suffering, its roots in prior American involvement with the Middle East, the effect of subsequent economic sanctions on Iraqi citizens, and the possibility that the enigmatic Persian Gulf syndrome might be linked
to munitions made of depleted uranium. Made by two investigative journalists, this concise documentary is worth viewing by anyone concerned about world events.
Ice From the Sun (Not rated)
Director: Eric Stanze. With DJ Vivona, Ramona Midgett, Angela Zimmerly, Todd Tevlin. (117 min.) Sterritt ** A young woman is recruited to battle a mysterious presence that threatens humanity with
violence and malevolence. Imaginatively filmed on what was obviously a shoestring budget, this
underground shocker has moments of real visual creativity, along with a surprisingly talky screenplay and
a general disregard for anything resembling old-fashioned good taste.
If... (Not rated)
Director: Lindsay Anderson. With Malcolm McDowell, Richard Warwick, Christine Noonan. (111 min.) Sterritt**** Revolution strikes a repressive school for boys in this 1968 classic, which both embodies and
critiques the rebellious atmosphere of the '60s era. At once comic, surrealistic, and outrageous, the
movie marks a high point in Anderson's filmmaking career.
In the Mood for Love (PG)
Director: Wong Kar-wai. With Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung-Chiu-wai, Rebecca Pan, Lai Chin, Siu
Ping-lam, Chin Tsi-ang. (97 min.)

Sterritt *** A journalist and a receptionist spend inordinate amounts of time in their lonely apartments, maintaining a polite distance between themselves until the man begins to suspect their spouses are having an affair with each other. The story gains most of its dramatic impact from superbly understated acting and Christopher Doyle's atmospheric camera work. Kudos also go to Nat King Cole's haunting renditions of Spanish-language songs on the proudly multicultural soundtrack. In Cantonese and Shanghainese with English subtitles
Innocence (Not rated)
Director: Paul Cox. With Julia Blake, Charles Tingwell. (95 min.)

Staff ***1/2 Yearning for the Englishwoman he loved in his youth, an aging Belgian widower finds her in Australia 45 years later where she is enduring a comforable but thankless marriage. Director Cox draws remarkably low-key performances from his cast, suggesting the would-be lovers' mental state with deft flashback glimmers of romance and separation. By M.K. Terrell.

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes, including nudity. Violence: 2 scenes, including a minor tussle. Profanity: 3 expressions. Drugs: 8 scenes of drinking.
Intimacy (Not rated)
Director: Patrice Chereau. With Kerry Fox, Mark Rylance, Timothy Spall, Clare Wayland. (119 min.)


Page 104 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt ** A man and woman meet every Wednesday in London for quick sessions of impersonal sex, and this murky drama explores the effects these escapades have on their otherwise separate lives. Based on fiction by Hanif Kureishi, the movie plays like a warmed-over "Last Tango in Paris," with more explicit sex but a lower level of originality and acting skill.
Invisible Circus (R)

Director: Adam Brooks. With Cameron Diaz, Jordana Brewster, Christopher Eccleston, Blythe Danner, Patrik Bergin. (112 min.)

Staff ** This lightweight look at '70's activism has 18-year old Phoebe (Brewster) traveling across  Europe in 1976 trying to unravel the mystery of the suicide of older sister Faith (Diaz) 6 years earlier. In flashback we see Faith's progress from non-violent protest to terrorism to guilt, as Phoebe has a gratuitous affair with Faith's ex-boyfriend. Blythe Danner shines in a small part as the young women's widowed mother,
but the postcard pretty settings and an earnest young cast fail to overcome the detached storytelling - we just don't care about these people. La guerre est l'ennui. (After the film, the woman behind this reviewer woke her companion out of a deep sleep. When he came to, he said, "that was good." He must have meant his nap.) By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 6 instances including 4 brief scenes of sex, 2 of them with nudity. Violence: 6 scenes including a suicide. Profanity: 20 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 9 scenes with smoking, 6 scenes with drinking and 2 scenes with drugs.
The Iron Ladies (Not rated)

Director: Yongyoot Thongongtoon. With Sahapap Virakamin, Pormasith Siticharoengkul, Jojo Mioxshi, Jessadaporn Pholdee. (104 min.)

Sterritt *** A team of gay volleyball players gets a chance at fame when a more macho team stages a walkout because they don't like their female coach, and flamboyant history is made on Thailand's athletic scene. The subject is certainly offbeat, and the movie has enough color and spirit to make lively viewing, aside from the interest of seeing one of the most popular movies ever produced by Thailand's modest
film industry.
Jabberwocky (PG)
Director: Terry Gilliam. With Michael Palin, Annette Badland, Max Wall. (105 min.)

Sterritt *** Palin, one of the most gifted members of England's fabled Monty Python comedy troupe, plays a mud-spattered medieval peasant whose life turns adventurous when a monster starts stalking the countryside. Gilliam's first solo flight as a director is more notable for its inspired visual ideas than for the frequency of its laughs, but Python devotees will have fun. First released in 1977.
Jackpot (R)
Director: Michael Polish. With Jon Gries, Daryl Hannah, Garrett Morris, Adam Baldwin. (96 min.)

Sterritt *** The adventures of a would-be country singer who makes up in tenacity - and obliviousness to his own lack of talent - what he lacks in musical gifts and upward mobility in what he finds to be a very ungenerous business. Gries and Morris act up a storm as the optimistically named Sunny Holiday and his long-suffering manager. Kudos also go to director Polish and his co-writer Mark Polish, who give the comedy-drama a bittersweet quirkiness that recalls their earlier and even better feature, "Twin Falls Idaho."
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (R)

Director: Kevin Smith. With Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Shannon Elizabeth, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Jason Lee, Matt Damon. (99 min.)

Sterritt * The title characters have appeared regularly in Smith comedies like "Dogma" and "Chasing Amy," and they take over the story here, traveling to Hollywood to register their protest that Miramax is making a movie about them without giving them a cut of the profits. There are enough four-letter words and smarmy sex gags to stock a dozen ordinary movies, but even fans of Jay and Silent Bob may find the story too slender and the jokes too repetitive to be much fun.
Jeepers Creepers (R)
Director: Victor Salva. With Gina Philips, Justin Long, Jonathan Breck, Eileen Breenan.

Page 105 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff * Trish (Philips) and her brother, Darry (Long) are heading home from college. But this is no ordinary road trip. Instead of taking a shortcut, the siblings opt for the scenic route - on a never- ending country road. The first half is pretty intense, as Darry and his sister investigate an abandoned church. But then it just turns silly. They soon encounter a hideous and evil creature that's part bird, who likes to sniff laundry, spread his huge wings, and eat people. There's also a psychic who sings "Jeepers creepers, where'd you get those peepers?" Many scenes caused this reviewer to laugh out loud. The filmmakers seem to be making fun of the horror genre itself. By Lisa Leigh Parney

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of naked dead bodies. Violence: 10, including bloody scenes of eating flesh, bodies torn apart, and head decapitations. Profanity: 40 expressions, sometimes harsh. Drugs: None.
Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade (Not rated)
Director: Hiroyuki Okiura. With voices of Michael Dobson, Moneca Stori, Doug Abrahams, Colin
Murdock. (102 min.)

Sterritt ** What if World War II had pitted Japan against  Germany, and the Nazis had won? This offbeat animation in Japan's colorful "anime" style takes place a decade after such a conflict, depicting the sometimes violent adventures of a policeman and a young woman in a Tokyo torn by fighting between cultlike terrorists and high-tech security forces. The story's emphasis is on action, but there are some sensitive moments and interesting ideas along the way.
Josie and the Pussycats (PG-13)

Directors: Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont. With Rachael Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid. (98 min.)

Sterritt *** Our heroines are wannabe rock stars who stumble on a scheme for selling pop-culture products through subliminal messages. The action is perky, but it's ironic that this satire of commercialism sets a record for product- placement plugs.
Journey to the Sun (Not rated)
Director: Yesim Ustaoglu. With Newroz Baz, Nazmi Quirix, Mizgin Kapazan. (104 min.)

Sterritt *** Friendship arises between a young Turkish man and a Kurdish rebel, but their lives darken when the law-abiding Turk is mistaken for his companion and placed under surveillance by the authoritarian police. This is only Ustaoglu's second film, but smart performances and expressive camera work mark her as a talent to watch in the future. In Turkish with English subtitles
Joy Ride (R)
Director: John Dahl. With Steve Zahn, Leelee Sobieski, Paul Walker, Walt Goggins. (97 min.)

Staff ** A stylish but ultimately cheap thrill, "Joy Ride" is a skillful production in the service of nothing better than your average teen fright- flick experience. Two brothers play a practical joke on a truck driver, who turns out to be Freddy Kreuger on 10 wheels as he pursues his revenge to its noisy, gory conclusion (and, of course, beyond). Fasten your seat belts if you must take this ride, but as every patron of the teen genre knows, you're better off if you don't get in the car. By Gloria Goodale
Juliet of the Spirits (No Rated)
Director: Federico Fellini. With Giuletta Masina, Mario Pisu, Valentina Cortese, Sandra Milo. (148 min.) Sterritt **** A woman must come to terms with moral, personal, and domestic challenges posed by her
husband's infidelity. Masina gives one of her most expressive performances in the rerelease of this 1965
masterpiece, which explores psychological and cinematic ideas first unveiled in Fellini's classic "8 1/2,"
an even greater excursion into the borderline area where fantasy and reality intertwine.
Jump Tomorrow (PG)

Director: Joel Hopkins. With Tunde Adebimpe, Hippolyte Girardot, Natalie Verbeke, James Wilby. (97 min.)

Staff ** Strait-laced George (Adebimpe), a Manhattan office worker from Nigeria, hopes to honor his departed parents and please an overbearing uncle by going through with an arranged marriage. En route to the ceremony, he encounters a suicidal Frenchman (Girardot) and a free-spirited Latina (Verbeke), whose passionate family threatens to set George's buttoned-down lifestyle on a new path. This feature

film debut by writer-director Hopkins suffers a bit from its low budget, but its witty script and multicultural cast never fail to delight. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 2 instances of mild innuendo; 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: None. Profanity: 20 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with alcohol.
Jurassic Park III (PG-13)

Director: Joe Johnston. With Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Laura Dern. (90 min.)

Sterritt ** After their 14-year-old son disappears into an island jungle inhabited by Jurassic Park's prehistoric critters, an unhappy couple shanghais mild-mannered paleontologist Alan Grant into helping their rescue effort. The cast is solid, and the special effects are as impressive as executive producer Steven Spielberg's bottomless resources can make them. But the screenplay is so stale that even fans of the previous "Jurassic" installments might think this is one clone too many.
Staff *1/2 Poorly paced, summer fun, empty theme park ride, blessedly short.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 11 scenes of dinosaur attacks. Profanity: 5 mild instances. Drugs: 1 scene with drinking.
Just Visiting (PG-13)

Director: Jean Marie-Poire. With Jean Reno, Christian Clavier, Christina Applegate, Malcolm McDowell. (93 min.)

Staff **1/2 A faulty potion sends a 13th-century French knight and his valet down "the tunnels of time" to wake up in a Chicago museum, touching off a romp through the city. The wizard (McDowell), realizing his mistake, comes after them, adding to the confusion. Director Poire's English-language remake of his
1993 French hit brings back original stars Reno and Clavier. Not a great film, but high energy, good clean fun, and dumb humor keeps you laughing. By M.K. Terrell
K-PAX (PG-13)
Director: Iain Softley. With Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Alfre Woodard, Mary McCormack. (120 min.) Sterritt * Spacey plays Prot, an amiable oddball who claims to be from a planet called K-PAX and is
promptly whisked off to a mental hospital. There, he helps other patients - he's the Patch Adams of the
extraterrestrial set-until psychiatrist Bridges uses hypnosis and sleuthing to investigate his life and
uncover his past. The story acknowledges suffering and grief, but the filmmakers soften every hard fact
with slick camera work, silky-smooth editing, and syrupy music. The result is exactly the kind of
starry-eyed escapist fantasy that Prot is suspected of having. There's a difference between movies that
lift our thoughts and movies that put our heads in the clouds.
Staff **1/22 Lacks courage, confused, puts a smile on your face, intriguing.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene with slight nudity. Violence: 2 scenes, including a mugging. Profanity: 1 expression. Drugs: 3 scenes with alcohol, some scenes with prescription drugs.
Keep Up Your Right (Not rated)
Director: Jean-Luc Godard. With Jean-Luc Godard, Jane Birkin, Jacques Villeret. (82 min.)

Sterritt *** This minor work by a major filmmaker tells three intertwined stories about a rock-music band, an eccentric worker, and a suicidal airplane pilot with a group of very worried passengers. Godard lends the comedy-drama an extra measure of offbeat charm with his own appearance as a sort of cinematic court jester, and the film's images grow more radiantly beautiful as it goes along. Everyday moviegoers may find its complicated structure more impenetrable than enticing, though. Made in 1987 and originally called "Soigne ta droite." In French with English subtitles
Kill by Inches (Not rated)
Directors: Diane Doniol-Valcroze, Arthur Flam. With Emmanuel Salinger, Christopher Zach. (85 min.) Sterritt * Fascinated by women and the art of measuring them for clothes, a troubled young tailor
escalates from bizarre behavior to outright murder. This dark psychological story falls short in terms of
filmmaking and acting, but it's original enough to stand out from the crowd.

The King Is Alive (R)

Director: Kristian Levring. With Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Davison, Janet McTeer, Miles Anderson. (118 min.)
Sterritt ***

Struggling with loneliness and anxiety while waiting to be rescued from the African desert where their bus has broken down, a group of very different people decide to while away the time with a bare- bones staging of "King Lear," which stirs up more passions and apprehensions than expected. Levring was a founder of Denmark's innovative Dogma 95 movement, which tries to bring filmmaking back to its roots
by forbidding artificial or extraneous effects. This unconventional character study is distinguished less by its elements of melodrama and psychodrama than by its intense acting and the vivid immediacy of Levring's powerful imagery.
Kiss of the Dragon (R)
Director: Chris Nahon. With Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tcheky Karyo, Burt Kwouk. (100 min.)

Staff ** Don't go to this martial arts movie expecting "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." There's none of that movie's nuanced acting or genteel violence on display in this tale about a Chinese policeman (Li) framed for murder while on assignment in Paris. Stylish production values and inventive choreography fail to paper up the cavernous cracks in the story, but Li's karate chops are impressive as he somehow takes on more bad guys than Rambo did in three movies. By Stephen Humphries

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes of implied sex. Violence: 79 scenes, extremely violent. Profanity: 48 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with smoking, 4 scenes with drinking, 2 scenes with drugtaking of cocaine and heroin.
A Knight's Tale (PG-13)
Director: Brian Helgeland. With Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk, Paul Bettany. (132 min.) Staff **1/2
"A Knight's Tale" is a familiar story in which a kid from the wrong side of town (Ledger) makes his dream of becoming a knight a reality by posing as royalty. Trained as a child by the best knight in England, the only thing holding him back from rivaling the best competitors from  Europe - and winning the heart of a beautiful princess - is his status in society. This quest for personal triumph is accompanied by a surprising array of classic rock-music favorites and other light-hearted comic relief. It's good family entertainment, but the jousting is bloody and violent. By Heidi Wilson
Staff **1/2 Gorgeous costumes, Not quite Shakespeare, alarming at times.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes of partial male nudity. Violence: 28 scenes, but no blood or gore. Profanity: 14 mild expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with drinking.
The Last Castle (R)
Director: Rod Lurie. With Robert Redford, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Delroy Lindo. (120 min.) Staff ** In his follow-up to "The Contender," former film critic- turned- director Rod Lurie seems to be
trying to create a prison drama that recalls "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Great Escape." The
prisoners this time are soldiers, including a legendary three- star general (Redford), serving a 10-year
sentence. He soon finds himself rallying the men to oppose a ruthless colonel who runs the military
prison. The film is often entertaining, but it's hampered by an unmerited sense of self-importance,
too-obvious gestures, and ludicrous plot holes. By Stephen Humphries
The Last Wave (Not rated)
Director: Peter Weir. With Richard Chamberlain, David Gulpilil, Olivia
Hamnett. (106 min.)
Sterritt **** A corporate lawyer in Sydney, Australia, agrees to defend a group of Aboriginal men against
a murder charge, only to find that his clients are reluctant to discuss some aspects of their lives. Probing
deeper, he learns that tribal mysteries aren't as absent from the modern Australian city as he thought,
and before long his findings take on increasingly apocalyptic implications. Weir had a truly magical touch

in early films like this 1977 masterpiece, which offers a transfixing excursion into the "dream time" of
Australian myth.
Legally Blonde (PG-13)
Director: Robert Luketic. With Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Victor Garber. (94 min.) Sterritt ** When her boyfriend proposes breaking up instead of getting married, a ditsy sorority girl follows
him to Harvard Law School and continues her courtship on his own turf. How does she get into such a
prestigious institution? This doesn't make much sense, even by the movie's own sitcom logic, but part of
the answer is a videotaped application essay featuring our heroine in a bikini - a good example of what
the movie as a whole is like. Witherspoon fills the screen with bright-eyed bounce. The rest of the cast is
as forgettable as the flimsy story.
Staff **1/2 Light-hearted, perky, delightful.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: 15 mild expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with alcohol. L.I.E. (NC-17)
Director: Michael Cuesta. With Brian Cox, Paul Franklin Dano, Bruce Altman, Billy Kay. (100 min.)
Sterritt ** Living with his self-absorbed father after his mother's death on the Long Island Expressway, a
15-year-old boy gets involved with troublemaking friends and then becomes the prey of an aging
pedophile who lives undetected in their town. The subject matter is deeply troubling, and the treatment is
harrowingly candid, but the movie paints a sincere and serious portrait of the seductiveness of evil and
the self-destructive nature of depravity. Cox is chillingly brilliant as the repugnant villain.
Life and Debt (Not rated)
Director: Stephanie Black. With Belinda Becker, Michael Manley, various residents of Jamaica. (82 min.) Sterritt *** A nonfiction look at poverty and inequality in Jamaica, and at globalized forces that drive and
sustain these hardships, often for the benefit of privileged people in faraway places. The documentary
blends compassion for individuals with explanations of the socioenonomic factors that influence them,
never forgetting that historical forces are anything but abstract when they manifest themselves in
people's lives.
Life as a House (R)
Director: Irwin Winkler. With Kevin Kline, Kristen Scott Thomas, Hayden Christiansen. (124 min.)

Staff *** "Life as a House" has a predictable story line, yet the telling is compelling with fresh twists. A lonely, eccentric architect (Kevin Kline) is diagnosed with terminal cancer. To atone for a lifetime of mistakes, he builds his dream home, enlisting his estranged and rebellious teenage son (Christiansen), and the help of his ex-wife (Scott Thomas). Building the house becomes a metaphor for a life rebuilt and relationships restored. The lead actors give credible, real, meaningful performances, and moments of delightful humor offset the drama. The subject matter, sexual content, and language probably make this film better suited to a more mature audience. By Steven Savides
Staff *** Enriching, sad but inspiring, preachy.

Sex/Nudity: 9 scenes of sex and graphic innuendo. Violence: 2 scenes. Profanity: 31 harsh expressions. Drugs: 1 scene of alcohol, 4 scenes with cigarettes, 4 scenes with substance abuse.
The Low Down (Not rated)
Director: Jamie Thraves. With Aidan Gillen, Kate Ashfield, Tobias Menzies. (96 min.)

Sterritt ** Our hero is a young Londoner who can't decide whether to find a nice girlfriend and settle down, as even his wilder friends are starting to do, or to stay with the day-to-day emotional drifting that has characterized his life so far. This comedy-drama has touches of quirky style to match its slightly edgy content, but its main audience will be 20-something audiences who haven't seen this kind of
coming-of-age tale many times before.
Lumumba (Not rated)

Director: Raoul Peck. With Eriq Ebouaney, Theophile Moussa Sowie, Alex Descas, Maka Kotto. (115 min.)

Page 109 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff ** The true story of Patrice Lumumba, who helped the Congo escape from Belgian colonialism but fell victim to assassins after two months into the Congolese presidency. Ebouaney's performance combines a great sense of dignity with a failure to bring out the psychologically complex man or his political ideas. The film fails to explain why he became a flashpoint of controversy for many Western observers. In French with English subtitles
The Luzhin Defence (PG-13)
Director: Marleen Gorris. With John Turturro, Emily Watson, Stuart Wilson, Geraldine James. (108 min.) Sterritt ** Turturro plays a chess master whose brilliance with knights and pawns is offset by an insecure,
even bumbling approach to other aspects of life. Visiting an Italian resort to play an important match, he
gets romantically involved with a beautiful Russian woman, and has trouble coping with the situation -
partly because he's so unworldly, and partly because his childhood was disrupted by his own parents'
unhappy marriage. The story (based on a Vladimir Nabokov novel) has promise, but it fails to score a
checkmate because of Gorris's failure to build dramatic momentum or elicit first-rate performances.
Made (R)

Director: Jon Favreau. With Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Sean Combs, Famke Janssen, Peter Falk. (95 min.)

Staff ** "Made" reunites Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, stars of the 1996 cult hit "Swingers." Bobby (Favreau) and Ricky (Vaughn) are small-time thugs sent to New York to help a deal go down. But professionals they're not, and do their best to (unintentionally) screw things up. Vaughn's comic talents shine with brilliant delivery and timing, while writer/director Favreau shows his skill with strong characterization and snappy dialogue. The pair's chemistry is dynamic, but a more seasoned director may have told a better story. By David S. Hauck
Staff ** Pointless, 'Not very money,' waste of time.

Sex/Nudity: 5 scenes of innuendo, 2 scenes with nudity, 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 6 scenes, including fight Profanity: 368 extremely harsh expressions. Drugs: 14 scenes with smoking; 9 scenes with drinking, 2 scenes with cocaine.
The Magnet (Not rated)

Director: Kamel Saleh, Akhenaton. With Kamel Saleh, Akhenaton, Brahim Aimad, Malek Brahimi. (100 min.)

Sterritt ** Love and crime are preoccupations of the main characters, ethnic- minority Frenchmen coping with poverty, discrimination, and their own self- created problems. The story and filmmaking are only sporadically interesting, but the movie deserves credit for exploring little-seen aspects of life in an increasingly multicultural France. Originally called "Comme un aimant." In French with English subtitles
Malena (R)

Director: Giuseppe Tornatore. With Monica Bellucci, Luciano Federico, Giuseppe Sulfaro, Matilde Piana, Pietro Notarianni. (94 min.)

Staff **1/2 A love-struck teenager (Sulfaro) in 1940s Sicily watches in horror as his town, lacking Jews or any other convenient scapegoats, turns against the object of his obsession, a pretty but chaste war widow (Bellucci). Prevented from earning a decent living by jealousy and cowardice of the villagers, she becomes a prostitute. Striking photography, period detail, screen-filling crowd scenes, and veteran composer Morricone's score make this one worth seeing, but the sheer nastiness of the town's people drags it down. By M.K Terrell
The Man Who Bought Mustique (Not rated)
Director: Joseph Bullman. With Colin Tennant, Nicholas Courtney, Princess Margaret. (78 min.)

Sterritt *** This hugely entertaining documentary etches a lively portrait of the elderly Lord Glenconner, a Scottish aristocrat who purchased a Caribbean island in the 1950s, touted it as a resort for the rich and famous, then sold it in the '70s when the investment went sour for him. The movie accompanies him on a rare visit to his former domain, where he prepares a luncheon for a royal friend while sparring with neighbors and servants over their occasional reluctance to let him have absolutely everything his own way. Must-see viewing if you're not quite sure the sun really set over the British Empire.
The Man Who Cried (R)
Page 110 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Sally Potter. With Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchette, John Tuturro. (99 min.)

Staff **1/2 Stalinist troops arrest a little girl's grandmother and burn their shtetl. Escaping to England, she grows up in foster care as 'Suzie,' always longing to find her father in American. Grown Suzie (Ricci)
joins a Paris cabaret act to raise boat fare and learns about life from a passionate gypsy (Depp), just as Hitler invades. Tuturro plays a vain tenor who sings gloriously, but turns out to be a facist bafoon. The film never quite gels, but the music (Verdi and Pucell) and Paris night views sometimes make it an aural and visual treat.

Sex/Nudity: 4 brief sex scenes. Violence: 7 scenes. Profanity: 3 mild expressions. Drugs: 1 scene with cigarettes, 5 with alcohol
The Man Who Wasn't There (R)

Director: Joel Coen. With Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub. (116 min.)

Sterritt **** Thornton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a 1940s barber who's unhappy about the affair his wife is having. The plot thickens when he meets a fast-talking entrepreneur looking for investors and arranges a blackmail scheme to raise money and take revenge on his cheating spouse. From its ominous title to its black- and-white cinematography, this is an affectionate homage to the shadowy "film noir" genre of old, written with gusto by Coen with his brother Ethan, and acted to near-perfection by a well-chosen cast. Haunting use of Beethoven music puts a crowning touch on the nostalgic package.
Staff ***1/2 Sustained tension, well-paced, impeccable acting, atmospheric.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 3 scenes, including graphic violence. Profanity: 38 mostly mild expressions. Drugs: 5 scenes with alcohol, 32 scenes with cigarettes.
Mr. Rice's Secret (Not rated)
Director: Nicholas Kendall. With David Bowie, Bill Switzer, Teryl Rothery, Garwin Sanford, Richard de
Klerk. (93 min.)

Sterritt ** A mysterious ring plays a pivotal role in this youth- centered tale about a boy who's helped by an enigmatic man as he copes with challenges of illness and growing up. The drama is likably low-key but builds little excitement, and Bowie's star billing says more about the power of his agent than the number of scenes he appears in.
Mau Mau Sex Sex (Not rated)
Director: Ted Bonnitt. With David Friedman, Dan Sonney. (80 min.)

Sterritt ** A wry documentary visit with two showmen who devoted their careers to developing, expanding, and profiting from the exotic world of exploitation movies. The title comes from their realization that a movie called "Mau Mau" will sell a lot more tickets if you add "Sex Sex" to the poster.
Bonnitt provides some insights into issues of censorship and mass-culture morality, but the picture would have benefited from more flamboyant film clips and fewer folksy conversations with the garrulous
old-timers it focuses on.
Mauvais Sang (Not rated)

Director: Leos Carax. With Denis Lavant, Juliette Binoche, Michel Piccoli, Julie Delpy, Carroll Brooks, Serge Reggiani, Hans Meyer, Hugo Pratty. (116 min.)
Sterritt ***

Carax assembled a sensational cast for this moody 1987 fantasy about a man who joins a scheme to steal the cure for a new illness that only afflicts lovers who don't really care about each other. Also present is Carax's cinematic verve and a love for pop-culture detritus which gives the story much of its distinctive feel. Also known as "Bad Blood" and "The Night Is Young." In French with English subtitles
Max Keeble's Big Move (PG)
Director: Tim Hill. With Alex Linz, Clifton Davis, Amy Hill, Orlando Brown. (86 min.)

Staff **1/2 Will Max survive his first week of junior high? Bullies take his money and toss him in a dumpster. He's also tormented by a crazed ice cream vendor, a bulldozer-driving principal, and a
ninth-grader trying to make him her pet. Under the impression that he's about to move to another town,

Max decides to strike back. This scattered production, which seems more like a Nickelodeon cartoon than a live action movie, often loses positive messages in the shuffle, but Linz's savvy performance as Max almost compensates. Fifth- graders may find it funny - or terrifying. By M.K. Terrell
Maze (R)

Director: Rob Morrow. With Rob Morrow, Laura Linney, Robert Hogan, Craig Sheffer, Rose Gregorio. (97 min.)

Sterritt ** Morrow plays the title character, an artist diagnosed with a syndrome that gives him patterns of involuntary speech and movement. His condition doesn't stop him from becoming infatuated with his best friend's lover, touching off a string of unexpected events and raising questions about his capacities for love and loyalty. Although this is a likable comedy-drama, it never quite balances its humanitarian message (disabled people fall in love like everyone else) with its standard-issue romantic angles. Moviegoers interested in how people cope with Maze's syndrome would do better to see the witty 1993 documentary "Twitch and Shout," which included the real-life Lyle Maze among its subjects.
Memento (R)
Director: Christopher Nolan, With Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss, Joe Pantoliano. (118 min.)

Sterritt *** A young man hunts the criminal who murdered his wife, hampered by a physical condition that obliterates his short-term memory on a day-by-day basis. How do you conduct a life-or-death quest
under such circumstances? You write yourself endless notes, tattoo crucial information on your skin, and hope your cause is just enough to succeed. This unconventionally structured thriller moves at an energetic pace, spurred by a string of clever variations on conventional film narrative.
Staff *** A reel-ful of Polaroid moments, fresh, intricate, long.

Sex/Nudity: None. V: 9 scenes of violence, including a rape. Profanity: 143 harsh expressions. Drugs: 6 instances of drinking; 1 scene with smoking.
The Mexican (R)

Director: Gore Verbinski. With Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Bob Balaban, J.K. Simmons, David Krumholtz, Gene Hackman. (123 min.)

Sterritt *** Pressured by mobsters, a small-time crook takes on one last job - retrieving an exotic pistol from a Mexican village - which places him in very hot water and lands his estranged girlfriend in the hands of an eccentric kidnapper. Lively acting and stylish directing make this an engaging comedy- drama, although its attitude toward guns and violence is disconcertingly romantic.
Staff **1/2 Edgy, disappointing, quirky, Gandolfini shines.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo. Violence: 14 scenes, including suicide and gunshots wounds. Profanity: 15 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with smoking.
Monkeybone (PG-13)

Director: Henry Selick. With Brendan Fraser, Brigette Fonda, Rose McGowan, Whoopi Goldberg. (87 min.)

Staff * Stu (Fraser) is a meek cartoonist whose saucy comic strip has just been picked up as a TV series. But when he smashes his Karmann-Ghia into a building and falls into a deep coma, he finds himself in a kind of purgatory filled with not-so-scary monsters. What's scary is that Monkeybone, his sex-crazed cartoon character, takes over Stu's body when he wakes up. An enormous cadre of animators, puppeteers, and technicians try for all they're worth but can't get this unfunny flick to wake up. By M.K. Terrell
Monsters, Inc. (G)

Director: Pete Docter. With voices of John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi. (90 min.)

Sterritt *** The setting is a monster-populated city where energy is generated from children's screams, helped by a company that employs professional kiddie- scarers to frighten tykes in their beds. The monsters are more scared of kids than kids are of them, however. The characters of this animated comedy are as sweet as they are ridiculous, and the story is told with gentleness and tact. But many of

the story's grownup touches - a monster love affair, references to old movies - are more calculated than clever.
Staff ***1/2 Warm and fuzzy, Not as good as "Toy Story," inventive, well-voiced. Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 10 scenes, of comic violence. Profanity: None. Drugs: None. Monterey Pop (Not rated)
Director: D.A. Pennebaker. With Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, The Mamas and the Papas, Simon and Garfunkel. (78 min.)

Sterritt *** This nonfiction visit to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, first released in 1969 to great acclaim, documents high- energy performances by a wide range of top-ranking '60s rock musicians. It captures their magic with a freewheeling spontaneity that became a model for later pop-music movies and made Pennebaker a directorial star of the cinema-verite documentary movement.
Moulin Rouge (PG-13)

Director: Baz Luhrmann. With Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo. (120 min.)

Sterritt *** The setting is Paris a century ago. The heroine is a can-can dancer caught between the love of a poor poet and the lust of a wealthy count who could help her career. Kidman and McGregor make a fetching couple and some will find it exhilarating fun. Others will pine for the days when musicals cared more about singing and dancing than cinematic shenanigans for their own sake.
Staff **1/2 Visual delight, uneven, good songs.

Sex/Nudity: Several scenes of innuendo. Violence: 2 scenes, one with attempted rape. Profanity: None. Drugs: 8 scenes of smoking, 11 with alcohol.
Mulholland Drive (R)

Director: David Lynch. With Laura Herring, Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, Robert Forster, Ann Miller. (147 min.)

Sterritt *** After losing her memory in a Los Angeles car crash, a young woman comes under the care of a wannabe actress who agrees to help her discover who she is and figure out why her purse is crammed with cash. That's just the bare bones of the plot, which also includes a cynical cop, a hit man who can't shoot straight, and others too numerous to mention. The movie is closer to a delirious dream than a conventional thriller. It will frustrate viewers who like stories to make instant sense, but fans of
provocative puzzles will have mind-teasing fun if they can stomach Lynch's trademarked outbursts of sex and violence.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes of explicit sex and innuendo. Violence: 9 instances, often disturbing. Profanity: 9 harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with alcohol, 2 scenes with cigarettes.
The Mummy Returns (PG-13)

Director: Stephen Sommers. With Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Patricia Velasquez, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Alun Armstrong, The Rock. (125 min.)

Sterritt ** A handsome adventurer and his Egyptologist wife dash through an Indiana Jones-style story about the resurrection of a three-millennium-old nemesis, the lurking danger of a long-buried warrior, and the appearance of a very ominous bracelet on their son's arm. Writer-director Sommers serves up
rousing visual effects, smart- alecky dialogue, and sword-swinging action. But there's more emphasis on computer-generated gimmickry than on persuasive acting and ideas, and there's not a moment of real feeling in this expensive but empty- hearted epic.
Staff **1/2 Good romance, witty references to other films, over the top.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence:16 scenes, intense and scary, but not too gory. Profanity: 6 very mild expressions. Drugs: None.
The Musketeer (PG-13)
Director: Peter Hyams. With Justin Chambers, Stephen Rea, Tim Roth, Mena Suvari, Catherine
Deneuve. (106 min.)

Page 113 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff ** Great swordplay; terrible wordplay. That's the lowdown on the latest movie adaptation of the Alexander Dumas tale in which D'Artagnan, a valiant swordsman, rallies France's musketeers to protect the throne from the political machinations of Cardinal Richelieu (Rea). Unfortunately, newcomer Justin Chambers shows not one iota of charisma in the lead role, and Mena Suvari isn't very interesting as the obligatory love interest. The supporting cast, meanwhile, have more accents than you could cram into a tower of Babel. It's up to Tim Roth's hissable villain and Deneuve's twinkle- eyed queen to liven up things in between fencing choreography that manages to out-Zorro "Zorro." By Stephen Humphries
My First Mister (R)

Director: Christine Lahti. With Albert Brooks, Leelee Sobieski, Desmond Harrington, Carol Kane. (109 min.)

Staff ***1/2 Leelee Sobieski and Albert Brooks play odd-couple opposites in this unconventional romantic comedy. He's a prim 49- year-old haberdasher, she's a heavily-pierced goth just out of high school. While there are significant taboos in this pairing - she's underage at 17, and he's her boss - the movie ultimately displays that true love is about positive transgressions. As their love- interest turns from flirtation to
familial love, the triumph of trust between the characters remains utterly convincing and upliftingly funny. By Ben Arnoldy
Staff *** Touching, modest, tear-jerking

Sex/Nudity: 6 scenes of implied sex and innuendo. Violence: 4 instances of self- inflicted wounds. Profanity: 64 expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with alcohol, 1 scene with marijuana.
New York in the 50's (Not rated)

Director: Betsy Blankenbaker. With Dan Wakefield, Nat Hentoff, Joan Didion, Robert Redford, William F. Buckley Jr., Gay Talese. (72 min.)

Sterritt *** A collective memoir of the hip Manhattan life of a half-century ago, when artists and thinkers like the bebop musicians, the New York School painters, and the Beat Generation writers were shaking and waking the cold-war conformity of their era. The verbal recollections and photographic memorabilia don't go very deep, but they suggest the energy and complexity of what is truly an underrated decade.
Nico and Dani (Krampack) (Not rated)
Director: Cesc Gay. With Fernando Ramallo, Jordi Vilches, Marieta Orozco, Esther Nubiola, Chisco
Amado. (90 min.)

Sterritt ** Two teenage boys, one straight and one gay, come of age during a romantic Spanish summer. The acting is amiable but the story isn't much deeper than the callow main characters. In Spanish with English subtitles
The Night of the Hunter (Not rated)

Director: Charles Laughton. With Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish, James Gleason. (93 min.)

Sterritt **** Mitchum gives one of cinema's greatest performances as a demented man who's one part preacher, one part murderer, and totally determined to track down a stash of stolen loot in the
possession of two kids. First released in 1955, this is the only film Laughton ever directed, and he packed it with a mixture of eerie chills, ingenious suspense, and absurdist humor. It's a genuine classic.
Night Waltz: The Music of Paul Bowles (Not rated)

Director: Owsley Brown III. With Paul Bowles, Phillip Ramey, Abdelouahaid Boulaich, Joseph A. McPhillips III, Karim Jihad Achouatte. (80 min.)

Sterritt *** Bowles is known mainly as the author of "The Sheltering Sky" and other evocative fiction, but he started his career as a composer trained and influenced by Aaron Copland and other major musical figures. This  finely tuned documentary outlines his career and devotes a commendably large portion of the soundtrack to his compositions, accompanying them with poetic footage of New York City and Tangiers, the places where he spent his most productive years. Some of the footage was shot by the great Rudy Burckhardt and by Nathaniel Dorsky, who also edited the film.
No Sex Last Night (Double Bind) (Not rated)

Sterritt ***

American photographer Shephard and French artist Calle made a video and photographic record of a drive they took across the United States, starting in New York and ending in Las Vegas at a drive- through wedding chapel. With its skillful blend of documentary, confessional, and comic moods, this is one of the infrequent avant- garde movies that's as amusing and entertaining as it is artful and sophisticated.
Novocaine (R)
Director: David Atkins. With Steve Martin, Helena Bonham Carter, Laura Dern, Scott Caan. (95 min.) Staff **1/2 Steve Martin returns to the screen in the role of a dentist for the second time in his career (the
first was in "Little Shop of Horrors"), but this is one of Martin's rare non-comedic roles. Well, almost.
There is comedy in "Novocaine," a film-noir tale about a dentist who becomes a murder suspect after one
of his patients scams him for prescription drugs, but it's pitch black and only reveals itself gradually.
Martin is excellent in the role: One immediately empathizes with him during his plight as he runs from
both cops and the real murderer. This is an unconventional film, but director Atkins manages to get the
difficult tone right.(But stay away if you're the type who gets squeamish in the dentist's chair!) By Stephen
Humphries
Staff ** Ridiculous plot twist, entertaining, improbable.

Sex/Nudity: 10 scenes including implied sex and nudity. Violence: 10 grisly scenes. Profanity: At least 40 harsh expressions. Drugs: 11 scenes with smoking, 3 scenes with alcohol, 1 with drugs.

Staff *** Adapting Shakespeare's "Othello" into a modern-day high- school tragedy sounds gimmicky on paper. Thankfully, though, "O" has deeper concerns. A chain of tragic events is set in motion by the duplicitous conniving of high- schooler Hugo (Hartnett). Envious of the attention his father (Sheen), a basketball coach, bestows on African-American basketball star Odin (Phifer), Hugo deceives Odin into believing that his girlfriend (Stiles) has been unfaithful to him. In a time when school violence is often explained away in the media by superficial pop psychology, the deft script and top-rate cast invite audiences to reexamine the complexity of teenage behavior. By Stephen Humphries
Staff **1/2 Disappointing adaptation, well-acted, dark, brutal.

Sex/Nudity: 9 scenes including sex, innuendo and rape. Violence: 7 scenes, including school shooting and graphic strangulation. Profanity: 56 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes with underage drinking, 2 with drugs, 1 with steroids.
O Brother, Where Art Thou? (PG-13)
Director: Joel Coen. With George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, Holly Hunter, John
Goodman. (143 min.)

Sterritt ** Three small-time crooks escape from a Southern chain gang and embark on a quest for adventure, romance, and buried treasure. The screenplay by director Coen and producer Ethan Coen borrows from sources as varied as "The Odyssey" and Preston Sturges's brilliant 1941 comedy "Sullivan's Travels," about a movie director who longs to make a picture called "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" to prove what a serious guy he is. For all its ambitions, though, the Coens' odyssey is a scattershot affair with too many tricks and twists for its own good.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes of implied sex. Violence: 11 scenes, including beating a man. Profanity: 57 mostly mild expressions. Drugs: 3 scenes with alcohol, 2 instances of smoking
Ocean's Eleven (PG-13)

Director: Steven Soderbergh. With George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould. (105 min.)

Sterritt *** Flimsy but amusing remake of the 1960 comedy- thriller about a gang of rascally thieves who decide to burgle a trio of Las Vegas casinos. Clooney and company aren't as self-consciously stylish as Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals of yore, but they have good-natured fun with Soderbergh's blend of heist-movie suspense and smart-alecky dialogue, and Reiner and Gould are uproarious as old- timers

helping with the job. Add the beguiling Roberts as a very wild card in the deck, and you have a caper that rarely goes wrong.
Staff *** Crowd-pleaser, slick, big-budget caper.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 3 scenes, plus several explosions. Profanity: 21 expressions, some harsh. Drugs: 17 scenes with drinking and smoking.
On Hostile Ground (Not rated)
Directors: Liz Mermin, Jenny Raskin. With Richard Stuntz, Susan Cahill, Morris Wortman. (73 min.) Sterritt *** A nonfiction study of abortion practices and politics in the United States today, stressing the
personal and professional dangers faced by abortion providers who draw the attention and anger of
sometimes fanatical opponents. The film doesn't dig very deep into the social or moral history of its
subject, but it contains much instructive and eye-opening material.
The One (PG-13)
Director: James Wong. Jet Lee, Carla Gugino, Delroy Lindo, Jason Statham. (80 min.)

Staff **1/2According to the plot of "The One," there are 125 parallel universes. And in each there is a parallel version of each one of us. A megalomaniac (Jet Lee) is killing off his alter egos, knowing that those who remain will inherit the victims' strength and intelligence. Kill them all off, and he'll be a godlike creature: "The One." The bad guy comes to Los Angeles to kill number 124. It's to give us the ultimate battle: Li vs. Li. As the non- stop action hurtles toward a rather predictable conclusion, you may have to look hard for a spiritual dimension, but it's there. By M.K. Terrell
One Night at McCool's (R)

Director: Harald Zwart. With Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, Michael Douglas, John Goodman, Paul Reiser. (93 min).

Sterritt ** Tyler plays a loose-living woman whose beauty bedazzles every romance-starved man who takes a look at her - which might bode well for her future if the men weren't such a sorry lot: a lawyer who lusts for her, a barfly whose house she decides to rob, and a policeman trying to crack a murder she's bumbled her way into. There's plenty of sex and violence in this "Pulp Fiction"-style comedy, but it's all so fast and frenetic that you may notice its MTV- style energy more than its gross-out moments. What you can't miss is Tyler's ability to look tantalizing in every outfit the hyperactive costume designer could
dream up.
Staff ** Funny but no story, aimless, Tyler vamps it up well.

Sex/Nudity: 12 instances of sexual activity, no nudity. Violence: 9 scenes, including gory deaths. Profanity: 49 harsh expressions. Drugs: 12 scenes with alcohol and 10 with drugs.
Original Sin (R)
Director: Michael Cristofer. With Antonio Banderas, Angelina Joie, Joan Pringle (112 min).

Staff * This steamy 19th-century love story begins its tale behind bars with a pair of lips. These lips tell us of a mysterious tale of shameless love and obsessive betrayal. It is a story with many twists of attraction and deception between a Gullible Cuban coffee merchant (Banderas) and his mail-order American bride (Jolie) who is not quite what she seems. Although it is deliciously filmed around stunning scenery,
'Original Sin' turns out to be another tedious melodrama simply reminding us of the unfortunate fate that awaits those consumed by lustful love.
Osmosis Jones (PG)
Directors: Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly. With Bill Murray, Molly Shannon, Chris Elliott, voices of Chris
Rock, Laurence Fishburne, William Shatner, David Hyde Pierce. (90 min.)

Sterritt ** Our hero has poor health habits - heavy on the snacks, light on the exercise - and we see the physiological fallout of his irresponsibility in animated sequences set at different times of day in different parts of his distressed innards, where a talkative white blood cell and an officious patent- medicine pill work to cure him. This mixture of cartooning and live action has antecedents as different as the
science-fiction adventure "Fantastic Journey," old educational TV specials like "Hemo the Magnificent," and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," which was far more ambitious. But the Farrelly brothers inevitably
steer toward gross-out farce, and little they cook up here amounts to more than smart-alecky parody with

an intermittently sour smell. Young viewers may guffaw, but seasoned fans of "There's Something About
Mary" will be disappointed.
The Others (PG-13)
Director: Alejandro Amenabar. With Nicole Kidman, Christopher Eccleston, Eric Sykes. (104 min.) Sterritt ** A war widow, her little boy, and their new servants dwell amid the mysteries of what may be a
very haunted house. This is a subdued and sometimes subtle exercise in ghostly doings, going against
the horror-movie grain by relying on quietude and understatement. Kidman is a bit stiff as the
increasingly anxious matriarch, though, and Amenabar's filmmaking is sadly short on surprises.
Staff *1/2 Unoriginal twist ending, great ghost story, too slow.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex. Violence: 10 scary scenes. Profanity: 2 mild expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes of pilltaking.
Our Lady the Assassin (Not Rated)
Director: Barbet Schroder. With  German Jaramillo, Anderson Ballesteros. (101 min.)

Staff *** A middle-aged intellectual (Jaramillo), returns to Medellin, Colombia, after 30 years, to find that his sleepy home town has grown to 4 million people, many existing in crushing poverty and drug
trade-related anarchy. He is strangely drawn to a teenager (Ballesteros), who murders at the slightest provocation and is himself the target of frequent drive-by shootings. Director Schroeder used
non-professional youths from the actual barrios we see on screen. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes with nudity. Violence: 5 scenes, sometimes gory. Profanity: 56 harsh expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with drinking, 1 scene with smoking, 2 scenes with drugs.
Panic (R)
Director: Henry Bromell. With William H. Macy, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Tracey Ullman, John
Ritter. (88 min.)

Sterritt ** A professional killer worries about his little boy, converses with his father and his psychiatrist, and starts an affair with a younger woman in this brooding, understated thriller. The atmosphere is more compelling than the plot, but the story does pack a surprise or two.
Pearl Harbor (PG-13)
Director: Michael Bay. With Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Cuba Gooding Jr. (178 min.) Sterritt *
The friendship of two pilots is threatened when they both fall for the same woman on the eve of America's defeat at Pearl Harbor. The script of this self- important epic is about as well-structured as a scrambled egg, and the acting is cartoonish. Even the much-vaunted depiction of the Japanese attack, while often visually arresting, still suffers from over-frenetic editing and more emphasis on adventure thrills than befits the tragedy of Pearl Harbor. By Stephen Humphries
Staff *** Disappointing, overlong, thrilling, engrossing, shallow.

Sex/Nudity: 1 sex scene, 11 scenes with partial nudity. Violence: 274 scenes. Profanity: 40 harsh expressions. Drugs: 5 scenes with cigarettes, 3 scenes with alcohol.
Performance (Not rated)
Directors: Nicolas Roeg, Donald Cammell. With Mick Jagger, James Fox, Anita Pallenberg. (105 min.) Sterritt ****
The personalities of a psychopathic gangster and a faded rock musician appear to mingle and fuse after unplanned events bring the unlikely pair together. This unorthodox 1970 psychological thriller from England includes one of Jagger's few successful appearances in a fiction film, and it remains the best- known effort completed by Cammell before his death. More importantly, it put Roeg's powerful cinematic style on the cultural map for the first time.
Persona (Not rated)

Page 117 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Ingmar Bergman. With Liv Ullmann, Bibi Andersson, Margaretha Krook, Gunnar Bjornstrand. (81 min.)

Sterritt **** This great Swedish masterpiece from 1966 explores the mysteries of identity and personality through the story of a psychologically afflicted actress and a well-meaning nurse who develop an intricate relationship while sojourning together in an isolated house. The radically unusual style Bergman employs here suggests fascinating new ideas about the mysteries of cinema, as well. In Swedish with English subtitles
The Personals (Not rated)

Director: Chen Kuo-fu. With Rene Liu, Chin Shih-chieh, Chen Chao- jung, Wuu Bai, Gu Bao-ming. (104 min.

Sterritt *** Looking for a suitable husband, a young physician places a personal ad in the newspaper and sets about interviewing a wide assortment of mostly unsuitable men for the position. Liu is dazzling as
the heroine, and the movie as a whole strikes a lovely balance between comedy and compassion.
Planet of the Apes (PG-13)

Director: Tim Burton. With Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan. (119 min.)

Sterritt ** Wahlberg crash-lands his spaceship on a world where supersmart simians have all the power and human beings are their slaves. Burton is an imaginative director with a distinctive artistic vision, but his originality is nowhere to be seen in this by-the- numbers retread of a science-fiction premise that seemed much fresher in 1968, when the original "Planet" was released. And what's the point of having gifted actors like Carter and Roth, when it's hard to savor their talents under all that monkey makeup?
Staff *1/2 One-dimensional, Burton succeeds again, never dull, terrific sets and makeup.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of innuendo. Violence: 22 scenes, including gore. Profanity: 10 mild expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with smoking; 2 scenes with drinking.
The Pledge (R)

Director: Sean Penn. With Jack Nicholson, Helen Mirren, Benicio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn, Tom Noonan, Vanessa Redgrave, Sam Shepard, Lois Smith, Harry Dean Stanton, Aaron Eckhart, Mickey Rourke. (123 min.)

Sterritt *** An aging cop postpones his retirement to find the murderer of a little girl, fighting the odds against tracking down the killer and facing skeptical colleagues who think the psychopath has already been caught and killed. The acting is excellent and Penn reconfirms his remarkable talent for muted, understated filmmaking that focuses on character and dialogue rather than spectacle and sensationalism. The film's weak point is the screenplay by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary
Olson-Kromolowski, which lapses into cliches far more often than Penn's visual style does.
Staff ***1/2 Existential, slow-paced, taut, sometimes difficult to watch, haven't stopped thinking about it. Sex/Nudity: 1 sex scene, no nudity, 5 verbal references. Violence: 6 extremely gory scenes including
murder and suicide. Profanity: 23 mainly harsh expressions. Drugs: 17 scenes with smoking, 5 with
drinking
The Price of Milk (PG-13)
Director: Harry Sinclair. With Danielle McCormack, Karl Urban, Willa O'Neill. (90 min.)

Sterritt * Concerned that the relationship with her boyfriend might be cooling off as they move toward their impending marriage, a young woman takes a friend's advice and devises a series of tests to prove the strength of her fiance's affection. This amiable New Zealand comedy would be more fun if it accompanied its imaginative plot with imaginative acting and filmmaking. If a mildly magical story is what you're after, it'll be worth the price of admission. Otherwise save your milk money for something more substantial.
The Princess Diaries (G)

Director: Garry Marshall. With Julie Andrews, Anne Hathaway, Heather Matarazzo, Hector Elizondo. (114 min.)

Page 118 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt ** Andrews is excellent as the queen of an itsy-bitsy  European principality who decides the nation's next ruler should be her granddaughter, a San Francisco teenager who's never been told she has royal blood. With its leisurely pace and unfancy filmmaking, this is a likable throwback to an old tradition of family-friendly comedies from the Disney studio, spinning its unpretentious yarn with a quiet but inventive sense of humor. The problem is that it goes on much too long, stretching a modest story into a marathon that outlasts its welcome by about 30 minutes.
Staff *** Benign, whimsical, endearing, fluffy, bland.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: None. Drugs: 2 scenes with drinking. The Princess and the Warrior (R)
Director: Tom Tykwer. With Franka Potente, Benno Furmann, Marita Breuer, Joachim Krol. (130 min.)

Sterritt *** When she's hit by a speeding truck, a reserved young nurse is saved from perishing by a stranger who vanishes as soon as the crisis is over - only to reappear later when she happens to be in a bank he's decided to rob. Are these events just coincidence, or is there some larger destiny that wants their lives to intertwine? This dramatic look at questions of time and fate is less explosive than Tykwer's explosive "Run Lola Run," but it offers much food for thought. In  German with English subtitles
Rat Race (PG-13)
Director: Jerry Zucker. With John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Goldberg, Seth Green. (112 min.)

Staff *1/2 When a millionaire gambling magnet (Cleese) sets up a cross-country race between a group of contestants, they have little idea of the mishaps that will ensue as they strive to beat the others for a $2 million prize. "Naked Gun" director Zucker adds plenty of energy to the madcap episodes the all-star cast find themselves in, but the laughs are scattershot. The gags that do work are fantastic, but mostly this is an uninspired affair. By Stephen Humphries
Staff *1/2 Flashy, nonsensical, simplistic, cocky.

Sex/Nudity: 5 instances of innuendo. Violence: 12 comic scenes, one fairly unpleasant. Profanity: 33 occasionally harsh expressions. Drugs: 5 scenes with alcohol, 1 with cigarettes.
Recess: School's Out (G)
Director: Chuck Sheetz. With voices of Dabney Coleman, Melissa Joan Hart, Peter MacNichol. (84 min.) Staff **1/2 Another brats-to-the-rescue fable. This time the TV gang from Disney's "Recess" must stop a
renegade school principal who kidnaps the real principal, and makes a school his lab for turning Earth
into a snowball. Eliminate summer, he reasons, and kids will study all year round. Good fun for the K-5
set with some good chuckles for parents. The story is lively enough to overcome its TV- style animation,
but the final battle (water balloons, condiment squirting, cafeteria soup) may be a bit too much for some
preschoolers. By M.K. Terrell
Staff **1/2 Spunky, punchy, chuckle-worthy.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 6 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: None. Drugs: None. Restless (Not rated)
Director: Jule Gilfillan. With Catherine Kellner, David Wu. (98 min.)

Sterritt ** An unusual relationship develops between an American woman visiting Beijing in search of adventure and a Chinese-American man who doesn't feel much more at home there than she does. The movie is likable and well acted, but it doesn't make a very strong or lasting impression.
Richard the Second (Not rated)

Director: John Farrell. With Matte Osian, Kadina Delejalde, Deb Snyder, Tom Turbiville, Ellen Zachos. (93 min.)

Sterritt * A modern-dress version of William Shakespeare's minor history play about a smart but ineffectual monarch who finds his supporters shrinking in number, while a rival tries to engineer his downfall and death. Shot with nondigital video equipment on an island in Boston Harbor, this
ultra-low-budget production has a scruffy cinematic interest, but isn't photographed or acted with enough imagination to carry much weight as Shakespearean drama.

Riding in Cars with Boys (PG-13)
Director: Penny Marshall. With Drew Barrymore, Steve Zahn, Brittany Murphy, Adam Garcia. (132 min.) Staff **1/2 Beverly Donofrio (Drew Barrymore) is an ordinary teenager with an extraordinary sense of
destiny. When she becomes pregnant at the age of 15 and reluctantly marries her young lover (Steve
Zahn), her dreams are shattered by new - sometimes nasty - realities. She embarks on a 20-year quest
to be a good mother and assert herself as a formidable writer. Based on the 1990 memoir of Beverly
Donofrio, this film takes a touching, humorous look at the relationships and events that shaped one
woman's life, and the lives of those closest to her. It's an enjoyable journey, though at times it loses its
way and drags a bit. By Steven Savides
Staff *** Full of pathos, satisfying, well-acted.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes innuendo. Violence: 4 scenes, including a mild fight. Profanity: 15 expressions. Drugs: 7 scenes with alcohol, 7 scenes with cigarettes, 3 scenes with drugs.
The River (Not rated)

Director: Tsai Ming-liang. With Lee Kang-sheng, Miao Tien, Lu Hsiao-ling, Chen Chao-jung, Ann Hui. (115 min.)

Sterritt *** This moody domestic drama centers on a father and mother, both of whom have secret sex lives outside their marriage, and their grown-up son, who starts to experience a mysterious ailment after floating in a polluted river. Tsai has made greater films, like "The Hole" and "What Time Is It Over There?" but his distinctive style is present as this atmospheric story unfolds through leisurely shots that invite us not just to watch the characters, but to live and breathe along with them. In Mandarin with English subtitles
The Road Home (Not rated)
Director: Zhang Yimou. With Zhang Ziyi, Honglei Sun, Hao Zheng, Yuelin Zhao. (89 min.) Sterritt ***
As he prepares for his father's funeral, a man recalls the stories he's heard about the long-ago love affair between his parents, a young peasant woman and a village schoolmaster, during the 1950s - a time of transition in China between ancient folkways and new-fangled ideas like romantic love. Zhang Yimou has directed much greater films, like "Ju Dou" and "The Story of Qiu Ju," but this effort has a graceful simplicity that many will find hard to resist. Ditto for the starring performance by Zhang Ziyi, who earned fame in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
Staff ***1/2 Luminous, moral, poetic, compassionate.
Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: None. Drugs: None. Rock Star (R)
Director: Stephen Herek. With Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Flemyng, Timothy Spall. (104 min.)

Sterritt *** The hero is a wannabe pop singer (Wahlberg) who fronts a "tribute band" that slavishly imitates a far more famous group. It looks like he's going nowhere until the famous group summons him to replace their ousted leader - which makes him an overnight sensation and lures him into the rock scene's dark side of drugs and promiscuity, endangering his relationship with the girlfriend and manager (Aniston) who's been with him since the beginning. Herek pushes the sex-and-drug material too far, threatening to exploit the dangers that the overall story deplores. The acting is excellent, though, and the movie has a good-natured spirit to match its ultimate faith in the hero's deep-down goodness.
Staff **1/2 Top entertainment, cartoonish, like watching VH1's "Behind the Music."

Sex/Nudity: 8 scenes including sex, nudity, and innuendo. Violence: 5 scenes, including fighting. Profanity: 56 harsh expressions. Drugs: 18 scenes with alcohol, 7 with smoking, 2 with drugs.
Rush Hour 2 (PG-13)
Director: Bret Rattner. With Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Zhang Ziyi, Chris Penn, Don Cheadle. (88 min.)



Page 120 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff **1/2 Just put Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in a room together for 90 minutes, and you've got a hit movie. Here, the odd- couple detectives chase evil Triad counterfeiters from Hong Kong to Las Vegas. But never mind all that. The plot is full of holes anyway. And never mind that the sequel's stunts and
fight- scene choreography aren't quite as impressive as that of the first movie - the amped-up comedy more than compensates to carry the day. Actor chemistry matters. By Matthew MacLean
Staff *** Flashy, nonsensical, simplistic, cocky.

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes of innuendo. 3 scenes male posterior nudity. Violence: 11 scenes, including martial arts. Profanity: 40 expressions, many harsh. Drugs: 3 scenes with alcohol, 3 scenes with smoking.
Save the Last Dance (PG-13)
Director: Thomas Carter. With Julia Stiles, Sean Patrick Thomas, Vince Green, Terry Kinney. (110 min.) Staff ** For Sara Johnson (Stiles), ballet is her life. But when her mom dies in a car accident, her life
pirouettes out of control. Sara must move in with her estranged father in a rough neighborhood of
Chicago and attend a mostly black high school. There, she meets a handsome black teen who inspires
her to step back into the groove and put some hip-hop in her moves. It's a decent enough movie, but it
tries to incorporate too many ideas at once - overcoming adversity, succeeding in ballet, an interracial
relationship, life on the street. It would have been stronger had it zeroed in on one theme. By Lisa Leigh
Parney
Staff *** Good values, credible characters.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes with innuendo, scantily clad women and male nudity. Violence: 20 scenes of mostly comic violence, including fighting. Profanity: 53 expressions, mostly mild, but some sexual references. Drugs: 7 scenes with smoking.
Saving Silverman (PG-13)

Director: Dennis Dugan. With Steve Zahn, Amanda Peet, Frank Black, Jason Biggs, R. Lee Ermey (90 min.)
Staff **1/2 Domineering psychologist (Peet) captures the heart of an obsequious, Neil Diamond-loving
20-something (Biggs), forcing him to answer one of life's toughest questions: pals before gals? Rising
funnymen Jack Black and Steve Zahn are terrific as the kidnap- scheming, jealous pals, but the raunchy
gags borrow heavily from "There's Something About Mary" and overacting make for some flat scenes. If
audiences can stomach sloppy editing, bawdy humor, and an awkward Neil Diamond cameo, this movie
could quickly become a GPC (guilty pleasure classic). By Josh Burek
Staff **1/2 Kinda sweet, hit-and-miss comedy, one for Farrelly Brother fans.

Sex/Nudity: 7 scenes with innuendo, scantily clad women and male nudity. Violence: 20 scenes of mostly comic violence, including fighting. Profanity: 53 expressions, mostly mild, but some sexual references. Drugs: 7 scenes with smoking.
Scary Movie 2 (R)

Director: Damon Wayans. With Carmen Electra, Shannon Elisabeth, Hector Elizondo, Tim Curry. (88 min.)

Staff 1/2 The original Scary movie was a rather smart, funny riff on horror movies, in the "Naked Gun" vein. Well that vein has apparently run dry, for all this sequel can offer is lots of cliches and bathroom humor. You won't laugh and you won't be scared, but you may be embarrassed for the group of teenagers trapped in an archetypical haunted house for a weekend with Tim Curry. They're forced to deliver such terrible one-liners rather than simply get killed off one by one. By Alex Kaloostian
The Score (R)
Director: Frank Oz. With Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando, Angela Bassett. (124 min.) Staff ** Any movie poster boasting De Niro, Norton, and Brando - three great actors from three different
generations - is sure to generate excitement. But this heist movie is also third-rate material. De Niro plays
a safecracker who, you guessed it, accepts one last job before he retires to help out an in-debt Brando.
Norton, as De Niro's partner, is a pleasure to watch, but like the other actors he's hardly stretching
himself here. The final robbery arrives a little too late after a tortoise-paced beginning. Like the movie
itself, the sequence is amiable fun, but too low-key. By Stephen Humphries

Page 121 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff *** Intelligent, no emotional drive, thrilling.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 5 scenes, including beating. Profanity: 79 harsh expressions. Drugs: 2 scenes with smoking; 6 scenes with drinking.
Scottsboro: An American Tragedy (Not rated)
Director: Daniel Anker. With Mills Thornton, James Goodman, Wayne Flynt, Dan Carter. (84 min.) Sterritt *** This articulate documentary takes a clear-eyed look at the dismaying events that enveloped
nine African-American youngsters who were arrested, prosecuted, and persecuted in Alabama for the
1931 rape of two white women, a crime that probably didn't happen and was certainly not committed by
any of them. Their ordeals captured the attention of everyone from racial bigots, more interested in
sustaining white supremacy than obtaining justice, to Communist idealists, eager to seize on American
inequities to bolster their cause. All emerge as vivid historical figures in this lucid account.
See Spot Run (PG)

Director: John Whitesell. With David Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan, Leslie Bibb, Paul Sorvino. (93 min.)

Staff * Arquette plays Gordon, a letter carrier who has a problem with dogs and is clueless when it comes to kids. Suddenly he finds himself in  charge of a beautiful neighbor's little boy and an FBI dog that a drug lord wants to bump off. The bungling hit men provide some laughs, Jones is marvelous as the kid, and Arquette shows a flair for physical comedy and warm male bonding scenes. Sadly, the director's uneveness of tone and poor sense of comic timing thwart the cast's efforts. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 1 incident with innuendo. Violence: 12 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: 10 mild expressions. Drugs: None.
Sentimental Destinies (Not rated)

Director: Olivier Assayas. With Emmanuelle Beart, Charles Berling, Isabelle Huppert, Olivier Perrier, Dominique Reymond. (180 min.)

Sterritt ** After his marriage in the early 1900s, a French clergyman gives up his religious calling and devotes himself to running his family's porcelain business. Covering a 30-year time period and etching a large number of characters, this historical drama is literate and ambitious. But its novelistic sweep doesn't suit Assayas's idiosyncratic talent, and much of it is duller and talkier than one expects from the director
of adventurous pictures like "Irma Vep," still his best movie. Originally titled "Les Destinees
Sentimentales." In French with English subtitles
Serendipity (PG-13)
Director: Peter Chelsom. With John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Molly Shannon, Eugene Levy. (100 min.) Sterritt ** A young man meets the woman of his dreams, but she wants a sign that destiny means them
to be together, and destiny doesn't quite come through. Several years later, they're both due to marry
other people, and since neither can forget the magical evening they once shared, they independently
decide to give destiny one more chance. This exceedingly romantic comedy begins with flair but lapses
into cliches long before the sentimental (and predictable) finale. The stars are fetching, though, and Levy
is great fun in his too- small role.
Staff *** Great chemistry, stylish, no depth.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex, 2 instances of innuendo. Violence: 1 mild instance. Profanity: 21 expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes of alcohol, 2 scenes with cigarettes.
Session 9 (R)
Director: Brad Anderson. With David Caruso, Peter Mullan, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton.

Staff * Director Anderson made a name for himself with "Next Stop Wonderland," a quirky and fun romantic comedy. Here, he brings us a disturbing, creepy horror film set in an abandoned mental institution. When a crew of asbestos workers arrive on the scene, they split up and start, well, removing asbestos. During this time, one of the members finds some old tapes of sessions - yes, nine - with a former patient with multiple personalities. Talented actors are wasted on an empty and aimless plot.

Series 7 (R)

Director: Daniel Minahan. With Brooke Smith, Mark Woodbury, Michael Kaycheck, Marylouise Burke, Richard Venture, Donna Hanover. (85 min.)

Sterritt *** This ferocious satire of "reality television" presents a marathon of episodes from a (bogus) show that arms ordinary people with deadly weapons and then videotapes them as they hunt and kill one another. Too cynical and savage to believe? Have another look at the TV listings in your local
newspaper, project your imagination into the future, and ponder the possibilities.
Sexy Beast (R)

Directors: Jonathan Glazer. With Ben Kingsley, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, Amanda Redman. (88 min.)

Staff *** In this smart, funny British caper, Gal (Ray Winstone) is an ex- mobster enjoying a quiet retirement in Spain. He has an easy life relaxing with his wife and another couple - until, that is, his ex-boss Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) arrives on the scene. Against his will, Gal gets sucked back into another heist. It's hardly a new premise, but Glazer's snappy direction and  fine acting by all the cast
(particularly Kingsley, in the most un-Ghandi-like role imaginable) put this film at the top of its genre. By
Amanda Paulson
Staff *** Brutal, wickedly funny, Kingsley shines.

Sex/Nudity: 1 sex scene with nudity. Violence: 8 scenes, extremely violent. Profanity: 138 harsh expressions. Drugs: 17 scenes with smoking, 12 scenes with drinking.
Shadow of the Vampire (R)
Director: E. Elias Merhige. With Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, Catherine McCormack, Udo Keir, Eddie
Izzard, Cary Elwes. (91 min.)

Sterritt *** This inventive comic nightmare looks at the making of the 1921 horror classic "Nosferatu," but instead of taking a straightforward historical approach, it posits the whimsical idea that the Dracula character was portrayed by a real vampire whose price for taking the part was a bite of the leading lady's neck. Malkovich is wryly amusing as  German director F.W. Murnau, and Dafoe steals the show as a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire.
Staff *** Dark, witty, nostalgic, Dafoe is best Dracula in decades.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes, including nudity. Violence: 5 scenes, not terribly graphic. Profanity: 13 expressions both harsh and mild. Drugs: 9 scenes with smoking, 3 with drinking, and 4 scenes with drugs.
Shallow Hal (PG-13)
Directors: Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly. With Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow. (110 min.)

Sterritt ** The main character is a self-absorbed businessman who judges women by their physical beauty, until a self-help guru makes him blind to everything but a person's inner worth. Under this spell, Hal thinks overweight Rosemary is gorgeous until reality kicks in again, causing him to see her as others do. He hurts her badly, decides he loves her anyway,... and you can guess the rest. Paltrow wears a fat suit for some of Rosemary's scenes, but usually we view her through Hal's idealizing eyes, contradicting the movie's effort to convey an enlightened message about seeing people for what they are instead of how they look. In all, this comedy is sheer compromise, only half as funny and constructive as it wants to be.
Shampoo (R)
Director: Hal Ashby. With Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant, Jack Warden, Carrie
Fisher. (112 min.)

Sterritt ** Beatty plays a woman-chaser who goes into the hairdressing business for its romantic possibilities, but manages to lose all his favorite lovers on a single fateful night. He and Robert Towne cowrote the screenplay for this popular 1975 comedy, aiming for an ambitious blend of sexual and political satire that the finished product doesn't quite pull off.
Shrek (PG-13)


Page 123 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Directors: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson. With voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, Vincent Cassel. (90 min.)

Sterritt *** An amiable ogre, a talkative donkey, and a domineering princess set off on a fairy-tale quest that brings out the hidden decency of the ugly- looking monster and the inner beauty of his royal companion. The story has rollicking moments and the visuals are amazingly realistic, filling the screen with authentic effects - eagerly dancing flames, smoothly flowing water,  finely detailed facial expressions
- that animators could only approximate before computer-generated imagery entered their tool kit. Don't expect a great cartoon on the level of "Toy Story" or the old Disney classics, but animation fans will find a generous amount of fun.

Irreverent, fairytale turned inside out, fabulous animation. Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: 4 mild. Drugs: None. Sidewalks of New York (R)
Director: Edward Burns. With Edward Burns, Heather Graham, Stanley Tucci, Brittany Murphy. (107 min.)

Staff * Edward Burns is a charming actor and colorful writer, but his latest film lacks an anchor and a rudder. The aimless film drifts between the confusions, romantic liaisons, and infidelities of an assorted group of New Yorkers - a waitress, an unfaithful husband, an egotistical TV show host, and a hotel doorman. It's all meant to give an insight into the complexities of love, but, by the film's end, even Burns admits that he doesn't have any answers. So why bother? By Stephen Humphries

Sex/Nudity: 46 scenes with frank sex talk, 4 scenes with sex. Violence: 1 mild scene. Profanity: 99 harsh expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with alcohol, 1 scenes with smoking.
Signs & Wonders (Not rated)
Director: Jonathan Nossiter. With Stellan Skarsgard, Charlotte Rampling, Debra Kara Unger. (108 min.) Sterritt *** Portents and premonitions play important parts in the life of the main character, a Danish
businessman living in Athens with his Greek-American wife, but they cause more confusion than
enlightenment when an illicit love affair starts wreaking havoc with his marriage. The director of "Sunday"
has crafted another unusual and imaginative drama.
Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine (Not rated)
Director: Bahman Farmanara. With Bahman Farmanara, Roya Nonahali, Reza Kianian, Valiyollah
Shirandami, Hossien Kasbian (93 min.)

Sterritt *** Farmanara plays the hero of this semiautiobiographical drama about a filmmaker who's gloomy because censorship pressures are preventing him from making a new film. So he embarks on a documentary about funeral customs, which makes him gloomier than ever until the satisfaction of energizing his imagination brings rewards that renew his affection for the world. Like the experiences of its hero, this understated Iranian drama affirms life as vigorously as it provokes thought. In Farsi with English subtitles
Snatch (R)

Director: Guy Ritchie. With Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham. (104 min.)

Staff **1/2 He's known as "the husband of Madonna," but can Guy Ritchie direct? Yes! Ritchie's flashy command of the film medium is used to audacious effect in this gangster comedy which centers around attempts to snatch a 65-carat diamond. If the film is too similar to Ritchie's first movie, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" with its multiple story lines, complex plotting, and double-crossing antics, it's at least colorfully told with dialogue that shines with the inventive slang of Ritchie's screenplay. Violent, but Quentin Tarantino fans will enjoy it. By Stephen Humphries
Staff *** A motley crew of characters, fast-paced, great cinematography, dizzying.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes with nudity. 1 incident of innuendo. Violence: 23 brutal scenes including amputation and boxing matches. Profanity: 171 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 5 scenes with smoking, 3 with drinking.

Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4 p.m. (Not rated)
Director: Claude Lanzmann. With Yehuda Lerner.(95 min.)

Sterritt **** A feature-length interview with a Holocaust survivor who escaped from no fewer than eight Nazi strongholds and then participated in a Jewish rebellion against the overlords of the lethal Sobibor death camp. The conversation was shot in 1979 as part of Lanzmann's research for "Shoah," his
nine-hour masterpiece on the Holocaust, and has now been fashioned into a rigorous and riveting stand-alone film. In Hebrew, French, and  German with English subtitles
So Close to Paradise (Not rated)
Director: Wang Xiaoshuai. With Wang Tong, Shi Yu, Guo Tao, Wu Tao. (90 min.)
Sterritt *** Shanghai is the setting of this sociologically revealing tale about two rural men who move to
the big city, take different paths toward what they hope will be happy lives - one as a worker, the other as
a crook - and find themselves at odds when a kidnapping scheme goes in wildly unexpected directions.
Strong acting and no-nonsense filmmaking lend interest and impact to the dramatic story. In Mandarin
with English subtitles
Someone Like You (PG-13)

Director: Tony Goldwyn. With Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei, Ellen Barkin. (93 min.)

Staff *1/2 Any attempt to reinvent the romantic comedy is welcome, but this Ashley Judd vehicle can't quite wrest itself from the genre's conventions. Judd plays a single woman who gets dumped by a Lothario in sheep's clothing (Kinnear). Stung, she adopts a pseudonym for a woman's magazine and begins to serialize her theories about why men can't commit by observing her roommate (Jackman), a king of one- night stands. Judd is winsome, but wearisome ruminations about relationships are no substitute for plot. By Stephen Humphries
Staff ** Sweet, singles-esqe, refreshing, believable, never quite jells, lacks chemistry

Sex/Nudity: 4 sex scenes of mostly innuendo and frank talk. Violence: None. Profanity: 23 expressions, mostly harsh. Drugs: 7 instances of drinking.
Southern Comfort (Not rated)
Director: Kate Davis. With Robert Eads, Lola Cola, Max Eads. (90 min.)

Sterritt *** Nonfiction portrait of a Georgia farmer who gave birth to and raised two children, then became a male through sex- change surgery and settled down to a quiet life in a rural community where transgendered people aren't exactly common. This capably made HBO documentary takes an understated and compassionate look at a subject that is often sensationalized in other contexts.
Spy Game (R)
Director: Tony Scott. With Brad Pitt, Robert Redford, Catherine McCormack, Omid Jalili. (126 min.) Staff ** On the verge of retirement, veteran CIA man Nathan Muir (Redford) discovers that his protege
Tom Bishop (Pitt) is about to be executed in China. Worse, the CIA aren't going to save their operative.
While trying to mount a covert rescue operation, Muir stalls for time by telling his superiors about how he
trained Bishop. These flashback scenes, though an intriguing indictment of the CIA's methods, detract
from the tension of the main story. But Redford's old-school charm will keep audiences engaged. By
Stephen Humphries
Staff **1/2 Well edited, engaging, fast.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes of innuendo. Violence: 13 scenes, fairly intense. Profanity: 34 harsh expressions. Drugs: 7 scenes with smoking, 7 scenes with alcohol.
Spy Kids (PG)
Director: Robert Rodriguez. With Antonio Banderas, George Clooney, Alan Cumming, Carla Gugino, Teri
Hatcher, Cheech Marin, Robert Patrick, Tony Shaloub. (93 min.)

thrust into a high-tech world of spies and skullduggery, complete with a movie full of goofy but imaginative hardware, including cars that can both float and fly and the niftiest jetpack of any recent spy flick. With bright colors and child-friendly names and settings, the movie definitely skews toward the under-10 set. By Gloria Goodale

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 12 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: None. Drugs: 2 instances with drinking.
Startup.com (R)
Director: Jehane Noujaim. With Chris Hedegus. (103 min.) Staff ***1/2
This fast-paced documentary follows the mercurial partnership of two longtime friends as they found a dotcom during the height of the internet gold rush. Startup.com epitomizes the Icarus mentality of the late
1990s, with numerous dotcom cliches becoming exquisite dark humor for the audience that knows the stock market "correction" is just around the corner. The film is ably edited and has a superb soundtrack, though the handheld camerawork can be dizzying. By Ben Arnoldy
Staff ***
Dark humor, makes you forget you're watching a documentary, well- edited. Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: None. Profanity: 28 harsh. Drugs: None.
State and Maine

Director: David Mamet. William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, David Paymer, Julia Stiles, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker. (102 min.)
Sterritt ***

A movie crew barges into a New England village with a lot of problems to solve before their production takes wing. How do you make a picture called 'The Old Mill' in a town with no old mill? Will the lecherous leading man keep a respectful distance from the local schoolgirls? And what will become of the nude scene now that the star refuses to get nude? Mamet's screenplay is full of savvy satire and the cast couldn't be better.
Staff ***
Thoroughly entertaining, it's like 'Day for Night' but with love, scattered.

Sex/Nudity: 8 instances of innuendo and drawings of nudes. Violence: 2 scenes, fish hook caught in finger and car crash Profanity: 33 expressions, both mild and harsh. Drugs: 7 scenes with drinking, 6 scenes with smoking.
States of Control (Not rated)

Director: Zack Winestine. With Jennifer van Dyck, John Cunningham, Ellen Greene, Stephen Bogardus. (85 min.)
Sterritt **

Married to a sexually dysfunctional man and discontented with her work as a small-time actress, a woman mulls over increasingly radical ideas for some explosive gesture that will change the course of her life. The acting is ordinary and the story's basic idea is naive, but Winestine conjure up enough involving moments to create some drama.
Strange Fits of Passion (Not rated)
Director: Elise McCredie. With Michela Noonan, Mitchell Butel, Samuel Johnson. (80 min.) Sterritt **
The title comes from an 18th-century poem by William Wordsworth, which is fitting, since the main character is a literature fan who works in a bookstore while plotting ways to bring some romance into her life. This modest comedy- drama relies too much on stereotypes, from the self-absorbed modern poet to the gay best friend, but Noonan's earnest performance makes much of it worth watching.

Sugar and Spice (PG-13)
Director: Francine McDougall. With Mena Suvari, Sean Young, James Marsden, Marla Sokoloff, Rachel
Blanchard. (76 min.)

Staff *1/2 When head cheerleader Diane (Shelton) meets the new quarterback, it's love at first sight. Soon they find themselves in a family way, and their parents disown them. To help their now- impoverished captain, the pep squad agrees to a "crafts project," robbing Diane's after-school employer, a bank. Spirited performances move the plot along briskly. But it's disappointing to see a movie written, produced, and directed by women who give only farcical treatment to teen pregnancy and crime. Also, the all-white casting displays an amazing lack of social awareness. By M.K. Terrell

Sex/Nudity: 6 incidents of innuendo. Violence: 4 scenes including a tussle and gunfire. Profanity: 67 expressions, both harsh and mild. Drugs: 3 scenes with smoking, 1 with drinking.
Summer Catch (PG-13)
Director: Michael Tolin. With Freddie Prinze Jr., Jessica Biel, Bruce Davidson, Brian Dennehy. (108 min.) Staff ** Blue-collar hometown boy and pro lawn mower Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prince Jr.) has big-league
aspirations. It's summertime on Cape Cod, and when he's not mowing the lawn of his rich girlfriend,
Tenley Parish (Jessica Biel), he's playing on a Cape League baseball team. Saddled with troubles in his
family and a huge lack of belief in himself, Ryan strives to take Tenley's advice, "allow yourself to
succeed," and make his dreams come true. This story about falling in love and finding yourself has its
share of bad acting. But "Summer Catch" turns out to be a well-meaning, light, and fluffy comedy with
plenty of good giggles. By Deborah Henderson
A Summer's Tale (Not rated)
Director: Eric Rohmer. With Melvil Poupaud, Amanda Langlet, Aurelia Nolin, Aime Lefevre. (114 min.) Sterritt *** A young musician and three enticing romantic opportunities are at the center of this amiable
comedy about love and youth. Rohmer's screenplay is on the slender side, but the seaside settings and
summer-struck cinematography are ravishing, and the director shows his usual blend of affection and
compassion for his footloose characters. In French with English subtitles
Sweet November (PG-13)

Director: Pat O'Connor. With Charlize Theron, Keanu Reeves, Greg  Germann, Lauren Graham. (120 min.)

Staff ** The sweetest thing about "Sweet November" (a remake of the 1968 movie) is the on-screen magic between Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. But that's pretty much where the magic ends. Although Theron gives one of her most credible performances to date, neither actor can completely drop his/her Hollywood image and internalize a character. The actress portrays the role of charming Sara Deever who is dying of a diagnosed disease. Committed to an alternative lifestyle, she convinces emotionally void workaholic Nelson Moss (Reeves) to live with her for 30 days, and the agreement quickly progresses into an unlikely romance. By Steven Savides
Staff ** Charming performers, anti-climactic, banal, sappy, uninvolving.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo, 3 scenes of implied sex, no nudity. Violence: None. Profanity: 36 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 7 scenes with alcohol.
Swordfish (R)
Director: Dominic Sena. With John Travolta. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle. (97 min.)

Staff * "Swordfish" is an action-thriller of the car-chase/ gunplay/misogynistic variety. Travolta plays the head of an organization of ruthless terrorists trying to rob a  bank. Hackman plays a computer hacker who can stop them. It all ends with a bus dangling precariously from a helicopter. (Don't ask!) By Stephen Humphries
Staff * Mindless, ridiculous plot, weak dialogue.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes with nudity, 1 with sex, 4 with innuendo. Violence: 14 scenes, including bullet wounds. Profanity: 61 harsh expressions. Drugs: 11 scenes with smoking, 5 scenes with drinking.
That Obscure Object of Desire (Not rated)

Page 127 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Luis Bunuel. With Fernando Rey, Carole Bouquet, Angela Molina, Andre Weber. (103 min.)

Sterritt **** A wealthy businessman, a beautiful maid who stays just outside his reach, and a background of revolutionary rumblings are among the ingredients of this 1977 masterpiece. Cinema's greatest surrealist is at the peak of his powers in the last movie of his unparalleled career, telling a deliciously dreamlike tale with the ease and wit of a master stylist who knows how to entertain us, unsettle us, and astonish us at the same time. His most celebrated gambit here is having the servant Conchita played by two different actresses, not to reveal different sides of her personality, but to discombobulate the notion that personalities can be comprehended in the first place. This is a classic in the fullest sense. In French with English subtitles
The Tailor of Panama (R)

Director: John Boorman. With Geoffrey Rush, Pierce Brosnan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Brendon Gleeson. (110 min.)

Sterritt ** Brosnan plays a spy who's sent to Panama and Rush plays a con artist who uses his profession - tailor to the rich and famous - as a front for more slippery activities. The movie strains too hard to seem smart and savvy, though, with touches of offbeat filmmaking that suggest a mood of unpredictable fun but prove to be a momentary sideshow.
Staff ** Implausible plot, too heavy, Rush is great.

Sex/Nudity: 12 scenes, including some innuendo and brief sex scenes with seminudity. Violence: 4 scenes, including some beatings and rioting. Profanity: 48 mostly harsh expressions. Drugs: 18 scenes with smoking and/or drinking.
Tape (R)
Director: Richard Linklater. With Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Robert Sean Leonard. (86 min.)

Sterritt *** A small-time filmmaker, a self-deluded drug dealer, and a rising young lawyer meet in a motel room 10 years after their high-school graduation, and smoldering old conflicts soon disrupt their friendly get-together. This offbeat comedy-drama is written like a play - three characters, one setting - but Linklater keeps it lively with imaginative camerawork and razor-sharp editing. There's little to like about the trio of people he lays bare for us, but their secrets have a morbid fascination that's hard to resist.
The Taste of Others (Not rated)

Director: Agnes Jaoui. With Agnes Jaoui, Alain Chabat, Anne Alvaro, Gerard Lanvin, Jean-Pierre Bacri. (112 min.)

Sterritt *** Why does affection sometimes grow between people who seem to have little or nothing in common? That's the tantalizing question running through this capably acted comedy-drama about a jaded businessman who falls in love with an actress the first time he sees her onstage. The movie
doesn't reach any startling conclusions, but it takes an entertaining look at the social and romantic issues its story brings up. In French with English subtitles
Thirteen Days (PG-13)
Director: Roger Donaldson. With Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp, Dylan Baker, Henry
Strozier, Len Cariou, Frank Wood. (120 min.)

Sterritt *** This impeccably produced docu-drama revisits the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, with Costner as a White House aide who coaches the Kennedy brothers through the worst of it. The subject is so gripping that you almost forgive the filmmakers for skewing their material in order to keep Costner's pretty face at the center of everything. Greenwood and Culp are excellent as the president and his brother.
Staff *** Awful Boston accent by Costner, Greenwood is phenomenal as JFK, gripping.

Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 3 war scenes including plane being shot down. Drugs: 15 scenes with cigarettes. 5 scenes with alcohol.
13 Ghosts (R)

Director: Steve Beck. With Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davitz, F. Murray Abraham, Shannon Elizabeth. (90 min.)


Page 128 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt * A single dad with two kids inherits a house populated with multiple spooks, each trapped its own chamber by magic spells. Pandemonium soon breaks out. The thriller's one good performance is given
by the house, full of ominous inscriptions, inscrutable corridors, and fiendish machines that stump even the ghost-friendly experts who join the family there.
3000 Miles to Graceland (R)
Director: Demian Lichtenstein. With Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell, Christian Slater, Courtney
Cox-Arquette, Howie Long, David Kaye. (115 min.)

Staff * Kevin Costner trades in his good-guy image to play an evil- minded criminal who's obsessed with Elvis. What better way to use it than as a disguise to steal millions of dollars? During a national Elvis convention in Las Vegas, ex-cons Costner and Kurt Russell (and a few thugs) dress up as the King, pull guns from their bag, and shoot everyone in sight. They get the loot, but it's a bloody mess. And the movie's twists and turns are nonsensical and mindless. If you make it to the end, you'll laugh at how bad it is. The movie's comical moments with the young David Kaye as Cox-Arquette's streetwise son save it from being a "dud." By Lisa Leigh Parney
Tigerland (R)
Director: Joel Schumacher. With Colin Farrell, Matthew Davis, Clifton Collins Jr., Tom Guiry. (100 min.) Staff *** "Tigerland," the nickname of a harrowing training ground in Louisiana, is an unconventional war
movie. It takes place late in the Vietnam War (1971) and never even leaves the United States. The story
revolves around rebel soldier Bozz - played by dazzling newcomer Colin Farrell - who helps a few
troubled souls get discharged from the military. Director Schumacher, known for slick Hollywood flicks
like "Batman and Robin," employs a handheld camera technique which creates a memorable, involving,
and in-your-face movie. By Lisa Leigh Parney
Time and Tide (R)

Director: Tsui Hark. With Nicholas Tse, Wu Bai, Anthony Wong, Candy Lo, Joventino Couto Remotigue. (111 min.)
Sterritt **

A young bodyguard and a former mercenary soldier cope with challenges of marriage and impending parenthood, as well as a murder plot that ensnares them in complicated ways. Tsui is a legendary leader of Hong Kong's internationally popular action-movie scene, which thrives more on visual pyrotechnics than on the depth of its stories. Its visual strengths and dramatic weaknesses are on clear display in this flashy but uninvolving crime thriller. In Cantonese and Mandarin with English subtitles
Together (R)

Director: Lukas Moodysson. With Lisa Lindgren, Michael Nyqvist, Gustav Hammarsten, Anja Lundqvist. (106 min.)

Sterritt *** The setting is a commune near Stockholm in the 1970s, the characters are aspiring nonconformists of assorted ages and genders, and the story is a loosely strung series of incidents geared more to conveying an atmosphere than absorbing us in situations. The result is an amiable look at a bygone time and a set of ideas about the world that once held far more power and magic than it does today. In Swedish with English subtitles.
Tomb Raider (PG-13)
Director: Simon West. With Angelina Jolie, Jon Voight, Daniel Craig, Iain Glenn. (80 min.)

Staff DUD Are Hollywood movies being dumbed down? On the evidence of "Tomb Raider," the answer would have to be in the affirmative. The plotline has young British archaeologist Lara Croft (Jolie) traversing the planet's ancient temples in search of keys that control time and space. The story stays true to the movie's video- game roots - but that's not a compliment. "Tomb Raider" isn't a story as much as it
is a show reel of circus stunts inside elaborate sets. Jolie is charismatic and looks the part of the video-game heroine, but she does little more than fight robots and ancient mummies that come alive. (Yes, the movie is that derivative.) By Stephen Humphries

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes of partial nudity - male and female. Violence: 11 scenes. Profanity: 10 mostly mild expressions. Drugs: 1 scene with smoking.
Tomcats (R)
Page 129 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Director: Gregory Poirer. With Jerry O'Connell, Shannon Elizabeth, Jake Busey, Horation Sanz. (92 min.)

Staff DUD If you dig deep through the garbage of sexist jokes and other forms of movie 'ick' that you'll find in the dumpster called "Tomcats," you may smell the excuse for fitting so much nastiness into 90 minutes. In the story, seven simple-minded friends set aside prize money for the last man to resist marriage. When Michael (O'Connell) needs to pay off a debt, he tries to get his pig of a friend to commit first. Given the standards of his friend, you can imagine those of the movie. By Christy Ellington

Sex/Nudity: 32 scenes of very graphic innuendo and sex scenes. Violence: 6 scenes. Profanity: 77 expressions, many harsh. Drugs: 10 instances of drinking.
Too Much Sleep (Not rated)
Director: David Maquiling. With Marc Palmieri, Nicol Zanzarella, Pasquale Gaeta. (88 min.) Sterritt **
A highly embarrassed security guard mounts a furtive search for his stolen gun, and learns more than he wanted to know about the sleaze and silliness lurking within his outwardly bland New Jersey town. The movie's concept is amusing, but much of the acting and dialogue is as uninspired as the story's deliberately bland suburban setting.
Town and Country (R)
Director: Peter Chelsom. With Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Gary Shandling, Goldie Hawn, Andie
McDowell. (106 min.)

Staff **1/2 Mona and Griffin, Ellie and Porter are the "oldest friends." But when Mona (Hawn) discovers her husband is cheating on her with a redhead, she sets off a domino effect of midlife crises within the group of friends. Marital commitments are thrown to the wind as the two couples draw the battle lines for the kind of nasty divorce settlements that result when Fifth Avenue apartments and Sun Valley hallets are at stake. There are so many twists and turns in this light-hearted, sometimes hilarious, comedy that it's a wonder they are untangled by the movie's end. By Katie Nesse
Training Day (R)

Director: Antoine Fuqua. With Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg. (120 min.)

Staff *** The first day on any job can be a nerve-wracking experience for anyone, but nothing can prepare ordinary cop Jake Hoyt (Hawke) for what he endures on his "training day" as he shadows a veteran narcotics cop (Washington) through the underbelly of Los Angeles. Aided by superb performers, director Fuqua has fashioned a gripping thriller in which both moral and immoral actions have consequences. By Stephen Humphries
Staff *** Sweaty, disturbing, a moral struggle.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of implied sex, 1 scene with nudity. Violence: 12 often gory scenes. Profanity: 268 harsh expressions. Drugs: 4 scenes of alcohol, 9 scenes with cigarettes, 2 scenes with drugs.
Trumpet of the Swan (Not Rated)

Directed by Richard Smith. With the voices of Jason Alexander, Mary Steenburgen, Seth Green. (75 min.)
Staff ***

In a newly animated version of the E.B. White children's classic, an all-star cast of voices, including the legendary Little Richard, brings jazzy new life to the story of a mute swan who finds his voice through music. For those whose memory of the book renders the story in gentle hues and tones, the animation may be a bit bouncy. But the jazz soundtrack by well-known jazz producer Marcus Miller will appeal to the next generation, who deserves to become familiar with this story of adolescent triumph over adversity. By Gloria Goodale
The Turandot Project (Not rated)
Director: Allan Miller. With Zhang Yimou, Zubin Mehta. (87 min.)



Page 130 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sterritt ** Renowned conductor Mehta and celebrated filmmaker Zhang combined their talents to create a unique production of Puccini's opera "Turandot," first in Italy and then in China, where they ran into
artistic and bureaucratic challenges they hadn't anticipated. Things worked out well in the end, and this attractively shot documentary of the production tells how the gifted duo managed to pull it off. Music buffs may wish there were a lot more Puccini and a little less talking-head chitchat, though. In English and in Mandarin and Italian with English subtitles
Under the Sand (Not rated)

Director: Francois Ozon. With Charlotte Rampling, Bruno Cremer, Alexandra Stewart, Jacques Nolot. (95 min.)
Sterritt ***

After her husband tragically vanishes during a vacation trip, a middle-aged woman sustains her loss by imagining him as an ongoing presence in her everyday life. Rampling's superb performance and Ozon's unexpectedly subtle cinematic style lend emotional power and psychological depth to this gently filmed French drama. In French with English subtitles
Va Savoir (PG-13)
Director: Jacques Rivette. With Jeanne Balibar, Jacques Bonaffe, Helene de Fougerolles, Sergio
Castellitto, Catherine Rouvel, Claude Berri. (150 min.)

Sterritt **** Back in Paris after three years with an Italian theater group, a French actress wavers between an old flame and her current boyfriend, who's obsessed with finding the manuscript of a long-lost play. Lots more happens in this magical movie, which has brilliant fun with the contrasts
between film and theater, love and infatuation, reality and fantasy. Don't let the 2-1/2-hour running time put you off. It's a delight from beginning to end, and a triumphant return to glory for Rivette, one of French film's most towering talents. In French with English subtitles
Valentine (R)

Director: Jamie Blanks. With Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Jessica Capshaw, Marley Shelton, Katherine Heigl. (96 min.)

Sterritt * A masked murderer stalks a series of women, and if you can't figure out the killer's identity at least 20 minutes before the end, pay more attention to "Scream" the next time you see it. The
slasher-movie genre may never die, but can't its perpetrators think up variations more clever than this by-the-numbers rehash?
Staff 1/2 The victims refuse to follow common sense in these movies, gruesome, no-brainer

Sex/Nudity: 4 scenes with nudity on a TV screen, partial nudity through a shower curtain and 2 scenes with innuendo. Violence: 14 scenes including multiple gory murders by a serial killer. Profanity: 41 expressions, mostly harsh. Drugs: 10 scenes with alcohol.
Vatel (PG-13)
Director: Roland Jaffe. With Gerard Depardieu, Uma Thurman, Timothy Spall, Arielle Dombasle, Julian
Sands, Julian Glover. (119 min.)

Sterritt ** An aristocrat's servant gets the assignment of a lifetime - honoring King Louis XIV with a personally prepared banquet - and complications ensue in every area from food and drink to love and money. Depardieu gives the story a firm center of gravity aided by Joffe's eye for colorful settings and period detail.
The Vertical Ray of the Sun (PG-13)

Director: Tran Anh Hung. With Tran Nu Yen-Khe, Nguyen Nhu Quynh, Le Khanh, Ngo Quang Hai. (112 min.)

Sterritt *** The emotional dynamics of a Vietnamese family are the focus of this exquisitely filmed drama about two married women, their unsettled young sister, and the challenges of living an individualistic life in a closely intertwined clan. Tran is Vietnam's most internationally respected filmmaker, and here he taps once more into a long tradition of richly understated Asian cinema stretching from Yasujiro Ozu to Hou Hsiao-hsien and beyond. The cinematography is gorgeous from first frame to last, but the story occasionally rings false, and Tran repeats the tendency he showed in "Cyclo" and "The Scent of Green Papayas" to favor artful images over dramatic momentum. In Vietnamese with English subtitles

The Visit (Not rated)

Director: Jordan Walker-Pearlman. With Hill Harper, Rae Dawn Chong, Obba Babatunde, Marla Gibbs, Billy Dee Williams, Phylicia Rashad. (107 min.)
Sterritt ** Diagnosed with illness and imprisoned for a crime he swears he didn't commit, an
African-American man copes with visits from ambivalent relatives, an old friend with her own problems to
conquer, and a psychiatrist who wants to help him come to terms with his difficult life. The film's touches
of unconventional style interfere with its emotional effectiveness at times, and some of the eclectic music
score is downright distracting. The drama has a welcome air of seriousness and sincerity, though.
Voyages (Not rated)
Director: Abraham Finkiel. With Shulamit Adar, Liliane Rovere, Esther Gorintin, Natan Cogan. (111 min.) Sterritt *** Three aging women in three different countries come to grips with their heritage as Jews from
Eastern  Europe, where the Holocaust decimated their early lives. Finkiel's filmmaking is so careful and
cautious that it becomes plodding at times. The theme is powerful, though, and the movie's sincerity
overrides its heavy- handed tendencies. In Yiddish and French with English subtitles
Waking Life (R)
Director: Richard Linklater. With Wiley Wiggins, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke, Steven Soderbergh. (99 min.) Sterritt *** This offbeat animation centers on a young man who's having the most vivid dream you can
imagine - and possibly a permanent one, since every time he wakes up, this turns out to be part of the
dream. Will he ever find his way back to waking life? Or is human existence a dream in the first place,
with so-called sleep a gateway to liberating mental alternatives? The screenplay is crammed with
conversations, often invoking philosophy and theology. Linklater is better at playing with concepts than
synthesizing them. But few American filmmakers put more faith in the ability of words to stimulate mind
and heart.
The Wedding Planner (PG-13)

Director: Adam Schankman. With Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Kevin Pollack. (102 min.)

Staff DUD A professional wedding planner (Lopez) despairs that she will never find the right man, until, that is, she finds herself drawn to the groom (McConaughey) of a nuptial celebration that she is organizing. Does the girl get the guy? Well, of course. But the truly dreadful dialogue, absurd plot contrivances, heavy-handed direction, and a score that sounds like an amateur high school pep band stifle any potential that this courtship might have had of succeeding. As long as audiences settle for sloppy and substandard fare like this, Hollywood will keep spoon-feeding them more pap like it. Vote with your wallet. By Stephen Humphries
Staff ** Romance-lite, predictable but romantic, mildly diverting.

Sex/Nudity: 3 scenes of innuendo, one of them fairly graphic. Violence: None. Profanity: 27 expressions, a few of them harsh. Drugs: 1 scene with smoking, 8 with drinking.
Werckmeister Harmonies (Not rated)
Director: Bela Tarr. With Lars Rudolph, Hanna Schygulla, Peter Fitz. (145 min.)

Sterritt **** Apocalypse is in the air as the residents of a poor Hungarian town cope with their unhappy lives, engage in petty disputes, and await the arrival of an enigmatic prince who travels with a wandering circus and may have a redeeming message to reveal. Tarr wants to stir the imagination and awaken the conscience of his audience rather than divert us with easy entertainment, so be ready for another of his dense, meditative parables filmed in long, slow- moving shots. This is as challenging as movies come, alluding to everything from philosopher Thomas Hobbes to the history of Western music. But compared with Tarr's legendary "Satantango," which clocks in at seven hours, it's almost a quickie. In Hungarian with English subtitles
What's The Worst That Can Happen? (PG-13)

Staff ** Crooked millionaire Max Fairbanks (DeVito) catches Kevin Caffrey (Lawrence) burglarizing his beach front mansion. Max persuades the police that Kevin's "lucky" ring is his own. The rest of the movie charts Kevin's dogged attempts to retrieve his ring, but the filmmakers run out of ideas long before the final freeze frame. By M.K. Terrell
Page 132 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Staff * Unoriginal, poorly written, loses its way.

Sex/Nudity: 1 scene of implied sex, 10 with innuendo. Violence: 4 scenes of comic violence. Profanity: 86 expressions. Drugs: 6 scenes with drinking, 5 scened with smoking.
When Brendan Met Trudy (Not rated)
Director: Kieron J. Walsh. With Peter McDonald, Flora Montgomery, Marie Mullen, Pauline McLynn, Don
Wicherley. (95 min.)

Sterritt ** He's a quiet schoolteacher who spends his time singing hymns and watching old movies, and she's a lively young woman with a secret life that takes her new boyfriend totally by surprise. McDonald and Montgomery are fun to watch in this mildly amusing Irish romantic comedy.
The Widow of Saint-Pierre (Not rated)

Director: Patrice Leconte. With Juliette Binoche, Daniel Auteuil, Emir Kusturica, Philippe Magnan. (108 min.)

Sterritt *** A condemned man develops a complex relationship with a mid-18th- century military commander and his wife as they wait for a guillotine to arrive on their tiny French-controlled island, so
that his death sentence can be carried out. Leconte reconfirms his growing importance to French cinema with this precisely crafted, marvelously acted drama, which makes a powerful statement on capital punishment.
The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (Not rated)
Directors: Charles Broune Jr., Joel Holt. With Jayne Mansfield, Mickey Hargitay. (90 min.) Sterritt * Oddity alert! Made in 1968, not long after Mansfield's death, this tacky exploitation flick
combines promotional footage shot during the actress's career - most of it during a  European
sightseeing tour - with coy shots of "shocking" material (stripteases, drag queens) and a
minidocumentary about the car crash that ended her life. The results are unbelievably tedious, but
Mansfield buffs may find it intermittently worthwhile.
With a Friend Like Harry... (R)
Director: Dominik Moll. With Laurent Lucas, Sergi Lopez, Mathilde Seigner, Sophie Guillemin. (117 min.) Sterritt *** With a friend like Harry you don't need enemies, and with a foreign movie like this - a startling,
suspenseful ride few will forget in a hurry - you don't need Hollywood pictures. Lopez is perfect as an
off-kilter old friend who barges into the life of a high-school pal and starts doing shady, violent favors that
nobody ever asked him for. Moll mingles mystery with humor in just the right proportions. The result is a
pitch-dark tragicomedy that deserves the often-abused adjective "Hitchcockian."
In French with English subtitles
Staff **1/2 Often funny, intense, absorbing. The Young Girl and the Monsoon (Not rated)
Director: James Ryan. With Terry Kinney, Ellen Muth, Milio Avital, Domenick Lombardozzi. (90 min.)

Sterritt ** A well-meaning photojournalist and his 13-year-old child navigate the challenges of single fatherhood and adolescent insecurity. The dad tries to be a sophisticated New Yorker while hiding his mercurial love life from his impressionable kid, and the daughter wonders how she's supposed to learn about life when her father would rather evade her questions than soothe her uncertainties. This likable comedy-drama gets most of its oomph from acting that reveals the psychological shortcomings of the characters with wit and insight.
Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras (Not rated)
Directors: Mike Lyddon, Will Frank, Karl DeMolay. With Matt James, Lorelei Fuller, Jason Deas. (75 min.) Sterritt * You guessed it, zombies wreak havoc on the New Oreleans festival, which is photographed in
grainy black-and-white images that make it hard to distinguish from the movie's pure fantasy elements.
Fans of unregenerate underground moviemaking will have a ball, and there's a creepy charm to the
picture's proudly homemade quality. Look for lots of sex and gore, but it's shot with such deliberate

amateurishness that viewers will spend less time being shocked than trying to figure out what's on screen.
Zoolander (PG-13)
Director: Ben Stiller. With Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller. (95 min.) Staff ** Imagine a collision between "Austin Powers" and "Dumb and Dumber" inside the world of fashion
catwalks, and you'll have a fair idea of the tone of "Zoolander." The loose plot - it's more of a concept,
actually - has Ben Stiller starring as the world's most famous supermodel who becomes unwittingly
embroiled in a plot to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The hit-and-miss jokes play like a "Saturday
Night Live" sketch, but there are laughs aplenty. By Stephen Humphries
Staff **1/2 Zany, juvenile, uneven.

Sex/Nudity: 2 scenes of implied sex, 1 scene with innuendo. Violence: 13 scenes of cartoonish violence. Profanity: 19 expressions, sometimes harsh. Drugs: 6 scenes with drinking, 1 scene with smoking, 2 scenes with drugs. (c) Copyright 2001. The Christian Science Monitor

Air China May Bring

TD
A Strategic Investor
On Board, Plans IPO

Air China plans to bring a strategic investor on board, a move that would accelerate the integration of China's vibrant travel market with the global airline industry. The government-owned carrier has the biggest international market share among the nation's carriers and the top position in Beijing, its home base. After years of sporadic preparation, Air China is moving to hold an initial public stock offering next year to catch up with rivals China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. These three carriers are emerging as the main participants in the continuing government-directed consolidation of China's airlines. Stock-market listings have given China Southern and China Eastern a lead on Air China in adapting to a competitive, profit-oriented environment, as is reflected in their superior financial performance and faster growth. Air China could get a leg up by bringing in a strategic investor, which neither of the other two has done.

Charges Against Suharto May Be Dropped
News that Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri may move to drop two-year-old corruption
charges against former President Suharto has some citizens worried that efforts to stop abuses of
power will never be put on her agenda. Through cabinet ministers and politicians, Ms. Megawati late last
week began signaling that she is considering seeking parliamentary approval for a legal measure, called
"abolition" in the Indonesian system, in which the  charge that faces the 80-year-old former leader would
be canceled. Authorities accused Mr. Suharto of illegal diversion of about $570 million from seven
charitable foundations that he led to businesses run by his family and close associates.
Taiwan to Be Observer on OECD Panel

Taiwan will be allowed to be an observer on a committee of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the government said Friday, a new victory in the island's campaign to build stronger ties with the rest of the world. Taipei was admitted to be an observer of the panel on competition law and policy in the OECD, a 30-member forum for developed nations to discuss economic and social policy, Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said. The government has sought for years to be an OECD observer, hoping that participating in the group eventually could clear the way for the island to become a full member.
Seoul to Sell 11.8% Stake in Telecom Firm

South Korea said it agreed to sell an 11.8% stake in KT, the nation's largest telecommunications concern, by issuing next month a $1.32 billion exchangeable bond and a separate bond with warrants, valued at $500 million, to Microsoft. The exchangeable bond, with a five-year maturity, will carry an

interest rate of 0.25%. The bonds will be issued to a select group of financial investors and can be converted to existing KT shares at a price of $23.96 apiece. The bond with warrants to the Redmond, Wash., software firm, with a three-year maturity, carry a higher interest of 4.3%.
Agency Orders Goldman to Halt Trading

Japanese regulators slapped brief suspension orders on some securities-trading operations of Goldman Sachs Group, in the brokerage firm's second round of punishments in Japan this year. The Financial Services Agency ordered Goldman to suspend proprietary stock trading, trading conducted for its own accounts, from tomorrow to Jan. 11. The penalty isn't particularly harsh, because most trading is conducted on behalf of clients. Japanese inspectors found three of Goldman's traders had failed to record accurately the sale of borrowed shares, known as short sales.

BASF Plans to Appeal $260 Million  Fine

BASF said Friday it will appeal a $260 million penalty imposed by the  European Commission last month for its part in a vitamin price-fixing  cartel. The chemicals giant noted that it had admitted responsibility for antitrust violations and said its appeal to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg was aimed solely at the "inappropriately high" level of the fine. BASF said it would take an additional $180 million  charge in the fourth quarter to cover the risk of an unsuccessful appeal. The  fine against the  German company was part of a record $752 million penalty levied against eight chemicals and pharmaceutical firms for fixing vitamin prices. BASF's was the second-highest  fine after the $406 million levied against Switzerland-based Roche Holding, which said it won't appeal its verdict and  fine.
Welch Is Hired as Consultant for Fiat

Former General Electric Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. has been hired as a consultant for Fiat, said the Italian auto maker's chairman, Paolo Fresco. Mr. Welch, who has served on Fiat's board for about a year and a half, will continue to hold that post. The terms of Fiat's current board expire in the spring of 2002. The details of Mr. Welch's consultancy contract, including its duration, haven't been finalized. "He will by and large advise us on strategy and [CEO Paolo Cantarella] on organization and people," Mr. Fresco said. Fiat has been plagued with a series of chronic losses at its core automotive division.
Sabena DAT Unit Is Sold for Single  Euro

Belgium's efforts to build a new airline from the remains of  bankrupt Sabena moved forward Friday as court administrators sold the national carrier's still-operating regional subsidiary, Delta Air Transport, to a group of local investors for a token  euro (90 U.S. cents). SN Airholding, which was established by prominent Belgian business figures, also is in talks with Virgin Group's Virgin Express, a Brussels-based budget airline, about commercial cooperation or even a merger, although those discussions remain at an early stage.
Tomkins, Former CEO Reach Settlement

Global engineering group Tomkins said Friday that it has reached an out-of-court settlement with its former chief executive, Greg Hutchings. The British firm said the terms are the release of 2.9 million shares held in Mr. Hutchings's company stock-option plan, a payment of GBP 500,000 ($724,800) to his pension, and a contribution to legal fees he incurred in relation to a suit he filed last spring in London's High Court. Tomkins and the executive also will withdraw all claims made against each other. Mr. Hutchings resigned in October 2000 following an investigation into the use of company assets.

Air Canada Agrees to Work-Sharing Plan

The Canadian Auto Workers union, Air Canada and Ottawa have agreed to a work-sharing program that will help preserve jobs at the carrier. CAW said the Canada Employment Insurance  Commission has approved the accord and that the plan will reduce Air Canada's surplus employment count by the equivalent of 427 positions. The union challenged at the Canada Industrial Relations Board the airline's planned 1,281 layoffs, and the result was a compromise requiring the Montreal concern to negotiate voluntary measures with CAW. Separately, Air Canada has completed an aircraft sale-leaseback deal providing about 565 million Canadian dollars (US$358 million) of new funding. The agreement with General Electric's GE Capital Aviation Services involves 16 Airbus A320 and one A319.
Mexican CPI Rises Less Than Expected

Diminishing demand and a strong  currency kept a lid on Mexican consumer prices in the first half of December, traditionally a month of spikes. The  Bank of Mexico said the consumer price index in the first two weeks of the month rose 0.16%, well below the 0.54% average forecast by seven economists. The central bank attributed the increase to rises in prices of gasoline, rents and some fruits and vegetables. Prices fell for other fresh produce and liquefied petroleum gas used for cooking and heating water. Core inflation, which excludes fresh fruit and vegetables, energy and education costs, climbed 0.15%.

NEW YORK (AP) - Consumer confidence rose sharply in December following three months of dramatic decline, as the erosion of the economy and job market appeared to begin leveling off.

The New York-based Conference Board said Friday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 93.7 this month from a revised 84.9 in November. Analysts were expecting a reading of 83. The original November reading was 82.2.

TD
The industry group's index, based on a monthly survey of some 5,000 U.S. households, is closely watched because consumer confidence drives consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The increase, she said, suggested that an economic recovery is possible by the middle of next year.

NEW YORK (AP) - A rebound in consumer confidence and surge in sales of homes and big-ticket consumer goods led a series of economic reports Friday that suggest the worst of the recession may be over.

The New York-based Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index climbed in December for the first time in six months to 93.7 from a revised 84.9 in November, the biggest monthly increase in nearly four years.
Separately Friday, the Commerce Department reported that new-homes sales soared by 6.4 percent in
November, the largest increase in almost a year, helped out by mild weather and low mortgage rates.

The Commerce Department also said orders for many big-ticket items, including appliances, autos and electronic equipment, posted solid gains in November.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - OPEC agreed Friday to carry out a planned 6 percent cut in its official oil output after crude producers outside the  cartel promised to make reciprocal cuts in a display of unprecedented - but fragile - solidarity.

Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided in an emergency meeting to slash the group's production target by 1.5 million barrels a day beginning Jan. 1 in a bid to bolster sagging world oil prices. The cuts are to last for at least six months.

The decision appears unlikely to have a major impact on the prices consumers pay for gasoline or heating oil. OPEC approved the cut in principle back in November, and energy markets have already factored it into current prices for crude and refined oil products.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Cash-hungry Argentines flooded  banks by the thousands on Friday, forming long lines and shouting for their money after the government eased a five-day  banking  holiday that shut off most routine financial transactions.

But a deep-rooted economic crisis continued to fuel anger and tension among depositors as the government kept up a month-old freeze limiting cash withdrawals. The government, meanwhile,  fine-tuned emergency plans to roll out a third  currency that is leaving many Argentines skeptical.

Interim President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa moved to finalize a congressional bill authorizing the creation of the "argentino" - a new money he says will breath new life into an economy suffocating under four years of recession.

FRANKFURT,  Germany (AP) - Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest  bank, said Friday it would cut 2,100 jobs in its corporate and investment banking  division, the latest round of cutbacks to hit  Germany's sluggish banking  sector.

The layoffs, which come on top of 7,100 already announced at the bank this year, will result in the elimination of 900 positions in the United States, 900 in mainland Europe, 350 in Britain and 250 in Asia, the Frankfurt-based  bank said.
All of Germany's four biggest  banks have announced cuts in staffing this year as they struggle to cope
with a slowing economy and with what analysts and the  banks themselves say are excessively high costs.

The bank reported a 48 percent plunge in net profits for the third quarter compared to the same period the year before, to $272 million.

TOKYO (AP) - In a sign of broadening instability in the Japanese financial system, a second-tier regional
bank declared itself insolvent on Friday, becoming the first such lender to go under in more than two years.

The Ishikawa  Bank in central Japan has applied with the Financial Services Agency to begin  bankruptcy proceedings, said Hakuo Yanagisawa, state minister in  charge of financial policy. The agency immediately appointed administrators to help the  bank restructure.

Ishikawa Bank, which has 65 branch offices and 709 employees, posted a loss of $183 million for the fiscal year ended in March.
Cleaning up the bad loans at Japanese  banks is one of the key promises for economic reform made by
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The federal government is suing Allstate Insurance Co., accusing it of forcing thousands of agents to give up their right to sue the company for age discrimination or other issues.
After a year of failed negotiations with the nation's second-largest insurer, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity  Commission accused the company of illegally converting the agents to private contractors.

To continue working as independent contractors, the agents had to sign a waiver giving up their right to sue Allstate over job issues.

The EEOC, in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Philadelphia on Thursday, said the waiver violates non-retaliation clauses of federal labor law, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

PITTSBURGH (AP) - The IRS has ruled that USX Corp.'s planned spin-off of U.S. Steel will be tax-free to USX and its shareholders. The transaction, announced in April, is expected to occur at year's end, company officials said Friday.
The spin-off is part of a reorganization that would separate USX's energy and steel businesses, turning
U.S. Steel into a freestanding, publicly traded company.

USX included two divisions, Pittsburgh-based USX-U.S. Steel Group and Houston-based USX-Marathon Group, which have stock that is traded separately on the New York Stock Exchange. The steel company has since been renamed United States Steel LLC and changed from a division of the company to a subsidiary in preparation for the final split.

THE EUROPEAN Commission is to fine five German banks a total of EUR100.8 million ($89.3 million)
for allegedly fixing the charges for the exchange of euro-zone currencies.

Imposing one of the largest  cartel fines in its history, the Commission charged the banks with infringing article 81 of the EC Treaty by colluding in 1997 to charge no less than 3 percent for the exchange of
euro-zone banknotes to compensate for the abolition of the buying and selling "spread" in 1999 when the
euro was launched.

TD
Commerzbank, Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank were  fined EUR28 million each, while Deutsche Verkehrsbank was  fined EUR14 million and Vereins- und Westbank EUR2.8 million.

The fines follow a major investigation which began in 1999 and which resulted in Statements of Objections being issued to around 150  banks in seven countries: Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, Finland, Germany, The Netherlands and Austria.

From April 2001, however, the vast majority of the  banks proposed to substantially reduce charges, and drop them completely for account holders from 1 October 2001. In response, the Commission agreed to end proceedings as it took the view that it was in the consumer interest to secure an immediate and substantial reduction in charges. A number of Austrian  banks are still being investigated for alleged collusion, including fixing forex charges.
The five banks are likely to fight the penalties; Commerzbank has vowed to appeal to the  European
Court of Justice, and Dresdner  Bank is reviewing its position.

The European Commission’s powers to enforce EU competition (anti-trust) law have been more and more in the news in recent years. However, whilst its blocking of high-profile mergers such as the GE/Honeywell deal have hit the headlines, a matter of equal interest to companies carrying on business in Europe is the Commission’s increasing activism in attacking non-merger anti-competitive agreements and conduct.The Commission’s attack on cartels

TD
The Commission’s current approach to competition law enforcement may be illustrated by the fact that in just six weeks in November and December 2001 it imposed  fines for competition law infringements in excess of Eu1 billion. This included individual  fines of Eu462 million on Hoffman-La Roche and Eu296 million on BASF (vitamins  cartel); Eu28 million each for Commerzbank, Dresdner  Bank and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank (fixing exchange rates); and fines ranging from Eu270,000 to Eu46 million on various Belgian brewers. A key aspect of the Commission’s enforcement of EU competition rules is its power to carry out unannounced inspections at company premises. Such inspections are often referred to as “dawn raids” - though in practice a company’s ordeal will generally begin at the rather more civilised hour of 9:00 am. By no means all dawn raids are publicised (companies rarely want to discuss their ordeal), but examples in the last 18 months include raids on Coca-Cola; nine UK and  German mobile phone operators; SAS and Maersk Air; and a number of producers of plastic film. The key EU competition rules affecting companies’ conduct are contained in the EC Treaty of Rome. Article 81 of the EC Treaty (formerly known as Article 85) prohibits agreements or understandings between businesses that appreciably restrict competition (or are intended so to do, even if they don’t have such an effect in practice). The agreement must also have some actual or potential effect on trade between EU member states. Agreements that don’t affect trade between EU member states can still be caught by national competition rules - often based on the EC Treaty - such as the UK’s Competition Act 1998. The classic type of agreement prohibited by Article 81 and likely to lead to a dawn raid is a  cartel arrangement between competitors. This can include, for example, competitors agreeing minimum prices that they will each charge their customers, dividing up territories or customers amongst themselves, boycotting certain customers or suppliers, or simply exchanging confidential information on pricing or strategy. The second key provision is Article 82 (formerly Article 86) of the EC Treaty. This applies to a business with a
dominant position in a market in the EU - this is usually presumed if the business’s market share exceeds
50%, but is also possible at lower market shares. Article 82 prohibits abuse of that dominant market
position by, for example, applying discriminatory prices, discounts or rebates, withholding supplies from
customers to force them out of business, refusing access to facilities essential to enable others to
compete, or generally using market power to maintain the business’s dominant position. The
Commission’s powers The Commission was given significant powers to investigate breaches of the
competition rules as long ago as 1962, in EC Council Regulation 17. Article 14 of Regulation 17 empowers
the Commission to enter business premises; to examine a business’s books and records, and to take
copies; and to ask for “oral explanations” in relation to such documents. Technically, there are two types of
Commission inspection. The first requires only an authorization by the  Commission of certain officials
under Article 14(2) to carry out the inspection. Businesses are not obliged to submit to an inspection by
authorization, which is often arranged in advance with the business, rather than being an unannounced
dawn raid. However, if a business fails to submit, the Commission may be expected to convert the
inspection into a more formal inspection by decision of the Commission under Article 14(3) - if necessary
within a matter of hours - so that refusal to submit to the inspection is unlikely to be productive. The
decision will provide an indication of the matters under investigation, though this is often in quite unspecific
terms. Businesses are obliged to submit to an inspection by decision, and a dawn raid will usually be
carried out pursuant to a decision (there is no requirement first to proceed using the authorization route).
Even when well handled, dawn raids are a stressful and disruptive experience for businesses. If allowed to
Page 143 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
run out of control, raids can descend into antagonism, and risk creating an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility between a business and the Commission that could influence the course of any subsequent investigation. Moreover, the extent of the Commission’s investigative powers means that there is little scope for active resistance - so constructive co-operation with the  Commission inspectors is the most realistic strategy. Such constructive co-operation should begin as soon as the inspectors arrive. Reception and security staff should be briefed on whom in the company to contact should a  Commission official arrive with an “Article 14 notice” - so that they do not throw the inspectors out of the building (as happened in one case in which the author was - too late - involved). The inspectors should be shown to a room, and greeted by an in-house lawyer and/or senior management. Two matters are a priority in the initial stages of the inspection: (1) to read the decision and ascertain the reason for the Commission’s inspection; and (2) to contact external lawyers for assistance. In relation to the latter, the Commission will not allow its inspection to be unduly delayed to await the external lawyer’s arrival, but will usually wait up to about an hour. Conduct of the inspection You may effectively have no choice but to allow the  Commission officials to carry out the inspection, but there are three key objectives you should aim to meet. First, to ensure that the officials understand that your business is willing to co-operate and has nothing to hide. Second, to ensure that, where there are innocent explanations for apparently damaging information, these are put to the Commission at once. Finally, to minimize the time the officials spend at your premises (and the disruption to your business). All of these objectives require “shadowing” of the officials by, preferably, lawyers. Once the inspection is under way, the Commission’s first request is likely to be for an
organigram of the relevant business divisions. The Commission officials (anything from 4 to ten or more, often including representatives from the national competition authority) will visit particular offices to inspect files. A lawyer should accompany each official to ensure that the inspection is carried out properly. In principle, the  Commission is not entitled to carry out a “fishing expedition” and simply demand to see all files. In practice, however, it can often be difficult even for the person whose files are being inspected to be certain whether or not they contain relevant information. It is ideal - but not always achievable without
giving an impression of being obstructive - if your lawyer can examine each file first before allowing the official to read it. As well as examining documents, the  Commission officials can take copies away with them. In order both to speed up the inspection and to maintain control, you should assign staff to copy the documents for the officials, with an extra copy for yourselves. It may be possible to persuade officials to allow documents to be redacted (ie with irrelevant sections removed), though the  Commission may well resist this on efficiency grounds. Finally, the  Commission may ask questions concerning documents. This is the aspect of  Commission inspections that is most likely to lead to conflict. The  Commission is entitled to ask for oral explanations on the spot. There are divergent views as to whether this allows the Commission to ask wide-ranging questions (subject to the privilege against self-incrimination - see
below), or whether the  Commission is confined to questions directly relating to documents it has found. In practice, questioning can range from the mundane (what does this hand-written note say?) to the potentially sinister (why did you meet your competitor in Zurich?). During one inspection in which the
author was involved a sales executive was asked why all of his travel receipts were missing from a file in a year in which his frequent flyer card indicated that he had made many trips to Switzerland! The questions can be put as the officials go along, or in interviews towards the end of the inspection. The obligation to submit to the inspection is that of the business, not any individual employee, but there is a risk that refusal to make a particular employee available for questioning could be regarded as an obstruction of the inspection. It is important therefore that a lawyer is present throughout any questioning, and that a careful note is made of all questions and answers. What rights do you have ? It will by now be clear that the balance of power in a  Commission inspection is firmly with the  Commission officials. Although judicial review of aspects of the inspection is possible, this will often only take place some time after the inspection has concluded, when damage may already have been done. Moreover, the  Commission has power to impose fines on a business that obstructs an inspection, or provides documents that are incomplete or misleading. However, there are certain rights of defence that may assist lawyers to limit the scope of the inspection. First, the  Commission must carry out the inspection within the subject matter of its investigation. It cannot, for example, demand to see documents relating to sales in Italy in relation to an investigation of Benelux markets. In practice, however, the subject matter is likely to be very broad. Secondly, legally privileged communications need not be disclosed to  Commission officials. Privilege is limited to communications with external lawyers only, not in-house lawyers, and to reports of the content of external legal advice (for example, an executive summary for the Board). It is good practice to ensure that all legally privileged communications are marked as such and stored in separate files, so that they can be easily identified in a raid and not inadvertently shown to the inspectors. Finally, there is a limited privilege against self-incrimination. Businesses and their employees are not obliged to answer questions that
involve an admission of a competition law infringement. You could therefore refuse to answer a question such as, “Did you agree the prices you would  charge with your competitor?” However, factual questions are still admissible, such as, “Did you meet your competitor in Zurich? What did you discuss?” - so the privilege can be of limited value. Conclusions A  European Commission dawn raid is usually only the beginning of an investigation that may last years, and could result in significant  fines. As demonstrated above, there are practical measures that can help to reduce the chaos of the raid itself - but it is always preferable to seek to minimize the risk of a raid occurring at all. In this context, an effective competition law

compliance programme is often the best way to ensure that a business does not infringe competition law in the first place.

IT SEEMED LIKE A YEAR of two distinct worlds: the one before Sept. 11 and the one afterward.

A new administration moved into the White House in January facing an evenly divided Senate. That split didn't last long, as Republican Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont declared himself an independent, shifting power to the Democrats. Microsoft scored a major legal victory in June, when an appeals court all but ended the chance that the software company would be split in two.

On Wall Street, investors were disappointed that a rebound from a dismal 2000 failed to materialize. Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate cuts, layoffs and profit warnings became seemingly daily occurrences.

Then, the planes hit. Travel stopped. Markets closed. A nation grieved. Bush declared to the world, "Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists." The focus turned to Afghanistan and homeland defense. An economy hard-hit before Sept. 11 came under increasing pressure. As the year drew to a close, the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the U.S. had been in a recession since March. And in the biggest such filing in U.S. history, Enron sought  bankruptcy-court protection.

Here is a summary of the news events as chronicled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, the dates reflect when the items were published.

Shell May Divest Stake in Basell

Royal Dutch/Shell says it will consider selling Shell Chemicals' 50% stake in Basell, a 5050 polyolefins joint venture with BASF, if Basell's profitability fails to improve. Shell says that Basell has cut costs by an annualized IE100 million ($91 million) since 2000, and aims to increase that to 250 million by 2003. Measures have included mothballing about 10% of Basell's polypropylene capacity during the past year. BASF and Shell supply Basell with 50% of its feedstock requirements and aim to increase that to 70%, to further reduce costs, Shell adds. Basell is among $7 billion worth of underperforming assets that Shell says it may divest. "If a route to satisfactory performance cannot be found, portfolio action will be taken," Shell says. Separately, the  European Commission has conditionally approved the merger of Shell's assets in Germany with DEA (p. 15).

Lyondell Cuts 2002 Capital Spending Budget

Lyondell Chemical says it will cut its 2002 capital expenditure budget by 25%, to $230 million. The company will spend $130 million in its intermediate chemicals and derivatives business, 35% less than expected, and reduce spending requirements for its 50-50 propylene oxidestyrene monomer joint venture with Bayer. Lyondell also allotted $39 million to spend on its Equistar jv, most of which will be used to improve plant efficiencies and to ensure regulatory and environmental compliance. LyondellCitgo Refining will use the remaining $61 million to meet regulatory requirements for cleaner-burning gasoline due to take effect July 2006 (CW, Feb. 7 2001, p. 6).
OxyVinyis to Close Texas Chlor-Alkali Unit

OxyVinyls, a 76-24 joint venture between OxyChem and PolyOne, says it will close its 410,000-tons/year chlor-alkali plant at Deer Park, TX indefinitely, and lay off 200 employees and 70 contract workers. The company cites weak market conditions. Some worker will be offered relocation to OxyVinyls facilities in the Houston, says the company. Production of vinyl chloride monomer and anhydrous caustic soda at the site is not affected, says OxyChem. The company will supply chlorine to OxyVinyls and meet all its customer requirements from its other sites. The facility will be restarted when demand improves sufficiently, says OxyVinyls
Former Hercules Employee Settles Insider Trading Case

SEC has sued a former Hercules employee for alleged insider trading before Hercules acquired BetzDearborn in 1998. Patricia Bugenhagen, a former BetzDearborn executive assistant, has been accused of tipping off six other investors and buying stock in BetzDearborn. Bugenhagen and the other defendants have agreed to pay a total of $270,000, including  fines and the money they made from the trades. SEC recently filed a lawsuit against a former J.P Morgan junior investment  banking  analyst and two of his acquaintances for alleged insider trading in BetzDearborn stock in 1998 prior to the deal (CW Oct. 24, 2001, p. 7).
Rogers Falls Short of Estimates; Idles Plants
Electronic materials firm Rogers (Rogers, CT) does not expect to meet its fourth-quarter sales and
earnings projections because of weak demand at the end of the quarter. The company expects sales to be
about $47 million, and earnings of 18 cts-20 cts/share, it says. Rogers estimated last October that

fourth-quarter sales would reach $53 million, and earnings 23-25 cts/share. Rogers attributes most of the decline to customers delaying orders as they pull down year-end inventories. Rogers says it closed most of its plants during the last week of December to help cut costs.
Crompton Renegotiates Debt Covenants

Crompton says it has renegotiated covenants for its five-year $400 million, and 364-day $125 million  bank agreements. The renegotiation allows Crompton to increase its debtearnings ratio before interest, taxes, debt, and amortization (EBITDA) from 4.25, to 5.25. The ratio will be decreased to 3.5 over the next 34 months, the company says. Crompton's EBITDA-interest coverage constraint ratio has been lowered from
3.0, to 2.5, under the agreement. Initial revision fees were about $1.6 million, the company says.
* Chevron Phillips Shuts HDPE Pipe Plant

Chevron Phillips Chemical says it closed a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe plant at Abbeville, SC on December 31 as part of a plan to consolidate its pipe production. The 45 employees at the site will be offered severance packages or redeployment to other sites, says Chevron Phillips. The company will retain an unspecified number of employees until July 31 as production is moved to other plants. Chevron Phillips has 12 remaining U.S. HDPE pipe plants; capacity details were not disclosed.
* Symyx, CSFB Sued Over IPO

Law firm Milberg Weiss (New York) says it has filed a class-action suit against Symyx Technologies and Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) alleging that Symyx's 1999 initial public offering violated securities laws; CSFB was one of the underwriters. The suit alleges that CSFB solicited and received commissions from certain investors in exchange for portions of restricted Symyx shares, and that CSFB agreed to allocate Symyx shares to certain customers that agreed to purchase more shares in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
* PCS Cuts Earnings Estimates
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (PCS) says it has lowered its 2001 earnings estimates by 8%, to
$2.30/share. Analysts' estimates reported by First Call (Boston) are $2.42/share. PCS blames oversupply
of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. Poor phosphates margins have prompted the company to cut
employees at Aurora, NC, by 15%, to 1,000, resulting in a one-time  charge of 5 cts/share for the fourth
quarter, it says. The cutback is expected to yield annualized savings of $9 million
* IMC Amends Credit Agreement

IMC Global says it has used proceeds of $683 million from recent divestment to completely pay down the used portion of its  bank revolver. This has allowed it to amend its $500 million credit arrangement to ease certain financial commitments, and to start a tender offer for all of its $300 million of outstanding 7.4% notes due November 2002. IMC says it on track to satisfy debt obligations in 2002 in the next few weeks.
* Uralita Closes Aragonesas Acquisition

Uralita (Madrid) has completed a previously announced deal under which it raised its stake in Energia e Industrial Aragonesas (Madrid) from 49.7%, to 84.2% (CW, Nov. 21/28, 2001, p. 8). The deal took the form of a share swap, under which Uralita offered to exchange nine newly issued shares for every 10
Aragonesas shares held. The share issue increased Uralita's market capitalization 23%, to EUR378.5 million ($344 million).
* VCI cuts Growth Forecast

German chemical industry association VCI (Frankfurt) has cut its 2002 output growth forecast by half, to
0.5%. VCI cites a worsethan-expected deterioration in fourth-quarter 2001 output in  Germany and the
uncertain world economic outlook, which, it says, makes a recovery before the second half of this year
highly unlikely. Cefic forecasts chemical industry output growth of 1.8% in the  European Union this year
(p. 33).
* Olefins Contracts Fall in  Europe

First-quarter contract prices in  Europe for ethylene, propylene, and butadiene have all plummeted due to lower feedstock costs and weak demand (p. 42). Ethylene fell EUR80/m.t., to EUR473/m.t. del; propylene felt EUR40/m.t., to EUR365/m.t. del; and butadiene fell EUR68/m.t., to EUR335/m.t. del. The market has accepted the propylene and butadiene settlements, market sources say, but some ethylene buyers are pushing for a greater decrease and had not agreed to the settlement by CWpress time.
* Elementis Warns of Loss
Page 168 of 170 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Elementis says that it may report a net loss in second-half 2001. The company had said last year that its second-half profits would be "less than half" of the L15.1 million ($22 million) it reported in the first half
(CW Oct. 24, 2001, p. 8). "Short-term trading conditions have worsened" since then, Elementis says. "As a result, it is likely that the company will make a negligible profit before goodwill amortization and exceptionals in the second half," it says.
* Eastman Reaches Site Closure Accord

Eastman Chemical says it has reached an agreement with the works council of its Dusseldorf,  Germany coatings polymers site on the previously announced closure of the site (CW, Oct. 31, 2001, p. 29). Production will cease at the site by March 31, Eastman says.
Atofina's Toulouse Site May Not Reopen; SNPE Moves Ahead

The French government says it will most likely not permit the reopening of Atofina subsidiary Grand Paroisse's Toulouse, France site where an explosion on September 21, 2001 killed 30 and injured more than 2,000. The blast provoked a nationwide debate in France on locating hazardous chemical plants in urban areas, culminating in a debate in the French parliament last month attended by prime minister Lionel Jospin (CW Nov. 21/28, 2001, p. 26). It is "almost unthinkable" to consider reopening the Grande Paroisse site, says Jospin. Atofina says it is concerned about Jospin's comments, but it will wait until completion of an investigation into the blast before commenting further. Plants at Toulouse owned by SNPE and its Isochem and Tolochimie subsidiaries will be authorized to restart, "provided that they are in a position to meet new safety requirements set by the government," says Jospin. SNPE says it plans to submit an
action plan to the relevant authorities "for the progressive restart of all our Toulouse installations," and it hopes to resume output there soon of all products that do not contain phosgene. SNPE, meanwhile, says it has halted negotiations to acquire DuPonts sulfonylurea plant at Loon, France, pending a resumption of full production at SNPE's Toulouse site (CW Oct. 24,2001, p. 17).
Albemarle JV Delas Jordan Flame Retardant Startup

Jordan Bromine Co. UBC; Amman), a joint venture between Albemarle and Arab Potash Co., says it will delay startup of a previously announced flame retardants plant at Safi, Jordan until the market improves. The company says that the project, comprising bromine, calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and hydrogen bromide units, will be completed on schedule in late 2002. A 50,000-m.t./year unit producing the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol-A, also originally due fully onstream at the end of 2002, will instead be brought online in stages as demand warrants.
Investcorp Agrees to Buy Avecia's Leather Chemicals

Private equity capital company Investcorp (New York) has agreed to acquire leather chemicals producer Stahl (Waalwijk, the Netherlands) from Avecia for g375 million ($341 million). Avecia says it expects to complete the deal this month, Investcorp entered negotiations with Avecia last year to buy Stahl (CW Oct.
31, 2001, p. 14). Stahl has sales of about i339 million/year. Investcorp and private equity capital firm
Cinven (London) jointly own Avecia.
Ineos to Buy BP Esters Operation

Ineos has agreed to acquire BP's  European butyl acetate and isopropyl acetate businesses for an undisclosed sum. The deal includes an ri-butyl/isobutyl acetate plant at Ineos's Antwerp site, as well as BP's butyl acetate and isopropyl acetate technology licensing business. Ineos has operated the
n-butyl/isobutyl acetate plant on behalf of BP since it acquired the Antwerp site from Inspec in 1998. BP recently commissioned an ethyl acetate unit at Hull, U.K. Separately, BP has secured conditional approval from the European Commission for its acquisition of Veba Oel's petrochemical business (p. 15).
BASF to Appeal Vitamin  Cartel Fine
BASF says it plans to appeal the C296-million ($269 million)  fine that the European Commission
recently imposed on the company for participating in a vitamins price-fixing cartel (CW, Dec. 5, 2001, p.
19). BASF says it admits "responsibility for the antitrust violations relating to the vitamins business," but it
says that the fine is "inappropriately high," and fails "to take sufficient account of BASF's cooperation with
the commission in resolving the case." BASF will appeal to the  European Court of First Instance. The
company says it will retain a previously announced C200-million provision in its fourthquarter, 2001
accounts, relating to the  fine, in case the appeal is unsuccessful. Roche, which incurred the highest
vitamins cartel fine, 462 million, says it will not appeal. The  commission fined six other companies for
participating in the cartel.
