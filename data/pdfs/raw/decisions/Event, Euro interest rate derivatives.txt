HD            EU to levy record fines on LIBOR banks

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters)—EU antitrust regulators will levy a record  fine of at least €1.5 billion ($2.02 billion) on six financial institutions, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, for rigging the yen LIBOR interest rate benchmark, a banking industry source said on Wednesday [Nov. 6].

The world's top interdealer broker, ICAP, and Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank are among the firms that will be  fined, the person said. The names of the other two financial institutions were not immediately clear.

TD
Switzerland's UBS will not be fined because it was the first member of the group to come clean
during the European Commission's investigation into wrongdoing, two sources familiar with the case
confirmed to Reuters.

The yen LIBOR  fines, likely to be the biggest so far to be handed out by Brussels, come on top of other penalties for a separate case involving the rigging of the  Euribor  benchmark interest rate, reported by Reuters on Tuesday [Nov. 5].

Other regulators worldwide have also punished several banks and brokerages — including some of those to be  fined by the European Commission — for misconduct.

EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia will announce the penalties next month, at the same time as  fines for the rigging of the euro zone interest rate, dealing a blow to a system which allowed banks to determine the cost of borrowing.

"The total  fine could be at least €1.5 billion," the financial industry source told Reuters. That would beat the current record of €1.47 billion  fine handed down to a  cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

The London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) is a central cog in the global financial system, used as a benchmark for pricing hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of products.

The financial source said the group of banks had admitted to wrongdoing in yen LIBOR, the rate associated with the Japanese currency, in exchange for a 10 percent cut in the  fine. The fines, which can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, are nonetheless set to be significant.

RBS had a turnover of £25 billion ($40.2 billion) last year, while Barclays was £29 billion and Rabobank €13.5 billion. ICAP's turnover was £1.47 billion. RBS, Barclays, Rabobank, ICAP and UBS declined to comment.

Antoine Colombani, the  European Commission spokesman for competition policy, declined to comment.

Almunia wants to hand out the  fines by the end of the year, reinforcing his emerging legacy as a firm penalizer of banks' wrongdoing since the financial crisis struck five years ago. His investigators say interest rate  derivatives' traders colluded to rig the LIBOR and  Euribor  benchmarks, using advanced knowledge of the cost of borrowing to bolster their profits. Such cartels are illegal.

LIBOR is based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans. Other regulators have already found that traders colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits.

(Recasts to incorporate  Euribor  and Libor settlement details)

BRUSSELS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A number of finance firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Rabobank face billions of euros in  fines next month from European Union regulators for colluding on global benchmark interest rates, reinforcing Brussels' hard line on the sector after the financial crisis.

TD
EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia is set to unveil a record  fine of at least 1.5 billion euros ($2.03 billion) on six banks, including Barclays and RBS, for rigging the yen Libor interest rate benchmark, a banking source said on Wednesday.

In addition to the yen Libor  fines, likely to be the biggest so far from Brussels, Almunia will also penalise another group of banks for operating as a  cartel in a separate case involving the rigging of the Euribor  benchmark interest rate, reported by Reuters on Tuesday.

Fines in the two cases could run to billions of euros.

The fines will add to the spiralling cost to banks for cleaning up past misdeeds. Globally this is expected to reach about $125 billion if JP Morgan agrees a $13 billion deal with the U.S. authorities over mortgages.

This earnings season, banks set aside more money for the rising cost of  fines, lawsuits and compensation.

Authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

The London inter-bank offered rate (Libor) and its European cousin (Euribor)  are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets, from Spanish mortgages to derivatives.

A settlement with the EU over  cartel allegations would require the banks to admit liability, potentially paving the way for lawsuits from investors and others who believe they have lost money because of the rates manipulation.

Under the Libor settlement, the world's top interdealer broker, ICAP, and Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank are among those that will be  fined, the person said. The names of the other two financial institutions were not immediately clear.

Switzerland's UBS will not be  fined because it was the first member of the group to come clean during the European Commission's investigation into wrongdoing, two sources familiar with the case confirmed to Reuters.

European lawmakers have responded to public anger over the cost of bank bailouts with tough measures that include the first bonus cap in the world for bankers.

Almunia wants to hand out the  fines by the end of the year, reinforcing his reputation for cracking down hard on banks' wrongdoings since the financial crisis struck five years ago.

Page 6 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The total  fine could be at least 1.5 billion euros ($2.02 billion)," the financial industry source told Reuters of the Libor settlement. That would beat the current record of 1.47 billion euro  fine for a cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

The financial source said the group of banks had admitted to wrongdoing in yen Libor, the rate associated with the Japanese currency, in exchange for a 10 percent cut in the  fine.

The fines, which can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, are nonetheless set to be significant.
RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds and Rabobank
13.5 billion euros. ICAP's turnover was 1.47 billion pounds. RBS, Barclays, Rabobank, ICAP and UBS
declined to comment.

The European Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment.

For its Euribor  settlement, Brussels is also set to  fine six global banks, including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, a source has told Reuters.
Barclays, which alerted the  European Commission to the suspected wrongdoing in relation to
Euribor,  will not be  fined.
All of the banks named in relation to either settlement declined to comment.

Almunia's investigators say interest rate  derivatives' traders colluded to rig the Libor and  Euribor benchmarks, using advanced knowledge of the cost of borrowing to bolster their profits. Such cartels are illegal.

Libor is based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans. Other regulators have already found that traders colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits.

In the Libor settlement, all the banks have admitted to wrongdoing to reduce the size of their  fine, but in the Euribor  settlement several of the banks are contesting the size of the proposed penalties.

HSBC, Europe's largest bank, is one of those, two sources said. In these cases, the banks are likely to face formal charges next month, followed by  fines next year, one of the people said.

By Lionel Laurent and Matthias Blamont

PARIS, Nov 7 (Reuters) - French banks Societe Generale and Credit Agricole have agreed an asset swap designed to help narrow their business focus, part of efforts to improve their investor appeal in a tough economic and regulatory climate.

Like many lenders across Europe, both banks are under pressure to find new strategies to cut costs and better compete for market share as new curbs on risk taking hike the cost of doing business and as a fragile recovery at home saps revenue.

They are also battling the legal and regulatory fallout from the financial crisis, with Agricole pledging to fight any accusation by the  European Commission that it had colluded to rig benchmark interest rates.
"I refused the notion of a deal that would have constituted a recognition of responsibility," Chief
Executive Jean-Paul Chifflet said.

Brussels is expected to  fine banks billions of euros next month for allegedly operating like a  cartel to manipulate benchmark interest rates, Reuters reported this week, with both Agricole and SocGen expected to be hit.

SocGen said it had set aside 700 million euros in provisions for litigation issues without specifying which ones. The bank declined to comment on a possible European  fine.

The asset swap, unveiled on Thursday alongside quarterly results, will involve SocGen buying its smaller rival's 50 percent stake in brokerage Newedge for 275 million euros ($372 million), while Agricole will buy 5 percent of their asset-management venture Amundi for 337.5 million.

This would leave SocGen with all of Newedge, which offers greater exposure to foreign-exchange and commodities markets, and Credit Agricole with 80 percent of Amundi.

It would also sharpen differences between investment-banking-focused SocGen and its 119-year-old semi-cooperative rival, which since the 2008 financial crisis has been retreating from trading and brokerage activities to focus on more traditional retail banking and insurance.

"It's positive for Credit Agricole, which derives 40 percent of revenue from insurance and asset management and which has been pulling back from trading and  derivatives," said Yannick Naud, a portfolio manager at Glendevon King, who does not hold shares in either bank.
Page 8 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"For SocGen, there will be synergies as well. The French banks are becoming more and more different from one another."

Agricole's strategy may have paid off in the third quarter, when it swung to a profit of 728 million euros from a 2.85 billion year-ago loss on the back of a painful exit from the crisis-hit Greek market.
SocGen shares were up 4 pct and Credit Agricole was up 5.5 pct, extending their gains on back of the
European Central Bank's surprise rate cut.
POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY

But the bank also said it would push back a planned investor day from later this year to March 2014, signaling potential uncertainty ahead for investors as the European Central Bank begins its health check of the region's lenders.

"While the investor day could bring even bigger changes, expectations are being delayed," Citigroup analysts wrote in a note to clients.

SocGen, which is retreating from areas such as asset-gathering and which according to trade union sources is planning up to 375 job cuts in its custody business, saw quarterly profit jump more than fivefold to 534 million euros.

Analysts had expected profit closer to 674.9 million for SocGen and 483.6 million for Agricole, according to the average of forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Smaller rival Natixis reported a 38 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Wednesday as cost savings and robust capital-markets trade offset economic weakness. BNP Paribas , France's No. 1 bank, last week also reported a rise in net income after cost cuts.
BNP also said it had made a non-binding offer for Polish bank BGZ without giving a price.

Reuters first reported SocGen's plan to take over Newedge in June. SocGen had previously sought to exit the unit as part of a drive to strengthen its balance sheet, but a lack of buyers pushed it to think up new ways of integrating it.

Agricole has already sold its other brokerage brands CLSA and Cheuvreux as well as assets including its stake in Spain's Bankinter in a bid to improve balance-sheet strength.

Agricole, which has lower capital ratios than rivals and its own parent network of regional cooperative banks, is targeting a Basel III core Tier 1 ratio of over 9.5 percent by end-2015. The bank said its ratio would improve as a result of the Newedge deal.
SocGen said it expected its capital ratio to fall by 10 basis points after the Newedge deal. It reached a
Basel III ratio of 9.9 percent at end-September and said it expected a dividend payout ratio of around
25 percent of profits.

HD         EU poised to set record for Libor  fines

Brussels is preparing to hit banks and brokers with record  fines for market manipulation in its investigation into yen Libor.

The European Commission is likely to collect more than €1.5 billion (£1.3 billion) from a group of banks and brokers in a settlement by the end of the year, a source told Reuters. Additional  fines for manipulation of  Euribor,  the eurozone equivalent of Libor, are also likely.

TD
Those under investigation for manipulation of benchmark interest rates include Barclays, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Rabobank, UBS and the broker Icap.

The EU has been running its own investigation rather than take part in joint efforts between Japanese, American, British and Dutch regulators.

Brussels is preparing to hit banks and brokers with record  fines for market manipulation in its investigation into yen Libor.

The European Commission is likely to collect more than €1.5 billion (£1.3 billion) from a group of banks and brokers in a settlement by the end of the year, a source told Reuters. Additional  fines for manipulation of  Euribor,  the eurozone equivalent of Libor, are also likely.

Record fines and impending legal settlements for banks over benchmark manipulation have strengthened the case for large institutional investors deciding whether to take legal action.

Investors including PGGM and AP7 - two of Europe's biggest pension funds - have been examining for months whether to pursue legal claims against banks accused of having manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate.

TD
Their position has been given a boost by a recent UK Court of Appeal decision, which ruled that two companies could include rate-manipulation allegations in lawsuits concerning  derivatives deals with Barclays and Deutsche Bank.

Simon Hart, a partner at RPC, the law firm, said that a number of "serious fund managers" have recently contacted him to establish if they now have "a better prospect of trying to make out a claim".
The case for investors has been bolstered by Dutch bank Rabobank's agreement last month to pay
$1bn to US, UK and Dutch authorities after admitting that dozens of employees manipulated Libor and
other key benchmark interest rates over six years.

Brussels, meanwhile, is expected to announce multibillion-euro  fines for banks that took part in a  cartel to rig Libor and Euribor,  another global interest rate benchmark, as part of an antitrust investigation undertaken by the European Commission.

Stephen Smith, a partner at RPC, said that the commission's findings will help form a clearer picture for investors currently assessing whether to take legal action.

He said: "We have been talking to various funds for some time and they have been actively asking what they should do. [Institutional investors] will increase their interest [in making claims] and I have no doubt other investors [will follow suit]."

Mr Smith said he has spoken to both aggressive investors keen to pursue these banks in the courts and conservative investors that are taking preliminary steps.

He added: "The more information that comes out and the more that their own investors agitate, these investors will come out of their comfort zone."

HD       EC Fines Firms Over Rates Derivatives Manipulation

The European Commission on Tuesday finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion ($2.34 billion) as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest rate derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called  cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to interest rate  derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro interest rate  derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate  derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of  EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement  cartel procedure. For the  cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

HD        UPDATE 2-EU readies multi-million euro benchmark rigging fines -sources

BRUSSELS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will impose record multi-million euro  fines on six banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland on Wednesday for rigging key interest rate benchmarks, sources said.

The sanctions, the first by the European Commission for rate manipulation and expected to top 1.5 billion euros ($2.04 billion), follow hefty fines on top banks for similar offences from authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere.

TD
The benchmarks involved in the three cases - the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo and the euro area equivalents - are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to  derivatives.

JPMorgan and Barclays were also in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.

The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 percent reduction in  fines. UBS alerted the  European      Commission to the yen interest rate  derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates. French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as  Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.

It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its  Euribor  involvement on Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent  Euribor fines on Nov. 5.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is expected to announce the  fines for the three cases at 1030 GMT on Wednesday, a second person said.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Commission spokesman for competition policy Antoine Colombani could not be immediately reached for comment.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's
Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds. Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

HD          EU Fines in Rate Case Expected Within Days; European Authorities Ready Steep Fines Against
Banks Over Allegations of Collusion on Euribor

European Union antitrust authorities are set to hit a group of major banks with heavy  fines as soon as
Wednesday for allegedly colluding to rig interbank lending rates, people familiar with the matter said.

The fines to be levied by the European Commission relate to alleged efforts to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.  The penalties could total several billion euros, people familiar with the matter said. The EU is expected to conclude that a handful of banks broke EU laws forbidding cartels and collusive behavior, although the announcement could be delayed a week, these people said.

TD
The EU investigations are targeting Germany's Deutsche Bank AG; France's Société Générale SA and Credit Agricole SA; the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; and the U.S.'s J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., say the people familiar with the investigation.

UBS AG and Barclays PLC struck immunity deals with the EU antitrust authorities after they agreed to cooperate with investigators and share information about other banks.

The commission's probes are the latest in a long line of investigations by several national regulators, including in the U.S. and the U.K., into whether banks colluded to manipulate benchmarks, including the more widely used London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

The EU antitrust investigation became public in October 2011, when agents simultaneously raided the offices of multiple European banks. Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, has vowed to make the probe an "absolute priority," describing the alleged collusion as "quite shocking." He previously said that interest-rate  derivatives markets were worth $20 trillion in 2011. The  European Commission wasn't immediately available for comment.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Almunia's office contacted some of the banks to inform them of the likely range of fines the EU planned to impose, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Under EU rules, a company can be fined up to 10% of its yearly global revenue for each  cartel in which it has participated.

Executives at some banks have previously expressed surprise at the anticipated large size of the  fines. Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and RBS nonetheless indicated to authorities that they would accept the punishment without a fight, these people say. Others, such as Credit Agricole SA, have said they would contest the penalties.

In a separate probe into benchmark rates, the commission is continuing to investigate possible collusion among banks and brokers in lending rates denominated in Swiss francs.

HD       Europe to unleash heavy rate-fixing fines

Brussels will unveil heavy  fines as soon as Wednesday on a group of global banks that allegedly formed cartels to rig two key global interest rate benchmarks, in a settlement set to break European antitrust enforcement records.

The latest regulatory crackdown over benchmark manipulation is expected to target up to 10 financial institutions. Some will admit wrongdoing while others will face formal charges alleging they colluded to fix Euribor,  Yen Libor or both. The settlements will involve combined  fines of hundreds of millions of euros apiece for most  cartel members.

TD
The decision to be announced by Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, will add to the escalating costs of a scandal that has rocked the financial sector. The multi-bank deal will also provide a more comprehensive account of alleged collusion between traders at different institutions, people
familiar with the settlements said.

Each of the two cases - one focused on the Yen Libor and the other on Libor's European sister benchmark - involve around half a dozen banks or brokers, the people said. Most banks involved in each cartel - including Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and Citi - will settle and pay fines for attempting to act in concert to rig the benchmarks and profit from related interest rate derivatives. RBS and Deutsche will face  fines for both cartels.

Barclays and UBS are to avoid  fines for Euribor  and Libor manipulation, respectively, because they alerted EU officials to the illegal practices. Both banks will admit wrongdoing, a move that could still leave them vulnerable to private damages claims in the courts. Barclays declined to comment on whether it would face  fines for Libor.

Some banks - JPMorgan, HSBC and Crédit Agricole - have been involved in the talks but were last month balking at signing a joint Euribor  settlement. Banks that hold out are expected to face formal charges that could pave the way for fines at a later stage. Interdealer broker ICAP is not part of the joint settlement on Libor.
The announcement will be an unwelcome reminder of past sins for an industry still struggling to cope
with a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and consumer products
to alleged manipulation of foreign exchange benchmarks. The  European Commission decision is to be
formally adopted by the college of commissioners on Wednesday, according to the meeting agenda.

The exact level of  fines remains confidential, unknown even to the banks involved. But the commission warned some banks that it is seeking a  fine of as much as €800m each for groups involved in both cartels. The range of  fines for the individual banks will vary significantly and the precise level will depend on a mix of culpability and leniency for co-operation.

Once the investigation is complete and all banks are fined, the penalty is expected to break antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. One person familiar with the case said the  fines for Libor are expected to be significantly smaller than the penalties for Euribor  manipulation.

There are EU guidelines for calculating  cartel fines but the rules have never been applied to markets in financial instruments. The commission can impose a maximum penalty equivalent to 10 per cent of a company's global turnover for each  cartel it is found to be involved with.

Four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker ICAP have already paid a total of $3.5bn in fines to settle with regulators around for world for Libor-related abuses. However, the EU antitrust authorities have not been party to those deals and for three years pursued its own investigation relating to breaches of antitrust law. A third EU  cartel probe into alleged Swiss franc Libor abuses is still in progress.

Unlike US antitrust regulators, Brussels will not settle with individual  cartel members and it only concludes cases simultaneously with all or most of the companies involved. Those banks refusing to settle would face formal charges - a so-called statement of objections - that could eventually lead to an antitrust ruling and a  fine.

The main incentive to settle under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet against the  cartel, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out have the opportunity to fight the charges in commission-organised hearings and eventually to appeal against any decision in the courts.
All the banks and the commission declined to comment.

European Union antitrust authorities are set to hit a group of major banks with heavy  fines as soon as
Wednesday for allegedly colluding to rig interbank lending rates, people familiar with the matter said.

TD
The fines to be levied by the European Commission relate to alleged efforts to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.  The penalties could total several billion euros, people familiar with the matter said. The EU is expected to conclude that a handful of banks broke EU laws forbidding cartels
and collusive behavior, although the announcement could be delayed a week, these people said.

The EU investigations are targeting Germany's Deutsche Bank AG; France's Société Générale SA and Credit Agricole SA; the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; and the U.S.'s J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., say the people familiar with the investigation.

UBS AG and Barclays PLC struck immunity deals with the EU antitrust authorities after they agreed to cooperate with investigators and share information about other banks.

The commission's probes are the latest in a long line of investigations by several national regulators, including in the U.S. and the U.K., into whether banks colluded to manipulate benchmarks, including the more widely used London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

The EU antitrust investigation became public in October 2011, when agents simultaneously raided the offices of multiple European banks. Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, has vowed to make the probe an "absolute priority," describing the alleged collusion as "quite shocking." He previously said that interest-rate  derivatives markets were worth $20 trillion in 2011. The  European Commission wasn't immediately available for comment.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Almunia's office contacted some of the banks to inform them of the likely range of fines the EU planned to impose, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Under EU rules, a company can be fined up to 10% of its yearly global revenue for each  cartel in which it has participated.

Executives at some banks have previously expressed surprise at the anticipated large size of the  fines. Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and RBS nonetheless indicated to authorities that they would accept the punishment without a fight, these people say. Others, such as Credit Agricole SA, have said they would contest the penalties.

In a separate probe into benchmark rates, the commission is continuing to investigate possible collusion among banks and brokers in lending rates denominated in Swiss francs.

HD     2ND LEAD: EU fines banks, traders 1.7 billion euros for rate-rigging By dpa correspondents Eds: Adds bank reax, Almunia  quotes, lenders who refused settlement
WC    721 words

LP
Brussels (dpa) - The European Union imposed Wednesday a record  fine totalling 1.7 billion euros (2.3 billion dollars) on six financial institutions for manipulating interest-rate benchmarks, with the bloc's top competition official vowing that more is yet to come.

Suspicions about rate-rigging date back to the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmarks involved - most notably Libor and  Euribor  - serve as references for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

TD
The EU believes that lenders colluded illegally by discussing the interest rates they would submit for the benchmarks' calculation and sharing other commercially sensitive information.

"The aim of these talks between traders was to increase their banks' profits and in turn their own bonuses," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in Brussels, calling the conduct "appalling."

The firms fined Wednesday entered settlements with the EU to end  cartel investigations into their activities, paving the way for their  fines to be reduced by 10 per cent.
A further three banks and one trader have refused to settle. Those inquiries will continue, Almunia said. Germany's Deutsche Bank faces the stiffest penalty at 725 million euros, followed by France's Societe
Generale with 446 million euros and Britain's RBS with 391 million euros.

The amounts are meant to both punish the institutions and dissuade others from following their example, Almunia said. He spoke also of the need to restore trust in financial markets.
All three lenders blamed the rate-rigging on individual employees.

"Societe Generale firmly condemns such inappropriate behavior, which is in total contradiction with its internal code of conduct," the bank said in statement.

Since 2008, it has "completely overhauled" its interest-rate submission processes, the statement added, assuring that the  fine would not affect the bank's financial goals for 2013.

Financial markets nevertheless turned against all three of France's major lenders, with Societe Generale shares down more than 1 per cent shortly after the EU announcement.

Deutsche Bank also insisted that it has made provisions in advance to pay the EU penalty, with no need for extra funds to be set aside.

RBS chairman Philip Hampton, meanwhile, said Wednesday's news was "another sobering reminder of ... past failings."

"Nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue," he added. "There were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees."
Prior to the EU's  fine, RBS had already paid penalties totalling 391 million pounds (640 million dollars) to
US and British authorities, for its role in manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate.


Page 39 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Britain's Barclays had also landed at the centre of the Libor scandal last year, but escaped an EU  fine on
Wednesday - along with Switzerland's UBS - for blowing the whistle on the cartels.
The other banks hit with  fines were US lenders JP Morgan and Citigroup, which face penalties between
70 and 80 million euros. The British broker firm RP Martin was slapped with a 247,000-euro  fine.
A spokesman for RP Martin declined to comment.
Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe General and RBS were involved in manipulating interest rate
derivatives denominated in euros from 2005 to 2008, the  European Commission found.
Inquiries on this rate-rigging continue into France's Credit Agricole, Britain's HSBC and JP Morgan. Manipulations of  derivatives denominated in the Japanese yen were chalked up to UBS, RBS, Deutsche
Bank, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin, with infringements found between 2007 and 2010. The cash
broker ICAP remains under investigation.

There are estimates that benchmarks - which include major indices such as Libor and  Euribor,  but also those used to set cocoa or oil prices - are a reference for financial instruments and contracts valued at more than 1,000 trillion euros.

The commission is probing whether other benchmarks such as currency exchange rates were also manipulated.

HD      European Commission issues fines totalling EUR1.7bn to eight banks for rigging financial benchmarks

Banks involved in a financial cartel that colluded to fix crucial benchmark rates have been levied with
fines that total EUR1.7bn by the European Commission, it was reported on Wednesday.

These benchmarks included the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents. The benchmark rates are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to  derivatives.

TD
The rate rigging was described by  European Commission vice-president Joaquin Almunia as “appalling examples of misconduct”.

UK bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is among the banks that had the record breaking  fines imposed for fixing yen Libor and  Euribor  rates. Other organisations involved were Deutsche Bank, which received the biggest  fine of EUR725.36m, Societe Generale and broking firm RP Martin, which is said to have facilitated one of the infringements by using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor. Two US banks, JP Morgan and Citibank, were also involved in the  cartel.

Barclays bank escaped being  fined EUR690m, as it had voluntarily reported that the cartel was rigging Euribor  rates. Swiss bank UBS also avoided a  fine of EUR2.5bn for exposing the cartel in yen Libor fixing. The  European Commission said it will continue investigating Credit Agricole, HSBC, JPMorgan and brokerage ICAP for similar offences. Credit Agricole has reportedly refused to settle and is likely to face sanctions in 2014, while HSBC has also contested the penalty proposed by the  European                 Commission.

Financial regulators in the UK and US have already levied  fines on financial institutions including UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP for attempts to manipulate key interest rates. Also, certain individuals are facing criminal charges.

Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of RBS, was cited as saying: “Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS.”

HD       Joaquín Almunia,  Vice President  Of The European Commission Responsible For Competition
Policy - Introductory Remarks On Cartels In The Financial  Sector
WC      1,192 words

LP
Today the Commission has taken decisions in two  cartel cases in the financial sector.

We have reached settlements with 8 financial institutions which violated EU antitrust rules and we have sanctioned them for these infringements. The total  fines imposed today amount to 1.7 billion euros. This is the highest total amount ever imposed by the Commission for breaches of antitrust rules - even if
some entities under investigation have not participated in the settlement and our proceedings continue for them. The companies who concluded today's settlements are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, UBS, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin.

TD
Among these 8 companies, 4 participated in a  cartel in the market for interest rate  derivatives denominated in euros (Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale). 6 participated in one or more bilateral cartels in the market for interest rate  derivatives denominated in yen (Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, RP Martin and UBS). Deutsche Bank and RBS participated in both infringements.

Interest rate  derivatives, such as swaps, futures, options or forward rate agreements, are financial contracts which are used by banks or companies. These financial products play a very important role in the economy, since they work as a kind of insurance mechanism against the fluctuations of interest rates. They are meant to allow for an efficient management of the risk that such variations entail.

Thousands of European companies may use these products, for example if they have contracted a loan with a variable interest rate and want to hedge their risk. Those companies that are active internationally may also want to protect themselves against changes in interest rates in foreign currencies such as the Japanese yen.

Investment banks compete with each other in the trading of these financial  derivatives. Indeed, for these markets to work properly and bring benefits to the real economy, transparency and healthy competition are crucial.

Obviously, the picture may look very different if  derivatives markets are rigged to benefit the private interests of a few, because financial institutions decide to collude instead of competing. The decisions taken today provide appalling examples of such misconduct.

Let me recall, before I get to the facts, that these financial instruments derive their value from the level of a benchmark interest rate, such as LIBOR – which is used for various currencies including the Japanese yen (JPY) – or  EURIBOR, for the euro. These benchmarks are meant to reflect the cost of interbank lending in a given currency. They reflect an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of banks who are members of a panel.

In the cartel covering euro derivatives, we found that the participating banks coordinated with each other to influence the EURIBOR benchmark. They also discussed confidential and commercially sensitive information that they are not allowed to share with other market players. They exchanged on their pricing and trading strategies and trading positions. As I said before, the banks included in our settlement here are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale.

We also found a series of bilateral infringements covering yen  derivatives. The settlement here covers five leading global banks – UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Citigroup – as well as one cash broker, RP Martin, who facilitated the collusion. There were discussions between the
Page 42 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
banks' traders about the upcoming submissions to the panels for the relevant benchmarks – i.e. Yen LIBOR and, in one case, Euroyen TIBOR, which is an interest rate benchmark set in Tokyo. The aim of these talks between traders was to increase their banks' profits and in turn their own bonuses. They also shared commercially sensitive information of the type that competitors normally keep secret.

I repeat that the two decisions taken today in the euro and the yen cases are addressed to companies that agreed to settle with the Commission. These companies have decided to turn the page and acknowledge their wrongdoing under EU competition law. As a result, the investigation for them was shorter than it would otherwise have been – and I can add that these are two of the swiftest  cartel settlements the Commission has concluded since the introduction of our settlement procedure in 2008.
In line with that procedure, all companies received a 10% reduction of their respective  fines for agreeing to settle.

Barclays (in the euro case) and UBS (in the yen case) received full immunity from  fines because they were the first to reveal the existence of the infringement to the Commission. Similarly, Citigroup received immunity from  fines in relation to one of the infringements relating to yen.

Immunity, as well as  fines reductions for other companies that cooperated with the investigation, was granted in the context of our leniency programme. Let me stress that this has proved to be an extremely effective tool in the fight against cartels. Because they are secret, cartels are very difficult to detect and prove. Providing such incentives to companies that choose to reveal the existence of a  cartel to the Commission is simply indispensable for any public authority that is serious about detecting and sanctioning cartels.
Our investigations will now continue for a number of parties.
In the euro case, we have opened proceedings also against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan
Chase. In the yen case, we have also opened proceedings against the cash broker ICAP.

While we fully respect the presumption of innocence until the end of antitrust proceedings, the Commission is of course determined to pursue all those who may have been involved in a  cartel. If their participation is established, we will launch the corresponding Statement of Objections against them, and if our concerns are confirmed, they will indeed receive the adequate sanction.

I am convinced that the rigorous enforcement of competition rules against financial institutions that infringe them – including the facilitators of such violations – is essential for restoring trust in financial markets and in benchmark rates. Of course other efforts are needed at the regulatory level. This is why the Commission has proposed legislation to improve the reliability of financial benchmarks in September. The objective of the draft regulation is to avoid conflicts of interest, make sure that benchmarks reflect
the economic reality they are intended to measure and that they are used appropriately.

But on top of this, we need to ensure that there is no collusion, just like in any other sector of the economy. Antitrust enforcement therefore comes in complement to the action of financial regulators and authorities worldwide, including those that have sanctioned market abuses. Indeed, what is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not just the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the setting up of genuine cartels between a number of financial players.

Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Enforcing competition rules can help ensure that financial markets truly work at the service of the real economy, not the interests of a few.

HD      EU slaps record fines on banks for latest abuses

The European Union imposed a record 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in  fines on six institutions on
Wednesday for rigging key interest rates that affect vast sums of money around the world.

The sanction comes after several other massive penalties imposed on the world's biggest banks over the malpractices which have besmirched the reputation of the sector.

TD
After boom years on Wall Street and in London, the financial crisis of 2008 has exposed various abuses by banks, including the reporting of false interest rates or the hiding of junk home loans in  derivatives sold as high-quality assets.

On Wednesday, the European Union dredged out one more malpractice by the institutions, with German Deutsche Bankfined a total of 725 million euros for involvement in  cartel rigging of both the European Euribor  and Japanese Tibor rates.

French Societe Generale was  fined 446 million euros for manipulating the European  Euribor  rate, while British bank RBS, already mired in controversy, was  fined 391 million euros for involvement in cartels which rigged both rates.

The European Commission's anti-trust authorities had never previously imposed such big  fines overall, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a press conference.

"What is shocking is not only the manipulation of benchmark but (the)  cartel," said Almunia, adding that the fine was meant to both "punish and dissuade".

The commission is now investigating the alleged rigging of the Swiss franc, and does not exclude "more investigations in the same area", said Alumnia.
It is "not the end of the story", he warned.
In total, four financial institutions were involved in a  cartel which rigged the Euribor  rate and six in a
cartel which manipulated the Tibor rate.

In the Euribor  case, British bank Barclays benefited from immunity and will not pay a  fine because it revealed the existence of the rigging to the Commission.

Deutsche Bank was however  fined 466 million euros, and Societe Generale and RBS were  fined 131 million euros in the  Euribor  case.
Investigations are continuing concerning French bank Credit Agricole, HSBC of Britain and US bank
JPMorgan.
In the Tibor case, Swiss bank UBS avoided a  fine because it admitted the  cartel misdoing to the
Commission.

Deutsche Bank was  fined 259 million euros, RBS 260 million euros, JPMorgan 80 million euros, US bank
Citigroup 70 million euros and British broker RP Martin 247,000 euros in that case.

Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest lender, said it had already accounted for the penalty in its reserves.
According to Wednesday's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the bank has a share of more than
15-percent in the currency market.

Societe Generale, which said the  fine would not affect its full-year target, blamed the rigging on "one employee" who "acted without the knowledge of his hierachy and the management of the bank".

The investigations and  fines come after a separate scandal broke over the rigging of the London Libor rate, which is the benchmark rate that underpins the terms of $500 trillion of contracts ranging from mortgages to student loans around the world.

The Euribor,  Tibor and Libor interest rates are calculated slightly differently but fulfil a vital function as a reference for the rates which banks are charging to lend each other.

The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is among seven banks that have been slapped with a collective £1.4 billion fine for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial  derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA).

Four of these institutions participated in a  cartel relating to interest rate  derivatives denominated in the euro currency.

Six of them participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to interest rate  derivatives denominated in Japanese yen.

The Commission said this collusion between competitors is prohibited under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's cartel settlement procedure; the companies'  fines were reduced by 10% for agreeing to settle.

As part of this RBS has been  fined £324.45 million by the European Commission in relation to competition law breaches concerning interest rate derivatives referenced to the London Interbank Offered Rate based (Libor) on Japanese Yen Libor and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). Barclays was able to avoid a  fine of around 690 million for its involvement, after the bank received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel. RBS's  fine was in fact much lower than the bank's
continental European counter-parts Deutsche Bank, which was  fined 465.9 million, some 30% lower as a result of the leniency notice. Socit Gnrale received a 5% reduction at 445.9 million.

RBS was one of seven banks and brokers implicated in respect of Yen Libor competition infringements and has agreed to pay a settlement penalty of a little over 260 million to resolve the investigation.

RBS was also one of seven banks implicated in the  Euribor  competition infringement and has agreed to pay a settlement penalty of 131 million to resolve the investigation. Barclays was able to avoid a  fine of around 690 million for its involvement in the cartel after the bank received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel. Meanwhile, RBS's fine was much lower than the bank's continental European counter-parts Deutsche Bank, which was fined 465.9 million even with a 30% reduction as a result of the leniency notice. Socit Gnrale received a 5% reduction at 445.9 million.
RBS said both of the payments would be covered by provisions that had already been made.

The announcement follows the settlement reached by RBS in February this year with US and UK regulators in relation to investigations into submissions, communications and procedures around the setting of Libor.

RBS said that since becoming aware of improper conduct in connection with rate setting in 2011, its management had taken action to strengthen systems and controls governing its submissions of Libor and other trading rates.

Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, told the stockmarket: 'We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

'Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS.'

Eight banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank have agreed to pay a combined 1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) to the  European Commission to settle breaches in relation to Libor and Euribor.

Joaqun Almunia, European Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

'Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.'

A group of leading European and American banks will be  fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4bn) by the European Commission for the rigging of interest-rate benchmarks, a source close to the investigation revealed today.

The banks to be  fined are Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Barclays and Societe Generale.
'The total  fine is 1.7 billion euros,' a source told Reuters news agency.
If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest anti-trust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the
EU's competition regulator.

The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents.
They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives. JPMorgan and Barclays were in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank
offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 per cent reduction in  fines. UBS alerted the  European
Commission to the yen interest rate  derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates.

French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.
It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its Euribor  involvement on
Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent Euribor  fines on Nov. 5.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds.

Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

The current record for an EU  cartel fine is 1.47 billion euros for a  cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

Deutsche Bank and state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates.

The fine is the latest in a string of sanctions levied against RBS, which is set to reward its bankers with bonuses of £500million this year despite plunging losses at the taxpayer-backed lender.

The group has already been  fined £390million in the wake of the market manipulation scandal, where traders rigged the £180 trillion Libor rate.
It has also set aside £2.6billion to compensate millions who were mis-sold PPI insurance.

The bank has been forced to call in lawyers Clifford Chance after admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall.
The group was accused of putting companies into bankruptcy before buying up their property. RBS was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 for £45billion, and is still 82per cent owned by the
government.

French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.

If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest anti-trust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the
EU's competition regulator.

The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents.
They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives. JPMorgan and Barclays were in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank
offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 per cent reduction in  fines.

UBS alerted the  European Commission to the yen interest rate  derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates.

The fine is the latest in a string of sanctions levied against RBS, which is set to reward its bankers with bonuses of £500million this year despite plunging losses at the taxpayer-backed lender.

The group has already been  fined £390million in the wake of the market manipulation scandal, where traders rigged the £180 trillion Libor rate.
It has also set aside £2.6billion to compensate millions who were mis-sold PPI insurance.

The bank has been forced to call in lawyers Clifford Chance after admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall.

The group was accused of putting companies into bankruptcy before buying up their property.

RBS was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 for £45billion, and is still 82per cent owned by the government.

French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.
It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its Euribor  involvement on
Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent Euribor  fines on Nov. 5.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Commission spokesman for competition policy Antoine Colombani could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 per cent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds.

Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

The current record for an EU  cartel fine is 1.47 billion euros for a  cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

Eight global banking giants have been  fined a combined 1.7 billion euros (£1.4 billion) by the European Commission for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates, it was announced today.

HD          RBS among six global banking  giants hammered by Brussels with record £1.4bn fine over interest  rate rigging

LP
Some of the world’s biggest banks have been  fined a record £1.4bilion by Brussels for operating an
‘illegal cartel’ to rig interest rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six hammered by the  European Commission on Wednesday, receiving a £325million penalty.

TD
German’s biggest lender Deutsche Bank, French giant Societe Generale and JPMorgan are among those accused of colluding to manipulate interest rates in order to rig their own trades.

Barclays was also involved in the conspiracy, but escaped a £390million penalty because it notified the European Commission about the cartel. Swiss giant UBS received immunity after blowing the whistle, avoiding a record £2.1billion fine.

The combined fine marks the biggest ever imposed by the EC for breaching anti-trust rules, exceeding a £1.2billion fine levied last year on Royal Philips Electronics and nine others for a TV parts  cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EC’s vice president in charge of competition policy, said: ‘What is shocking is about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.’
Global fines for rate rigging hit £5billion following the latest settlements which included a £390million
fine for Deutsche Bank and £370million for Societe Generale.
But the costs are expected to soar as banks face a raft of lawsuits and investigations.

A number, including Barclays and RBS, have already been  fined by US and UK regulators for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor. The latest  fines are the result of a separate probe by the  European Commission into Libor rates denominated in euros and the Japanese yen. These are called the Euro Interbank Offered Rate – or  Euribor  – and JPY Libor.

These rates are used to price complex financial instruments called interest rate  derivatives which are traded in huge volumes. By manipulating the interest rates, traders managed to rig bets on these derivatives in their favour.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS were involved in the euro  cartel, which operated between 2005 and 2008. The Yen  cartel included UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup
and London-based broker RP Martin between 2007 and 2010.

On Wednesday the EC confirmed it is also investigating whether HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole were involved in the euro  cartel. ICAP, the broker founded by former Tory Party treasurer Michael Spencer, is also being investigated.

The EC is also probing whether the Swiss franc Libor rate was manipulated. At least 15 banks, including RBS and Barclays, are being investigated over allegations they rigged the £3trillion a day foreign currency market.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six global banking giants to accept  fines totalling €1.7billion (£1.4 billion) from the  European Commission today for their involvement in the latest interest rate rigging scandal.

The fines have echoes of last year’s then record penalties handed out as part of the Libor scandal, which saw Barlcays and RBS  fined £290million and £390million respectively by US and UK regulators.

The scandal also saw the resignations of both Barclays’ chief executive Bod Diamond and the bank’s chairman Marcus Aigus.

Deutsche Bank, UBS, Societe Generale, RP Martin and JPMorgan are the other banks which have accepted fines.

The settlements follow allegations they formed cartels to fix two key interest rates used to set the price at which banks lend money to each other for trillions of dollars-worth of financial products, from mortgages to complex financial products.

RBS has agreed to pay €391million (£325 million) for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor  - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London market interest rate - known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Remarkably the bank's shares were little changed following the announcement, up 0.36 per cent at 332.2p.

The sanctions are the first from the Commission on rate manipulation and the highest yet for European antitrust enforcement.
Barclays bank avoided a potential €690 million (£573 million) penalty for blowing the whistle on the
Euribor cartel. The bank's shares were 1.26 per cent lower at 262.85p at mid-day however.
Swiss bank UBS also avoided what would have been the largest financial penalty of €2.5billion
(£2billion) after it alerted regulators to rate rigging in the Yen Libor market.

As a result Deutsche Bank received the largest fine of €724million (£601million) after it admitted colluding to rig both the yen Libor rate and the Euribor  rate.

Page 64 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Citigroup received a discount of €55million (£45million) for cooperating over one of the cartels and so received a fine of €70million (£58million) rather than €120million (£100million).

But Credit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan have all refused to settle with the Commission over the investigation into  Euribor  rate-rigging, which means investigations will continue and could lead to much bigger fines being imposed on the banks.
City inter-broker ICAP is also being prosecuted by the Commission for alleged yen Libor rigging.

ICAP, founded by Michael Spencer was  fined $87million (£53million) by UK and US regulators the for manipulating Libor between 2006 and 2010.

EC antitrust commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: ‘What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

‘Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.’
He also told reporters that today's  fine were ‘not the end of the story’.

‘Even for the yen case, we have investigations going on against those firms who have not wanted to settle, he said. ‘We have more work to do on the collusion around those two benchmarks, and beyond these benchmarks.’

Mr Almunia added the Commission was also investigating whether there had been manipulation in the foreign currency exchange market.

Authorities worldwide have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS has paid the largest penalty yet in the clampdown,  fined $1.5 billion (£917 million) late last year. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bank's bosses ‘condemn the behaviour’ of those
involved in attempted rate rigging.

He said: ‘We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

‘Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue.’

A statement released by Barclays bank said: 'The  European Commission has today announced that it has reached a settlement with Barclays and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning  Euribor.  The settlement acknowledges that the banks’ conduct infringed EC competition law by attempting to distort the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives referencing Euribor.

'As today’s announcement from the Commission confirms, Barclays voluntarily reported the  Euribor conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied'

ICAP, founded by Michael Spencer was  fined $87million (£53million) by UK and US regulators the for manipulating Libor between 2006 and 2010.

EC antitrust commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: ‘What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

‘Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.’
He also told reporters that today's  fine were ‘not the end of the story’.

‘Even for the yen case, we have investigations going on against those firms who have not wanted to settle, he said. ‘We have more work to do on the collusion around those two benchmarks, and beyond these benchmarks.’

Mr Almunia added the Commission was also investigating whether there had been manipulation in the foreign currency exchange market.

Authorities worldwide have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS has paid the largest penalty yet in the clampdown,  fined $1.5 billion (£917 million) late last year. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bank's bosses ‘condemn the behaviour’ of those
involved in attempted rate rigging.

He said: ‘We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

‘Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue.’

A statement released by Barclays bank said: 'The  European Commission has today announced that it has reached a settlement with Barclays and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning  Euribor.  The settlement acknowledges that the banks’ conduct infringed EC competition law by attempting to distort the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives referencing Euribor.

'As today’s announcement from the Commission confirms, Barclays voluntarily reported the  Euribor conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied'

A group of six financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN), U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. (C) and broker RP Martin were also fined by the European Commission in the latest chapter of the rate-rigging scandal that has shaken the financial sector.

TD
The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as  Euribor,  and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor  case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor  manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the  Euribor  settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage. ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

(FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 12/4/13)
By Max Colchester, David Enrich and Vanessa Mock
European Union antitrust authorities are set to hit a group of major banks with heavy  fines as soon as
Wednesday for allegedly colluding to rig interbank lending rates, people familiar with the matter said.

TD
The fines to be levied by the European Commission relate to alleged efforts to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.  The penalties could total several billion euros, people familiar with the matter said. The EU is expected to conclude that a handful of banks broke EU laws forbidding cartels and collusive behavior, although the announcement could be delayed a week, these people said.

The EU investigations are targeting Germany's Deutsche Bank AG; France's Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA; the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; and the U.S.'s J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., said the people familiar with the matter.

UBS AG and Barclays PLC struck immunity deals with the EU antitrust authorities after they agreed to cooperate with investigators and share information about other banks.

The commission's probes are the latest in a long line of investigations by several national regulators, including in the U.S. and the U.K., into whether banks colluded to manipulate benchmarks, including the more widely used London interbank offered rate.

The EU antitrust investigation became public in October 2011, when agents simultaneously raided the offices of multiple European banks. Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, has vowed to make the probe an "absolute priority," describing the alleged collusion as "quite shocking." He previously said that interest-rate  derivatives markets were worth $20 trillion in 2011. The  European Commission wasn't available for comment.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Almunia's office contacted some of the banks to inform them of the likely range of fines the EU planned to impose, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Under EU rules, a company can be fined up to 10% of its yearly global revenue for each  cartel in which it has
participated.

Executives at some banks have previously expressed surprise at the anticipated large size of the  fines. Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS nonetheless indicated to authorities that they would accept the punishment without a fight, these people say. Others, such as Credit Agricole, have said they would contest the penalties.

In a separate probe into benchmark rates, the commission is continuing to investigate possible collusion among banks and brokers in lending rates denominated in Swiss francs.

HD         Banks Fined Record £1.42bn For Rate-Rigging
WC        563 words

LP
Eight global banks have been  fined a combined £1.42bn by the  European Commission for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was handed a £325m penalty for its role though Barclays was spared a bill because it blew the whistle on the wrongdoing.

TD
The other banks named as participating in the alleged  cartel were Deutsche Bank - which is to pay the largest individual penalty of £602m - Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, HSBC, JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup.
The UK brokerage RP Martin was ordered to pay £205,000.

HSBC's role was still under consideration, the Commission said, though the collective  fine amounted to the biggest handed down by the EU.

The benchmarks involved were the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents - all used to price hundreds of trillions of pounds in assets ranging from mortgages to  derivatives.

The EU said that not every bank was involved in manipulating every rate but competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the most shocking aspect of the case was the "collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

Although other  fines have been levied against individual banks by US and UK regulators for manipulating interest rates, the Commission said it has sole responsibility for punishing cartels in the European Economic Area.
Part-privatised RBS was previously  fined £390m over the rate-rigging while Barclays was handed a
£290m penalty.

Both banking groups - along with London-listed HSBC - are currently subject to a separate probe by the Financial Conduct Authority and other world regulators into the alleged manipulation of foreign currency markets.

It emerged that eight personnel - six of them at Barclays and two at RBS - were suspended as the investigation got underway.

Both banks have also set aside billions of pounds to cover the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) while the industry is also being urged to quickly compensate businesses who were wrongly sold interest rate swap products.
In the wake of today's penalty, RBS said it had already made provisions for the payments.

Its statement said: "Since becoming aware in 2011 of improper conduct in connection with rate setting, RBS management has taken action to strengthen significantly the systems and controls governing its submissions of Libor and other trading rates."


Page 76 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Chairman Sir Philip Hampton added: "We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue.

"The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities.
"There is no place for it at RBS," he said.

Barclays also released a statement that recognised its wrongdoing in relation to euro rates but added: "Barclays voluntarily reported the  Euribor  conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation.

"In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied."

The European Commission has fined eight international banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, a record 1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) for rigging crucial interest rate benchmarks

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of the benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between the banks which are supposed to be competing with each other."

TD
Almunia, pictured, added: “If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these  cartel
traders you will be appalled."

RBS, the taxpayer-controlled bank, has been  fined  391 million. That is on top of the £390 million it paid to UK and US regulators earlier this year.

Barclays, which was  fined £290 million last year and saw the resignations of its chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius over the Libor-rigging scandal, escaped a European  fine because, along with UBS, it acted as a whistleblower to the commission.

If it had not done so it would have been  fined  690 million and UBS 2.5 billion. The Swiss bank has already paid the equivalent of $1.5 billion (£915 million) in  fines of rate rigging.

Deutsche Bank landed the largest EC  fine of 725 million. France’s Société Générale was  fined  446 million. JPMorgan has to pay 80 million, Citigroup 70 million and London broker RP Martin 247,000. Today’s fines take the total imposed by UK, US and European regulators to $6 billion.

Almunia said: “Today’s decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a
few."

The benchmarks involved were the Yen London interbank rate and Euribor.  These rates are used to price assets running into hundreds of trillions of dollars ranging from derivatives to mortgages.

Three banks — HSBC, Credit Agricole and JPMorgan — rejected the commission’s offer to settle early on the Euribor  case and London broker ICAP on the Yen case. All face formal antitrust charges which could lead to larger  fines.

HD           Global Finance: EU Bank Fines on Euribor  Are Expected Within Days

European Union antitrust authorities are set to hit a group of major banks with heavy  fines as soon as
Wednesday for allegedly colluding to rig interbank lending rates, people familiar with the matter said.

The fines to be levied by the European Commission relate to alleged efforts to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.  The penalties could total several billion euros, people familiar with the matter said. The EU is expected to conclude that a handful of banks broke EU laws forbidding cartels and collusive behavior, although the announcement could be delayed a week, these people said.

TD
The EU investigations are targeting Germany's Deutsche Bank AG; France's Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA; the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; and the U.S.'s J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., said the people familiar with the matter.

UBS AG and Barclays PLC struck immunity deals with the EU antitrust authorities after they agreed to cooperate with investigators and share information about other banks.

The commission's probes are the latest in a long line of investigations by several national regulators, including in the U.S. and the U.K., into whether banks colluded to manipulate benchmarks, including the more widely used London interbank offered rate.

The EU antitrust investigation became public in October 2011, when agents simultaneously raided the offices of multiple European banks. Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, has vowed to make the probe an "absolute priority," describing the alleged collusion as "quite shocking." He previously said that interest-rate  derivatives markets were worth $20 trillion in 2011. The  European Commission wasn't available for comment.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Almunia's office contacted some of the banks to inform them of the likely range of fines the EU planned to impose, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Under EU rules, a company can be fined up to 10% of its yearly global revenue for each  cartel in which it has participated.
Executives at some banks have previously expressed surprise at the anticipated large size of the
fines. Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS nonetheless indicated to authorities that they would
accept the punishment without a fight, these people say. Others, such as Credit Agricole, have said
they would contest the penalties.

In a separate probe into benchmark rates, the commission is continuing to investigate possible collusion among banks and brokers in lending rates denominated in Swiss francs.

HD        UPDATE 3-EU Commission fines banks 1.7 bln euros for benchmark rigging

BRUSSELS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators vowed to keep investigating rate- rigging on Wednesday as they slapped a record 1.7 billion euro ($2.3 billion) penalty on six financial institutions including Deutsche Bank, RBS and JPMorgan.

The fines by the Commission, which along with authorities around the globe has been examining the manipulation of London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro equivalent  Euribor,  takes the tally of penalties related to the scandal to almost $6 billion.

TD
Confirming what a source familiar with the matter had previously told Reuters, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he had been shocked at the scale of the scam and was sending a clear message that Brussels would fight and impose sanctions on cartels.

Deutsche Bank, which has yet to be  fined by U.S. and UK regulators as part of separate investigations into benchmark interest-rate fixing, received the highest  fine of 725.4 million euros.

Germany's largest lender and RBS were  fined for their involvement in both the  Euribor  and Libor cartels.

Also fined were JPMorgan and Citigroup, France's Societe Generale and UK-based brokerage RP Martin.

Swiss bank UBS and Britain's Barclays avoided  fines of 2.5 billion euros and 690 million respectively for revealing the existence of the  cartel.

U.S. and French banks were penalised for the first time in a scandal in which traders fiddled rates used as a reference point to price around $400 trillion worth of products worldwide, from  derivatives to mortgages and student loans.

Some banks declined to settle with the EU. France's Credit Agricole and UK-based HSBC are disputing allegations, while the role played by UK-based brokerage ICAP remains under investigation.
JPMorgan has only settled allegations relating to yen-denominated Libor, not  Euribor.

Almunia said the Commission would continue to investigate collusion allegations in other benchmarks, including the Swiss Franc currency and foreign exchange markets.

"This will not be the end of the story, neither for interest rate  derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks," Almunia told a Brussels news conference.

"And one of the areas where, as you know, we have received some elements of information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex, forex markets and the relations with forex benchmarks."
SOBERING REMINDER

RBS Chairman Philip Hampton said the bank's board and new management team condemned the behaviour of individuals involved in rate rigging.

Page 84 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue," Hampton said.

Deutsche Bank said it had already set aside enough money to cover the costs of the  fine, while JPMorgan and HSBC vowed to vigorously defend themselves over  Euribor  allegations. ICAP, RP Martin and Societe Generale declined comment.
Banks that have settled the EU allegations qualified for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines. Authorities around the world have so far handed down a total of $3.7 billion in  fines to UBS, RBS,
Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to U.S. and UK regulators for rate-rigging. EU fines in such instances can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover.

Other banks to be penalised for breaking EU competition rules include JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin.
Societe Generale was also  fined for its manipulation of  Euribor,  while Barclays escaped a £572m  fine
for revealing the existence of the  cartel.

The bank to receive the lowest  fine (£58m) was Citigroup, which turned to a Brussels-based Cleary team led by competition partner Robbert Snelders and included associates Luuk Bressers, Max Kaufman and Romanie Dendooven.

KWM, which has played a role in co-ordinating RBS' dealings with regulators across the globe, took the lead for the bank on its €391m (£325m) settlement with the EC.
The firm's team was led by London competition partner Tom Usher, with support from associates Emma
Radcliffe, Fiona beattie, Lisa Kaltenbrunner and Tonia Gilbert.

Clifford Chance - which previously acted for RBS in its Libor settlement with UK regulators - is understood to have acted for Barclays on the latest settlement.

Elsewhere, Slaughters' competition litigation head Michael Rowe acted for Deutsche Bank, which received the largest penalty of all the banks (£602m). Rowe was assisted by Will Turtle, Vassilena Karadakova and Murray Reeve.

Gibson Dunn & Crutcher acted for Swiss bank UBS, which was spared any penalty by regulators after it revealed the existence of a Yen interest rate  derivatives cartel.

London-based senior disputes partner Philip Rocher -  who also advised the bank on its £160m settlement with UK regulators last year - acted for UBS alongside Brussels competition partner David Wood.

Speaking on the settlement, EC vice-president for competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: "What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, Slaughter and May and King & Wood Mallesons SJ Berwin (KWM) have taken roles as eight global banks reach a settlement with the European Commission (EC) for forming illegal cartels to rig interest rate  derivatives. The EC today (4 December) fined eight banks - including the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Deutsche Bank - a total of €1.7bn (£1.4bn) for their roles in rigging interest rates in euro- and Japanese yen-denominated  derivatives.

The EC today (4 December)  fined eight banks - including the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Deutsche Bank - a total of €1.7bn (£1.4bn) for their roles in rigging interest rates in euro- and Japanese yen-denominated  derivatives.

Other banks to be penalised for breaking EU competition rules include JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin.
Societe Generale was also  fined for its manipulation of  Euribor,  while Barclays escaped a £572m  fine
for revealing the existence of the  cartel.

The bank to receive the lowest  fine (£58m) was Citigroup, which turned to a Brussels-based Cleary team led by competition partner Robbert Snelders and included associates Luuk Bressers, Max Kaufman and Romanie Dendooven.

KWM, which has played a role in co-ordinating RBS' dealings with regulators across the globe, took the lead for the bank on its €391m (£325m) settlement with the EC.
The firm's team was led by London competition partner Tom Usher, with support from associates Emma
Radcliffe, Fiona beattie, Lisa Kaltenbrunner and Tonia Gilbert.

Clifford Chance - which previously acted for RBS in its Libor settlement with UK regulators - is understood to have acted for Barclays on the latest settlement.

Elsewhere, Slaughters' competition litigation head Michael Rowe acted for Deutsche Bank, which received the largest penalty of all the banks (£602m). Rowe was assisted by Will Turtle, Vassilena Karadakova and Murray Reeve.

Gibson Dunn & Crutcher acted for Swiss bank UBS, which was spared any penalty by regulators after it revealed the existence of a Yen interest rate  derivatives cartel.

London-based senior disputes partner Philip Rocher -  who also advised the bank on its £160m settlement with UK regulators last year - acted for UBS alongside Brussels competition partner David Wood.
Pinsent Masons' senior competition partner Alan Davis also took a role for broker RP Martin, which was
fined £205,000 for its role in the yen  cartel.

Speaking on the settlement, EC vice-president for competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: "What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

HD          EU fines in rate case expected within  days; European authorities ready steep fines against banks over allegations of collusion on Euribor

European Union antitrust authorities are set to hit a group of major banks with heavy  fines as soon as
Wednesday for allegedly colluding to rig interbank lending rates, people familiar with the matter said.

The fines to be levied by the European Commission relate to alleged efforts to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.  The penalties could total several billion euros, people familiar with the matter said. The EU is expected to conclude that a handful of banks broke EU laws forbidding cartels and collusive behaviour, although the announcement could be delayed a week, these people said.

TD
The EU investigations are targeting Germany's Deutsche Bank; France's Societe Generale and Crédit Agricole; the UK's HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland; and the US' JP Morgan, say the people familiar with the investigation.

UBS and Barclays struck immunity deals with the EU antitrust authorities after they agreed to cooperate with investigators and share information about other banks.

The commission's probes are the latest in a long line of investigations by several national regulators, including in the US and the UK, into whether banks colluded to manipulate benchmarks, including the more widely used London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

The EU antitrust investigation became public in October 2011, when agents simultaneously raided the offices of multiple European banks. Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, has vowed to make the probe an "absolute priority," describing the alleged collusion as "quite shocking". He previously said that interest-rate  derivatives markets were worth $20 trillion in 2011. The  European Commission wasn't immediately available for comment.

A few weeks ago, Almunia's office contacted some of the banks to inform them of the likely range of fines the EU planned to impose, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Under EU rules, a company can be fined up to 10% of its yearly global revenue for each  cartel in which it has participated.

Executives at some banks have previously expressed surprise at the anticipated large size of the  fines. Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS nonetheless indicated to authorities that they would accept the punishment without a fight, these people say. Others, such as Crédit Agricole, have said they would contest the penalties.

In a separate probe into benchmark rates, the commission is continuing to investigate possible collusion among banks and brokers in lending rates denominated in Swiss francs.

The European Commission has collectively fined 6 international financial institutions €1.7bn (£1.4bn) for their involvement in the manipulation of benchmark rates.

Eight international financial institutions were accused of participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
Deutsche Bank and RBS were handed  fines of €725m and €391m respectively for their involvement in manipulating both the yen London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR).
Société Générale received a  fine of €445m for its involvement in the rigging of the  Euribor  rate.

Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale received a reduction in their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme.
Over yen Libor, JP Morgan has been  fined €79m and Citigroup received a  fine of €70m.

Citigroup received full immunity for one of the infringements in which it participated, avoiding a  fine of around €55m
Wholesale broking firm RP Martin received a  fine of €247,000.

Barclays was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 leniency notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.
UBS was also granted full immunity for its participation in revealing the  cartel, avoiding a fine of around
€2.5bn for five of the seven infringements.

Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."
In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
JPMorgan and the investigation will continue under the standard  cartel procedure.

HD        EU Fines Eight Financial  Institutions EUR1.7 Bln for Fixing Benchmarks

BRUSSELS--A group of eight financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN), U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. (C) and broker RP Martin were also fined by the European Commission in the latest chapter of the rate-rigging scandal that has shaken the financial sector.

TD
The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as  Euribor,  and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor  case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor  manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the  Euribor  settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage. ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

BRUSSELS--A group of six financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN), U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. (C) and broker RP Martin were also fined by the European Commission in the latest chapter of the rate-rigging scandal that has shaken the financial sector.

TD
The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as  Euribor,  and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor  case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor  manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the  Euribor  settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage. ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

The European Commission has finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest rate  derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion, while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million, as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called  cartel to the Commission.

TD
The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to interest rate  derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million.

Joaquín Almunia

"What is shocking about the [Libor] and [Euribor]  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. "Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for
financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro interest rate  derivatives market, which covered Euribor  and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005-May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate  derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of Euribor  as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, which covered JPY Libor and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel discussed certain JPY Libor submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive
information relation to either trading positions or future JPY Libor submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY Libor submissions.

In relation to the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement  cartel procedure. For the  cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

HD        EU fines banks €1.7bn for fixing  global interest  rates

Six banks and one broker were hit with a record €1.7bn  fine from Europe's top competition enforcer on
Wednesday after admitting to participating in a  cartel to rig two global interest rate benchmarks.

The multi-party settlements unveiled by the  European Commission are the first results from a sweeping two-year probe into separate conspiracies to fix the Japan focused Yen Libor and its European sister benchmark  Euribor,  which allegedly involves a total of up to 10 financial groups.

TD
Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland accepted taking part in both cartels and will pay fines of
€725m and €391m respectively. Société Générale will pay €446m for attempting to rig the Euribor
benchmark and profit from related  derivatives. For Yen Libor related abuses JPMorgan accepted a  fine
of €79.8m and Citi €70m. The broker RP Martin will pay €247,000 for facilitating the  cartel.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. But the banks accepted participating in the  Euribor  and Yen Libor cartels respectively.

UBS's own fine would have totalled €2.5bn had it not won immunity for Yen Libor, putting the already record total fines in the shade.

Barclays'  fine for euribor  transgressions would have totalled €690m without immunity, the commission said. The bank said in a statement that it was not part of the commission's investigation into the manipulation of Yen Libor.

Several banks and interdealer brokers - HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Crédit Agricole for  Euribor  and the broker ICAP for Yen Libor - rejected a settlement and are likely to face formal antitrust charges from Brussels, which will pave the way to a  fine at a later point.

JPMorgan said in a statement that its Yen-Libor  fine related to "two former traders during a one-month period in early 2007" and added that it would "defend itself fully" against the commission's allegations of Euribor-rigging.

Even with these holdouts, the EU penalty breaks antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. Additional  fines for other members of the  cartel would be expected in a year or two.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commission, said the cartels were "appalling examples of the misconduct" in the financial sector.

"What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."
The EU settlement  fines bring the financial sector's total penalty tally for benchmark manipulation to
$5.8bn, a sum that is expected to continue rising as regulators conclude probes and private lawsuits
stack up.

More than a dozen banks and interdealer brokers were originally under the spotlight of the three separate EU probes, which cover Yen Libor,  Euribor  and the less advanced Swiss Franc Libor case.

Before the EU decision, four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker ICAP settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses. Most of the penalties related to manipulation or false reporting, until now RBS was the only institution that admitted violating antitrust rules in its settlement with the US Department of Justice.

While the full details of the settlement have yet to be published, the multi-bank EU cases provide a more rounded account of collusion across the sector, shedding light on the abuses within banks and the links between traders acting in concert to influence rate movements to their own advantage.

So-called hybrid cartel settlements are rare in the EU. Unlike the US authorities, the commission prefers to close cartel cases simultaneously with all groups involved rather than pursue one group at a time.
The only other example of a hybrid settlement is an animal feed phosphate  cartel late in 2010, where all but one company settled.

The main incentive to settle a  cartel under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out can fight the charges in Commission organised hearings and eventually appeal against any decision in the courts.

The hybrid deal, however, reduces the advantages from settling early. Brussels must still devote resources to completing its investigation of the holdouts and defending any decision through the courts. This full decision will also include a fuller assessment of facts, providing extra ammunition for private lawsuits against groups that settled as well.

RBS chairman Philip Hampton said it was a sobering reminder of those past failings: "We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but
also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

Citigroup said it was "pleased" that the commission's investigation was over while Deutsche Bank said it had invested €1bn in improving its compliance and did not need to make extra provisions to cover the costs of today's  fines.

Six banks and a broker agreed to pay  fines for taking part in at least one  cartel, two were spared  fines for having alerted authorities to the issue, and the rest have rejected settlements and are likely to face formal antitrust charges from Brussels.

HD        Euribor fines reveal vital pieces to scandal's puzzle

The fines were big on number but short on detail.

The €1.7bn of  fines meted out by the  European Commission on Wednesday to six financial institutions, lacked the accompanying embarrassing chatroom conversations - where traders have agreed to alter a benchmark rate in exchange for a bottle of Bollinger, or even day-old sushi - that has become de rigueur in settlements arising from the sprawling Libor scandal.

TD
This is because Europe's top competition watchdog does not publish findings until the conclusion of all relevant investigations. With HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JPMorgan refusing to settle allegations that they attempted to rig  Euribor,  and with broker ICAP's role still undetermined - plus a continuing parallel probe into the manipulation of Swiss franc denominated Libor - it could be at least two years before similarly incriminating messages are published.

But even without the tawdry details, the commission's settlement announcement still provided vital pieces in the fragmented jigsaw puzzle that the Libor scandal has become.

While as many as 20 financial institutions are being probed by at least 10 authorities around the world, only five companies before Wednesday had settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses - Barclays, UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland, ICAP and Rabobank.

For Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, JPMorgan and Citigroup, the EU settlement constituted the first public admissions that they had been involved in benchmark-rate manipulation; and when institutions settle with the commission they must admit antitrust infringements.

These admissions mean the benchmark-manipulation scandal is pushed squarely into the eurozone and the US.

Deutsche and SocGen, the twin pillars of the eurozone's financial markets, landed the two largest individual fines, at €725m and €446m respectively.

While Deutsche's settlement with US, UK and German authorities has been pushed back until next year, its fine from the commission does not bode well for its overall exposure. The bank said it had
provisioned for its commission  fine.

The Financial Times first reported 18 months ago that Deutsche and SocGen were part of an alleged cartel being probed by authorities. Philippe Moryoussef, a francophone trader formerly at Barclays, allegedly communicated with traders at banks including Deutsche, SocGen, Crédit Agricole and HSBC, the FT reported at the time.
At the time French politicians portrayed Libor-manipulation as a London problem.

A lawyer for Mr Moryoussef, who is based in Singapore, did not respond on Wednesday to an email seeking comment.

One person familiar with the  Euribor  investigation said the bulk of email evidence parsed by the commission is written in French. Some of the anonymised and translated emails, seen by the FT, include one trader boasting about how many other traders at rival banks he was in contact with.

"Could you tell the guys in the treasury department to put a low 12-month fixing?" he writes to a trader at another bank.

"OK, done," comes the reply. The trader then writes: "Thanks! If you need high or low fixings, do not hesitate... I ask 4 or 5 banks in general."

The geographic politics of Libor have been highlighted by its global nature. While the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission was the first regulator to start probing rate-rigging back in 2008, it is yet to fine a US bank. This has led to some criticism - from the UK in particular, which has hitherto borne the brunt of the Libor settlements - that the investigation has become overly political.

Citi could hardly escape involvement - a yen-derivatives trader who joined the bank from UBS now faces criminal charges in the US and the UK. He is yet to enter a plea to either set of charges.

On his UK indictment, the trader is alleged to have conspired with employees at all the institutions named in the Yen-Libor  cartel by the commission on Wednesday - RBS, Deutsche, JPMorgan, Citi and RPMartin. In addition, however, he is accused on the UK indictment of conspiring with employees of HSBC, Tullett Prebon and Rabobank.

Despite Rabobank's $1bn  fine that it paid to US, UK and Dutch regulators in October - and the departure of its chief executive - the Dutch co-operative escaped even a mention by the commission on Wednesday, even though it responded to the commission's request for information more than a year
ago.
Both Rabobank and the commission declined to comment.

However legal experts expressed concern that the commission's investigation could have been curtailed for expediency's sake.

"It seems to me that the commission have likely compromised the scope of their investigation in the very obvious rush to be seen to deal with this quickly," said Lianne Craig, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld & Co, which is advising claimants in the US and UK with Libor-related damages claims. "It is also telling that the two currencies that have been omitted are sterling and US dollar - those relating to the jurisdictions where claimants are most likely to bring claims, and where claimant law firms are most active."

Moreover, the timeframe that the commission investigated could also limit banks' exposure to follow-on damages actions.

"Where people have lost out on Libor-manipulation, they have lost out due to systemic manipulation where banks were lowballing their rates during the credit crisis, as opposed to when traders were colluding to benefit their own trading books," said Stephen Critchley, a competition lawyer at Collyer Bristow.

Not only did lowballing tend to occur in sterling and dollar-denominated Libor but also it occurred as the worst financial crisis in a generation took hold in 2008 - the very end of the period of  Euribor-rigging  that the commission investigated.

European  Commission  Text: Seven 'Infringements' Found

BRUSSELS (MNI) - The following are excerpts from the announcement
Wednesday
by the European  Commission  of fines levied against several European and U.S. banks for collusion in the alleged manipulation of key international benchmarks:



Antitrust: Commission fines banks E1.71 billion for participating in cartels in the interest rate derivatives industry

The European  Commission  has fined eight international financial institutions a total of E1.712 billion for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). Four of these institutions participated in a cartel relating to interest rate derivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or
more bilateral cartels relating to interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese yen. Such collusion between competitors is prohibited by Article 101 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the
EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's cartel settlement procedure; the companies' fines were reduced by 10% for agreeing to settle.

Joaquin Almunia, Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy,
said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing
with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.
Healthy
competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly,
at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

Interest rate derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products which are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. They derive their value
Page 117 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
from the level of a benchmark interest rate, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) - which is used for various currencies including the Japanese yen (JPY) - or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), for the euro.
These benchmarks reflect an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of
banks who are members of a panel (panel banks). They are meant to reflect the cost of interbank lending in a given currency and serve as a basis for various financial derivatives. Investment banks compete with each other in the trading of these derivatives. The levels of these benchmark rates may affect either
the
cash flows that a bank receives from a counterparty, or the cash flow it needs to pay to the counterparty under interest rate derivatives contracts.

The cartel in Euro interest rate derivatives (EIRD) The EIRD cartel operated between September 2005 and May 2008. The settling parties are Barclays ,
Deutsche Bank , RBS and Societe Generale . The cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for these derivatives. Traders of different
banks discussed their bank's submissions for the calculation of the EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

The Commission's investigation started with unannounced inspections in October 2011. The Commission opened proceedings in March 2013. Barclays was not
fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency
Notice
for revealing the existence of the cartel to the Commission. Deutsche Bank , RBS
and Societe Generale  received a reduction of their fines for their cooperation
in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. These companies
received a further fine reduction of 10% for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against
Credit Agricole , HSBC  and JPMorgan  and the investigation will continue under the
standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.


the
The cartels in Yen interest rate derivatives (YIRD) In the YIRD sector,
Commission uncovered seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between one
and 10 months in the period from 2007 to 2010. The collusion included discussions between traders of the participating banks on certain JPY LIBOR submissions. The traders involved also exchanged, on occasions, commercially sensitive information relating either to trading positions or to future JPY LIBOR submissions (and in one of the infringements relating to certain future submissions for the Euroyen TIBOR - Tokyo interbank offered rate). The banks involved in one or more of the infringements are UBS , RBS, Deutsche Bank , Citigroup and JPMorgan . The broker RP Martin facilitated one of the infringements by using its contacts with a number of JPY LIBOR panel banks that
did not participate in the infringement, with the aim of influencing their JPY LIBOR submissions.

The Commission opened proceedings in February 2013. UBS received full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing to the Commission the existence of the infringements. Citigroup also benefited from full immunity for its participation in one bilateral infringement. For their cooperation with the investigation, the Commission granted fine reductions to Citigroup , Deutsche Bank , RBS and RP Martin, under the Commission's leniency programme. The companies have also been granted a fine reduction of 10% for
Page 118 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

In the context of the same investigation, the Commission has also opened proceedings against the cash broker ICAP. This investigation continues under the
standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.

The fines The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006
Guidelines on fines.

In setting the level of fines, the Commission took into account the banks'
value of sales for the products concerned within the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringements, their geographic scope and respective durations.

and
UBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels
thereby avoided a fine of around E2.5 billion for its participation in five of the seven infringements. Citigroup  received full immunity for one of the infringements in which it participated, thereby avoiding a fine of around E55 million.

Background on the products concerned Derivatives are contracts traded on financial markets that are used to transfer risk. They serve as an insurance mechanism against price movements and reduce the volatility of companies' cash flows, which in turn results in more reliable forecasting, lower capital requirements, and higher capital productivity. In recent years derivatives
have
developed into a main pillar of the international financial system and are an indispensable tool for risk management and investment purposes.

The most common basic interest rate derivatives are: forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, interest rate options, and, interest rate futures. Interest rate derivatives may be traded over the counter (OTC) or, in the case of interest rate futures, exchange traded. They derive their value from
a benchmark interest rate.

The products concerned by the EIRD cartel are Euro interest rate derivatives linked to the EURIBOR and/or the Euro Over-Night Index Average (EONIA). The products concerned by the cartels are the Japanese Yen interest rate derivatives linked to the JPY LIBOR (and in the case of one infringement also Euroyen TIBOR).

The EURIBOR, JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR are benchmark interest rates intended to reflect the cost of interbank lending in Euros or Japanese Yen respectively. These benchmarks are widely used in the international money markets and they are based on the relevant panel banks' individual quotes submitted daily to the relevant calculation agent.


used
On 18 September 2013, the Commission proposed a Regulation on indices
as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts such as LIBOR
or
EURIBOR. See IP/13/841. The planned measures aim at helping restoring confidence
in the integrity of benchmarks following the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals.

Today's decisions are the eighth and ninth settlement decisions since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008. They are
one
of the swiftest cartel settlements decided by the Commission, showing the full

potential of the efficiencies offered by the settlement procedure. Under a cartel settlement, companies that have participated in a cartel acknowledge their participation in the infringement and their liability for it. The cartel settlement procedure is based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 and allows
the
Commission to apply a simplified procedure and thereby reduce the length of the
investigation. This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs;
good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker
decisions and a 10% reduction in fines.

The verdict is out. After a three-year investigation, the  European Commission announced, on 4
December, a first round of  fines of €1.71 billion for participation in cartels in markets for financial
derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). This record combined financial penalty for
cases concerning cartels or abuse of dominant position has been slapped on six banks and a broker that
cooperated with the EU executive. Other cases are pending.

TD
The institutions involved participated in regular, organised exchanges of their strategies and commercially sensitive information in breach of EU competition rules, practices that led to large-scale manipulation of benchmark interest rates to the advantage of banks, either to settle transactions to their advantage or to mask their financial situation. These rates are used as a reference for the pricing or remuneration of hundreds of thousands of billion euro in assets and financial products worldwide, including mortgages and derivatives. The case surfaced in 2012 and has already resulted in  fines of US$3.5 billion, imposed among others by the United States on four banks - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Union des Banques Suisses (UBS) and Rabobank - and on a British cash broker, ICAP.

With this decision, the Commission "has two aims: to punish and to deter," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. It nevertheless took into account the cooperation of eight financial institutions that recognised their wrongs and reached a settlement with it. This resulted in either a reduction of their  fines or total immunity for revealing the fraud. The executive distinguished two types of infringement: one concerning euro interest rate  derivatives (Euribor),  which involved four institutions, and the other consisting of one or more bilateral cartels concerning yen (JPY) interest rate  derivatives, involving six entities. Certain banks - RBS and Deutsche Bank - participated in both infringements. Deutsche Bank alone has been  fined €725 million (see table).

For the Euribor  rate cartel, which lasted from September 2005 to May 2008, Deutsche Bank, RBS, Gale and Barclays settled with the EU executive. They benefited from immunity, thus dodging a  fine of €690 million.

For the JPY Libor and Tibor (Tokyo interbank offered rate)  cartel, which ran from 2007 to 2010, the institutions concerned by the decision are RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan, as well as UBS, which received immunity for its cooperation in the investigation, thus avoiding a  fine of around €2.5 billion for its participation in five of the seven infringements. The British broker RP Martin was  fined
€247,000 for facilitating one of the infringements by using its contacts with a number of JPY Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringement, with the aim of influencing their JPY Libor submissions.
OTHER CASES

"But this is not the end of the story," explained Almunia. In the  Euribor  investigation, a procedure has been initiated against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, he said. "If their participation is confirmed, the companies will be sent a statement of objections" in the context of a standard  cartel procedure. Crédit agricole and HSBC chose to discontinue their negotiations with the Commission because they refused to assume the responsibilities entailed. Their case is expected to be settled by the next competition commissioner. "We intend to defend ourselves vigorously," said an HSBC spokesman. In the Libor and Tibor yen cartel, a procedure opened against the cash broker ICAP is still under way.

Other investigations are also under way regarding possible cartels on benchmarks for the gas market
(see Europolitics 4528) and foreign exchange markets (4726).
DECLARATION SYSTEM AT ISSUE

What is questionable in the determination of Libor and  Euribor  rates, and to a lesser extent in the other cases under way, is the fact that they are based on declarations by the entities that use them. The Libor consists of the average rate that 16 leading banks in London declare that they would be willing to pay to borrow for different borrowing periods. On that basis, the British Banking Association (BBA) sets an average rate published daily. The  Euribor  is set by the European Banking Federation on a sample of 44 banks.

This type of declaration system is under fire from the EU in particular, which wishes to see an independent entity assume responsibility for setting benchmarks.

Fines imposed (in euro) for the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel (% reduction under the leniency programme):
- Barclays (100%) 0
- Deutsche Bank (30%) 465,861,000

The refusal of some banks to settle with the  European Commission could yet undermine its settlement procedure, writes Nicholas Hirst

Global banks have been hit with yet another heavy sanction for misdemeanours that they perpetrated in the run-up to the financial crisis. The  European Commission yesterday (4 December) imposed its largest ever anti-trust  fine for alleged manipulation of benchmarks used to price mortgages and consumer loans.

TD
The fines, totalling €1.7 billion, are the result of a settlement reached very quickly by the Commission over allegedly collusive submissions made to manipulate the Euro and Yen-denominated London interbank offered rates. But what appears to be a resounding success could backfire, both on the Commission and on the parties, since although seven banks and one broker agreed to settle, four refused to do so.

Joaquín Almunia, the European Commissioner for competition, said as he presented the decision yesterday that the antitrust regulator had not yet charged the refuseniks but did hold relevant “information”. Yet by choosing to adopt a so-called ‘hybrid settlement’ – in which some, but not all, suspects settle – the Commissioner must ensure that punishment is even more severe on any bank found guilty of participating in a  cartel that refused to settle. To do otherwise, would seriously undermine the Commission’s settlement procedure.

The settlement procedure was introduced to save resources. Companies receive a discount on their fines, while the Commission avoids the travails of formal charges and court battles. (Only a cynic would suggest that the Commission opted for a hybrid settlement in this case so that it could boost its otherwise puny cartel fine figures for 2013.)

However, the ‘hybrid decision’ is likely to embroil the Commission in issuing formal charges and defending its case in hearings and in court. Resource efficiency as a result of settling will be reduced, while the Commission will have allowed those banks that settled to get off more lightly than they might otherwise have done.

The likely prospect of appeals offers some interesting possibilities. One of the motivations for the four hold-outs may have been to postpone the day when those banks might face court actions for huge damages; but they may also have balked at signing up to what is the first anti-trust  fine relating to financial products and a novel anti-trust infringement.

There are uncertainties surrounding the accusation of colluding to distort “the normal course of pricing components” for  derivatives – the Commission’s words. This is not so clear an anti-trust infringement as might be fixing of the sale price of elevators or removal services.

Indeed, the danger of settlements and commitment procedures, where a company gives a commitment not to behave in a certain manner so as to end an anti-trust investigation, is that they create precedent without being subject to legal challenge.

Deutsche Bank, Barclays and other others have waived their right to challenge the Commission’s legal reasoning on the LIBOR and  EURIBOR manipulation. The three others have not.

Eventual guidance from an EU court could prove important, particularly since the Commission harbours similar suspicions in relation to foreign exchange markets, oil and gas benchmarks and the Swiss-franc benchmarks.

HD     (AE) COMPETITION: Eight banks fined for manipulating Euribor  and Libor

ECONOMY - FINANCE - BUSINESS



TD
Brussels, 04/12/2013 (Agence Europe) - On 4 December, the European Commissionfined seven international banks (Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup) and one broker (RP Martin) a record €1.71 billion in total for membership of an illegal cartel on the interest rate  derivatives market and for manipulating inter-bank interest rate benchmarks in euro (Euribor)  and yen (Libor and Tibor). The companies colluded to set rates and exchanged sensitive information about trading practices.

Commissioner Almunia said that this was the highest total  fine ever levied by the Commission for breach of competition rules and reflects the serious nature of the crimes committed - fiddling interest rates used by banks around the world. He said the  fines were meant by the Commission as a punishment for the guilty and a disincentive to ensure similar cartels are not set up in the future. The Commission has reduced the fines by 10% for banks that accepted their guilt and reached an arrangement with the Commission.

For the Euribor  benchmark, four banks - Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank - were involved. The first three were  fined €465.86 million, €445.88 million and €131 million, reduced by 30.5% and 50% because they collaborated in the investigation. Barclays' fine of €690 million was cancelled entirely because it provided information to the Commission about the cartel. The investigation will now continue in the normal manner into Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, which refused to negotiate.

Five banks were involved in the Libor/Tibor  cartel, namely UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Citigroup, along with RP Martin. They participated in one or more cartels, exchanging information about their negotiating positions and future bidding plans. UBS, which committed five breaches of the rules, was granted full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels to the Commission and therefore does not have to pay any of its €2.5 billion  fine. RBS (3 breaches), Deutsche Bank (2 breaches), JP Morgan (1 breach) and Citigroup (3 breaches) have been fined €260 million, €259.5 million €79 million and €70 million respectively, with various reductions in fines under the clemency procedure for collaborating in the investigation. RP Martin has been  fined €247,000 for facilitating the crimes and abusing its connections with a number of banks. The investigation will continue along the usual lines into currency broker ICAP, which refused to negotiate. Commissioner Almunia says that Dutch bank Rabobank was not involved in this cartel, but may have been involved in other cartels being investigated by the Commission.

On the scale of the  fines, Commissioner Almunia commented: “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few”. The Commission set the  fines on the basis of the banks' derivatives sales in the European Economic Area, the serious nature and long duration of the abuse and their geographical scope.

TRADERS from eight global banks colluded from 2005 to 2010 to attempt to alter euro and yen
derivatives rates, the  European Commission said yesterday, fining them a total of €1.7bn (£1.4bn).
Deutsche Bank led the field with  fines totalling €725.4m, followed by Societe Generale on €455.9m and
RBS at €391m.

TD
JP Morgan was hit with a €79.9m settlement, Citigroup with €70m and RP Martin at €247,000.

Barclays would have faced a bill of around €690m and UBS €2.5bn, but both blew the whistle on their cartels and so were granted immunity.

The cases are still not finally settled - JP Morgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole are fighting claims they were colluding in the Euro rates markets.

"What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

The Commission found a  cartel in the euro interest rate derivative market between September 2005 and May 2008.
And it found seven instances of bilateral collusion lasting from one to ten months from 2007 to 2010. RBS' chairman condemned the behaviour of the traders.
"We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees," said Sir Philip Hampton.

"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue."

What are these  fines for? Q Why have these banks had to pay €1.7bn to the  European Commission? A The banks' traders were found to have colluded to fiddle interest rates. They would contact other traders in other banks and decide where to push benchmark interest rates. They have paid up to settle the EC's antitrust claims against them.

QI thought it was only a handful of traders involved, how is corporate law involved? A Antitrust law covers competition and collusion, and is used against misbehaving companies. But although it was only a few individuals here and their bosses did not know what was going on, the company is still treated as

culpable. That is in part because the competition that is meant to operate did not, regardless of who was to blame.
QARE the  fines over yet? ANo.

This case has further to run - - JP Morgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole are fighting claims their traders were involved in the  Euribor  cartels. And other authorities including the Swiss regulators and Japan's watchdogs are carrying out their own investigations

HD          RATE RIGGING BANKS HIT BY £1.4BN RECORD FINE BY          BY JAMES SALMON

SOME of the world's biggest banks have been  fined a record £1.4bn by Brussels for operating an
'illegal cartel' to rig interest rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six hammered by the  European Commission yesterday, receiving a £325m penalty.

TD
German's biggest lender Deutsche Bank, French giant Societe Generale and JPMorgan are among those accused of colluding to manipulate interest rates in order to rig their own trades.

Barclays was also involved in the conspiracy, but escaped a £390m penalty because it notified the European Commission about the cartel. Swiss giant UBS received immunity after blowing the whistle, avoiding a record £2.1bn fine.

The combined fine marks the biggest ever imposed by the EC for breaching anti-trust rules, exceeding a £1.2bn fine levied last year on Royal Philips Electronics and nine others for a TV parts  cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EC's vice president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking is about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.'
Global fines for rate rigging hit £5bn following the latest settlements which included a £390m  fine for
Deutsche Bank and £370m for Societe Generale.
But the costs are expected to soar as banks face a raft of lawsuits and investigations.

A number, including Barclays and RBS, have already been  fined by US and UK regulators for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor. The latest  fines are the result of a separate probe by the  European Commission into Libor rates denominated in euros and the Japanese yen. These are called the Euro Interbank Offered Rate - or  Euribor  - and JPY Libor.

These rates are used to price complex financial instruments called interest rate  derivatives which are traded in huge volumes. By manipulating the interest rates, traders managed to rig bets on these derivatives in their favour.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS were involved in the euro  cartel, which operated between 2005 and 2008. The Yen  cartel included UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup
and London-based broker RP Martin between 2007 and 2010.

Yesterday the EC confirmed it is also investigating whether HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole were involved in the euro  cartel. ICAP, the broker founded by former Tory Party treasurer Michael Spencer, is also being investigated.

The EC is also probing whether the Swiss franc Libor rate was manipulated. At least 15 banks, including RBS and Barclays, are being investigated over allegations they rigged the £3trillion a day foreign currency market.
***

÷ LAST night Labour said the news raised questions for the Economic Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid. Javid was a senior investment banker at Deutsche Bank while it was part of an interest rate rigging cartel. He quit for a career in politics in 2009.

In a letter Labour's shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson asked whether he was aware of the wrong-doing and whether any of the traders involved worked for him.

The already battered reputation of banks took an expensive new hit yesterday when the  European       commission slapped a record euros 1.7bn (pounds 1.4bn)  fine on six firms - including the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland - for colluding to fix key interest rate benchmarks.

Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner, warned that further  fines were on the cards as three more banks, including HSBC, and one broker have refused to settle the long-running investigation by Brussels.

TD
He revealed the authorities were in the process of unmasking a fresh scandal in the currency markets that could further damage the industry and add to the vast sums banks have had to pay for their mistakes since the financial meltdown.

"This will not be the end of the story, neither for interest-rate  derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks," Almunia said. "One of the areas where we have received information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex [foreign exchange]."

The latest  fines - the first levied on a financial  cartel by Europe since the banking crisis began - take the total penalties for rigging Libor and other key interest-rate benchmarks to pounds 3.5bn.

Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) to be published next week will put a total of pounds 100bn on the costs of misconduct for 10 major banks, including RBS, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, in the five years to the end of 2012. That total has now risen by a further pounds 30bn, according to an analysis for the Guardian by MSCI ESG Research.

Roger McCormick, the LSE professor who led the research team, said: "To put that into context, the one year's budget of the 24 richest nations for international aid is pounds 80bn, and the national health service budget is pounds 100bn to pounds 110bn every year."

Yesterday's announcement saw two US banks, Citigroup and JP Morgan, receive their first  fines over the interest-rate rigging scandal, while the other banks received fresh penalties on top of those already imposed by regulators.

Barclays, the first bank penalised for rigging Libor when it was  fined pounds 290m in June last year, was also part of the  Euribor cartel, the European equivalent of Libor.

However, this time the UK bank blew the whistle. In return for that help Barclays was let off another pounds 570m fine.


Page 131 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Similarly the Swiss bank UBS escaped a pounds 2.1bn  fine by telling regulators about the  cartel that had been rigging yen Libor. It had already paid pounds 940m in  fines related to manipulating the London Libor rate.

Almunia said: "What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

The biggest  fine - pounds 600m - was on Deutsche Bank, putting pressure on the Treasury minister Sajid Javid, who was previously head of global credit trading for Asia and had seat on the board of Deutsche's international operations division until he left in 2009.

Javid said last night that while at the German bank he was not responsible for the departments hit by the fine and as a minister he had not held any talks with Brussels or any of the firms involved.

The commission also inflicted more pain on RBS, which has suspended four traders and will now pay another pounds 320m on top of pounds 390m already handed over to US and UK regulators. The new fine adds to its public image problems following a systems meltdown this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers.

Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said: "Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities."

The Euribor  investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale. In yen Libor the banks involved were UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin was also involved, and fined for using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor.

Other banks yet to agree  fines for fixing  Euribor  rates - apart from HSBC - are Credit Agricole and JP Morgan. The money broker Icap, run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is still facing penalties for rigging yen Libor.

Almunia said: "Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector."

Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI ESG Research, questioned whether the penalties were as hefty as they first appeared. "If you look at RBS it is the equivalent to its revenues for five weeks. That's not much. If you think about the manipulation of a global interest rate where several trillion dollars are priced to it you'd think they'd be more punitive."

LP
London, Dec. 5 -- Describing the rigging of interest rates as "shocking", the  European Commission (EC) on Wednesday  fined eight banks including Deutsche Bank, RBS and JPMorgan a record 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) for forming cartels instead of competing with each other between 2005
and 2010.

"What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said, Joaquin Almunia, vice-president in charge of competition policy at EC.

TD
The cartels operated in markets for financial  derivatives - products used to manage the risk of interest rate movements.
The cartel in euro interest rate  derivatives (EIRD) operated between September 2005 and May
2008, aiming to distort the normal course of pricing components for these  derivatives, the EC said.

Derivatives are contracts traded on financial markets that are used to transfer risk. They serve as insurance mechanism against price movements and reduce the volatility of firms' cash flows, resulting in more reliable forecasting, lower capital requirements and higher capital productivity.

Authorities around the world have so far handed down a total of $3.7 billion in  fines to UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.

Business | BANKING
Labour sought to make political capital last night over the senior role of Sajid Javid, the Financial
Secretary to the Treasury, at Deutsche Bank during the rate-fixing scandal.

TD
The EU found that the bank was one of eight institutions engaged in cartels that conspired to manipulate
European Euribor  and Japanese yen Libor interest rates.

Yesterday  European Commission watchdogs imposed fines totalling €1.7bn (£1.4bn) on six of the eight, including Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS was ordered to pay €391m for involvement fixing both the Euribor  and the Libor yen rate, but that was dwarfed by the penalty imposed on Deutsche, which will have to pay €725.4m. The rest was shared between JPMORGAN, Citigroup and broker RP Martin (yen) and Société Générale (Euribor).  Barclays, which flagged the  Euribor cartel to watchdogs, and UBS, which alerted the commission to the yen  cartel, were exempted for acting as whistleblowers.
They ducked fines of €690m and €2.5bn respectively.

In a letter to Mr Javid, the shadow Treasury minister, Cathy Jamieson, demanded that he clarify what he knew about the affair while at Deutsche Bank. She wrote: "It is of course in the public domain that prior
to being elected as an MP, you held senior positions at Deutsche Bank during the period that the commission's investigations and findings cover.

"I am sure that you would wish to be open about any meetings and discussions that have taken place which relate to this issue."
Mr Javid worked at Deutsche between 2000 and 2009, focusing on emerging markets.

The commission said it had acted even though financial regulators had already levied heavy  fines, because the case involved "collusion between competitors in  derivatives markets".

Joaquin Almunia, the Competition commissioner, said: "What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector."
HSBC and French bank Crédit Agricole remain under investigation and are fighting attempts to  fine
them, while JP is battling regulators over the  Euribor  part of the case.

The RBS chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, described his bank's  fine as "a sobering reminder of past failings", adding that "there is no place" for such behaviour at the bank now.

Business | Javid had job at bank that is one of those hit by record  fine for cartels' conspiracy

Labour last night sought to make political capital over Treasury Financial Secretary Sajid Javid's senior role at Deutsche Bank during the period when the EU found the bank was one eight institutions engaged in cartels that conspired to manipulate European  euribor  and Japanese yen Libor interest rates.

TD
European Commission watchdogs yesterday imposed  fines totalling €1.7bn (£1.4bn) on six of the eight, including Royal Bank of Scotland.

RBS was ordered to pay €391m for involvement in both but that was dwarfed by the penalty imposed on Deutsche, which will have to pay €725.4m. The remainder of the €1.7bn total was shared between JPMorgan, Citigroup and broker RP Martin (yen) along with Société Générale (euribor).  Barclays, which flagged the  Euribor cartel to watchdogs and UBS which alerted to the commission to the yen  cartel, were exempted for acting as whistleblowers. They ducked  fines of €690m and €2.5bn respectively.

In a letter to Mr Javid, Labour's Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson demanded that he clarify what he knew about the affair while at Deutsche Bank.

In the letter she said: "It is of course in the public domain that prior to being elected as an MP, you held senior positions at Deutsche Bank during the period that the commission's investigations and findings cover.

"Given your current role as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and your former role as Economic Secretary to the Treasury, I am sure that you would wish to be open about any meetings and discussions that have taken place which relate to this issue."

Mr Javid worked at Deutsche between 2000 and 2009, initially as a director and later as a managing director, focusing on emerging markets.

The commission said it had acted even in the wake of heavy fines levied by financial regulators because the case involved "collusion between competitors in derivatives markets". Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said: "What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is
being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector."

RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton described his bank's  fine as "a sobering reminder of past failings". "The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS," he said.
Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: "It will be appalling if the guilty banks attempt to recoup these
fines by making frontline staff pay."

The European Commission has collectively fined six international financial institutions €1.7bn (£1.4bn)
for their involvement in the manipulation of benchmark rates.

Eight international financial institutions were accused of participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
Deutsche Bank and RBS were handed  fines of €725m and €391m respectively for their involvement in manipulating both the yen London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR).
Société Générale received a  fine of €445m for its involvement in the rigging of the  Euribor  rate.

Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale received a reduction in their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme.
Over yen Libor, JP Morgan has been  fined €79m and Citigroup received a  fine of €70m.

Citigroup received full immunity for one of the infringements in which it participated, avoiding a  fine of around €55m.
Wholesale broking firm RP Martin received a  fine of €247,000.

Barclays was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 leniency notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.
UBS was also granted full immunity for its participation in revealing the  cartel, avoiding a fine of around
€2.5bn for five of the seven infringements.

Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."
In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
JPMorgan and the investigation will continue under the standard  cartel procedure.

LP
The European Commission on Dec. 4 imposed a collective penalty of €1.71 billion on eight international financial institutions for their involvement in two cartels that manipulated interest rate  derivatives.

Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for participating in a  cartel that discussed  EURIBOR submissions as well as trading and pricing strategies. Barclays Plc avoided a  fine of about €690 million for its participation as it received full immunity for revealing the  cartel's existence, the EC said.

TD
The three banks  fined received discounts of 10% on their  fines for agreeing to settle, as well as reductions under the commission's leniency program for cooperating with the investigation. RBS'  fine was reduced by 50%, Deutsche Bank's by 30% and SocGen's by 5%.

In the context of the  EURIBOR investigation, proceedings were opened against JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Crédit Agricole SA, and the probe will continue under the standard, nonsettlement  cartel procedure.

For a second cartel that discussed submissions related to Japanese yen LIBOR and the euroyen TIBOR, the EC fined RBS €260.1 million, Deutsche Bank €259.5 million, JPMorgan €79.9 million, Citigroup Inc.
€70.0 million and RP Martin €247,000.

UBS AG received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and avoided a  fine of about €2.5 billion, while Citigroup received immunity for one infringement related to the  cartel and was exempted from a penalty of about €55 million.

A fine reduction of 10% was given for agreeing to settle, and RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and RP Martin received varying degrees of leniency reductions for cooperating with the probe. Proceedings were opened against ICAP Plc and the investigation continues under the standard nonsettlement  cartel procedure.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks … but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

Banks' value of sales for the  derivatives products concerned within the European Economic Area, the "very serious nature" of the breaches, their geographic scope and respective durations were taken into account for determining the level of  fines, the EC said.

In the context of the  EURIBOR investigation, proceedings were opened against JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Crédit Agricole SA, and the probe will continue under the standard, nonsettlement  cartel procedure.

For a second cartel that discussed submissions related to Japanese yen LIBOR and the euroyen TIBOR, the EC fined RBS €260.1 million, Deutsche Bank €259.5 million, JPMorgan €79.9 million, Citigroup Inc.
€70.0 million and RP Martin €247,000.

UBS AG received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and avoided a  fine of about €2.5 billion, while Citigroup received immunity for one infringement related to the  cartel and was exempted from a penalty of about €55 million.

HD       Five banks hit with €1.7bn fine by European Commission for roles in rate rigging

The European Commission today fined five international banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, and one London broker a record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) for their roles in rigging crucial interest rate benchmarks.

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “What is shocking about the Libor and  Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of the benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between the banks which are supposed to be competing with each other."

TD
Almunia, pictured, added: “If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these  cartel
traders you will be appalled."

RBS, the taxpayer-controlled bank, has been  fined  €391 million. That is on top of the £390 million it paid to UK and US regulators earlier this year.
“If you see the conversation between these  cartel traders you will be appalled"

Barclays, which was  fined £290 million last year and saw the resignations of its chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius over the Libor-rigging scandal, escaped a European  fine because, along with UBS, it acted as a whistleblower to the commission. If it had not done so it would have been fined  690 million and UBS 2.5 billion. The Swiss bank has already paid the equivalent of $1.5 billion (£915 million) in fines of rate rigging.

Deutsche Bank landed the largest EC  fine of 725 million. France’s Société Générale was  fined  446 million. JPMorgan has to pay 80 million, Citigroup 70 million and London broker RP Martin 247,000. Today’s fines take the total imposed by UK, US and European regulators to $6 billion.

Almunia said: “Today’s decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

The benchmarks involved were  the Yen London interbank rate and Euribor.  These rates are used to price assets running into hundreds of trillions of dollars ranging from derivatives to mortgages.

Three banks — HSBC, Credit Agricole and JPMorgan — rejected the commission’s offer to settle early on the Euribor  case and London broker ICAP on the Yen case. All face formal antitrust charges which could lead to larger  fines.

The European Commission on Dec. 4 imposed a collective penalty of €1.71 billion on eight international financial institutions for their involvement in two cartels that manipulated interest rate  derivatives.

Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for participating in a  cartel that discussed  EURIBOR submissions as well as trading and pricing strategies. Barclays Plc avoided a  fine of about €690 million for its participation as it received full immunity for revealing the  cartel's existence, the EC said.

The European Commission has fined 8 international financial institutions a total of 1 712 468 000 for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). Four of these institutions participated in a cartel relating to interest rate  derivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese yen. Such collusion between competitors is prohibited by Article
101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's  cartel settlement procedure; the companies'  fines were reduced by 10% for agreeing to settle. See also MEMO/13/1090.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said: What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined
to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a
few."

Interest rate  derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products which are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. They derive their value from the level of a benchmark interest rate, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) which is used for various currencies including the Japanese yen (JPY) - or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), for the euro. These benchmarks reflect an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of banks who are members of a panel (panel banks). They are meant to reflect the cost of interbank lending in a given currency and serve as a basis for various financial  derivatives. Investment banks compete with each
other in the trading of these  derivatives. The levels of these benchmark rates may affect either the cash flows that a bank receives from a counterparty, or the cash flow it needs to pay to the counterparty under interest rate  derivatives contracts.
The cartel in Euro interest rate  derivatives (EIRD)

The EIRD  cartel operated between September 2005 and May 2008. The settling parties are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale. The  cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for these  derivatives.

The European Commission on Tuesday finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion ($2.34 billion) as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest rate derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called  cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to interest rate  derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro interest rate  derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate  derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of  EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement  cartel procedure. For the  cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called  cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to interest rate  derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro interest rate  derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate  derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of  EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement  cartel procedure. For the  cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

SE         EURIBOR SCANDAL
HD       Vital pieces in a fragmented jigsaw puzzle; News analysis

Settlement lacked details but a clearer picture is emerging, write Caroline Binham and Alex Barker
The fines were big on number but short on detail.

TD
The €1.7bn of  fines meted out by the  European Commission yesterday to six financial institutions, lacked the accompanying embarrassing chatroom conversations - where traders have agreed to alter a benchmark rate in exchange for a bottle of Bollinger , or even day-old sushi - that has become de rigueur in settlements arising from the sprawling Libor scandal .

This is because Europe's top competition watchdog does not publish findings until the conclusion of all relevant investigations. With HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JPMorgan refusing to settle allegations that they attempted to rig  Euribor,  and with broker ICAP's role still undetermined - plus a continuing parallel probe into the manipulation of Swiss franc denominated Libor - it could be at least two years before similarly incriminating messages are published.

But even without the tawdry details, the commission's settlement announcement still provided vital pieces in the fragmented jigsaw puzzle that the Libor scandal has become.

While as many as 20 financial institutions are being probed by at least 10 authorities around the world, only five companies before yesterday had settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses - Barclays, UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland, ICAP and Rabobank.

For Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, JPMorgan and Citigroup, the EU settlement constituted the first public admissions that they had been involved in benchmark rate manipulation; and when institutions settle with the commission they must admit antitrust infringements. These admissions mean the benchmark manipulation scandal is pushed squarely into the eurozone and the US.

Deutsche and SocGen, the twin pillars of the eurozone's financial markets, landed the two largest individual fines, at €725m and €446m respectively.

While Deutsche's settlement with US, UK and German authorities has been pushed back until next year, its fine from the commission does not bode well for its overall exposure. The bank said in a statement that it had provisioned for its commission  fine.

The Financial Times first reported 18 months ago that both Deutsche and SocGen were part of an alleged cartel being probed by authorities. Philippe Moryoussef, a trader formerly at Barclays, allegedly communicated with traders at banks including Deutsche, SocGen, Crédit Agricole and HSBC, the FT reported at the time.
French politicians portrayed Libor manipulation as a London problem around this date.



Page 166 of 188 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A lawyer for Mr Moryoussef, who is based in Singapore, did not respond yesterday to an email seeking comment.

One person familiar with the  Euribor  investigation said the bulk of email evidence parsed by the commission is written in French. Some of the anonymised emails, seen by the FT, include one trader boasting about how many other traders at rival banks he was in contact with.

"Could you tell the guys in the treasury department to put a low 12-month fixing?" he writes to a trader at another bank. "OK, done," comes the reply.

The trader then writes: "Thanks! If you need high or low fixings, do not hesitate . . . I ask four or five banks in general."

The geographic politics of Libor have been highlighted by its global nature. While the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission was the first regulator to start probing rate-rigging in 2008, it is yet to  fine a US bank. This has led to criticism - from the UK in particular, which has hitherto borne the brunt of the Libor settlements - that the probe is overly political.

Citi could hardly escape involvement - a yen-derivatives trader who joined the bank from UBS now faces criminal charges in both the US and the UK. He is yet to enter a plea to either set of charges.

On his UK indictment, the trader is alleged to have conspired with staff at all the institutions named in the Yen-Libor cartel by the commission yesterday - RBS, Deutsche, JPMorgan, Citi and RPMartin. In addition, however, he is accused on the UK indictment of conspiring with employees of HSBC, Tullett Prebon and Rabobank.
Despite Rabobank's $1bn  fine that it paid to US, UK and Dutch regulators in October the Dutch
co-operative escaped even a mention by the commission yesterday, even though it responded to the
commission's request for information more than a year ago.
Rabobank declined to comment, while the commission said: "We go where the evidence takes us." However, legal experts expressed concern that the commission's investigation could have been curtailed
for expediency's sake.

"It seems to me that the commission have likely compromised the scope of their investigation in the very obvious rush to be seen to deal with this quickly," said Lianne Craig, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld & Co, which is advising claimants in the US and UK with Libor-related damages claims.

Moreover, the timeframe that the commission investigated could also limit banks' exposure to follow-on damages actions.

"Where people have lost out on Libor manipulation, they have lost out due to systemic manipulation where banks were lowballing their rates during the credit crisis, as opposed to when traders were colluding to benefit their own trading books," said Stephen Critchley, a competition lawyer at Collyer Bristow.

Not only did lowballing tend to occur in sterling and dollar-denominated Libor, but it also occurred as the worst financial crisis in a generation took hold in 2008 - the very end of the period of  Euribor  rigging that the commission investigated.

HD      Commission fines banks for participating in cartels in interest  rate derivatives industry

<p itemprop="description">The  European Commission has fined eight international financial institutions EUR 1.7bn for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). Four of these institutions participated in a cartel relating to interest rate derivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to interest rate  derivatives denominated in Japanese yen.

Such collusion between competitors is prohibited by Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's cartel settlement procedure; the companies'  fines were reduced by 10 per cent for agreeing to settle.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said: “What is shocking about the LIBOR and  EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined
to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a
few."

The EIRD  cartel operated between September 2005 and May 2008. The settling parties are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale. The  cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for these derivatives. Traders of different banks discussed their bank's submissions for the calculation of the EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.
In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
JPMorgan and the investigation will continue under the standard (non-settlement)  cartel procedure.

In the context of the same investigation, the Commission has also opened proceedings against the cash broker ICAP. This investigation continues under the standard (non-settlement)  cartel procedure.

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the banks' value of sales for the products concerned within the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringements, their geographic scope and respective durations.
The fines imposed for the EIRD  cartel are as follows (Participants:  Fine)
- Barclays: 0
- Deutsche Bank: EUR 465,861,000
- Société Générale: EUR 445,884,000
- RBS: EUR 131,004,000

Barclays received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel and thereby avoided a  fine of around EUR 690m for its participation in the infringement.

UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin were involved in one or several of the infringements of EU competition rules.

The fines imposed for the YIRD cartels are as follows (Participant:  Fine)
- UBS (5 infringements): 0
- RBS (3 infringements): EUR 260,056,000
- Deutsche Bank (2 infringements): EUR 259,499,000
- JPMorgan (1 infringement): EUR 79,897,000
- Citigroup (3 infringements): EUR 70,020,000
- RP Martin (1 infringement): EUR 247,000
UBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and thereby avoided a  fine of around
EUR 2.5bn for its participation in five of the seven infringements. Citigroup received full immunity for one
of the infringements in which it participated, thereby avoiding a  fine of around EUR 55m.

These decisions are the eighth and ninth settlement decisions since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008. They are one of the swiftest  cartel settlements decided by the Commission, showing the full potential of the efficiencies offered by the settlement procedure.

The European Commission (EC) has fined eight banks a total of €1.71 billion for manipulating benchmarks affecting the interest rate derivatives industry.

TD
The EC ruled that from 2005-2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale participated in a cartel manipulating the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), affecting interest rate  derivatives denominated in Euros. The EC also found that from 2007 to 2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to interest rate  derivatives denominated in Japanese yen by manipulating the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

In doling out fines, Barclays received immunity for revealing the existence of the Euro interest rate derivatives cartel, and by doing so, the bank avoided a  fine of approximately €690 million. Of that group, Deutsche Bank received the steepest  fine of nearly €466 million, followed by Société Générale at nearly
€446 million and RBS at €131 million.

For the yen interest rate  derivatives cartel, the EC granted immunity to UBS for revealing its existence, and thus the bank avoided an approximate €2.5 billion  fine. RBS and Deutsche Bank received  fines for this case of around €260 million each, while J.P. Morgan was  fined nearly €80 million, and Citigroup was fined €70 million.
The EC also  fined broker RP Martin €247,000 for its role in the yen  cartel.
For Euro derivatives manipulation, the EC still has proceedings open against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
J.P. Morgan. For the yen  derivatives, the EC has a proceeding open against cash broker ICAP.

HD       Barclays  fund profited from Libor fixing,  claimants argue

Barclays profited from lowballing its sterling Libor rate, according to explosive new allegations to surface as part of a UK civil case brought against the bank by a care home that has cast a shadow over its former top management.

The bank had an offshore fund named Ricardo into which it paid £130m of profits from its interest rate derivatives business, the commercial court in London heard on Friday as part of a case that will call as witnesses Bob Diamond, the bank's former chief executive, and other members of its former executive team.

TD
The Ricardo Master Fund "was an eponymous fund named after Mr Ricci", the court heard, referring to Rich Ricci, the former co-head of Barclays' investment banking business and another witness in the case. Jerry del Missier, Mr Ricci's co-head who will also be called to appear in the case, "described the fund as Barclays' global interest-rate portfolio", Mr Justice Flaux said after reading the claimants' written arguments, before suggesting that authorities in Singapore should be contacted to glean more details about the fund.

Legal arguments filed by the claimants, Graiseley Properties and Graiseley Investments - the owner of Guardian Care Homes - allege that the Ricardo fund "was a direct beneficiary of the manipulation (including downward manipulation) of sterling Libor".

The written arguments, seen by the Financial Times, cite a report by Clifford Chance, the bank's law firm, to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's watchdog, into the Ricardo fund. The law firm's report stated that the profitability of so-called UK Certificates of Deposit Strategy in which the fund invested was "linked to a fall in sterling Libor".
The law firm's report cited in the claimants' arguments refers to a Ricardo Fund internal monthly report in
November 2008, just as markets were roiling during the worst of the financial crisis.

That monthly report stated: "The 150bp surprise rate cut by the BoE helped a lot . . . At the very least, Mervyn King gave the Fund its best day as Libor CDs rates dropped 100bp."
The case is an unwelcome reminder of alleged Libor manipulation for the bank, even though it paid
£290m to US and UK authorities 18 months ago to settle allegations that it manipulated the London
Interbank Offered Rate, a key interbank borrowing rate.

As part of that settlement, the bank admitted to lowballing its Libor rate submissions to paint a false picture of its financial health during the credit crisis.

Earlier this week Barclays admitted to participating in a cartel that aimed to manipulate  Euribor,  the Brussels equivalent, as part of a settlement with the European Commission, the antitrust watchdog. The bank escaped a €690m  fine through an immunity deal in which it provided the commission with information.

The claimants in the care home case allege that they were mis-sold an interest rate hedging product that was pegged to a rate Barclays was manipulating. They have alleged that knowledge of Libor manipulation reached the highest echelons of Barclays management.

"The idea that people in Barclays did not know that there was manipulation of Libor and that it was wrong is simply not true," Mr Justice Flaux said on Friday at the hearing.

Barclays said in a statement after the hearing that the case had no merit. "This business had a suite of advisers and a lot of financial experience and skill in-house. Barclays understands the client entered into their swap agreements with sufficient understanding to exercise their own judgment as to whether the products would meet their business objectives. This is a significant business which owes Barclays £70 million."
Barclays declined to comment specifically on the Ricardo fund.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to interest rate  derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million.

"What is shocking about the [Libor] and [Euribor]  scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. "Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro interest rate  derivatives market, which covered Euribor  and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005-May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the  cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate  derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of  Euribor  as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, which covered JPY Libor and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel discussed certain JPY Libor submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY Libor submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the yen interest rate  derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY Libor submissions.

In relation to the euro interest rate  derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement  cartel procedure. For the  cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

Barclays profited from lowballing its sterling Libor rate, according to new allegations that have surfaced as part of a UK civil case brought against the bank by a care home that has cast a shadow over its former top management.

The bank had an offshore fund named Ricardo, into which it paid £130m of profits from its interest rate derivatives business, the commercial court in London heard yesterday as part of a case that will call as witnesses Bob Diamond, the bank's former chief executive, and other members of its former executive team.

TD
The Ricardo Master Fund "was an eponymous fund named after Mr Ricci", the court heard, referring to Rich Ricci, the former co-head of Barclays' investment banking business and another witness in the case.

Jerry del Missier, Mr Ricci's co-head, who will also be called to appear in the case, "described the fund as Barclays' global interest-rate portfolio", Mr Justice Flaux said after reading the claimants' written arguments, before suggesting that authorities in Singapore should be contacted to glean more details about the fund.

Legal arguments filed by the claimants, Graiseley Properties and Graiseley Investments - the owner of Guardian Care Homes - allege that the Ricardo fund "was a direct beneficiary of the manipulation (including downward manipulation) of sterling Libor".

The written arguments, seen by the Financial Times cite a report by Clifford Chance, the bank's law firm, to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's watchdog, into the Ricardo fund.

The firm's report stated that the profitability of UK Certificates of Deposit Strategy in which the fund invested was "linked to a fall in sterling Libor".

Clifford Chance's report cited in the claimants' arguments refers to a Ricardo Fund internal monthly report in November 2008, just as markets were roiling during the financial crisis.

That monthly report stated: "The 150bp surprise rate cut by the BoE helped a lot . . . At the very least, Mervyn King gave the Fund its best day as Libor CDs rates dropped 100bp."
The case is a reminder of alleged Libor manipulation for the bank, even though it paid £290m to US and
UK authorities 18 months ago to settle allegations it manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate.

As part of that settlement, the bank admitted to lowballing its Libor-rate submissions to paint a false picture of its health during the credit crisis.

This week Barclays ad-mitted participating in a cartel that aimed to manipulate  Euribor  , the Brussels equivalent, as part of a settlement with the European Commission. The bank esc-aped a €690m  fine through an immunity deal in which it provided the commission with information.

The claimants in the care home case allege that they were mis-sold an interest rate hedging product that was pegged to a rate Barclays was manipulating. They have alleged that knowledge of Libor manipulation reached the highest echelons of Barclays management .

"The idea that people in Barclays did not know that there was manipulation of Libor and that it was wrong is simply not true," Mr Justice Flaux said yesterday at the hearing.

Barclays said after the hearing that the case had no merit. "This business had a suite of advisers and a lot of financial experience and skill in-house. Barclays understands the client entered into their swap agreements with sufficient understanding to exercise their own judgment as to whether the products would meet their business objectives. This is a significant business which owes Barclays £70m."
Barclays declined to comment on the Ricardo fund.

Six banks and one brokerage have been hit with a record combined €1.7 billion ($2.3 billion)  fine from the
EU’s top competition regulator after admitting to participating in a cartel to rig two interest rate
benchmarks. The multi-party settlements unveiled by the European Commission are the first results from
a two-year investigation into allegations of separate conspiracies to fix the Yen London interbank offered
rate and the Euro interbank offered rate. Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland accepted taking part
in both cartels and will pay fines of €725 million and €391 million, respectively. Société Générale will pay
€446 million for trying to rig Euribor  and profit from related  derivatives. For Yen Libor related abuses,
JPMorgan accepted a fine of €79.8 million and Citi €70 million. The broker RP Martin will pay €247,000
for facilitating the cartel. Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities
to the violations.

TD
But the banks accepted participating in the  Euribor  and Yen Libor cartels, respectively. Barclays said in a statement that it was not part of the Commission’s investigation into the manipulation of Yen Libor.
Several banks and interdealer brokers rejected a settlement. Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, said the settlement was a sobering reminder of past failings: “We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.” Citi said it was “pleased” that the Commission’s investigation was over, while Deutsche Bank said it had invested €1 billion in improving its compliance and did not need to make extra provisions.

As global regulators intensified their investigation into benchmark manipulation, a number of the world's largest banks agreed in 2012 and 2013 to pay hefty  fines to settle probes relating to their involvement in the misconduct.

On Dec. 4, the  European Commission announced a record combined penalty of approximately €1.71 billion on eight financial institutions for their participation in two cartels that rigged interest rate  derivatives.

TD
Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for taking part in one  cartel that discussed  EURIBOR submissions, as well as trading and pricing strategies.
The EU executive body also asked Deutsche Bank and RBS to pay additional  fines of €259.5 million and
€260.1 million, respectively, for participating in a second  cartel that discussed submissions related to
Japanese yen LIBOR, with JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin  fined €79.9 million,
€70.0 million and €247,000, respectively.

Barclays Plc and UBS AG escaped  fines of roughly €690 million and €2.5 billion, respectively, attaining full immunity for informing the authorities about the cartels.

Before that, on Oct. 29, Rabobank Group said it settled investigations into its historical LIBOR and EURIBOR submission processes, agreeing to pay €70 million to the Dutch Public Prosecutor, £105 million to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, $475 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and $325 million to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The agreement, in the wake of which Rabobank CEO Piet Moerland resigned, came roughly a month after ICAP Plc unit ICAP Europe Ltd. reached a £55 million deal with British and U.S. regulators over the involvement of certain brokers in the attempted manipulation of yen LIBOR by bank traders.

Back on Feb. 27, The Wall Street Journal had reported that ICAP, Rabobank Group and Lloyds Banking Group Plc could be next in line to settle with global authorities following RBS' Feb. 6 disclosure that it settled LIBOR-rigging charges with the U.K. FSA for £87.5 million and the U.S. CFTC and the U.S. DOJ for $325 million and $150 million, respectively. John Hourican, CEO of RBS' markets and international division, stepped down the same day.
In late 2012, on Dec. 17, UBS said its board approved LIBOR-related accords that saw the bank pay
fines of $1.2 billion to U.S. authorities; £160 million to the U.K. FSA; and CHF59 million to Swiss regulator
Finma. CEO Sergio Ermotti said unacceptable behavior was exhibited by certain UBS employees, but
added that their misconduct "does not reflect the values of UBS nor the high ethical standards to which we
hold every employee."
The first bank to settle benchmark manipulation charges was Barclays, which on June 27, 2012, struck a
£290 million deal with global authorities, after rumors of rate-rigging surfaced a few months earlier.
Barclays CEO Bob Diamond resigned shortly after the settlement.

More fines and settlements could come still, with regulators investigating whether or not gold and silver rates also were rigged.

HD      European CommissionFines Eight Banks Record € 1.71 Billion For Participation In Cartels In
Interest Rate Derivatives Industry

LP
On 4 December 2013, the  European Commission announced that it had  fined eight international financial institutions over € 1.71 billion for breaching Article 101 TFEU by participating in cartels in the markets for financial  derivatives covering the EEA between different periods ranging from September
2005 to 2010.

Interest rate  derivatives are financial products which are commonly used by financial institutions or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Their value derives from a benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR). These benchmarks represent an average of the quotes submitted on a daily basis by a number of banks who are members of a panel. The banks involved in the case are members of such panels. The LIBOR is used for ten currencies, including the Japanese Yen (JPY), whereas the  EURIBOR is used for the euro.

TD
The Commission decision concerns a  cartel in Euro interest rate derivatives and cartels in Yen interest rate derivatives. Having regard to the Euro interest rate derivative cartel, the Commission found,
following unannounced inspections in October 2011 (see VBB on Competition Law, Volume 2011, No. 10, available at www.vbb.com) and the opening of proceedings in March 2013, that traders of different banks discussed their daily bank rate submissions for the calculation of the  EURIBOR, as well as trading and pricing strategies between September 2005 and May 2008.

In relation to this  cartel, Barclays received full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for having brought the infringement to the Commission's attention and for having provided valuable information to prove the infringement, and thereby avoided a  fine of around € 690 million. Three other infringing banks received  fine reductions under the Leniency Notice ranging from 5% to 50%, as well as a further 10% reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission under the provisions of the Commission's Settlement Notice. As a result, the Commission imposed  fines of € 465 million on
Deutsche Bank, € 445 million on Société Générale and € 131 million on RBS to settle the allegations that they rigged the  EURIBOR benchmark borrowing rates. The proceedings opened against three other banks, Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, will continue under the standard (non-settlement)  cartel procedure.

As regards the Yen interest rate derivative cartels, the Commission found that five banks and one broker had engaged in seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between one and ten months in the period from 2007 to 2010. The collusive conduct included discussions between traders on their JPY LIBOR submissions, as well as trading and pricing strategies.

In relation to these cartels, UBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of six of the infringements and thereby avoided a € 2.5 billion fine. Citigroup received full immunity in respect of another of the infringements thereby avoiding a fine of € 55 million. Other infringing banks received  fine reductions under the Leniency Notice of between 25% and 40%, as well as a further 10% reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission under the Settlement Notice. As a result, the Commission imposed total  fines of € 260 million on RBS for three infringements, € 259 million on Deutsche Bank for two infringements, € 80 million on JP Morgan for one infringement, € 70 million on
Citigroup for three infringements and € 247,000 on RP Martin, a broker, for facilitating the implementation of one of the infringements.
