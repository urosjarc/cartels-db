Competition flares in Europe's sea-lanes, reports Charles Batchelor.

Most international cargoes make part of their journey by sea but, unless there is a dramatic sinking of a ferry or an oil tanker, seaborne  shipping suffers from a very low profile.

TD
In recent months, however, a dispute over a rate and capacity sharing  agreement or 'conference' across the north Atlantic has focused attention on the financial pressures afflicting parts of the shipping
industry. The controversy surrounding the  Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) has drawn the European
Commission, the shipping industry and large shippers into a bitter dispute.

The TAA raises questions about the viability of long-distance, deep-sea routes but the problems confronting short-sea  shipping have also come under serious consideration recently. The opportunities for taking consignments off road and rail and transferring them to coastal and canal  shipping are being reviewed by the European commission.

Shipping owes its low profile in large measure to the shift of the industry away from the traditional but now high-cost European seafaring nations to the Third World and the Far East. With a few notable exceptions ownership has moved to small one or-two vessel companies which sail under 'flags of convenience' and employ non-European crews.

Despite these cost-saving measures, competition in many areas of the  shipping market has put fierce pressure on the operating margins of shipowners. The traditional method of regulating competition has been the shipping conference, an  agreement between competing  shipping companies to set  prices on a particular route.

The TAA was just such an agreement, put in place in September 1992 to stem rising losses on the Europe-North America routes. It united 15 large  shipping lines accounting for 85% of sailings on these routes and included companies such as P and O, Nedlloyd and Maersk.

The TAA succeeded in pushing up freight rates by as much as 100%. But it enraged many of the companies shipping their products across the Atlantic and prompted the intervention of the  European   commission.

The commission took particular exception to the  TAA extending its influence over the land-based section of journeys - to and from the port - and to the fact that it sought to control capacity as well as freight
rates.

In July the members of the  TAA put revised proposals to the commission aimed at making the agreement more flexible and more acceptable to shippers but there is no guarantee that these concessions go far enough. A response from the commission is still awaited.

In its role as a defender of free trade and open competition the commission has taken a tough line with the companies involved in the TAA. But within the framework of its transport policies the commission is doing its best to promote the shipping sector.

This reflects the importance of  shipping to the international movement of goods. More than 90% of the European Union's trade with the rest of the world uses sea transport. This amounts to 600m tonnes of the world's total seaborne trade of 3.6bn tonnes.

The EU's international maritime trade is split roughly equally between distant, deep-sea destinations and more 'local' ports of call in Scandinavia, eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

Maritime transport also accounts for a large share - 35% - of total trade between the EU member states. Island nations such as the UK and Ireland are understandably very dependent on seaborne transport but other countries on the EU periphery such as Greece, Portugal and even Denmark move many of their imports and exports by ship.

As part of its efforts to revitalise the European  shipping fleet, the commission is working on proposals for a European  shipping register, Euros. Under an early draft Euros would have still required officers and half the crew to be European nationals but would have given income tax concessions to the crews of Euros-flagged vessels.

The tax proposals ran into objections from the national finance ministries, however, and a modified version of this plan is now under consideration.

A second strand in the commission's efforts to boost  shipping can be found in its proposals to improve the efficiency of ports within the EU. This ports initiative forms part of a broader strategy to create strategic networks of road, rail and air links.

Growing pressures on the road network have led to rising levels of congestion and there is little likelihood that investment in roads alone can solve the problem. The inability of road investment to keep up with demand has led to higher energy consumption, more pollution and a greater number of accidents, a commission report concluded.

Ports and maritime transport cause less damage to the environment and are more energy efficient. New port infrastructure is normally less intrusive than new road building while the energy consumption of a coastal tanker is four times less per tonne/kilometre than road freight.

Under the commission's proposals, financial support would be available for projects defined as being 'of common interest'. An initial trawl has thrown up more than 110 possible projects including the deepening of the approach channel to Esbjerg in Denmark, the construction of quays for a new  container terminal
in Oslo and improved road connections for ports such as Ramsgate and Southampton.

But for all the apparent financial and environmental advantages of ship transport, it will still have a tough task in competing with road and rail shipments. The de-regulation of the road haulage sector to allow cabotage, the carriage of goods between destinations in another country, and the construction of transport links such as the Channel tunnel and Oresund tunnel/bridge between Denmark and Sweden increase the competitiveness of land transport

'The critical success factors such as transit time, frequency of departure, cost of transport and quality of service often do not measure up in comparison with road and sometimes also rail transport,' according to a recent study* by Niko Wijnolst, a Dutch academic.

The turnaround time of ships must be reduced dramatically and port and stevedoring costs must be cut if shipborne transport is to become more attractive. Wijnolst calls for the creation of port hopper services, fast and frequent  shipping links between European ports, to make maritime transport more attractive.

Vessels would need to be equipped to load and unload their own cargoes, dispensing with the delays and cost of shore-based systems. They would also need flexible propulsion units and mooring systems to make them independent of tugs and harbour pilots.

Such proposals would require a revolution in working practices in many European ports and a rethink on the level of port dues levied, Wijnolst concedes. Hopper services would also require government assistance.

But if these admittedly considerable obstacles could be overcome, maritime transport could play an even greater role in moving goods.

HD       FRESH CHALLENGE TO EUROPEAN SHIPPING COMPETITION POLICY. WC      830 words

TO the uninitiated, European  shipping competition policy must seem baffling yet rudimentary in the ease to which it can be challenged.

The Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  outlawed by the  European Commission's competition directorate in its statement of objection earlier this year, in a decision which has just been backed by Europe's Advisory Committee, is a case in point.

TD
Having endured countless industry complaints and  European Commission statements of objection against the  TAA, member lines sought to buy time by reviewing the terms of the  agreement and presenting it under a different name.

By doing so, they exploited their right under European law to operate the newly presented  agreement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), until this too is finally declared illegal by a full meeting of commissioners.

This ability to operate an accord that could also eventually find itself facing the scorn of the commission's competition directorate (DG4) is a questionable anomaly of European competition legislation.

No wonder the lines fought so vehemently to defend their position last year by opposing an initial application by shippers for interim measures to be brought against the old  TAA.

If the application had been successful it would have changed the whole face of the way European competition law affects  shipping conferences.

It would have compelled the  TAA and now the TACA to cease operations until it had been proved to be within the law. If you like, branding it guilty until proven innocent.
Predictably, the lines are upbeat about the advisory committee decision, saying it was expected.

Lord Sterling, chairman of the P and O group and president of the European Community Shipowners' Associations, said the old  TAA was dead and the advisory committee decision was just part of that procedure.
What was important was the way the newly revised TACA would be received.

He said the new accord had generated significant interest in Brussels and Washington where it was being examined by officials.

The most significant aspect of the advisory committee's recommendation was that it backed the competition directorate's belief that the old  TAA was unlawful because it operated a two-tier pricing system and was managing excess capacity.

As far as two-tier pricing is concerned, DG4, headed by Karel van Miert, the European competition commissioner, has said that re-grouping on former conference and non-conference carriers within an accord such as the TAA was impossible because some of the constraints traditionally imposed by the conference agreements were difficult for the former non-conference carriers to accept.

Lawyers acting for the TACA lines have been quick to stress that this practice has stopped under the newly-reviewed accord, although tonnage capacity was still managed, but now eastbound as well as westbound.

According to Mr van Miert's department, the capacity management programme operated by the old  TAA was not an instrument for suspending capacity "which changes in line with seasonal variations in demand.

"It is therefore not indispensable to the regulation of excess capacity associated with seasonal variations in demand."

It said that, while westbound volumes last year exceeded eastbound volumes by about 10%, the programme was only intended to suspend capacity in the westbound sector.

It said: "If there is a problem of eastbound /westbound imbalance, it is in the eastbound sector. Accordingly, the conclusion must be that the CMP is not associated with the problems of eastbound
/westbound imbalance."

Criticising the objectives of the programme, the commission said: "The  TAA accordingly serves the objective of maintaining operators in being and preserving the service of all its members and not the objective of stability within the meaning of regulation 4056/86."

All these rulings are significant in that they form the agreed position of the commission's competition Eurocrats who have been  charged with upholding "fair" competition principles throughout the European Union.

Whether DG4's conclusions in the statement of objection are right or wrong is ultimately up to the courts to decide if cases get that far. But what has come into question, is the relative ease with which the lines have postponed action against them by retuning the  agreement.

This serves two purposes. Apart from immediately distancing the lines from the problems and rulings made against the old  TAA, it also means that under the terms of the European law, they can continue to operate a conference operation across the North Atlantic until the commission decides that the new vehicle is also unlawful.

If future shipper complaints against the TACA result in another set of oral hearings and statements of objection, this could be up to two or three years. Then who knows, maybe a new identity could be thought up again.

Meanwhile, while the shipowners and shippers continue to trade the lawyers continue to rake the money in. After all, defending a commercial position in Brussels, no matter how concrete, does not come cheaply.

Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, will today announce a telecoms development project in China which may mark a watershed in the opening of the market to foreign telecoms operators. The deal will involve Hongkong Telecom, of which C and W owns a majority stake, in a joint venture with Chinese partners to expand telecoms services. Until now, China has maintained a state monopoly over telecoms services, although western equipment suppliers have long been established there.

A leading Hong Kong analyst said the agreement would involve either a substantial loan from HongKong Telecom tied to an operating agreement, or a leasing arrangement, either of which might in time be convertible into equity. 'This is a watershed, which could lead within months to a far wider opening up of the Chinese telecoms to overseas operators,' he said.

TD
The agreement follows months of contacts between C and W and China's ministry of posts and telecommunications and the Chinese government, during which the ministry nominated C and W as its
'preferred partner' for future operations. China has ambitious plans to increase its number of phone lines from about 30m to at least 110m within the next decade. But state operators are believed to be finding it increasingly difficult to secure supplier finance for telecoms expansion, which has obliged them to move faster than expected on joint ventures with network operators.

Member states of the European Union and the  European Commission yesterday came before judges at the European Court of Justice for a case, the outcome of which should allow the EU to ratify the Uruguay Round trade accord before the January 1 1995 deadline.
The commission asked the court for its opinion after a disagreement with member states over who has
the power to negotiate in certain trade areas - such as transport, services, and intellectual property rights.
The commission has argued it should ratify the Uruguay Round, under those articles of the Rome and
Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive authority to negotiate on trade. But member states yesterday
argued there was a limit as to how far the commission could claim to have exclusive competence in these
areas.
The judges are expected to give their opinion on what constitutes the correct legal basis for ratification on
November 15. Emma Tucker, Luxembourg

European exporters' organisations have threatened legal action against the  European Commission if it does not move quickly against a shipowners'  agreement to set prices across the north Atlantic. The British and French Shippers' Councils have written to the commission's competition directorate - DG4 - demanding measures to outlaw the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA). The shippers are worried that unless action is taken soon, the TAA will go into its third year and exporters will face  price rises of 15% on cargoes crossing the north Atlantic.

The TAA is a 'conference' or  agreement between 15 large  shipping lines accounting for about 85% of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to regulate both rates and capacity. It was introduced to stem losses by shipping lines, and its members include many large  container shipping lines such as P and A, Nedlloyd and Maersk.

The European Commission has issued a temporary judgment objecting to the TAA, but shippers are now pressing for a final ruling. They also want a decision to outlaw a compromise agreement, the

Shipowners try to keep EU competition exemption.
By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent.

TD
Shipowners belonging to the  Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  a controversial  shipping 'conference' which sets cargo rates across the north Atlantic, yesterday offered a concession designed to defuse their dispute with the  European Commission and exporters.

Lord Sterling, chairman of the P and O  shipping line and president of the European Community Shipowners' Associations, last night proposed dropping the  TAA's constraints on capacity on the north Atlantic routes. The offer was made during a meeting with Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU competition commissioner.

Exporters have complained that by restricting capacity as well as setting rates, the  TAA was allowing inefficient shipowners to keep excess tonnage in operation.

The TAA hopes that by dropping its clause on capacity management it will persuade the  European         commission's competition directorate - DG4 - to continue to grant the shipowners exemption from the normal EU competition rules.

'We are proposing to drop the capacity angle from the package,' Lord Sterling said. 'It is not necessary because in practice excess tonnage on these routes was taken out two years ago.'

This is the second time that the shipowners have made changes to the  TAA. They proposed a compromise agreement, the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), in July easing some of the terms of the original 1992 conference.

But shippers, companies which export goods across the Atlantic, said this was simply a delaying tactic and threatened legal action against the  European commission if it did not speedily issue a ruling on both agreements.

A second objection to the  TAA/TACA - that they set rates for  containers on their land journey to the port, thereby increasing costs - is still rejected by the shipowners. 'Multimodal shipments (by land and water) are a vital part of the  container industry,' Lord Sterling said. 'The efficiency of multi-modal shipments is essential to the success of  containerisation. Customers say they do not want anything to do with the cargo from the moment it leaves the factory gate.'

Shipowners believe that the multi-modal issue does not relate solely to the  TAA/TACA but to conferences generally and should be negotiated separately. 'We want to separate TACA from the multimodal debate,' Lord Sterling said.
The British Shippers' Council, representing UK-based exporters, said it was heartened by the proposal
to drop capacity management from the conference but remained opposed to shipowners cont-rolling the
land leg of a journey.

'We are against the shipowners making profits from inland  price-fixing,' Mr Richard Turner, policy director, said. 'They get the cheapest  price (for inland haulage) by tender and then sell it in a  cartel at the dearest  price.'

The TAA/TACA groups 15 large  shipping lines which account for 85% of sailings across the north Atlantic. It was introduced to stem considerable losses by the  shipping lines and its members include Nedlloyd and Maersk. Exporters say these losses were exaggerated and the conference has been used to push through excessive rate increases.

The European commission has issued a temporary judgment objecting to the  TAA and is expected to produce a final ruling within the next month.

BRUSSELS, Oct 14 (Reuter) - The European Commission will decide in two weeks whether to allow
a controversial agreement between 15 shipowners on prices and capacity on the transatlantic          
container market.

A Commission spokesman said that at a meeting with shipowners representatives on Thursday, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert had said that "changes (to the deal) seemed substantial but needed to be formalised."

TD
The Commission would probably decide in principle on October 26 whether the new deal, called the Trans Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), complies with European Union competition rules, the spokesman said.

But in a move underlining its determination to provide a level playing field in the sector, the Commission will block a previous  agreement called the Trans Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) which was sent to it for clearance in August 1992.
The spokesman and other officials declined to give any details of the new  agreement which involves
European companies but also one American, one Japanese and two Mexican.

Together they control 75 percent of regular  container traffic between European and American ports on both the East and West coast, a senior official said.
More than 80 percent of European exports to the United States go by sea, she added.

"The Commission should block the  TAA on Wednesday and delay its decision on the TACA for a week to allow for further examination," the spokesman said.

The officials said there had been many complaints in particular from European exporters about the original TAA agreement including that freight  prices had increased by between 20 and 60 percent in
1993 and by 15 percent to 20 percent in 1994.

Under the terms of the  agreement, companies agreed prices for regular maritime transport by containers, but what was worse, the official said, this was combined with the freezing of about 20 percent of capacity. The  agreement also included land transport to ports for which the companies involved were charging "prohibitive"  prices, she said.

"By agreeing not to use capacity the companies were artificially reducing the offer of transport which resulted in unacceptable  price increases," she said, adding that the changes announced on Thursday were the first "serious" ones since the Commission started vetting the deal.

If the modifications were confirmed, the Commission would probably decide in two weeks not to go ahead with a plan to propose fining the companies concerned if they failed to comply with competition rules, she said.
This, she said, would give a signal that the new deal was acceptable for the Commission. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

HD        TACA LEGALITY ISSUE ADDRESSED. WC       396 words

IN a dramatic attempt to solve the impasse over the legality of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), member lines have proposed dropping their insistence on managing vessel capacity on the trade.

The proposal was raised last night by Lord Sterling, chairman of the P and O Group and president of the European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA) at a meeting with European competition commissioner Karel van Miert.

TD
The TACA lines believe the move could be enough to secure the  agreement block exemption from
European competition rules.
However, speculation mounted last night that TACA - the newly revised version of the old
Trans-Atlantic Agreement  - had been forced to alter its stance on capacity management in order to
also secure approval from the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC).

The FMC is currently considering the legality of the new accord and has until midnight on October 23 to challenge it in court. It would then come into force.
Austin Schmitt, director of the FMC bureau of trade monitoring, said he sent a letter to TACA's New
York lawyers on October 3 raising serious concern over the effect the accord's "capacity regulation plan"
has on freight rates and the service offered to shippers.
But he indicated in the letter that the FMC might change recommendations it was preparing if the TACA
lines modified certain parts of the  agreement, namely capacity management.

Lord Sterling has contacted FMC chairman William Hathaway about the proposal he has now presented to the European Commission.

The current health of the  transatlantic container trades has meant there has been no need for the TACA lines to manage capacity on their vessels for some time. But the lines are understood to have proposed to Mr van Miert a chance to discuss the issue again in the future if changes in the trade demand such action.

They are hoping this could take the form of an individual exemption from European competition rules over capacity, or possibly the introduction of some sort of capacity management vehicle.

The issue of intermodal rate  fixing  is also understood to have been raised at last night's meeting between Lord Sterling and Mr van Miert.
The lines are keen for the commission to maintain the status quo and allow carriers to continue to
charge door-to-door rates.

BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuter) - The European Commission's decision to block the  TransaTlantic         Agreement  (TAA) between shipowners on the transport of containers is likely to deal a stinging blow
to other shipping cartels, lawyers said.

The decision effectively left the 15 companies involved, which have revised the deal now called TransaTlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), with nothing but  price agreements on sea transport of containers, they said. The Commission condemned capacity management and inland  price fixing  also agreed in TAA.

TD
Only price-fixing deals on maritime transport are clearly authorised because they contribute to stabilising rates.

"What the decision says is that the only way for TACA to get an exemption (from European Union competition rules) is to leave out both the kidneys and the heart," Trevor Soames, with law firm Norton Rose, said. "(TACA) completely emasculates itself."

Existing deals such as the Europe Asia Trade  Agreement  (EATA) on capacity management between Europe-Asia routes and the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC) on multi modal rate  fixing  could be next under Commission investigation.

The Commission said in a statement that it could not exempt  TAA from competition rules because its terms included an artificial freezing of capacity available on ships.

This practice had caused significant  prices increases on the Europe-United States route about which European exporters in particular had complained to the Commission. It also condemned another  TAA practice consisting in  fixing  rates for inland transport to ports.

The landmark ruling was seen affecting both EATA and FEFC since they involve one or the other incriminated practices and because they sail to Europe.

"It marks the first time the Commission has finally determined on issues of absolutely essential and critical importance for the  liner shipping and shipping industries," Soames said. -- +(322)2876800

BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuter) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked a 1992 agreement between 15 shipping companies in the transatlantic container trade saying it broke European Union competition rules.

But it said in statement IP/94/956 it was already considering a revised  agreement between Britain's P&O  Containers Limited, United States' Sea-Land Service Inc and Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk Line among others.

TD
"The shipowners informed the Commission recently of their intention to modify the deal substantially," the statement said.

Changes to the deal on  container traffic between Europe and the United States could include dropping clauses on capacity freezes and  price-fixing on land transport to ports, a Commission official said.

The statement said the first accord called Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) had been blocked because it combined price fixing  practices on sea container transport, which in other circumstances could be allowed, with common tariffs  on land transport to ports and capacity freezes.

Another  agreement called the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) was notified to the Commission in July and was revised during on Thursday when shippers met Competition Comissioner Karel Van Miert.

The Commission said it had received many complaints, especially from European exporters, as the freezing of about 20 percent of capacity had resulted in  price increases of between 20 and 60 percent in 1993 and of 15 to 20 percent in 1994.

"Thanks to this  agreement, which concerns an important share of the traffic and to the combination of price and capacity agreements, members of the  Trans-Atlantic Agreement  were able to impose significant  price increases in 1993 and 1994," the statement said.
The Commission has exempted so-called  liner conference agreements, which set common freight
tariffs,  from EU rules on the grounds that they can be good for customers by providing single rates.

But TAA could not be considered a conference since it also included prices on land transport and capacity freezes. The Commission also noted that although one of TAA's aims was to agree  prices some of its members had different  tariffs.

It therefore concluded that the  agreement could not benefit from the exemption granted to conferences nor an individual exemption under article 85.3.

A Commission spokesman explained the decision to block a deal which no longer applies by saying it was important to send a signal that such deals would be severely punished.
But, the decision was not accompanied by fines because the deal had been officially notified to the
Commission for approval in August 1992 and, therefore, could not be considered as an illegal  cartel.

BRUSSELS (Reuter) - The European Commission, in a landmark ruling, Wednesday blocked an agreement of 15 shipping companies in the transatlantic container trade, saying it broke European Union competition rules.

It particularly condemned companies operating on Europe-United States routes for agreeing to freeze capacity and fix  prices for inland transport to ports.

A CONCEPT paper on the proposed Federation of East Asian Shippers Council (FEASC) will be submitted to the Federation of Asean Shippers Council (Fasc) meeting to be held in Sydney in October next year.

The concept paper will be prepared by a working group to be chaired by Singapore National Shippers Council chairman Sia Yong in consultation with Fasc members and shippers' councils in the East Asian region.

TD
Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Chua Jui Meng, who is also Fasc chairman, said the Council agreed that the FEASC should be set up to enable East Asian shippers to have a bigger say in the global shipping industry.

"In the face of trade growth, we want the  shipping industry to be more open, thereby accepting consultations on  shipping matters affecting the region," he told a press conference at the end of the Fasc 17th annual general meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

Chua said the Fasc will work closely with the Transport Ministry to work out a legislative framework to enable local shipping lines adhere towards fairer  shipping rates and greater transparency of surcharges imposed on shippers.

He said it needed the Government's intervention in this matter as it can help reduce the country's services deficit. Last year, freight and insurance deficit accounted for 34.7% or RM5bn of the total services loss.

"If the Government continues to be in the playing field in favour of the  shipping cartels, then it will result in further losses of our services revenue," Chua said.

Another issue discussed during the annual general meeting was the introduction of several new arrangements by various shipping lines to hamper shippers' movement like the Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement,  Trans-Atlantic Agreement  and Europe Asia Trade Agreement.

All these arrangements are being challenged by the European Shippers' Council and supported by other shippers' bodies including Fasc before the  European Commission in Brussels.
It also urged Indo-Chinese countries to form their own shippers' council.

At the meeting, Chua was re-elected as Fasc chairman for another term while Rosli Abdul Shukor, the principal assistant director of trade support at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was appointed as Fasc secretary-general.

The European Commission yesterday outlawed the  Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA), a shipping
'conference' which set cargo rates and capacity levels across the North Atlantic, because it infringed its
competition rules. This decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had
led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the 15 large shipping lines
which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is however only the first stage in resolving this dispute
because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the  Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement  (TACA) in July. Earlier this month they made a further concession by offering to remove
capacity constraints from the TACA.

TD
A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling established an important principle which would have implications for similar conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa.

If the TACA is also rejected there could be a return to lower  transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in the late 1980s. Members of the  TAA include P and O, Maersk, Nedlloyd, AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd.

The US cables and systems subsidiary of Pirelli, the Italian industrial company, is to collaborate with US companies, research institutes and the government in building the world's first prototype high temperature superconductor power cable. The new generation of cables, if developed successfully, should allow electricity utilities to increase the amount of power transmitted along existing routes, at lower costs and without environmental damage. Pirelli Cable Corporation will manufacture the cable itself. The project, which will cost $5.8m and last four years, will be co-funded by Pirelli, the American Superconductor Corporation, a Nasdaq-quoted US company which will manufacture the superconductive wire, the Electric Power Research Institute, the US electricity utilities' research body, and the US department of energy.
The department's research laboratories at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and Ames will also work on the project.

Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, yesterday proposed that Malaysian and British companies work together to exploit opportunities in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region. 'There is great scope if you seize the opportunity to use the UK as a springboard into Europe,' said Mr Heseltine, the first British minister to visit Malaysia since it lifted a ban on doing business with British companies in September. In February Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, banned British companies from government contracts in retaliation for British press reports which hinted at corruption among senior figures in Malaysia. Mr Heseltine's two day trip to Malaysia is being seen as a peace-making exercise. In hour-long talks with Dr Mahathir the British minister stressed Britain's extensive trade and cultural links with Malaysia and its willingness to transfer technology to Malaysia's fast expanding economy. Mr Heseltine carefully avoided any public reference to the trade ban, merely saying that in politics there were ups and downs.

competition rules. This decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had
led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the 15 large shipping lines
which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is however only the first stage in resolving this dispute
because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the  Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement  (TACA) in July. Earlier this month they made a further concession by offering to remove
capacity constraints from the TACA.

TD
A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling established an important principle which would have implications for similar conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa.

If the TACA is also rejected there could be a return to lower  transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in the late 1980s. Members of the  TAA include P and O, Maersk, Nedlloyd, AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd.

BRUSSELS
The European Commission has blocked an agreement of 15 shipping companies in the
trans-Atlantic container trade, saying it broke European Union competition rules.

TD
It particularly condemned companies operating on Europe-United States routes for agreeing to freeze capacity and fix  prices for inland transport to ports.

The commission said in a statement it was already considering a revised deal, called  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement,  or TACA, involving Britain's P&O  Containers Ltd., U.S.-based Sea-Land Service Inc. and Denmark's A. P. Moller-Maersk Line, among others.

HD       ATLANTIC LINER PACT IS DECLARED ILLEGAL.

THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday formally outlawed the  Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) on the grounds that it contravened European competition rules.
Competition directorate DG4 ruled that the  TAA failed to meet the terms of the block exemption under
European regulation 4056.

TD
It said illegal TAA practices included combined  price-fixing and capacity regulation as well as charging different tariffs.

It decided not to lift the  TAA's immunity from fines because the  agreement had been registered with the commission.
The commission also dismissed a  TAA application for individual exemption on the grounds that the
agreement did not offer adequate benefits to shippers.

However, Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, hinted that changes to the  TAA's replacement, the newly formed  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), came close to meeting demands for exemption from competition rules.

Mr van Miert told Lloyd's List that recent modifications to the TACA "met to a considerable extent" commission requirements.

But he stressed that a final decision on the legality of the new accord could not be made until all the points had been examined by his department.
A commission spokesman said it could take up to 10 days for a decision on the TACA.
TACA lines last week proposed dropping their reliance on capacity management within the accord. They proposed a number of other concessions which included abolishing minimum service contract
requirements and reducing the notice period for taking independent action on  tariffs.
Mr van Miert said: "TACA is an  agreement between lots of shipowners.

"But if the modified version meets our requirements, and it seems to go a long way in that direction, considering it as a conference  agreement might be accepted. But this has to be looked at." The commission also hinted that the removal of capacity management provisions from the TACA  agreement last week, injected flexibility into rate  fixing  on the North Atlantic trade.
DG4 said the wider issue of intermodal rate  fixing  authority still had to be worked out.

It hinted that awarding TACA block exemption from competition rules could be considered separately from the issue surrounding intermodal rate  fixing.

However, in order to escape future action on intermodal rate  fixing,  shipowners would have to meet the criteria already laid down for exemption.

It would be up to shipowners in general, and not just on the North Atlantic, to file concrete formulae in the future to secure exemption from competition rules.
Mr van Miert said DG4 had got its act together and was closer to its objective of sorting out the issue. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1994.

HD   COMPETITION - BAN ON TAA AGREEMENT REPRESENTS "CLEAR SIGNAL" ON WHAT IS PROHIBITED - COMMISSION.

Brussels, 20/10/1994 (Agence Europe) - As EUROPE mentioned yesterday, the  European Commission has decided to ban the  Transatlantic Agreement  (TAA, signed between 15 maritime companies from throughout the world and notified to the Commission in August 1992), considering that it does not meet the necessary conditions to benefit from the "exemption by category" provided for maritime conferences, nor the individual exemption under Article 85(3), as it does not provide sufficient advantages for users.  TAA,
which ran from August 1992 to July 1994, involved the joint setting of  tariffs,  and conditions of transport, as well as the capacity limits for  container maritime traffic between Europe and the United States.

TD
The Commission's spokesperson stressed that, although the agreement in question is no longer being implemented by shipowners while waiting for the new TACA agreement to come into effect, on which the Commission will decide soon (see below), a formal decision banning the  agreement was nevertheless made by the Commission because: i) TAA still served as a reference for setting the 1995  tariffs  (which will therefore now have to be reviewed); ii) TAA provisions proved to be "totally" contrary to the spirit of the rules of the EC Treaty; iii) it was regarded as appropriate to give a clear signal to operators in other sectors of activity that this type of  agreement has to be compatible with the Community's rules of competition and that the Commission set on making sure these were fully respected.

The Commission did not impose fines on the TAA member companies, given that it had never lifted the immunity on fines that this type of agreement benefits from and on which the Commission has started investigation proceedings.

As for the new TACA  agreement that shipowners have notified to the Commission and which they have recently modified (modifications qualified as "substantial" by the Commission spokesperson), the Commission decided to postpone its decision on a possible "objection" in order to be able to examine in detail the latest developments. EUROPE has reason to believe that a decision is not expected before the end of the month.

THE European Commission is due to decide within the next week whether or not to grant the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) block exemption from European competition rules.

If, as expected, the EC follows the lead of the US Federal Maritime Commission and delivers the exemption the lines need to operate, it will have brought to an end one of the most expensive, controversial and time consuming maritime competition issues to date.

TD
If it does not, it could force the  transatlantic liner carriers to the edge of a precipice beyond which they could be forced to compete intensely for business in a market free-for-all.

Far fewer lines would able to compete, possibly a handful of mega carriers dominated by Far Eastern lines, and services for shippers would be reduced drastically.
If Europe's shipowners have succeeded in educating the competition directorate to the nuances of the
European shipping industry, this scenario will not become a reality.

But the  price the lines will have to pay for exemption is a high one, judging by the extent of the last minute changes made to the TACA in the face of the commission's outlawing of the  TAA. The overriding question that must be asked is: Was it all worth it?

Prior to the  TAA being registered in April 1992, the  transatlantic trade was controlled by two rate agreements-Neusara and Usanera. Aligned to them was a unique talking shop called the Eurocorde agreement which allowed conference and non-conference lines to discuss rates.

However, the extent of losses on the trade at this time forced the conference lines to rethink their position.

They came up with an  agreement which they thought would be a panacea: an  agreement that strictly regulated both vessel capacity and freight rates and, by design, bound the individual lines - old conference as well as non-conference lines - into adhering to a strict rating regime.

This has all changed. Thanks to the commission's actions, gone are the capacity management regulations of the old  TAA and now TACA as well as the bulk of the mechanism that had restricted the free movement of the lines to negotiate rate terms individually with shippers.

In its place is an  agreement little changed in principle from the old Neusara and Usanera - albeit with a certain degree of discipline still imposed on its enlarged membership to toe the party line or face the threat of spiralling freight rates and plummeting profitability.

Some will argue that the road taken by the  TAA and latterly TACA was vital to propel lines to profitability at a time when healthy returns on the trade were nowhere to be seen. It can also be argued that in its relatively short existence the  TAA had in any case largely fulfilled its purpose, making the lines' concessions in TACA easier to bear.

But had the lines opted instead to take their customers with them and involve the shippers in helping to find a solution to improve returns on what was recognised as a severely depressed market, could they have achieved as much?


Page 30 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
From the outset shippers, though understanding of the lines' need to make a profit, were incensed at the method they had chosen to achieve their goal. Shippers may yet take their revenge on the lines in other areas of dispute, while the reviled  TAA may inspire more effective lobbying of the industry and governments.

It may be a tough lesson to learn but the commission's clipping of TACA's wings may force owners to consider a more conciliatory approach to their problems next time round.

AMSTERDAM, Oct 25 (Reuter) - Dutch transport group Nedlloyd says it does not expect the  European Commission's move last Wednesday to block  price and capacity deals between  shipping lines on the transatlantic container route to affect its profitability

"We see no discontinuation in our position and profitability on the  transatlantic route," Paul Bijvoets, Nedlloyd Lines chief executive officer told Reuters.

TD
"Nedlloyd (overall) results are on schedule. Our cost reduction plans are running as we wanted them to run and we also see growth and scale effects helping us too. We are confident that we will continue to improve our results," he added.

Bijvoets said the previous  Trans Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) had been replaced by new arrangement between the lines, which came into force on October 23 and which excludes the contentious reference to shipping capacity cooperation.

"The old deal was declared illegal, but everyone expected it. For that reason we created a new agreement. There is no more capacity management in the new  agreement and it is a normal conference deal whereby lines can set rates together," he said.

Bijvoets said he thought the sharp fall of over 10 guilders in Nedlloyd's share price in the past week was due more to the steep decline in the dollar than the EU move on the TAA.

Nedlloyd's earnings are mainly in dollars and therefore its shares are very sensitive to movements in the U.S. currency.
On Monday Nedlloyd's shares closed down 40 cents at 48.50 guilders. A week ago the stock stood at
59.20 guilders.

Bijvoets said that in general tariff increases on Nedlloyd's main  shipping routes were holding well and the key Europe to Far East container route continued to operate at full capacity.

"At the moment our vessels as well as those of our competitors from Europe to the Far East are chock-a-block and there's even a space shortage," he said.

HD         Commission still has doubts  about shipowners freight  deal. BY          By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuter) - The  European Commission still has problems with the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) between 15 shipowners on  transatlantic container transport despite changes made to the deal last week, a senior Commission official said on Tuesday.

The official said the shipowners had dropped provisions on capacity freezes, which had brought the Commission's wrath down upon them, but had kept rules which were likely to harm  container users' interests.

TD
A decision on the revised TACA was not expected before the end of the year and not this week or next as announced previously by a Commission spokesman, the official said.

"If all goes well we should be able to reach a decision by the end of the year," the senior official said, adding that the Commission would try to negotiate with shipowners further changes required for the deal to conform with competition rules.

But if this approach proved to be unsucessful it would send the companies involved a statement of objections possibly accompanied by a penalties threat, the official told Reuters.

The official said that with a "few changes" the  agreement would possibly benefit from group exemptions the Commission usually grants to maritime conferences.

The Commission last week blocked an initial  agreement, called the Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  of which it had been notified in August 1992, because it had provoked freight price increases between 20 and 60 percent in 1993 and 15 to 20 percent in 1994.

This was mainly because firms involved agreed to freeze 20 percent of their capacity. The  agreement involves 15 firms, including Sea-Land Service Inc of the United States, P&O  Containers Limited of Britain and Atlantic  Container  Line of Sweden.

The Commission official said that the shipowners had only partially abandoned another practice it had problems with, in which they bought inland transport services to ports from other companies and charged "prohibitive" fares for it afterwards.

"They no longer have agreements with providers of land tranport, but they can agree between themselves on this part of transport", the official said.
The Commission also opposed TACA provisions prohibiting its members of concluding individual  tariffs
with large customers.
"This clause is particularly opposed by  container users," the official said.

The Commission was notified of TACA in July as a replacement for  TAA, but this did not prevent it from blocking the latter on the basis that its restrictive practices had applied for two years and because
TACA did not present any substantial modifications.

Shipowners finally made "serious" chances to the second  agreement two weeks ago when it became clear that the Commission was going to decide fines on them.

HD         FASC TO INCLUDE SHIPPERS' BODIES FROM EAST ASIA - ALEC ALMAZAN. WC        378 words

SINGAPORE - Members of the Federation of Asean Shippers Councils (FASC) have agreed to transform the group into an expanded body called the East Asian Shippers' Council. The federation has decided to adopt a proposal from the Singapore National Shippers Council to include shippers' bodies from countries such as China, Japan, Taiwan, Hongkong and South Korea in the new organisation.

The FASC said later the move was significant because of the growing importance of East Asian nations in world trade. Together with Asean, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Hongkong account for a third of world sea trade.

TD
The expansion of membership is also expected to give Asian shippers a stronger hand in dealing with conferences and rate agreements.
China has welcomed the move and says it will set up a shippers' council soon.

A committee under the chairmanship of the Sia Yong, of the Singapore National Shippers Council, has been formed to come up with a plan to organise the East Asian Shippers' Council.

Some shipping executives say this may not be so easy as the market is fragmented and shippers from different countries have different interests and priorities. "It's just icing on the cake," the managing director of an international  shipping line based in Singapore commented. "The Asean and East Asian shippers' councils have been dealing with each other for some time now but they have not been able to exert much influence on the conferences."

The FASC noted at its general meeting last week that the situation on freight rates had "improved". Because of disarray in the conference mechanism, rates were once more being set in the marketplace, it said.

Furthermore, individual national shippers' councils have become more willing to seek government relief. Australia and Taiwan, for instance, have introduced legislation to bring about negotiations on "fairer" shipping rates and greater transparency on surcharges imposed on shippers.
Thailand is drafting legislation to achieve the same objectives.

The FASC said it would support the European Shippers' Council in its fight against new arrangements such as the Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement,  the Transatlantic Agreement and the Europe Asia Trade Agreement.  A case challenging these arrangements is pending before the European Commission in Brussels.

HD        SPECIAL REPORT - ATLANTIC CONTAINER TRADES - NEED FOR STABILITY AFTER PERIOD OF TURMOIL.

TURMOIL is just one word which could be used to describe current events in the  transatlantic trade.

This year, we have seen takeovers, realignments, share flotations and, most importantly, the battle between the 15 members of the former  Trans Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) with Brussels bureaucrats.

TD
Possibly due to the history of trade between European countries and the US, the mention of the word transatlantic brings back memories of famous  liners and cargo liners leaving daily from each side - and of the Atlantic convoys during the Second World War.

Much has changed since the  container revolution started to bite in the mid-1960s. Many of the old traditional names have disappeared, while new ones appeared, only to go the same way as their predecessors.
A few have survived, despite years of severe recession, some by transforming their services to a
round-the-world configuration, whereby the  transatlantic becomes just one leg in the logistics transport
chain.

Much has been written about the arguments between the member lines of the old TAA and the revamped Trans Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) with the European Commission.

At the time of writing, Brussels had not decided whether the new  agreement will qualify for block exemption from the European competition rules. A decision was expected any day.
However, last week Brussels formally outlawed the old  TAA, saying it contravened competition rules. Competition commissioner Karel van Miert hinted the changes suggested in the format of TACA came
close to meeting the requirements for exemption from competition rules.
The Commission's competition directorate (DG4) was assessing last-minute proposals.

Among the latest set of proposals put to the Commission for consideration was an  agreement to abolish the annual 100 teu minimum service contract requirement.

Shippers will still be able to negotiate shipments below this level with a service contract, the extent of the discount will differ depending on the circumstances.

Other issues being debated included a 15-day window for unilateral action by any of the lines on service contracts, plus the reduction in the notice period for taking independent action on  tariffs  from five to three days.

A change in the voting system allows service contracts to come into force. They would be valid if approved by five member lines, instead of the old method of securing support from the majority of lines, less two.

One concern of Brussels was the collective negotiation with rail, air, motor and water carriers within inland transportation, which had been removed in the US for many years.



Page 36 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
TACA members proposed to abolish this practice, while finally the members agreed to remove the provision which allows them collectively to exchange data and statistics with other interested parties.

The member lines were expresssing confidence the concessions were enough to sway Karel van Miert and his team to accept the TACA  agreement.

One point open to negotiation is the ability of conferences to manage vessel capacity in certain circumstances. At present nobody knows what these circumstances or conditions are.

The lines have held talks with the Commission on how their needs can be accommodated within the demands of the law.

P and O's chairman Lord Sterling was the chief negotiator for the lines in his guise as the president of the European Community Shipowners' Association (ECSA).

It appeared the vital area to be explored was capacity management and how to incorporate individual exemption from competition laws.

In a separate move, the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) late last week gave TACA members the green light to trade as a conference on the North Atlantic.
The FMC cited the recent changes to TACA's format as the reason for its acceptance.
It also said the agency would continue to monitor TACA's progress to ensure it was not contravening US
competition laws once trading commenced. This was deemed particularly necessary when new
operators joined, such as Hanjin, which is expected be part of the alliance from January 1 next year.
The original TAA was formed in June 1992 and immediately came under fire from the European
Shippers' Council, which asked the  European Commission to investigate.

Rates and volumes have since picked up, whereby some operators were going into the black for the first time in years.

Recently, the European Shippers' Council expressed concern if the regulatory authorities accepted TACA, it would become a role model and quickly spread to other areas. The ESC has asked the Commission for consultation on the latest proposals.

While containerships operating on the Atlantic tend not to be as large as their counterparts on the Far East services, except for the round-the-world operators, the cost of a newbuilding in the 2,500 teu range is approaching the $50m mark.

Naturally, an operator needs to protect his investment and to ensure each box carried contributes to the operating costs of the vessel, plus providing a profit, something which has not been seen for many a year.
On the other side, shippers, quite rightly seek to protect themselves from inflated freight rates.
The various shippers' councils vehemently oppose any rate rise proposed by the vessel operators. However, some form of stability is now needed on the Atlantic, as both the US and northern Europe
enter a period of sustained growth.

HD       EUROPEAN OWNERS MAY WIN MULTIMODAL COMPROMISE. BY        By Alan Dickey, Netherlands Correspondent

EUROPEAN shipowners may qualify for special exemption from a tough new series of rules outlawing multimodal rate  fixing,  a senior European Commission official claimed yesterday.

But Wim Blonk, director for Maritime Transport and Ports at the EC's Directorate General for Transport (DG7), warned maritime lawyers at the fourth annual European Maritime Law Organisation (EMLO) conference in Rotterdam that owners would have to act quickly if they wanted to be considered for exemption.

TD
He said competition commissioner Karel van Miert's new maritime transport report made clear that
"naked inland price fixing  by conference" would not be tolerated by the EC.

However, the commission was prepared to allow "by way of an individual exemption,  price fixing  for the inland leg by groups of operators which had meaningful co-operation in the inland sector". Such
co-operation could be extended to joint  container operations, interchange of  containers, common land transport services, and the operation of joint depots or computer systems.

He said carriers that did not co-operate on the inland transport leg "will have to offer individual  tariffs  for their land-haul operations. To avoid instability resulting from excessive  price competition, conferences in which at least two operators co-operate... will have the possibility of agreeing that neither may  charge a price which is below its own costs."

Dr Blonk also said the commission was granting conferences "a reasonable transitional period to adapt their agreements and practices to the new commission approach". He called on owners to examine the proposals and suggestions made and to submit requests for individual exemptions as soon as possible.
The EC Council of Ministers is due to debate Mr van Miert's maritime report in mid-November and Dr
Blonk said it was important that  shipping lines' opinions were included in this debate.

He added: "To make sure that this discussion will be fruitful, it will be of crucial importance that shipowners make their opinion on the van Miert proposals known well before the council meeting."

Dr Blonk regretted being unable to provide give additional information on competition in maritime transport, and the fact that he was unable to talk about the biggest current issue in the maritime law arena, the replacement of the  Trans Atlantic Agreement  with the New  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA).

From Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm

FOUR of Sweden's big exporters have come out strongly against shipping cartels and conferences, saying that in future they intend only to enter agreements with individual shipping companies.

TD
The move is directed against the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA), which was outlawed last week by the European Commission, and its successor, the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca).

The four companies - linked through an organisation called Tarsan (Transatlantic Revival Swedish Action Necessary) - comprise Volvo, the car group; Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper concern; Electrolux, the world's leading producer of household appliances; and Vin and Sprit, the Swedish alcohol monopoly.

Tarsan secretary, Ulla Ressel, said: "Conferences and cartels in  shipping restrict freedom of choice and competition. Tarsan and the transport subsidiaries of the four companies have decided to act together to tackle restraints on competition in  shipping."

The group was formed last year to help its members achieve long-term stability in areas such as quality, service and prices.

HD       FINANCIAL FOCUS - ANALYSTS SPLIT OVER P AND O SHARES VALUE. WC      836 words

P and O's recent bull run seemed to be levelling off yesterday after strong activity which has seen the shares gain by more than 35p in the past week. The stock was up 2p at 638p at last night's close, Anthony Poole, Markets Reporter writes.

The activity in the stock over the past fortnight has also revealed a clear split in opinion among analysts over the value of P and O's shares. Two weeks ago, James Capel was telling its clients to sell the stock, which pushed it below 600p. Last week, UBS was offering the opposite advice, backed on Monday by NatWest Markets, which quickly brought the stock back above the 600p mark.

TD
The recent deliberations by the  European Commission over the legality of the  Transatlantic Rate
Agreement  have sparked much of the interest in the stock.

Then there has been that hardy perennial: the Channel Tunnel, which has renewed the usual chorus of doom on future ferry profits.

So what have the analysts been saying? In the case of James Capel, it cited the commission's ruling on the TAA as being damaging insofar as P and O's potential  container earnings were concerned.

It also said that the opening of the Channel Tunnel would dent its highly profitable cross-Channel ferry operations.

In contrast, UBS put out a buy note, distributed among a small network of its clients, recommending the shares. Its note is believed to have highlighted the strong potential, which many analysts believe P and O has, in container shipping and cruise shipping.

Recent results have shown that P and O, chaired by Lord Sterling, has already begun to see the benefits of rising rates on the high-density Europe to Far East  container trade. As P and O is a high-volume carrier, the slightest rate increase has a dramatic effect on its revenues.

The influx of modern tonnage on to this route, combined with past fleet refinancing deals, has helped keep ship operating costs down, thus putting the company on a considerably more profitable footing.

NatWest Markets dismisses the  TAA ruling as irrelevant, saying that rates are steady to rising with volumes growing and unit costs falling as the restructuring processes take effect. It also says that profits in the container business are set to rise and talks of the possibility of a large increase in the next few years, given the  container businesses' sensitivity to rates.

Bulk shipping, having been in the doldrums during the past few years and beset by low freight rates, now appears set to turn the corner, thanks to a dramatic increase to spot market levels, especially on capesize tonnage in which P and O Bulk is a major player.

NatWest Markets notes that average daily earnings for capesize tonnage has increased to $18,000 per day against a 1993 average of just $11,500/day. It notes that many of P and O's vessels are fixed on rolling contracts of affreightment (COAs) at just under $11,000 per day but, over the next year, it should start to see the benefit of higher rates as COAs are renewed.

In revenue terms, P and O Bulk could expect to see an improvement of $37m on its 14-vessel fleet, excluding the new ships due to be delivered in 1995 and 1996, or #18m ($29.16m) allowing for dollar weakness.
Page 41 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Cruise shipping is benefiting from increased  prices and rising passenger yields - a trend which is expected to continue and one which has benefited P and O and its competitors.

Insofar as all of P and O's  shipping operations are concerned, the only real cause for concern is the value of the dollar, which has fallen against sterling this year. Further upward pressure on UK interest rates is likely to strengthen sterling further against the dollar.

NatWest Markets concedes that the ferry operations will take a "hit" in 1995 thanks to the Channel Tunnel. But it falls broadly in line with P and O's own opinion that at some stage after 1995 the market will find its own level and P and O will settle into a sizeable market share, despite the competition beneath the seabed.

The real division among the analysts is on the pricing of the shares. NatWest Markets says the shares at a level in the low to mid 600p mark is undervalued. It bullishly values the stock at 715p. It says at
present, stripping out cruise and  container shipping but including investment properties, the degeared residual is being valued at about 9.5 times projected 1995 earnings, which is too low, even though ferries account for one-third of this.

However, Matthew Hetherington, transport analyst at Schroeders, believes the shares are already overvalued. He says that anything above 600p is too high.
But he is adamant that P and O remains safe as a long-term investment. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1994.

HD      NEDLLOYD FACES MOUNTING NEW PRESSURES. WC     1,281 words

LP
Nedlloyd Lines' takeover - with Malaysian International  Shipping Corp - of Compagnie Generale Maritime's stake in the Tonnage Sharing  Agreement,  and developments affecting carrier agreements on the Atlantic, highlighted the competitive pressures mounting on the Dutch giant. Our Netherlands Correspondent Alan Dickey talked to Nedlloyd chief executive officer Paul Bijvoets

NEDLLOYD Lines has been busy of late with the ink still drying on the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement,  son of the ill-fated and recently declared illegal Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  and its deal to take a greater exposure in the Far East-Europe trade.

TD
Nedlloyd has had a lasting relationship with both trades, and its lawyers have been as busy as any in the careful penning of the new wording of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  which was crafted to meet the terms of the block exemption under European Commission regulation 4056.

Paul Bijvoets, who took over the helm of Nedlloyd Lines from Anton van Langeveld on his retirement earlier this year, says he has faith in the potential and permanency of TACA.

"We take considerable stock from the fact that the conference has kept its cohesion and its harmony throughout a difficult period. The willingness of lines to co-operate within the conference system is there. Without this, chaos would prevail."
But he concedes that the North Atlantic trade is difficult, and given the fact that Nedlloyd shifted only
110,000 boxes on the route annually, compared to 760,000 elsewhere in the world in 1993, it is by no
means the company's most important business. However, he says: "We would miss this business were it
not part of what we do. If there was no Atlantic trade, we would miss its contribution to our land-based
organisation. The extra capacity it brings to this business is very important."

But the legal wrangling that has accompanied the process of moving containers from Europe to the US has become a permanent thorn in the side of Nedlloyd and that of other liner companies. Mr Bijvoets argues: "What we had problems in understanding was that gradually it appeared that  TAA was getting more and more legally involved.

"It clearly had less to do with moving boxes. While we [the  shipping companies] have talked to our respective governments about the legal debate with the EC, it seemed to us that DG1V, while a competent organisation, was taking the role of prosecutor and judge all rolled into one."

Member states of the European Union, Mr Bijvoets maintains, must learn from the fact that they did nothing or little during the fiery debate which eventually killed off the  TAA.

In parallel to its role in creating TACA, the company has been involved in broader negotiations to create the new super-consortium, comprising TSA members, American President Lines, and Orient Overseas Container  Line which will take its place in the Europe-Far East trade in January 1996.

As part of its deal with CGM, Mr Bijvoets revealed, Nedlloyd has an option to buy outright the four containerships featured in its deal, with Malaysian International Shipping Corp, to take over French Compagnie Generale Maritime's share of Europe-Far East shipping traffic.
He said the Dutch company has been given the purchase option for the vessels CGM Normandie of
4,500 teu, and for the smaller CGM Paseru, CGM Pascal and CGM Korrigan boxships, all of 2,800 teu.

Page 43 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the vessels must remain under the French flag and CGM ownership for the length of their various time charters, and any purchasing programme would therefore be staggered.

Mr Bijvoets disclosed that the commercial possibilities afforded by owning the ships and operating them as part of the larger share it now has of Europe-Far East trades, "seem attractive", but added that a firm decision will only be taken nearer the time the ships are available. The first of these - one of the smaller vessels - will be in two years' time. The longest time charter of five years is for the largest vessel, CGM Normandie.
He said that Nedlloyd and MISC's decision to assume all of CGM Orient's rights and obligations under the
TSA would not involve money changing hands: "No money will be either paid or received," he said.

And he said that the planned changes to the TSA would have no detrimental effect on Mitsui OSK's plan to join the TSA next March as part of preparations to build a new super-consortium, comprising TSA members plus American President Lines and Orient Overseas  Container  Line on the Europe-Far East route.

He is confident that Nedlloyd will benefit from its increased market share, although rates on the trade remain difficult. "It's not the most attractive trade and rates have decreased over the years, although it is true to say that there has been some recovery eastbound.

"I think for everyone concerned it is a good deal. This is not a trade where there are millions to be made, although we think the timing of this deal is good for us and for MISC."

Containership operators introduced a 40% of volume increase on eastbound traffic as of July 1994, but a similar attempt to raise rates on westbound traffic failed. Mr Bijvoets said this was a disappointment.

"The interesting question will be to see what happens to the independent companies. They've always had a price differential, but what will happen here? Will that differential get bigger? Will we see mergers or new alliances?"
Food for thought for those who like to speculate on the future of this important trade is the future roles for
K Line, Hyundai, and Sea-Land. The sector is a ripe rumour generator.

Following its deal with CGM, Nedlloyd has 75% of the TSA Eur- ope-Far East  container shipping routes and MISC 25%. Nedlloyd will take on between 80 and 100 CGM staff, mainly to handle clients.
Mr Bijvoets said that the deal, combined with growth on various routes, will boost Nedlloyd Lines' total
container volume to a little more than 1m teu by 1996 from around 800,000 in 1994.
The economies of scale it will deliver will speed up a decline in costs, which have already fallen by 13%
since 1992, he said.
Costs will have fallen 18% by 1996 from 1992 levels.

Looking at the group as a whole, Mr Bijvoets says he is content with its reformed management structure, to which the final coat of paint was being applied as he was appointed to his present post.

The group now has three operational divisions, in Hong Kong, Atlanta and Rotterdam, where overall management responsibility lies. Its lines of demarcation and responsibility are said to be substantially clearer, and from the board's point of view, the company is far more efficient.

By the start of next year, the group will have hit its target of Fls250m ($148m) in savings, imposed by chairman Leo Berndsen. Of this, Nedlloyd Lines can be expected to have contributed roughly half. Mr Bijvoets says the company is still, to some degree, in a phase of transition. He worked closely on the shipping side with the now defunct ScanDutch alliance and now recalls: "Four to five years before ScanDutch started, Nedlloyd was clearly much more of a conventional  shipping company, with conventional ships as well as  containerships.

"The process of transition between the Nedlloyd then and the Nedlloyd now has been to become a dedicated containership company with a dedicated land transport operation.

"I think we are still growing. And that process will continue to a certain point where we consider ourselves to be fully matured."

The unique non vessel owning common carrier (NVOCC) set-up for the US deepsea greight forwarding industry is struggling to survive, writes JIM LAMB from San Francisco.

US ocean freight consolidators, who have that betwixt and between identity of non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC or NVO), have good reason to fear their unique status could come to an end in the not too-distant future.

TD
On one side they see other segments of the industry -  shipping lines, forwarders, shippers - encroaching on their territory. On the other, there seems to be a trend for the US to move more towards the European model where there is no real distinction between forwarder, customs broker, and NVO.

"Actually, globalisation will probably take us beyond the European model," argues Pierre Schoenheimer, chief executive of Radix Group International.

"At the same time," he adds, "it may also see information systems and processing operations moved to lower cost areas, such as India and China."

But Federal maritime commissioner Ming Chen Hsu tries to put aside any notion that the FMC prefers to deal with carrier and conference matters and ignore the NVOs.

"Nothing could be further from the truth," says Ms Hsu. "In fact, I've made it my personal goal to pay particular attention to the concerns of NVOs since joining the commission in 1990. I have developed a real admiration for the NVO work ethic: it is truly a dynamic business."

She is concerned, however, by some of the negative reaction within the NVO industry to the FMC's recent decision to hold in abeyance a proposed rule revision on co-loading. The commission voted to initiate a new proceeding, exploring more fully the legal issues.

"I read in the press that NVOs would have preferred we just drop the whole thing rather than subject them to another round of expensive comments," she says.

"That attitude is extremely shortsighted. I seriously doubt that the larger NVO community would really prefer that we simply revoke the current rule and thereby eliminate co-loading as a commercial practice. On the other hand, we believe that the current regulations present problems we cannot ignore."

Ms Hsu adds: "It needs repeating: the focus of our attention is on co-loading as an off-tariff method of privately rating cargo. We are not questioning the long-accepted commercial practice of cargo consolidation."

But Peter Friedman, the Washington counsel for the Pacific Coast of Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders, asks why the US continues to be the only major trading nation in the world to treat the NVO as a separate entity?
Ms Hsu responds: "The FMC cannot change that. It would require legislation to exempt the NVOs from
tariff filing. "

However, though NVOs find themselves squeezed economically and conceptually, it doesn't seem to have dampened their enthusiasm.

Page 46 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"When anyone asks me what you have to do today to survive in this business, I say adjust," says Leiv O Knutsen, executive vice-president of Shipco Transport Inc in New Jersey. "Perhaps a less
tongue-in-cheek response would be that quality is the key ingredient to survival."

And that concept of quality is probably more important when it comes to NVOs than with almost any other element of the

shipping business.

"As an industry, we really have a terrible reputation, primarily because there are those few out there who spoil it for the really good NVOs," says Laurie Zack Olson, executive director of the International Association of Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers (IANVOCC).

"But on the other hand, a shipper should have enough business acumen to inquire into the reputation - quality, if you will - of an NVO prior to signing a contract, just as in any other business dealing," says Mrs Olson, who had a lengthy career as an NVO before taking over the IANVOCC.

Michael Troy, who heads New Jersey-based Troy Catucci Line Inc, agrees. "It's definitely something you carry with you." he says. " Unfortunately, there are those who jump jobs, start up businesses and then shut down with no warning. As a result, NVOs have got a bad name over the years." So, is lack of quality the reason a lot of once familiar NVO company names are among the missing - companies that have been bought, merged, or simply gone out of business?

Jim Justiss, president of CaroTrans International of Cherryville, North Carolina, says it is extremely important that an NVO knows what its costs are.
"Pricing and rate decisions should be based on that rather than simply going after volume," he says. Conversely, there are many NVOs who have helped change the way  shipping lines look at the business. It has been estimated that NVOs are responsbile for 30% to 40% of the liftings of some carriers, making
them a very effective sales arm.

"Many independent steamship lines have made their markets with NVOs; without us they wouldn't be where they are," claims Mr Troy.

Dan Petrosini, who heads President  Container  Lines in New Jersey, believes that in the struggle for survival, there is no good reason to try to maintain a high profile.

"We've been here 16 years and plan to be here another 16, or more, and we've made money every year," he said.

"Maybe what has kept us alive is concentrating on the fundamentals of the business rather than on some of the glitz."
Mr Petrosini has also adapted. "Our whole operation, outbound and inbound, is fully automated. "We've invested the resources to help us trace and track shipments, create load plans, handle bills of
lading, and develop manifests."

Computerisation/ automation has become an absolute necessity according to all of the NVOs interviewed.
"Any company that doesn't have the capital to invest in a modern electronic data processing (EDP)
system is going to die," declares DCL's Michael Sinclair.

Expansion has been market by market, says Mr Sinclair. "But now we're running out of markets to enter," he says.

"I think the NVO business is going to continue to polarise - the big are going to get bigger and the niche players will survive. But the middle of the road businesses will eventually fade away."

And Mr Sinclair goes so far as to project that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to come into the business today and start up a new, viable NVOCC.

He points out that DCL loads  containers for five ports in Japan - Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobi, and Nagoya. "Someone just starting out may try to pool all its Japan shipments and send them to Tokyo, then truck every to all the other destinations," he says. "Well, what they may not know is that trucking a


Page 47 of 54 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
shipment from Tokyo to Yokohama will be as expensive as the ocean cost from Los Angeles to
Yokohama. That sort of thing can eat you up pretty quickly."

But Mr Knutsen says industry observers were saying there was no room for a major new NOV when Shipco started up six years ago. "I think we have proved them wrong. Obviously, with the  TransAtlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) in place, you can compete on an equal basis now. Much of the
cut-throat rate ac
tion has been eliminated."

Mrs Olson adds: "I just hope this industry isn't going to base its competition on rates any more. That isn't going to do anyone any good. I think the carriers have finally realised this - now I think it is time the NVOs realised it, too. But if that's the game everyone decides to play, it is going to put us all out of business."

NVOs have gained some relief from their complaints of discrimination from the  TransAtlantic                   Agreement (TAA).

Within a few days of each other, the  TAA was declared illegal by the European Commission (EC) and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) allowed the  TransAtlantic Conference Agreement  - TAA's successor - to become effective.

The FMC decided to take no action against TACA after the members agreed to a number of modifications, including:
Removal of the capacity regulation programme

Authorisation for carriers not participating in TACA service contracts unilaterally to negotiate different rates with shippers during a 15-day window following filing of the TACA contract;
Reduction of the independent action notice window on rates from five to three days; Reduction of the number of conference carriers required to approve service contracts from a
"majority-minus-two" formula to five favorable votes;
Elimination of the 100 teu or $100,000 minimum requirement for service contracts;

Deletion of provisions allowing carriers to collectively negotiate with inland carriers on European inland segments of through transportation, and to enter into agreements with other parties.

The commissioner said that while some of these modifcations have received more attention in the media than others, "I believe that NVOs may receive the most immediate and positive benefit from the elimination of the service contract minimum".

HD        GUINNESS URGES NO TACA EXEMPTION. BY         By Sean Moloney,  Shipping Correspondent.

LEADING transatlantic shipper Guinness has urged the  European Commission not to exempt the newly-formed Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) from European competition rules.

In a letter to Karel van Miert, the European competition commissioner, Brian Baldock, Guinness deputy chairman, said the emergence of the TACA as an alternative  agreement to the TAA "leaves us with the feeling this (the Commission's recent banning of the  TAA) could prove to be a Pyrrhic victory.

TD
"Beyond the technical and legal differences between the  TAA and TACA there lies a far greater similarity. Both result in a grouping which controls roughly 75% of the market and which engages in horizontal price fixing  administered through a central secretariat.
"This grouping has effectively eliminated all  price competition on the North Atlantic routes since 1992;
and would continue to do so under the TACA were this to be approved," he added.

Mr Baldock wrote that Evergreen, "the only significant carrier outside the  TAA/TACA", had, quite rationally and predictably, adopted a policy of shadowing the  TAA rates. He added: "There is no question but that the  TAA/TACA lines have effectively eliminated all  price competition on these routes."

Mr Baldock called on Mr van Miert to consider the necessary European regulations when addressing the shippers' primary concern, "namely, the need for price competition on the North Atlantic routes, which is sufficient to establish a market and a market price for container services.

"So far as shippers are concerned, our preferred outcome would be a return to the status quo ante the TAA. That is to say, a situation in which the  liner conferences on these routes are limited in terms of market share and face significant competition from independent carriers," he added.

HD   COMPETITION: COMMISSION BANS TRANS-ATLANTIC SHIPPING AGREEMENT WC  242 words

Summary: The  European Commission decided on October 19 to ban the  Trans -Atlantic Agreement  on
shipping between Europe and North America.
It says the  agreement breaches EU competition rules, and does not qualify for the block exemption for
liner agreements because it does not bring sufficient benefits to users.

TD
The agreement - between 15 leading  shipping companies operating between Northern Europe and the
United States - has been under study by the Commission since 1992. The shippers involved hold between
70 and 80% of the trans-North Atlantic  container market. In December 1993, the Commission said the
price-fixing and capacity utilisation arrangements breached EU rules on competition. In defence of the EU
Treaty, and in response to complaints from exporters, the Commission sought modifications to bring the
agreement into line with EU rules .

Particularly at issue were differential  tariffs  for members and non-members, artificial capacity freezes, and agreements on the land segment of door-to -door multi-modal services. The Commission says the parties to the agreement had as a result been able to raise  prices significantly in 1993 and 1994 - and that
European exporters had suffered. The  agreement was replaced in July this year by a modified  agreement (known as TACA), which the Commission is also examining under competition rules. But the Commission has not ruled out the possibility of fines for the period August 1992 to July 1994 when the original agreement operated.

HD         EC POSTPONES DECISION ON TACA LEGALITY. BY         By Sean Moloney,  Shipping Correspondent

THE European Commission's competition directorate (DG4) has postponed a decision on the legality of the revised Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) to give it more time to consult with shippers and shipowners.

A commission decision on the  agreement had been expected at the end last month, but Brussels' sources said it would not come until the end of this month or later, possibly mid-December.

TD
Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, hinted last month that the  agreement could be approved by the commission when he said that shipowner modifications to Taca "met to a considerable extent" commission requirements.

But he said that a final decision on the legality of the new accord could not be examined until his department had considered all the points.

A breakthrough on the legality of the  agreement came when Taca member lines proposed dropping their insistence on managing vessel capacity on the North Atlantic  liner trade.

They also agreed to abolish the minimum service contract requirement for cargo and to reduce the notice period for taking independent action on  tariffs.
However, the European Shippers' Council (ESC) said it had still not seen a copy of the Taca
agreement despite requesting a one through DG4.

A spokeswoman from the  TAA's attorneys in Brussels said shippers were free to secure a copy either from the commission or the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in Washington.
However, she refused to comment on allegations by the ESC that shipping lines had failed to follow
the terms of the commission decision into the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA) and inform shippers of
their right to renegotiate service contracts across the North Atlantic.
Meanwhile, the European Union advisory committee will meet on November 23 to discuss the ongoing
DSVK case against the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC).
This is one day after European Union transport ministers meet in Brussels to discuss commissioner van
Miert's recent report covering multimodal  tariff fixing.

Withdrawing threat to scuttle OECD accord is proving difficult, writes David Buchan.

The French government is trying to wriggle off the hook on which it impaled itself when it publicly threatened to torpedo the international  agreement to ban direct subsidies to shipbuilders from 1996.

TD
It will not be easy. Even before he formally opened his campaign for the presidency, Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, was fulminating at the accord, negotiated in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development last July.

Mr Chirac dubbed it the 'maritime Blair House', a reference to the preliminary  transatlantic farm deal two years ago that was so hated in France. His presidential rival, the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, must therefore make any climb-down as discreet as possible.

In fact, unlike French complaints about the agricultural Blair House, the Balladur government has no real quarrel with the way the  European Commission negotiated the OECD deal on behalf of the European Union twelve. It simply rues the fact that the previous Socialist government joined other EU governments in giving Brussels a negotiating mandate in the first place.

Instead of being able to use OECD consensus rules to stymie any ship subsidy ban at the outset, Paris now finds itself with a choice of submitting to the desire of all its 11 EU partners to ratify the accord, or blocking an international  agreement that already carries the signatures of the US, Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden.

The latter option puts Paris on a collision course with Bonn, which is keen to get the OECD deal ratified during its EU presidency, preferably by EU foreign ministers on November 28.

Paris is banking on Bonn's help in finding a formula to save face. It was US complaints against German subsidies that triggered the OECD negotiation, and Paris reckons it deserves to be reciprocated for agreeing to let Bonn give a special, temporary subsidy (equivalent to up to 36% of turnover) to the Rostock yards in eastern Germany.

The main effect of the OECD deal would be to ban, from January 1 1966, direct subsidies which, in the EU, are allowed to be up to 9% of a ship's cost. The Commission is now advising France to cease its fixation about the ban of this direct subsidy, and to make the most of permitted indirect aids. The OECD accord allows governments to pay up to 100% of a yard's research costs and 25 to 35% of its development costs, as well as some environmental and training aid.

But CSCN, the French shipbuilders' association, was yesterday unenthusiastic. 'Shipyards on average only spend 1% of turnover on research, and perhaps 2% if you define research 'creatively' like the Japanese,' said a CSCN official. 'Even if the government pays for all of this, it wouldn't compensate for the disappearance of direct subsidies.'

The OECD accord gives three other EU countries - Spain, Portugal and Belgium - longer to phase out direct subsidies, because they have agreed to new capacity reductions. But France refused any further formal restructuring, arguing in the words of Mr Fabrice Theobald, head of CSCN, that the industry 'has so little capacity left to lose'.

Over the past 18 years, employment in the sector has fallen from 25,000 to 4,800. Some 4,000 of these work at St. Nazaire for Chantiers de l'Atlantique (CAT), which is owned by GEC-Alsthom, the
Franco-British joint venture. It has a new plan to boost productivity by 30% over five years, but hopes to do this with minimal cuts in capacity or jobs.

Apart from CAT, French civil shipbuilding is composed of Constructions Mecaniques de Normandies at Cherbourg (which tried to save Swan Hunter in the UK from going under), Chantiers du Havre, and smaller operations at St Malo, Dieppe and Lorient. None of these locations - even St Nazaire, which has high unemployment - warrants regional aid, which other European yards are eligible for, certainly not on the scale of Rostock's.
Some of these companies get a few French naval contracts. But the vast bulk of that is reserved for the
French navy's own huge DCN yards at Brest, Lorient and Toulon, which employ about 30,000 people.

The OECD accord allows governments to subsidise 'home credit' to their own shipowners to the level they subsidise 'export credit' to foreign buyers of their ships. But, with the French merchant fleet now only ranking 36th in the world, France complains it hardly has any shipowners left to take advantage of these 'home credits'.

French shipping is unquestionably in poor shape; the average age of the 210 French-flagged vessels has doubled to 15 years over the past decade. Compagnie Generale Maritime is pulling out of Asian and North Atlantic routes in an effort to cut its losses so that one day the government can realise its plan to privatise the  shipping group. The private Bollore group has also scaled down its  shipping operations.

Of the 15 ships on order from French shipowners now, only four are to be from French yards. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand is the result, as Mr Theobald admits, of his industry's decision to sidestep cut-price competition from Japan, Korea and Poland in  containers and bulk carriers, and to specialise in passenger  liners, LNG gas carriers and ferries, where they only face Finland and Italy.

In one sense, this has paid off. CAT has in terms of orders 20% of the world LNG market and, with the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line recently ordering a new 2,000 passenger cruiseship and placing an option on another, the St Nazaire yard has a similar share of world orders for passenger  liners.

But the upshot of such specialisation is that French yards depend on exports for more than 90% of their business, and have left themselves little home market to fall back on.

BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuter) - European Union transport ministers will call on Monday for a temporary exemption from EU competition rules for certain  price-fixing arrangements used by container              shipping conferences, an EU official said on Friday.

In a draft statement drawn up by the EU's German presidency, ministers are expected to demand a transitional period during which multi-modal  price fixing  by conferences, agreements setting costs for sea and land sections of  container journeys, be exempted.

TD
Authority to grant exemptions to EU competition rules lies with the  European Commission.
The Commission is currently considering the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) between
15 shipowners on trans-Atlantic container transport, having already outlawed on October 19 an
earlier version of the agreement which it said had pushed up  prices for container users.

A decision on the revised TACA is not expected before the end of the year, a Commission official has said.
