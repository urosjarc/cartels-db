HD         Philip Morris offers $1bn to settle with EU.

Philip Morris International is offering to pay about $1bn to the European Union in a landmark deal to avoid lawsuits over allegations it colluded in the smuggling of cigarettes into the EU.

The US tobacco group said it hoped an agreement was "close", and that the money would be used to fund a new crackdown on tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting in Europe.

TD
The European Commission confirmed the offer, and hinted that a deal with Philip Morris could pave the way to similar agreements with other tobacco companies.

"We are willing to have discussions with all companies that show they are serious about their fight against this illegal trade," said a spokeswoman for Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner.

The settlement would end the EU's threat of legal action against Philip Morris, which would have forced the company to address allegations that it colluded with smugglers to get its products into European market.

The tobacco industry has always denied any involvement in smuggling, insisting it dealt with legitimate traders.

It was estimated in 2000 that the EU lost an average of E1m ($1.2m) in duties per illegal truckload of cigarettes, putting the scale of fraud at E1bn-E2bn a year.

Philip Morris said on Sunday it had tabled a draft settlement "in the ballpark" of $1bn, which would be paid over 12 years.

The offer is under consideration by the  European Commission and by the 10 EU member states, including France, Germany and Italy, which brought the legal action.
The deal, which exceeds the E497m  antitrust fine recently imposed by the  European Commission on
Microsoft, would "resolve all disputes" between the parties.

The company said the agreement, which still had to be endorsed by governments and its own board, would be used to form an alliance between the tobacco industry and customs agencies to tackle smuggling and counterfeiting, which has particularly affected Marlboro sales.

The tobacco industry is concerned about the possible increase in smuggling after the EU's borders expand on May 1, to take in a frontier with Ukraine, Belarus and other former Soviet states.

"Europe is a very significant part of our business and with a number of member states joining in May it's going to focus our attention even more," Philip Morris said.

LP
There are different approaches to solving big-player disputes, but who wins in the end?

EVEN as Microsoft Corp smarts from a bloodied nose delivered by an uncompromising  European       Commission, Messrs Bill Gates et al must surely be enjoying the irony playing out at home.

TD
The Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, last month found  Microsoft guilty of violating EC  antitrust laws, with EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti charging that 'the illegal behaviour is still going on'. Spurning offers of significant concessions from the software giant, the EC hit the US software giant with a record  fine of almost 500 million euros (S$1.02 billion).

More significantly in terms of precedent, it also required  Microsoft to unbundle its audiovisual software, Windows Media Player, from the Windows operating system. And adding insult to injury, it also ordered Microsoft to provide proprietary information about its software to rival makers of computer servers.

Not surprisingly,  Microsoft says it will appeal the judgement. Nonetheless it's clearly been embarrassed by exposure to the Full Monti.

This EC investigation was triggered by a complaint from another US company - Silicon Valley-based Sun Microsystems, one of  Microsoft's most implacable critics and rivals. Indeed, Sun was also a prominent witness for the prosecution in the highly publicised  antitrust action by the US Department of Justice against - who else -  Microsoft.

Now comes the interesting part. Back in the US, the most notable voice questioning the severity of the EC punishment came from no less than the DoJ. Then, in an even more stunning development last week, Sun and  Microsoft buried the hatchet. Sun chairman Scott McNealy and  Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer shook hands, swapped jokes and exchanged jerseys of their mutual-favourite Detroit ice-hockey team. Under the agreement, Sun's bank balance will be enriched to the tune of almost US$2 billion in settlement of all  antitrust and patent litigation, most notably those involving Sun's Java software.

So what's going on, really? Certainly this signals a thawing of an often icy relationship; but it's far from an ideological victory of any kind. If anything, it's a victory of pragmatism on the part of two camps in a notoriously splintered industry, giving both sides some respite as they face other competitors and - let's not forget - each other.

Thus, Sun, despite having excellent technology, has been losing revenue every quarter for the past three years.  Microsoft, which practically owns the desktop environment, finds its efforts to expand into the large-computer environment stymied by established players like Sun and IBM. Meanwhile, companies complain that their IT people are wasting time, resources and money trying to make the rival platforms work with each other. With this truce, much of that aggro will be eased.  Microsoft's Windows and Sun's Solaris and Java will be able to cohabit much more smoothly, and we may at last see real progress in Web services. For IT departments and users, this is undoubtedly good news.

Another possible consequence of the  Microsoft-Sun agreement, however, is potentially more alarming to users, in particular those who see the Linux operating system as both a solution and a bargaining chip in their quest for reasonably priced software. The fact is that Linux is a competitor to Windows and
Sun's Solaris. And getting off each other's backs will allow them to train their individual sights - and who knows, maybe even their collective guns - on this populist upstart.

Page 7 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Balancing this latter scenario is the fact that Linux does have a heavyweight champion in IBM. While this may guarantee that any incipient  Microsoft-Sun axis doesn't have everything its own way, that's little comfort to the Red Hats and SUSEs that embody the spirit of the Open Source culture.

So who wins in this kind of complex poker game? As with any game of high stakes, the players with the deepest pockets have the advantage; and  Microsoft, IBM and even Sun are in that category. Hence the need for regulators to keep the game flowing and fair; even if, as the contrasting positions of the US DoJ and EC show, what's fair is not always clear.

Sun Microsystems' $2 billion  antitrust lawsuit settlement with  Microsoft Corp. on Friday has removed a major reason for the world's largest software maker to continue hoarding its $53 billion cash pile, analysts said.

The settlement, along with last week's decision by the  European Commission to fine Microsoft 497 million euros ($603 million) and change the way it ships software, "clears the decks to deal with its cash position," said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Charles Di Bona.

TD
Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft has long said it would retain cash while the threat of major litigation remained, but investors are clamouring for it to return money to them.

At the end of 2003,  Microsoft had $52.8 billion in cash, which grew nearly $2.4 billion per quarter that year.

In February, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors promised the company would offer clearer direction on Microsoft's cash plans by its annual analysts meeting at the end of July.
"At this point, they better come through with something meaningful," Di Bona said.

Last year, Microsoft paid its first dividend since going public in 1986 in response to pressure from shareholders. It later doubled the annual payout to 16 cents a share.

"Investors are going to be more eager for  Microsoft to make a move toward a stepped-up dividend," said Alan Davis, analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.

Friday's settlement calls for  Microsoft to pay Sun $700 million to resolve  antitrust issues, $900 million to resolve patent issues and $350 million in royalty fees. Combined, it represents about 3 percent of Microsoft's cash on hand.
Asked about  Microsoft's cash position after announcing the settlement,  Microsoft chief executive
Steve Ballmer said the company is still "not clear of litigation."

"Obviously, this is another step forward and our board will be able to take a look at things in that light," Ballmer told reporters.

Since settling the U.S. government's landmark  antitrust case against it in late 2002,  Microsoft has steadily resolved its lawsuits by paying large settlements to its legal adversaries.
So far,  Microsoft has settled class actions in nine states and the District of Columbia for more than
$1.5 billion. It paid $750 million to America Online in a Web browser dispute.

Other, pending issues, include its expected appeal over the European Commission ruling. Current patent-related litigation has more than $500 million at stake. Microsoft also faces a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit by RealNetworks Inc., its rival for digital media player software. ($1=0.824 euros) (Additional reporting by Duncan Martell in San Francisco)

Sun Microsystems' $2 billion  antitrust lawsuit settlement with  Microsoft Corp. on Friday has removed a major reason for the world's largest software maker to continue hoarding its $53 billion cash pile, analysts said.

The settlement, along with last week's decision by the  European Commission to fine Microsoft 497 million euros ($603 million) and change the way it ships software, "clears the decks to deal with its cash position," said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Charles Di Bona.

TD
Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft has long said it would retain cash while the threat of major litigation remained, but investors are clamouring for it to return money to them.

At the end of 2003,  Microsoft had $52.8 billion in cash, which grew nearly $2.4 billion per quarter that year.

In February, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors promised the company would offer clearer direction on Microsoft's cash plans by its annual analysts meeting at the end of July.

HD        Industry mulls Philip Morris deal with Brussels.

Philip Morris International's offer to pay the European Union $1bn (Euro32m, GBP550m) to head off lawsuits over alleged collusion with smugglers looked set on Monday to pave the way for similar deals in the industry.

Philip Morris said its payment would help fight cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, and Japan Tobacco, maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, said it wanted to co-operate with authorities in the same way.

TD
Japan Tobacco, the world's third largest tobacco company, confirmed it had talked to the  European       Commission over co-operation to fight the illicit trade.

Guy Cote, a Japan Tobacco spokesman, said that until now Brussels-based regulators had rejected his company's offers to settle all eventual legal disputes and pay money to fight smuggling.

He said he hoped the latest development would enable serious negotiations to be reopened. "Perhaps they wanted to deal with the biggest player first," Mr Cote told Dow Jones.

The European Commission launched legal action against Philip Morris, Japan Tobacco and RJ Reynolds in 2000, claiming that the companies colluded with smugglers to bring their products into the EU, so avoiding excise duties. That case was rejected by the US courts, but Brussels is now pursuing a related claim against RJ Reynolds for alleged money-laundering.

Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner, said she hoped the Commission and 10 EU member states would be able to agree a deal with Philip Morris "very soon" to end the legal dispute.

She refused to say whether the litigation against Japan Tobacco had been suspended because talks with the company were continuing.

"We are willing to have discussions with all companies that show they are serious about their fight against this illegal trade," she said.

The $1bn payment would be the largest amount ever extracted by the EU from a private company, and exceeds the Euro97m  antitrust fine levied last month against  Microsoft.

However, the Commission said the money, to be paid over 12 years, was not guaranteed to be spent on fighting the illegal trade in tobacco, saying only that the funds "could be made available" for that
purpose.
Japan Tobacco last year warned that rising excise rates in the 10 countries due to join the European
Union next year could lead to a flood of contraband.

It argued that long borders between some of the new EU member states and countries such as Ukraine could allow extensive smuggling.

Philip Morris International's $1bn payment is designed to arrest the flow of bogus cigarettes from markets like Russia and the Ukraine into the new EU.

But what is less clear, says Michael Smith of JP Morgan, is whether governments will be able to tackle intra-EU movements from countries such Poland to Germany and France effectively after they join the EU on May 1.

HD         Philip Morris offers Dollars 1bn to settle with EU - TOBACCO. BY          By GEORGE PARKER and JENNY WIGGINS

Philip Morris International is offering to pay about Dollars 1bn to the European Union in a landmark deal to avoid lawsuits over allegations it colluded in the smuggling of cigarettes into the EU.

The US tobacco group said it hoped an agreement was "close", and that the money would be used to fund a new crackdown on tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting in Europe.

TD
The European Commission confirmed the offer, and hinted that a deal with Philip Morris could pave the way to similar agreements with other tobacco companies.

"We are willing to have discussions with all companies that show they are serious about their fight against this illegal trade," said a spokeswoman for Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner.

The settlement would end the EU's threat of legal action against Philip Morris, which would have forced the company to address allegations that it colluded with smugglers to get its products into European market.

The tobacco industry has always denied any involvement in smuggling, insisting it dealt with legitimate traders.

It was estimated in 2000 that the EU lost an average of Euros 1m (Dollars 1.2m) in duties per illegal truckload of cigarettes, putting the scale of fraud at Euros 1bn-Euros 2bn a year.

Philip Morris said yesterday it had tabled a draft settlement "in the ballpark" of Dollars 1bn, which would be paid over 12 years.

The offer is under consideration by the  European Commission and by the 10 EU member states, including France, Germany and Italy, which brought the legal action.

The deal, which exceeds the Euros 497m  antitrust fine recently imposed by the  European                  Commission on Microsoft, would "resolve all disputes" between the parties.

The company said the agreement, which still had to be endorsed by governments and its own board, would be used to form an alliance between the tobacco industry and customs agencies to tackle smuggling and counterfeiting, which has particularly affected Marlboro sales.

The tobacco industry is concerned about the possible increase in smuggling after the EU's borders expand on May 1, to take in a frontier with Ukraine, Belarus and other former Soviet states.

"Europe is a very significant part of our business and with a number of member states joining in May it's going to focus our attention even more," Philip Morris said.

HD      Client Week - Will Microsoft offer Windows  lite? WC      604 words
PD       5 April 2004
SN      VNUnet SC   ITWEEK PG      24

LP
Many buyers would prefer a basic, low-cost version of the Windows client that removes unnecessary add-ons. So will the EC  antitrust ruling make it happen, asks Daniel Robinson.

The recent news that  Microsoft is to be fined for anti-competitive behaviour by the European Commission has produced the expected knee-jerk reactions from the usual pro-and anti-Microsoft lobbies in the industry.

TD
Some observers in the US have been quick to depict the move as proof of anti-American bias or even that Europeans are culturally opposed to competitive companies that make large profits. Meanwhile, the Microsoft-bashing camp has wasted no time saying that the remedy doesn't go far enough in curtailing the software giant's monopolistic behaviour.

In truth, however, it is difficult to see precisely what good is expected to come from the ruling. Those with a grudge against  Microsoft might derive some Schadenfreude from the  fine, but who exactly will benefit from Microsoft being forced to produce a version of Windows that doesn't include the Windows Media Player (WMP)? It could be argued (and you can bet  Microsoft will take this line in its appeal) that consumers actually benefit from having WMP pre-loaded as standard with Windows. If this is true, then we should expect to see the "full" version of Windows outselling that of the "sawn off" version, even if the latter costs less - assuming it ever sees the light of day, of course.

But where a cheaper, WMP-free version of Windows might find a receptive market is among business users. Even if the EC ruling shaves just a few pounds off the cost of a Windows XP licence, this equates to a worthwhile saving when you are looking at deploying software to thousands of desktops.

Let's be honest, there are many companies that would be better off without Windows Media Player. This application must be one of the biggest temptations for office time wasting in the history of employment. Whoever at  Microsoft was responsible for including it in an operating system destined for the corporate desktop, well, they deserve shooting.

However, there is plenty of other rubbish that comes with Windows and which need not be there. For most business desktops, all that is really required is a browser, email client, and the ability to connect to corporate servers. Perhaps  Microsoft could take the EC ruling as a wake-up call, and turn its "sawn off" version of Windows into a cut-down client that just offers the bare essentials, runs reliably, and has none of the extra bloat that we recognise today as Windows XP.

This isn't very likely to happen, of course.  Microsoft executives have already gone on record with words to the effect that you can't turn back the clock to the days of a simpler Windows client. The next major release - Longhorn - thus appears set to be the biggest, most resource-hungry version of Windows yet.
I believe that  Microsoft should think again. One of the reasons behind the growing corporate interest in
Linux is that it makes it possible for IT managers to pick and choose which features get deployed to
end-users.
By comparison, Windows is full of unwanted features that cannot easily be removed or turned off.

In these days when corporate applications increasingly reside on a server, there is little need for a heavyweight client-side operating system.  Microsoft would be wise to take this opportunity to give IT managers what they really want - an easier life.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. occurred on March 25. An article yesterday incorrectly said the ruling took place last week.
(WSJ April 6, 2004) (END)

LP
BRUSSELS --  Microsoft Corp.'s deal with rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in the U.S. could undermine Microsoft's challenge of part of last week's landmark  antitrust ruling against the company in Europe, lawyers and competitors said.

The deal wouldn't derail the European ruling, which ordered  Microsoft both to offer a stripped-down version of its multimedia software and to broadly share information with its competitors in the server business. The multimedia aspect wouldn't be affected, but in Friday's deal  Microsoft agreed to share server information with Sun.

TD
Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said the Sun deal wouldn't hurt the company's effort to suspend the ruling while it appeals. "We carefully crafted the agreement with Sun so as to assure continued protection for all of our intellectual-property rights," he said. "That's very different from the  European     Commission's decision, which doesn't protect intellectual-property rights."

But to try to freeze the server ruling,  Microsoft would have to convince a European court that the company would be irreparably harmed by sharing information.  Microsoft's deal with Sun, which does just that, makes it a harder case to argue. Commission officials contend they did protect  Microsoft's rights in their order.

"If  Microsoft has found a way to share the information with its archenemy, doesn't that prove that the [commission] decision isn't going to cause irreparable harm?" asked Stephen Kinsella, an  antitrust partner at law firm Herbert Smith in Brussels. One person close to  Microsoft rival Novell Inc. also predicted the U.S. deal would make it harder for  Microsoft to challenge the commission's order. Sun was the company that originally brought the complaint about  Microsoft's lack of compatibility to the commission, and Novell also testified against  Microsoft.

For years, Microsoft told European  antitrust regulators investigating its business practices that forcing it to hand over information to competitors would amount to an excessive disclosure of intellectual property. The commission nevertheless handed down its order last week, along with a record 497
million euros ($614 million)  fine for Microsoft's past practices.

The fine also applies to Microsoft's use of its Windows program to gain an edge in multimedia players against rivals such as RealNetworks Inc. That part of the case wouldn't be affected by the U.S. deal. The commission gave the company 90 days to offer personal-computer manufacturers the option of installing a version of Windows with another media player in place of  Microsoft's product.

Page 23 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the server part of the case,  Microsoft could try to use the Sun deal as a template to meet the commission's order that the company work out information-sharing agreements with rivals and submit them to an arbiter within 120 days. Sun said its deal with  Microsoft resolved its issues before the EU. One traditional  Microsoft supporter said the deal could be used that way to help resolve the similar demands of Novell and other companies, including backers of the open-source Linux operating system. The deal "should pave the way to a reasonable settlement," said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group that testified on Microsoft's behalf in the EU case.

But Philip Lowe, the commission's director general of competition, said Friday that the commission's order on servers wouldn't be affected by a deal with just one Microsoft competitor, even a central one such as Sun. The commission's March 24 decision "isn't related to the interest of any one competitor in any one area," Mr. Lowe said. "It is a decision aimed at remedying a  competition problem that is harmful to  competition and harmful to consumers."

Microsoft still insists it provides rivals enough information to ensure compatibility with Windows computers without the extra details demanded by European  antitrust regulators.

Several observers said the Sun-Microsoft settlement vindicates the commission's long-running case. Microsoft restarted its stalled talks with Sun on March 19, the day after its negotiations over settling the European case broke down. "The commission could perhaps claim credit for making  Microsoft ready to settle" with Sun, said Mr. Kinsella, the  antitrust lawyer.

Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman and chief executive, said the settlement would give it a competitive advantage. "Without the collaboration . . . the guarantees you can give a customer are much more tenuous," he said at a news conference in San Francisco.

Open-source-software advocates said it was unclear how the settlement between Sun and  Microsoft would affect the Linux operating system and other software initiatives that no one company controls. "It remains to be seen how they reconcile their Linux plans with this," said Jeremy Allison, co-creator of Samba, a software program that provides file and print services to network computers. In addition to computers running Sun's own software, Sun sells desktop PCs that run Linux and need to be able to integrate seamlessly in a network that includes Windows-based servers.

HD     EU close to US$1 billion deal with U.S. tobacco  giant to resolve cigarette  smuggling charges

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and the maker of Marlboro cigarettes said Monday they were close to a US$1 billion deal to end years of legal wrangling by cracking down together on smuggling and counterfeits that are costing both sides enormous sums.
Under the draft agreement, Philip Morris International would make payments over 12 years totaling about
US$1 billion -- the biggest sum the EU has ever extracted from a single company.

TD
In return, "all disputes" would be resolved between the company, part of the U.S. tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc., and the  European Commission, which has filed two lawsuits in recent years against Philip Morris and was contemplating a third.

The latest, filed in New York in 2001, accused U.S. tobacco giants of complicity in cigarette smuggling by intentionally oversupplying neighboring countries. Such smuggling is estimated to cost European governments US$1 billion annually in lost taxes.
The lawsuit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds but a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in
January to file a new one based on money laundering laws.

Even if the lawsuit weren't refiled, analysts said the deal likely would be a good one for Philip Morris if it stems the tide of fake Marlboros into the high-margin European market, which the company says costs it US$100 million each year.

"This is not a company that's shy of litigation, to say the least," said David Adelman, tobacco industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. "I think this is a situation where by providing funds and resolving conflict, you're in a position to much better address and attack a real business issue."

The money could help cash-strapped governments -- particularly in the poor eastern countries joining the EU next month -- hire and train more customs officers, pay for better equipment and technology "and create a better working relationship," Adelman said.

EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer said the 10 EU governments that joined the Commission's legal action are now reviewing the draft.

"We are waiting on the approval of the member states," Schreyer said. "We hope that we can sign the agreement very soon."

The potential deal would result in "substantial payments over a number of years," she said, declining to elaborate. A company spokeswoman confirmed reports of about US$1 billion over 12 years.

"That is reflective of the terms of the draft agreement," said Nerida White, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The amount would exceed the record euro497 million (US$611 million) the EU recently  fined Microsoft
Corp. in an antitrust case.

But both sides stressed the prospective payments were not penalties but a commitment to work together.
"What it really represents is moving from conflict to very firm and strong cooperation," White said. Philip Morris International -- which markets Philip Morris brands outside the United States -- said it is
concerned about cheap imitations made in China, South America and eastern Europe, particularly its
most popular, Marlboro.

The May 1 addition of eight eastern European countries into the EU adds another dimension to the problem, given that their cigarette taxes are generally much lower than in western Europe.
Smugglers could get truckloads of authentic Marlboros in an eastern EU member like Latvia, where
excise taxes are only 10 percent, and make money by selling them illegally in Britain, where the taxes run
to 211 percent and where cigarettes cost about US $8.60 a pack.

In a statement, the EU said the draft covers "broad areas of cooperation with European law enforcement agencies" to ensure the company's brands, which also include L&M and Chesterfield, are sold legally.

Also in the draft are "customer oversight policies" to deter sales to minors and "tracking and tracing" provisions from the factory to stores, the EU said.
Philip Morris also said it would pay for the installation of equipment in customs offices to detect fakes. Schreyer declined to say whether negotiations were underway with other companies.
In 2002, the EU filed a new lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against R.J. Reynolds, accusing the maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes of working with organized crime and terror organizations and laundering the profits through New York banks.

Japan Tobacco Inc., which acquired R.J. Reynolds international tobacco operations in 1999, said it also hoped to open settlement talks after its previous overtures had been rejected.

"We welcome this news," said Guy Cote, a Japan Tobacco spokesman in Lausanne. "Perhaps they wanted to deal with the biggest player first."

A British American Tobacco PLC spokesman in London said it too was ready to work with "governments to counter smuggling."

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and Philip Morris said Monday they were close to a $1 billion deal to end years of legal wrangling by cracking down together on cigarette smuggling and counterfeits that are costing both sides enormous sums.
Under the draft agreement, Philip Morris International would make payments over 12 years totaling about
$1 billion -- the biggest sum the EU has ever extracted from a single company.

TD
In return, "all disputes" would be resolved between the company, part of the U.S. tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc., and the  European Commission, which has filed two lawsuits in recent years against Philip Morris and was contemplating a third.

The latest, filed in New York in 2001, accused U.S. tobacco giants of complicity in cigarette smuggling by intentionally oversupplying neighboring countries. Such smuggling is estimated to cost European governments $1 billion annually in lost taxes.
The lawsuit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds but a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in
January to file a new one based on money laundering laws.

Even if the lawsuit weren't refiled, analysts said the deal likely would be a good one for Philip Morris if it stems the tide of fake Marlboros into the high-margin European market, which the company says costs it
$100 million each year.

"This is not a company that's shy of litigation, to say the least," said David Adelman, tobacco industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. "I think this is a situation where by providing funds and resolving conflict, you're in a position to much better address and attack a real business issue."

The money could help cash-strapped governments -- particularly in the poor eastern countries joining the EU next month -- hire and train more customs officers, pay for better equipment and technology "and create a better working relationship," Adelman said.

EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer said the 10 EU governments that joined the Commission's legal action are now reviewing the draft.

"We are waiting on the approval of the member states," Schreyer said. "We hope that we can sign the agreement very soon."

The potential deal would result in "substantial payments over a number of years," she said, declining to elaborate. A company spokeswoman confirmed reports of about $1 billion over 12 years.

"That is reflective of the terms of the draft agreement," said Nerida White, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The amount would exceed the record 497 million euros ($611 million) the EU recently  fined Microsoft
Corp. in an antitrust case.

But both sides stressed the prospective payments were not penalties but a commitment to work together.

concerned about cheap imitations made in China, South America and eastern Europe, particularly its
most popular, Marlboro.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The makers of Marlboro cigarettes would pay about $1 billion to the European Union over a dozen years to fight smuggling and counterfeiting under a proposed deal that would end years of legal wrangling, officials said Monday.

Philip Morris International, part of the U.S. tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc., and the EU's executive European Commission said the draft agreement would "resolve all disputes" between them.

TD
In 2001, the EU filed a lawsuit in New York accusing Philip Morris and other tobacco giants of complicity in smuggling by intentionally oversupplying neighboring countries. Such smuggling is estimated to cost European governments $1 billion in lost taxes annually.

The lawsuit was dismissed in 2002 but a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in January to file a new lawsuit based on money laundering laws.

EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer said talks have been underway for "several months" and the 10 EU governments that joined the Commission's legal action are now reviewing the draft.

"We are waiting on the approval of the member states," Schreyer said. "We hope that we can sign the agreement very soon."

The potential deal would result in "substantial payments over a number of years," she said, declining to elaborate. A company spokeswoman confirmed reports of about $1 billion over 12 years.

"That is reflective of the terms of the draft agreement," said Nerida White, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Shares of Philip Morris fell 12 cents to $54.75 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

It would be the largest amount of money the EU has ever extracted from a private company, exceeding the 497 million euros ($611 million) the EU recently  fined Microsoft Corp. in an antitrust case.

But both sides stressed the prospective payments were not penalties but a commitment to work together on issues important to both.
"What it really represents is moving from conflict to very firm and strong cooperation," White said.

Philip Morris International -- which markets Philip Morris brands outside the United States -- is especially concerned about cheap imitations made in China, South America and eastern Europe, particularly its most popular, Marlboro.
An estimated 1 million packs of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the EU daily, White said, costing Philip
Morris alone an estimated $100 million in lost sales annually.

Many of the fakes enter the EU from poor, eastern countries like Poland that are set to join the EU on
May 1, adding urgency to the need for additional efforts.

Excise taxes run to 211 percent in Britain but only 10 percent in Latvia, one of the 10 EU newcomers, creating an incentive for smugglers to buy in the East and sell tax free in the West.
Philip Morris also said it would pay for the installation of equipment in customs offices to detect fakes. Schreyer declined to say whether negotiations were underway with other companies.

HD     EU says its case against Microsoft not affected by makeup with Sun

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Last week's stunning US$1.6 billion settlement with Sun Microsystems Inc. was unlikely to impact the  antitrust actions against  Microsoft Corp. in Europe, officials and legal experts said Monday.

The European Commission said it stood behind its recent ruling against  Microsoft, which was initially trigged by a complaint from Sun in 1998.

TD
"It does not call into question the decision of the 24th of March, if only because the Commission decision
is not limited to the interests of any one company in any one area," said EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres.
"It is broader than the interests of one company. We took the decision because we thought it was in the
interest of European consumers."

Torres refused to say whether Sun had been in contact with EU regulators over the deal or whether it has retracted support for a similar, pending probe into Windows XP, the most recent version of  Microsoft's ubiquitous operating system.

In a news release Friday, Sun said it was "satisfied" the agreement with  Microsoft also would "satisfy the objectives it was pursuing in the EU actions pending against  Microsoft."

A Brussels-based lawyer for Sun referred questions Monday to Lee Patch, Sun's vice president of legal affairs in Santa Clara, California. Patch was not immediately available for comment.
Ed Black, president of an anti-Microsoft group -- including Sun -- that brought the XP complaint, said
Sun's settlement would have no impact.

"That case was developed with involvement and support of very wide range of companies through many sectors of industry," said Black, who heads the Washington-based Computer and Communications Industry Association.

"The settlement does not appear to reflect any fundamental change in  Microsoft's business strategy at all," he added. "They just made Sun into more of a cooperator than a competitor."
He said Sun is not withdrawing from his organization.

Although legal experts who have followed the EU case agreed the overall impact of the Sun settlement probably would be minimal, Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels, said it could affect  Microsoft's promised appeal.

"The fact that  Microsoft is willing to settle after the decision -- doesn't that tend to prove that the decision was necessary?" Kinsella said. "The Commission probably has every justification for feeling justified."

But he added that  Microsoft could also use the settlement to argue to the court that it was working in a positive way to solve the problems.

PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: It`s a busy day for bond traders. Prices fall
and yields rise, closing in on a key benchmark level, on fears the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates
as soon as this summer. We`ll have the details.

SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: The nation`s discount airlines are flying high these days. Landing at the top, a new survey of quality in the airline industry. But experts say, don`t count out the big boys just yet.

TD
KANGAS: A healthier profit outlook for CIGNA (CI) spurs a healthy gain in its stock price. The company says it isn`t paying out as many medical claims as it expected to, and that may be a good sign for cost trends in the industry as a whole.

GHARIB: Then, this is Johannesburg, South Africa, 10 years after Apartheid. It`s a bustling, active city in a nation that has made great economic strides. But there are still great challenges ahead. Tonight, a look at "South Africa: Ten years After."
KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.
GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, April 5. Good evening, everyone.
Stocks surged on Wall Street today, but it was another bad day for bonds. The Dow rose 87 points and the
NASDAQ almost 22. But Treasury prices continued their slide on a stronger-than-expected economic
report from the Institute for Supply Management, and in a follow-through to Friday`s surprisingly strong jobs
data. That pushed the yield on the benchmark 10- year note to 4.22 percent, a three-month high.
And as Erika Miller reports, some bond experts see even higher rates ahead.

ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For much of the past three years, interest rates have been hovering at historic lows, but that may be about to change. Traders say today they`ve drastically altered their outlook for rates as a result of Friday`s surprisingly strong employment report. Until then, one of Wall Street`s biggest concerns was that weak job growth was threatening the economic recovery. Now the sudden revival in hiring has heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will start raising rates sooner than expected.

GEMMA WRIGHT, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, BARCLAY`S CAPITAL: The market began to assess that perhaps there was not so much slack in the economy, particularly in the labor market, and that would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner.

MILLER: But Wall Street economists are almost evenly split on whether that hike will come this summer or some time in 2005. The Fed will not have another monthly employment report before it`s next policy meeting May 4. But some bond experts predict the central bank could provide a hint about the timing of the next rate hike at that meeting.

MICHAEL RYAN, INCOME STRATEGIST, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: They are going to continue to offer a more upbeat assessment of the economic prospects, and I think what you are going to see is more encouraging phrasing in terms of the job outlook. What I don`t think they`re prepared to do just yet is to

Page 35 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
shift either to a tightening bias or a suggestion that the economy is beginning to accelerate too quickly and that the Fed is poised to start raising rates.

MILLER: What`s clear is that the bond market will be scrutinizing comments from Fed officials between now and the May meeting to see if their thinking has changed. St. Louis Fed President William Poole will speak on inflation tomorrow, while Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson talks about the economy Thursday. Another investor concern this week is a new supply of Treasury securities. The government will auction off
$25 billion worth of 5-year notes and 10-year inflation-indexed securities to raise new cash. Experts say it all adds up to the likelihood of higher interest rates.

WRIGHT: We generally have a slow upward trending trajectory in our projections for interest rates for the balance of the year. We have 175 basis points tightening priced in from the beginning of August to the end of the second quarter of next year. So yields will move higher.
MILLER: An early indication of the Fed`s thinking could come April 21. That`s when Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is scheduled to testify before Congress.
Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.
GHARIB: The power industry wasn`t playing by the rules. That`s the word tonight from a U.S. and
Canadian task force investigating last summer`s big power blackout. The August 14 blackout plunged all or
part of eight states and Canada into darkness. The task force`s final report today blamed much of the
problem on Ohio-based FirstEnergy (FE), which didn`t recognize or respond to problems on three of its
lines. But the report also says another major outage could happen unless there are new guidelines on
reliability.
And everyone knows what the penalties are for violating them.

ROGER GALE, CEO, GF ENERGY: We have to have teeth. We`ve got to have ways that people have to deliver and they get penalized if they don`t run their systems right. Two, we have to pull the industry together into a smaller group of companies that have the ability to manage larger swaths of generation.

GHARIB: Gale also says Congress needs to pass new energy legislation in the works now for more than five years. He says any new law should include ways to help energy companies build new transmission lines.

KANGAS: There was sufficient buying power on Wall Street to extend Friday`s big gains today as investor confidence was buoyed by the strong March employment report, which suggested the economy was strong enough to give a solid boost to corporate profits. Underscoring this was the Institute of Supply Management`s March service sector index, which rose to 65.8 when a reading of only 61.0 was expected. Persistent buying as the day unfolded enabled the stock market to close near its very best level of the day. The Dow Industrial Average ending with a gain of 87.78 points at 10,558.37. The NASDAQ Composite rose nearly 22 points, or 1.1 percent, ending at 2079.12. The Standard & Poor`s 500 Index was up 8 3/4 points
at 1150.57. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note tumbled 18/32 to 98 9/32, bringing the yield all the way up to 4.22 percent.

GHARIB: It looks like tobacco company Philip Morris will pay $1 billion to settle a dispute over cigarette smuggling in Europe. Morris` parent company, Altria (MO), and the  European Commission say a draft agreement is in the works where the firm will pay out the money over 12 years as part of an agreement to fight fraud. The European Union would also drop the threat of a lawsuit against Altria, accusing it of
colluding in cigarette smuggling to avoid paying customs fees and taxes. If the deal is approved, it would be the largest amount of money that the E.U. has ever gotten from a private company, even more than the
$611 million it fined Microsoft (MSFT) last month.

KANGAS: More fallout from the mistrial in the corruption case against two former top executives of Tyco (TYC). Nine news organizations, including the Associated Press and "New York Times," are asking the court for transcripts of arguments that persuaded the judge to call off the trial. The mistrial in the case against Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz was made due to what the judge called outside pressure on a juror. But the media outlets say they couldn`t fully report on the decision since discussions were behind closed doors. They say since the trial is over, those transcripts should be publicly released.

GHARIB: America`s skies are getting friendlier. A new survey today says the quality of airline travel by U.S. carriers improved for the third year in a row. And the top three best performers were discount airlines.
Stephanie Woods takes a closer look at the new study.

STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: JetBlue (JBLU) flew to number one for quality as measured by on-time performance, baggage handling and customer complaints.

Southwest (LUV) landed second, Alaska (ALK) third in the study. Researchers poured over data the airlines reported to the Department of Transportation for 2003. The outlook researchers expect is for low-cost carriers to continue outperforming traditional airlines.

BRENT BOWEN, UNIV. OF NEBRASKA AVIATION INSTITUTE: I think in the future we`re going to see more of our mainline carriers be so unable to reinvent themselves, to reinvent their organizations, that we`re going to have more financial turmoil in the near future.

WOODS: Mainline carriers are fighting back. United and Delta (DAL) started new low-fare airlines Ted and Song, and not all big carriers faired poorly. US Airways (UAIR) ranked fifth and Northwest Airlines (NWAC) showed the most improvement over last year. Experts say mainline carriers which operate traditional network hub and spoke systems will continue to play an important role in domestic air travel.

JOHN WELLS, BUREAU OF TRANSPORTATION STATISTICS: Even if you live in a large city, you will often need to go on a network carrier, because only a network carrier goes to the places you want to go. If you live in a smaller city, which may not have any low-cost carrier service, then you`re essentially forced to use a network carrier.

WOODS: Still, low fares and quality service have fueled the growth of discount airlines. Their market share has soared to more than 25 percent over the last decade. But some analysts say those airlines may face new headwinds.

PHILIP BAGGALEY, TRANSPORTATION ANALYST, STANDARD & POOR`S: As the low-cost carriers grow and in some cases themselves become more complex, offering greater service, using more models of aircraft, they run some of the same dangers that the large carriers have faced so far, that it will be harder to deliver this type of service.

WOODS: Overall, airline quality improved last year with customer complaints cut in half from 2002. But it`s unclear if that`s from improved service or lowered expectation. As the economy improves, experts predict airline passengers will find longer lines at the airport, crowded planes, and modestly higher ticket prices.

GHARIB: J.C. Penney (JCP) says it`s found the right prescription for the future: selling its Eckerd drugstore chain. The price tag on the deal is just over $4.5 billion, and the buyers are two of Eckerd`s competitors: Canadian drugstore chain Jean Coutu and U.S. chain CVS (CVS). The two will split up the stores mostly on geographic lines, with CVS also buying Eckerd`s mail order pharmacy business. Analysts say the deal rids Penney of a major headache, since Eckerd is under pricing pressure from its  competition and is having trouble managing inventories. The transaction pumps a huge amount of cash into Penney`s coffers, about
$3.5 billion worth, and it makes CVS America`s largest drugstore chain. Paul?

KANGAS: CVS shares rose more than 7 percent, Susie, gaining $2.57 to $37.35. J.C. Penney stock was up just $0.07. Now let`s take a look at our other "Stocks in the News" tonight.
For the fifth consecutive trading session, GE (GE) topped the active list today on 36 million shares, up
$0.52. And just as the market was closing, the SEC said it`s looking in on some suspicion option trading of
the stock of InVision Technologies (INVN) just before GE announced a buyout bid.

NorTel Networks (NT) down $0.23. The story here, SEC issued a formal order of investigation regarding the company`s previous restatements of results.
Lucent (LU), a $0.04-gain there. EMC (EMC) up $0.26.
Micron Technology (MU), fifth in volume, was up $0.29 a share. Pfizer (PFE) rising $0.13.
Motorola (MOT) dropped $0.12.

Then a big gainer, Oxford Health (OHP), rising $7.65. WellChoice Corporation (WC) is in advanced talks to acquire Oxford for stock. No specific details, but the rumor is that the bid will be worth somewhere around
$60 a share. WellChoice was down $0.36, incidentally.
Ford Motor (F), a $0.41-gain.
And Citigroup (C) up $0.43, was tenth in volume.

Page 37 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CIGNA Corp. (CI), look at that gain, up almost $7, or 11 1/3 percent. The company increased its
first-quarter and full-year earnings estimates thanks to cost-cutting and improved management. The
company now sees first- quarter earnings at $1.75 to $1.95. It`s earlier estimate was about $1.30.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs reinstated its in-line rating for CIGNA`s stock. It helped the whole sector,
incidentally: Aetna (AET) rising 3 1/2; good gains in Anthem (ATH); Coventry Health (CVH); UnitedHealth
Group (UNH); all in the health insurance business, all stocks doing well there.

On the downside, Impac Mortgage Holdings (IMH), just like last Friday, a big loser. The mortgage lenders were down on the threat, of course, of higher interest rates. Let`s look at that sector again: Countrywide (CFC) down 3.33; Fremont (FMT) losing 3.79; and Novastar Financial (NFI) down $8.10 after losing nearly
$5 last Friday.

And the real estate investment trusts hard-hit on this threat of higher interest rates, Boston Properties (BXP) down $2.54. Let`s look at more stocks in that sector: Equity Office (EOP) off $1.26; General Growth Properties (GGP) down a little over 2; a $2 1/2-drop in Health Care Real Estate Investment Trust (HCN).
On the upside, Biovail Corp. (BVF), rising $1.74. The FDA has approved the company`s hypertension drug
Cardizem for the use in treating Angina.
7-Eleven (SE) moved up $0.76. Merrill Lynch upgraded it from neutral to buy.

And then BankAmerica (BAC) up $0.74. Just after the close, the company confirmed it will cut 12,500 jobs as part of its merger with FleetBoston Financial.
Most active NASDAQ,  Microsoft (MSFT), up a dime. A $0.43-gain in Intel (INTC).
Cisco (CSCO), a $0.38-rise.

But TASER International (TASR) dropping $6 1/2, the rumor is CBS television tonight is going to air a report that`s critical of the company`s weapons.
Research In Motion (RIMM) up $2.71.
And then Ipix (IPIX) up $4.66 on news the company sold stock in a private placement and netted $5 million. QUALCOMM (QCOM), a $0.96-gain.
Nextel (NXTL) up $1.43. Yahoo! (YHOO), a $0.16-loss.
And then in volume, Oracle (ORCL), up $0.19.

Critical Path (CPTH), a $3.06-gain. Look at that percentage, 151 1/2 percent. The story here, General Electric is going to use the company`s identity management software for its 400,000 employees, contractors and vendors.

And then we see a new offering today, Memory Pharmaceuticals (MEMY), which develops drugs. This was a 5 million share initial public offering, priced at 7. The stock opened at $7.50. The high of the day, $9.36. Then it backed down a bit. But still a pretty good debut, up $1.40.
Those are the "Stocks in the News" tonight, Susie? GHARIB: Thanks, Paul.
This month, South Africa celebrates the tenth anniversary of its transition to democracy. The nation will also hold a general election on the fourteenth, next Wednesday, that will effectively serve as a referendum on those 10 years of change. Its president, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to be overwhelmingly reelected. Over the weekend, Mbeki was endorsed by Nobel peace laureate Nelson Mandela. Tonight, we begin a series of reports looking at the past decade in South Africa and what happened after the collapse of the
white-dominated Apartheid system of racial separation.

Tonight, in part one of "South Africa: Ten Years After," reporter Simon Marks looks at the economic achievements that the nation has already made and the enormous challenges that still lie ahead.




Page 38 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SIMON MARKS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It is a month-long celebration marking a decade of change. Across South Africa, 10 years of democracy have people dancing in the streets.

BOITSHOKO SEEKOEI, STUDENT: When Mandela came here everything changed. We got democracy and there was freedom. We could do whatever we wanted to do.

MARKS: A decade on, the South African economy is slowly recovering from 50 years in which the Apartheid system only worried about improving life for the country`s white minority. In the past 10 years, the new government built 1.5 million houses, brought clean water and sanitation to more than 10 million homes, desegregated education and the country`s beaches, and saw key economic sectors like tourism
and the country`s wine industry grow. The motor industry has been a big driver of South Africa`s economic development. Like many U.S. companies, Ford (F) pulled out of South Africa in the mid-1980s to protest Apartheid. But now it`s back, employing more than 4000 local workers.
CRAIG VON ESSEN, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: South Africa is a miracle story.

MARKS: General Manager Craig Von Essen says the company sold 370,000 vehicles in South Africa last year and is now poised to use its plant just outside Johannesburg as an export hub.

VON ESSEN: If you consider the foreign exchange that comes into this country, the jobs that we are creating and maintaining, the motor industry is playing a really pivotal role here in the country.

MARKS: But millions of South Africans still aren`t experiencing the economic benefits of democracy. Every morning a long line forms outside employment agencies all over the country.

MAHMOUD HAMAD, UNEMPLOYED: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) at the moment. I can`t be choosy. Even if I get a job sweeping the streets, I will take it, because things are hard.
MARKS: Nationally, 31 percent of the workforce is out of work, and the economy`s annual growth rate of
2.8 percent is unlikely to bring dramatic change. So last week, when South Africa`s president, Thabo
Mbeki, campaigned for reelection in the north of the country, he addressed the most basic of needs.

THABO MBEKI, PRESIDENT, SOUTH AFRICA: When we say our people are poor, and therefore the people must be able to get some free water and free electricity, that is going to happen.

MARKS: But some of the country`s problems, like a spiraling HIV crisis, can`t be promised away. More than one South African in eight is now HIV- positive, with far-reaching economic consequences. There`s another factor shaping South Africa`s economic destiny: 50 percent of the country`s population is under the age of 20. An entire generation is coming of age that has no memory of the Apartheid era.

BARNABAS THINDWA, JOHANNESBURG WAITER: We have quite come a long way, a very, very, very long way.

MARKS: Barnabas Thindwa is just one example of the new South Africa: 24 years old, a waiter at a popular Johannesburg restaurant, he`s a keen student of the country`s change.

THINDWA: I look at the people, and just by looking at them I see that a lot of the people are very broadminded, most of them. I would like to say they are opportunists in a good way. Everyone is hungry to get that piece of the pie. Everyone is curious, you know? And I believe that`s what gives me the confidence, everyone is curious, everyone is dreaming.

MARKS: And that creates a growing sense of expectation in South Africa and growing impatience for further change. The government here is on course for easy reelection but may find it tough to maintain the reservoir of goodwill it has enjoyed for the last 10 years.
Simon Marks for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Johannesburg, South Africa.

KANGAS: Tomorrow, South Africa`s education system: teaching the country`s leaders for the next decades.

GHARIB: The world`s biggest cruise company is getting even bigger. Carnival Corporation (CCL) is ordering up a new, half-a-billion-dollar luxury cruise ship. It will be called the Queen Victoria and operate under the Cunard Line banner. Setting sail in January of 2007 with more than 1800 passengers, the new ship will be built as an ocean liner similar to the company`s new Queen Mary II.

KANGAS: Internet search engine Google`s new e-mail service is running into trouble. Last week Google unveiled plans for what it calls "g-mail" with 100 times the storage of other services. But consumer groups

Page 39 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in Europe say that may violate privacy laws there since users can`t delete those messages. Google admits copies of e-mails will stay on its systems and advertisements will be pasted into some of them.

GHARIB: Here`s a look now at what`s happening tomorrow. As we reported earlier, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, William Poole, speaks in Little Rock, Arkansas. Also tomorrow: the latest Redbook retail sales numbers; and Dow component ALCOA (AA) reports first-quarter earnings.

If you don`t have your paperwork together to file your federal income taxes this year, you need to get moving. They`re due back at the IRA a week from Thursday. But what happens when the IRS comes back at you? In tonight`s "Tax Tip" report, a look at audits.
Here`s Kevin McCormally, editorial director of "Kiplinger`s Personal Finance."

KEVIN MCCORMALLY, EDITORIAL DIR., "KIPLINGER`S PERSONAL FINANCE": As usual this time of year, the IRS is spending a lot of time telling us how tough it is on tax cheaters. Barely a day goes by that I don`t get a press release telling me about some tax scam that`s been shut down or some tax cheat who`s heading to prison.

The head of the IRS will tell anyone who`ll listen that his agency is beefing up its enforcement activities. Of course, he also admits that he`s worried about the big jump in the number of Americans who think it`s OK to cheat on their taxes. Back in 1999, 11 percent said it was OK. Now 17 percent think so.

Increasing the number of audits to catch more cheaters should stem that tide. But what are the odds that your return will be audited? Slim to none. Overall, the chance is just one in 150, and that counts audits that are handled by mail. The odds of actually going face to face with an IRS agent are one in 780. Even taxpayers earning over $100,000 have a just one in 250 chance for a sit-down with the IRS.

I don`t offer these statistics to encourage you get creative and play the audit lottery. Honest taxpayers need to root for the IRS in this catch-the- cheaters battle. The less the bad guys get away with, the less money the rest of us have to pay to make up for it.

But don`t let the saber-rattling scare you away from taking full advantage of every tax break that Congress has crammed into the law. And don`t lose any sleep worrying about an audit, assuming you`re not committing tax fraud. Heck, even if your return is pulled out for scrutiny, the odds are pretty good you`ll walk away unscathed.

Last year, nearly one in five audits resulted in "no change." In other words, after the IRS had done its best to prove that the taxpayer owed more money, the agency had to admit that the original return was OK.
I`m Kevin McCormally.

KANGAS: Kevin McCormally can answer your tax question, but time is running short, only 10 more days to file. You can submit a question on our Web site, NBR.com.
Recapping today`s market action: an improving outlook for earnings keeps investors happy. The Dow
Industrial Average gains 87 3/4 points, the NASDAQ Composite climbs almost 22.

GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, April 5. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone.
Good night to you, Paul. KANGAS: Good night, Susie.
I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys. END

LP
United States, 2004 Apr 05 (NB). The software industry's most infamous war came to a sudden, unexpected conclusion Friday when and publicly exchanged the olive branch and pledged a new era of collaboration and cooperation between and .

While it's too soon to tell if the $1.6 billion settlement will truly end the software  antitrust wars, The Seattle Times, like many other media outlets and analysts, suggested that the agreement "may begin a new era of cooperation between  Microsoft and the Silicon Valley."

TD
As yesterday's New York Times put it, the settlement may be a sign that Silicon Valley in general has concluded that lawsuits against  Microsoft might not prove beneficial in the long run: "After two decades of inflamed criticism, many here in the technology sector have come to accept the slowly acquired reality that the legal system can do little to resolve their quarrel with  Microsoft. 'Did Microsoft do wrong?' , a computer industry consultant who is a director at the in Menlo Park, Calif., asked rhetorically. 'Of course. But the wheels of the legal system grind too slow to solve problems in the technology space.'" The Times also picked up on one of the most popular comments from Friday's announcement: "Maybe they've
grown up," Sun's said. "Maybe we've grown up."

"Such a reconciliation has seemed all-but-impossible ever since Sun led the campaign among a handful of Valley companies that helped instigate the Justice Department's 1997  antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. The armistice is seen by many Silicon Valley executives as Sun largely suing for peace," The New York Times said.

The Los Angeles Times also picked up on the "Microsoft has won" theme, reporting that the case "marks the starkest example yet of the software giant's attempt to impose a sort of Pax Microsoftus on the technology industry. By using some of its $53-billion cash stockpile to make peace with major rivals, Microsoft is trying to mute some of its harshest critics and clear a path to new markets, experts said. Microsoft has agreed to pay out nearly $5 billion to settle cases since the beginning of last year -- removing political and legal obstacles with each new deal."

CNET's News.com asked whether Sun and  Microsoft can "truly bury the hatchet" with such a long history of hatred. "McNealy says yes. During a press conference on Friday, McNealy said customers have requested that he tone down his anti-Microsoft rhetoric and focus instead on an arrangement where the two companies still compete but their products work well together." (The Wall Street Journal's Web site has a link to a full transcript of Sun's conference call on the deal, courtesy of CCBN Street Events.)

"Many industry analysts have in recent years joined customers in calling for an end to the war of words. 'It really opens the opportunity to let Sun get away from old wars that probably are no longer serving a
useful purpose,' said , an analyst at Illuminata," according to CNET.

Other handicapping of the Sun-Microsoft deal suggests that the two tech industry giants had little option but to work together. As The Wall Street Journal put it, the real winner may be the customer: "That the truce finally came together last week shows how sweeping changes are forcing technology giants to acknowledge a new reality: Customers have more power than ever before over their suppliers, and little patience for the bitter rivalries of the industry's youth. The deal is a break from the practice of the prior two decades, when technology vendors churned out generations of incompatible products, secure in the

Page 42 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
belief that their clients would assume the trouble and expense of making those products work together. Microsoft and Sun epitomized the problem, marketing rival software products with a vehemence that triggered constant bickering and several bitter court cases. For much of the industry's history, companies were willing to accept the rough-and-tumble tactics as the price of getting zippy new products. But the economic pressures of the past few years have slowed the spigot of corporate spending on technology, prompting stiffer  competition among vendors and giving corporate buyers leverage to insist that warring suppliers make their products work together."

The Journal piece provides more details on how the growing Linux threat pushed the two companies to shake hands: "The Linux operating system also has disrupted Sun's business. The software, which can be downloaded free or obtained with computers from IBM and other vendors, has made it easier for customers to use machines that are simpler and less-expensive than Sun's. That trend has hammered Sun's hardware prices and profit margins.  Microsoft is also feeling heat from Linux and IBM. And the software giant bears another big burden, 14 years of  antitrust investigations and lawsuits. The company wants to quickly settle such cases, which hurt its image with customers, so it can share more of its $53 billion cash hoard with investors." Reuters also picked up on the Linux threat in a brief article: "Both companies face stiff  competition from upstart Linux in the market for server software used on networked computers because Linux can be copied and modified freely."
", an analyst for , said the compatibility problems between Sun and  Microsoft systems made switching to
Linux even more attractive for many customers," The Washington Post reported.

And more on Linux from Dow Jones: "The pungent oratory shifted Friday morning, as did the competitive landscape in the high-tech industry, when Mr. McNealy and  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer announced a broad technology agreement and the settlement of a seven-year legal dispute over Java," the wire service said. "Their announcement appeared a mutual recognition that they are no longer each other's primary enemy. The open-source software Linux has taken that place, and both companies sought new ammunition to combat it."
Sun and Microsoft making peace is akin to Oracle's Larry Ellison issuing a public apology to
PeopleSoft's Craig Conway -- it's hard to believe. "Far more significant than any element of the pact is the
striking change of heart and the circumstances that pushed Sun and Microsoft toward a truce. Sun, a
technology pioneer whose business has struggled recently, has long been Microsoft's nemesis and was
an instigator of the sweeping government  antitrust cases against Microsoft in the United States and
Europe," The New York Times explained in a separate article. Sun Microsystems chief Scott McNealy
"has a well-earned reputation as  Microsoft's most persistent and quotable antagonist. In the past, he
routinely described  Microsoft's software as an overly complex 'hairball.' He once referred to  Microsoft's
leaders, Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, and , the chairman and cofounder, as 'Ballmer and
Butthead.'" CNET's News.com has a good recap of some of the  finer McNealy barbs about Microsoft.

The Sun settlement may have one unintended side effect for  Microsoft -- making it harder for the company to appeal the European Union's tough  antitrust sanctions. The Wall Street Journal reported in a separate article today that "to try to freeze the server ruling,  Microsoft would have to convince a European court that the company would be irreparably harmed by sharing information.  Microsoft's deal
with Sun, which does just that, makes it a harder case to argue." But  Microsoft General Counsel told the Journal that the deal with Sun was "carefully crafted the agreement ... to assure continued protection for all of our intellectual-property rights." After 15 years of infighting, you better believe that  Microsoft didn't draft a hasty resolution with Sun.

"Microsoft's surprise legal settlement with Sun Microsystems last week should strengthen efforts to overturn a European  antitrust ruling against the US software giant, a senior  Microsoft official claimed," The Financial Times reported. "But the  European Commission said it would press ahead with its case, adding that it did not believe the agreement between the two US technology companies would have any effect on its own  antitrust ruling."

"I think there's nothing in this -- nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing -- that will do anything other than delight customers," said  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, as quoted by The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. "I don't think there's any downside."

More Ballmer-isms are revealed in the MicrosoftWatch blog, which has the text of an e-mail Ballmer sent out to employees on the deal. An excerpt: "This agreement underscores what I believe is a fundamental reality in the technology business today given the increasingly interconnected nature of technology, we will continue to find ourselves simultaneously working in partnership with and competing with other companies in the industry. Our ability to do both in a focused, professional, and responsible manner will be critical to our success going forward," Ballmer wrote.

Customers might stay alert too, despite the niceties the McNealy and Ballmer showered on each other on
Friday. "Friday's deal settled a lot of scores for two of the tech industry's leaders. I hope it wasn't
designed to kill a mutual foe, namely the threat of commoditization. If it was, customers would be advised
to ignore all that reassuring talk about how the deal is for their sakes. Instead, they should make sure
their pockets aren't about to be picked," , a tech columnist for The San Jose Mercury News, wrote on
Saturday.

The Washington Post's  Microsoft reporter, , will be online today at 1 p.m. ET to answer questions about the Sun-Microsoft peace settlement.

The Microsoft deal overshadowed Sun's other announcement Friday -- that it was laying off 3,300 workers and revising downward revenue forecasts for upcoming quarters. And those problems may explain why Sun was willing to make peace in the first place.

"Laying off 10 percent of your workforce and missing your targets for your quarterly financial expectations is a pretty dramatic problem at this point in the business cycle where we are seeing an uptick in IT spending," of the told The Washington Post. "That would probably indicate the need for a dramatic
change in strategy. That is what we have seen with their pact with  Microsoft."

"It does not signal the end of Sun's troubles," Gartner analyst told The San Jose Mercury News of the deal. "You can't look at this settlement and interpret it as meaning that Sun is back."

The San Francisco Chronicle offered up some hope for sun. "For Sun Microsystems Inc., which is heading for its third straight money-losing year, getting handed nearly $2 billion in a settlement with Microsoft Corp. was great news. But Sun watchers say that burying the hatchet with  Microsoft has positive implications for the server maker that go far beyond the cash. Agreeing to make its systems interoperable with  Microsoft's is Sun's latest -- and biggest -- step toward the healthier business strategy the company needs to emerge from its doldrums, they say."

, a technology investor, told The Seattle Times that the deal eliminates a serious distraction for Sun's McNealy. "From the Sun side it's even better because during the last 10 years Scott McNealy has ignored proper management of his company in favor of what I call the 'Bill Disease,'" Anderson said. "He was worrying only about Bill and what he would do instead of worrying about how to run Sun and it has
harmed the company."

<p>The governments of mainland China, Japan and South Korea have recently signed a cooperation
pact to develop applications for the Linux operating system.</p> <p>Under the pact, the governments will

a major competitor of Windows.</p> <p>The move is seen by local analysts as an attempt to stop
Microsoft from monopolizing the operating systems market.</p> <p>"The governments have
demonstrated their ambition to lead the development of Linux applications around the world," industry

licenses in 2002, compared with about 23 percent for Linux, according to International Data Corp.</p>

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - Last week's stunning $1.6-billion settlement with Sun Microsystems Inc. is unlikely to affect the  antitrust actions against  Microsoft Corp. in Europe, officials and legal experts said Monday.

TD
The European Commission said it stood behind its recent ruling against  Microsoft, which was initially triggered by a complaint from Sun in 1998.

"It does not call into question the decision of the 24th of March, if only because the commission decision is not limited to the interests of any one company in any one area," said EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres.

"It is broader than the interests of one company. We took the decision because we thought it was in the interest of European consumers."

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti  fined Microsoft $611 million US two weeks ago for abusively wielding its Windows software monopoly, after a five-year investigation.

Monti also ordered Microsoft to produce a version of Windows without  Microsoft's own digital media player already included.

Torres refused to say whether Sun had been in contact with EU regulators over the deal or whether the firm has retracted support for a similar, pending probe into Windows XP, the most recent version of Microsoft's ubiquitous operating system.

In a release Friday, Sun said it was "satisfied" the agreement with Microsoft also would "satisfy the objectives it was pursuing in the EU actions pending against Microsoft."

A Brussels-based lawyer for Sun referred questions Monday to Lee Patch, Sun's vice-president of legal affairs in Santa Clara, Calif. Patch was not immediately available for comment.
Ed Black, president of an anti-Microsoft group -- including Sun -- that brought the XP complaint, said
Sun's settlement would have no impact.

"That case was developed with involvement and support of a very wide range of companies through many sectors of industry," said Black, who heads the Washington-based Computer and Communications Industry Association.

"The settlement does not appear to reflect any fundamental change in  Microsoft's business strategy at all," he added.
"They just made Sun into more of a co-operator than a competitor."

He said Sun is not withdrawing from the organization.

Although legal experts who have followed the EU case agreed the overall impact of the Sun settlement probably would be minimal, Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels, said it could affect  Microsoft's promised appeal.

The computer giant might never have to pay its huge  fine for anti-competitive practices, writes Edward
Fennell

IF EVER a company were misnamed it would have to be  Microsoft. The company is neither small nor cuddly. "Macrotough", the hardest nut on the corporate block, would be more appropriate.

TD
After the  European Commission imposed a fine of Euro 497 million (Pounds 332 million) last month for the company's anti-competitive behaviour, there were suspicions that  Microsoft might brazen the whole thing out.

After a five-year investigation the Commission found that  Microsoft, whose operating systems equip almost all personal computers, had exploited its market power to penalise its competitors and restrict consumer choice. In particular it had bundled its Windows Media Player in with the Windows software, stifling  competition from rival products.

No one questions that the decision is monumental, with most lawyers in the  competition field agreeing with Stephen Kinsella, of Herbert Smith's Brussels office, that it is striking that the Commission decided
to make a stand against so big a player as  Microsoft rather than going for the easy option of settling the case. Moreover, as Christopher Thomas, of Lovells, which acted in the case against  Microsoft on behalf of Novell Inc, points out: "The level of factual detail reviewed by the Commission was quite
extraordinary. It is probably the most researched case in history."

But the  fine, although the largest imposed on a company by the Commission, is reckoned to be only slightly more than 1 per cent of  Microsoft's $53 billion (Pounds 29 billion) in the bank. "I don't consider the fine particularly large," Kinsella says. "I was expecting something more like Euro 1 billion."

So what about the requirement that the company unbundle its Media Player product from the Windows operating system and create scope for interoperability with other companies' products?

Well, the lawyers involved in the case, and the IT industry, are still trying to work out just how meaningful this is. Thomas Vinje, of Clifford Chance, who has been advising the Computer and Communications Industry Association, is bullish.

"For the first time,  Microsoft will be required to alter its fundamentally anti-competitive business model," he says. "The main value of the decision is as a precedent. It lays down the rules of the road for tackling Microsoft's broader anti-competitive actions."
Kinsella is more restrained. "I think it is a fairly measured decision by the Commission," he says. "After
all, Microsoft has not even been stopped from selling the bundled product in Europe. All they have to do
is offer their customers a choice."

There is also disagreement about whether the case is confined in its significance to  Microsoft's unique position or whether it has wider ramifications for the knowledge-driven industries generally. As Pat Treacy, head of  competition law at Bristows, puts it: "Its actual relevance to particular companies or courses of conduct is hard to assess in legal terms until the precise legal reasoning can be analysed." In
Page 48 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this context, the next few days may be very important. Although it is now a fortnight since the  fine was handed down, none of the lawyers outside  Microsoft has seen the judgment. It is 300 pages long and Microsoft was given a fortnight to review it for business secrets before it could be made more widely available.

So, money aside, we will not know the full legal ramifications until the judgment is released. Even then this may just be another curtain-raiser to the next act in the drama. After all,  Microsoft did not get where it is today by holding up its hands when invited to do so. The fight will surely go on.

So the immediate issue will be whether the Court of First Instance will confirm the Commission's decision. It would be several months before the process reached that stage and, if the court fails to do so, the celebrations among  Microsoft's many enemies will have to be put on hold.

Even after that, there will be the long haul through to the European Court of Justice. All of which means that last month's judgment is probably not the beginning of the end, just the end of the beginning. "I think that we have reached about the halfway stage," says Treacy. "It's taken us five years to get to this point.
I think that it will be a further five years before it's finished."
Of course, that scenario could be all part of the  Microsoft strategy. With advances in technology, by
2009 this whole affair may seem like a debate among ancient historians -of interest, perhaps, to the
legal academic but of little significance on a new technological and business landscape.  Microsoft will
have moved on to the next big idea.

That is why Kinsella believes that the Commission should be taken to task for having allowed the case to drag on for so long. Indeed, some commentators reckon that it was brought to a judgment now only because of the deadline of May 1, when decentralisation comes in and many more decisions will be
taken by national courts -including those in the EU accession states.

Ultimately this Trojan war will move on to the other side of the Atlantic. Some American critics have already tried to play the case up as being another example of Old Europe trying to do down Uncle Sam. An interesting point, perhaps, except as Treacy points out: "All the complainants are American."

More significant are the possible lessons that the American courts will draw from the Brussels judgment. Treacy says: "There is an exchange of legal theory between America and Europe, so if the decision is upheld here it will impact on the US too."

But to carry weight in America the decision will have to have the full backing of the courts rather than merely the judgment of Brussels bureaucrats. That is another reason why we can expect the litigation to be long and hard. It starts to get serious from this point on.

HD     COMMISSION MICROSOFT RULING MAY THREATEN INNOVATION WC     472 words

There has been a flood of criticism from the US in the wake of the  European Commission's fine of Microsoft and its demand that the software giant change its business practices. All the way up to government level, Americans are accusing the Commission of threatening innovation. Beyond the record fine of Euro 497 million, the Commission has also imposed certain "remedies" to stop  Microsoft from crushing its competitors. The most controversial measure for the Americans is the forced removal of Media Player (software for playing audio and video) from the Windows operating system. Thus, the consumer may choose between a Windows package with or without Media Player. To be obliged to withdraw software so as not to discourage  competition is unprecedented, the US says.

TD
According to Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general for anti-trust at the US Department of Justice, this solution was never at any time envisaged during the long process his department took between 1998 and
2002 against the world's number one software giant. Mr Pate says the requirements imposed by Mario Monti could slow down "innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies," and that "a contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition".

"The only winners are multi-billion dollar  Microsoft competitors, Real Networks and Sun Microsystems", underlined for its part the Association for Competitive Technology (ACT), which promotes SMEs in the technology sector. "For example, software developers writing distance learning applications can no longer rely on the fact that Media Player functionality will be in Windows. The cutting of the safety net will result
in higher costs for software development and higher costs for consumer software", explained ACT. Going further than the Department of Justice, this association also fears for innovation. It believes that the ruling makes "it difficult for any market-leading company to add new features to dominant products". And under this regime, the Finnish world leader in mobile telephony, "Nokia could be found liable for integrating instant messaging or imaging software to its market-leading phones."

"Far from defending the interests of consumers, the latest decision from the European Union transforms the antitrust question into a programme of social aid for market losers", claims the Washington based Cato Institute, which describes itself as a defender of the free market. For the institute, "the real costs" of this decision will be "fewer jobs, less innovation, lower quality products and higher prices".

The organisation Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) - working to prevent the waste of public money - also believed that the Commission was exposing itself to risks in taking the opposite course from the compromise agreed two years ago by the American Department of Justice. "In most international antitrust cases, courts will rely on precedent if a decision has been made in another jurisdiction", noted CAGW in a press release.

BRUSSELS -- The makers of Marlboro cigarettes would pay about $1 billion (U.S.) to the European Union over a dozen years to fight smuggling and counterfeiting under a proposed deal that would end years of legal wrangling, officials said yesterday.

Philip Morris International, part of the U.S. tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc., and the EU's executive European Commission said the draft agreement would "resolve all disputes" between them.

TD
In 2001, the EU filed a lawsuit in New York accusing Philip Morris and other tobacco giants of complicity in smuggling by intentionally oversupplying neighbouring countries. Such smuggling is estimated to cost European governments $1 billion in lost taxes annually.

The lawsuit was dismissed in 2002 but a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in January to file a new lawsuit based on money-laundering laws.

EU budget commissioner Michaele Schreyer said talks have been underway for "several months" and the 10 EU governments that joined the commission's legal action are now reviewing the draft.

"We are waiting on the approval of the member states," Schreyer said. "We hope that we can sign the agreement very soon."

The potential deal would result in "substantial payments over a number of years," she said, declining to elaborate. A company spokesperson confirmed reports of about $1 billion over 12 years.

"That is reflective of the terms of the draft agreement," said Nerida White at the company's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Shares of parent company Altria gained 42 cents to $55.29 yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

It would be the largest amount of money the EU has ever extracted from a private company, exceeding the 497 million euros ($611 million U.S.) the EU recently  fined Microsoft Corp. in an antitrust case.

But both sides stressed the prospective payments were not penalties but a commitment to work together on issues important to both.
"What it really represents is moving from conflict to very firm and strong co-operation," White said.

Philip Morris International - which markets Philip Morris brands outside the United States - is especially concerned about cheap imitations made in China, South America and Eastern Europe, particularly of its most popular brand, Marlboro.
An estimated 1 million packs of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the EU daily, White said, costing
Philip Morris alone an estimated $100 million in lost sales annually.
Many of the fakes enter the EU from poor, eastern countries like Poland that are set to join the EU
on May 1, adding urgency to the need for more efforts.

HD        Tobacco smuggling agreement set to pave way for EU deals.

Philip Morris International's offer to pay the European Union Dollars 1bn (Euros 832m, Pounds 550m) to head off lawsuits over alleged collusion with smugglers looked set yesterday to pave the way for similar deals in the industry.

Philip Morris said its payment would help fight cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, and Japan Tobacco, maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, said it wanted to co-operate with authorities in the same way.

TD
Japan Tobacco, the world's third largest tobacco company, confirmed it had talked to the  European      Commission over co-operation to fight the illicit trade.

Guy Cote, a Japan Tobacco spokesman, said that until now Brussels-based regulators had rejected his company's offers to settle all eventual legal disputes and pay money to fight smuggling.

He said he hoped the latest development would enable serious negotiations to be reopened. "Perhaps they wanted to deal with the biggest player first," Mr Cote told Dow Jones.

The European Commission launched legal action against Philip Morris, Japan Tobacco and RJ Reynolds in 2000, claiming that the companies colluded with smugglers to bring their products into the EU, so avoiding excise duties. That case was rejected by the US courts, but Brussels is now pursuing a related claim against RJ Reynolds for alleged money-laundering.

Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner, said she hoped the Commission and 10 EU member states would be able to agree a deal with Philip Morris "very soon" to end the legal dispute.

She refused to say whether the litigation against Japan Tobacco had been suspended because talks with the company were continuing.

"We are willing to have discussions with all companies that show they are serious about their fight against this illegal trade," she said.

The Dollars 1bn payment would be the largest amount ever extracted by the EU from a private company, and exceeds the Euros 497m  antitrust fine levied last month against  Microsoft.

However, the Commission said the money, to be paid over 12 years, was not guaranteed to be spent on fighting the illegal trade in tobacco, saying only that the funds "could be made available" for that
purpose.
Japan Tobacco last year warned that rising excise rates in the 10 countries due to join the European
Union next year could lead to a flood of contraband.

It argued that long borders between some of the new EU member states and countries such as Ukraine could allow extensive smuggling.

Philip Morris International's Dollars 1bn payment is designed to arrest the flow of bogus cigarettes from markets like Russia and the Ukraine into the new EU.

But what is less clear, says Michael Smith of JP Morgan, is whether governments will be able to tackle intra-EU movements from countries such Poland to Germany and France effectively after they join the EU on May 1. See Editorial Comment

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM
The European Union and the maker of Marlboro cigarettes said yesterday they were close to a
$1-billion (U.S.) deal to end years of legal wrangling by cracking down together on smuggling and
counterfeits that are costing both sides enormous sums.

TD
Under the draft agreement, Philip Morris International Inc. would make payments over 12 years totalling about $1 billion â the biggest sum the EU has ever extracted from a single company.

In return, âall disputesâ would be resolved between the company, part of the U.S. tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc., and the  European Commission, which has filed two lawsuits in recent years against Philip Morris and was contemplating a third.

The latest, filed in New York in 2001, accused U.S. tobacco giants of complicity in cigarette smuggling by intentionally oversupplying neighbouring countries. Such smuggling is estimated to cost European governments $1-billion annually in lost taxes.

The lawsuit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds but a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in January to file a new one based on money laundering laws.

Even if the lawsuit wasn't refiled, analysts said the deal likely would be a good one for Philip Morris if it stems the tide of fake Marlboros into the high-margin European market, which the company says costs it $100-million each year.

âThis is not a company that's shy of litigation, to say the least,â said David Adelman, tobacco industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. âI think this is a situation where by providing funds and resolving conflict, you're in a position to much better address and attack a real business issue.â

The money could help cash-strapped governments â particularly in the poor eastern European countries joining the EU next month â hire and train more customs officers, pay for better equipment and technology âand create a better working relationship,â Mr. Adelman said.
EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer said the 10 EU governments that joined the
Commission's legal action are now reviewing the draft.

âWe are waiting on the approval of the member states,â Ms. Schreyer said. âWe hope that we can sign the agreement very soon.â

The potential deal would result in âsubstantial payments over a number of years,â she said, declining to elaborate. A company spokeswoman confirmed reports of about $1-billion over 12 years.
Page 57 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
âThat is reflective of the terms of the draft agreement,â said Nerida White, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The amount would exceed the record 497 million euros ($783-million) the EU recently  fined            Microsoft Corp. in an antitrust case.

But both sides stressed the prospective payments were not penalties but a commitment to work together. âWhat it really represents is moving from conflict to very firm and strong co-operation,â Ms. White said.

Philip Morris International â which markets Philip Morris brands outside the United States â said it is concerned about cheap imitations made in China, South America and eastern Europe.

The May 1 addition of eight eastern European countries into the EU adds another dimension to the problem, given that their cigarette taxes are generally much lower than in western Europe.

Smugglers could get truckloads of authentic Marlboros in an eastern EU member like Latvia, where excise taxes are only 10 per cent, and make money by selling them illegally in Britain, where the taxes run to 211 per cent and where cigarettes cost more than $11 a pack.

In a statement, the EU said the draft covers âbroad areas of co-operation with European law enforcement agenciesâ to ensure the company's brands are sold legally.
Also in the draft are âcustomer oversight policiesâ to deter sales to minors and âtracking and tracingâ
provisions from the factory to stores, the EU said.

Just two weeks ago, Microsoft was slapped with a {euro}497 million (HK$4.75 billion)  fine by the European Commission. The firm was also told to unbundle its Media Player in Europe and release details on its application programming interfaces to competitors.

I described the  fine as "chump change", and received several complaints that I was being unfair on the company. During our On the Spot chat on scmp.com last week, one reader said I had "taken on the crusading role of a  Microsoft basher". Some people might take that as a compliment.

TD
Well, last Friday, just nine days after the EU announced its  fine, none other than  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer proved me right.

Microsoft has just settled one of the longest-running feuds in technology history, for close to US$2 billion. That breaks down into $1.6 billion to end antitrust and patent lawsuits, and $350 million in licensing fees, all of which does make the EU fine look modest. It's rude to say it, but I told you so.

The settlement follows a well-established pattern that  Microsoft has perfected over the past decade. We have seen it pay off Apple, AOL/Netscape, the United States Department of Justice and 17 States, a host of consumer groups and small software firms, and now, probably its biggest litigant of all: Sun Microsystems.

What was most remarkable about the settlement was not the size but the settlor. After all, this was the firm that instigated the EU investigation. As a rule, Microsoft will not settle a suit until its opponent is hanging on the ropes. Whatever the courts decide, Microsoft keeps its appeals going until its opponents run out of either cash or market share. In this case, Sun Microsystems still has both, however weak they may appear. After nearly eight years of litigation, Sun is just too big in the back office to be broken by  Microsoft's desktop dominance.

While Sun has embraced Linux to some extent, free software running on generic PCs is eating into its workhorse Solaris on the Ultrasparc platform. And that change will cost the firm another 3,300 jobs. But Sun chief executive Scott McNealy added that Sun was working on  Microsoft certification for its Linux products, which can only help the open source movement.

Both men emphasised that their customers had been demanding interoperability between Windows and Solaris. "Our customers said stop the noise and start the collaboration," Mr McNealy said. "Maybe we've grown up, maybe they've grown up. Who knows? Maybe the customers are getting more in charge these days."

Despite all the hugs, the jokes and the exchange of gifts from their mutual hometown of Detroit, Mr McNealy and Mr Ballmer come from very different corporate cultures. Although Mr McNealy has often said that he would be willing to work with  Microsoft, his public comments tell a different story.
"Microsoft is integrated - it's not integratable," he has said, adding that "Microsoft flunked Sharing
101," and "Microsoft giving Sun advice on open standards is like W.C. Fields giving moral advice to
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."


Page 59 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
How well the relationship succeeds will depend on some major compromises and trust from both companies. While the agreement sounds like good news for customers, it is a sad day for those who follow the industry.

For nearly 20 years, one of the highlights of the technology calendar has been Mr McNealy's appearance at tech events such as Openworld, Java One or Comdex, and entertaining the adoring crowds with jibes at  Microsoft. He has compared Microsoft to the Dark Side, the Evil Empire, heroin dealers, Neil Sedaka, a hairball, and "one big melted glob of plastic that you can't pull apart". He has also called on the US government to take a chainsaw to the firm.

When he was asked on Friday whether he would stop calling  Microsoft names, Mr McNealy replied: "I'm going to do my best to be good. I will be good."

He added that Mr Ballmer would also have to change his sales pitch. "There's been an equal amount of rhetoric coming back the other way. Mine was just more clever."

Peace between  Microsoft and Sun may mean the technology world becomes a less entertaining place. But with that aggressive edge gone, it could also become a less competitive and innovative place. Let's just hope that I am wrong this time.

HD       Glaser: EU ruling  a boon to Real's $1 billion suit; RealNetworks' CEO says the ruling  that Microsoft abused its OS power to try to dominate  the media player market will bolster  his company's courtroom and marketplace efforts.

LP
RealNetworks CEO Rob Glaser is praising the  European Commission's recent ruling against
Microsoft, saying it will also help his company in its private lawsuit against the software giant.

In London on Wednesday to promote European versions of the company's media player software, RealPlayer 10, Glaser said: "The commission did the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons."

TD
The commission ruled on March 24 that  Microsoft broke the European Union's  competition law by leveraging its near-monopoly in PC operating systems to bully into the markets for workgroup server operating systems and for media players. It imposed a record  fine of $613 million and demanded changes in Microsoft software.
In December, Real hit  Microsoft with its own lawsuit, saying that  Microsoft has been illegally using its
Windows monopoly in the media player market. It is seeking in excess of $1 billion.

Though strangely quiet at the time of the EC announcement, when asked Wednesday if it will help Real's action, Glaser said: "My lawyers tell me yes. It's a positive development, the first time any jurisdiction has ruled on media players."

Real has pointed out on more than one occasion that it didn't initiate the commission's investigation--which began five years ago--but did contribute to it.

"It is much better to establish a legal precedent that there was a violation," Glaser said, adding that he thinks consumers and PC vendors will benefit as a result.
Following the EC ruling two weeks ago, 10 U.S. members of Congress wrote to Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti calling for him to reconsider the decision and accompanying fine.

One politician to be outspoken about the European course of action is Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell. Both Real and  Microsoft are based in the state of Washington, but she was a senior vice president at Real between 1995 and 2000 and still holds several million dollars worth of Real shares.

"She was a member of the lower house before (joining) Real, and her statements have been balanced," Glaser said, referring to Cantwell's earlier term in the U.S. House of Representatives. "She believes in the marketplace and that it's always better to have a marketplace solution--and by the way, we agree with that."

He said that bluster against European regulation should be taken with a grain of salt during a U.S. general election year, with such comments likely to come across to voters as more "pro-U.S." than anything else.

On Tuesday, Real announced a major deal with BT Rich Media for its Helix Universal Server and Helix Service Delivery Suite, used for services aimed at consumers and small businesses that want to create and share content.

It has also announced a deal with Virgin Radio, a broadcast station that's one of the biggest voices in
Internet radio, to broadcast using RealAudio 10. This win sits alongside other premium content such as
Page 61 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
that carried for Channel 4 and European football governing body UEFA, which offers a Champions
League package including video highlights.

Real and UEFA won't reveal how many subscribers that service has--past efforts by Yahoo to stream valuable football content at the 2002 World Cup were also shrouded in secrecy--but the software vendor says it has 1.3 million premium subscription users worldwide. Around three-quarters of revenue come from consumer services such as paid-for RealPlayer downloads, and a quarter from licensing deals with user organizations and companies such as BT.

Real is currently in a quiet period, with its first-quarter results due at the end of the month. Over the past six quarters, the company has increased revenue but has yet to report a profit since the tech slump kicked in.

HD         INTERVIEW-RealNetworks  talks to PC makers after EU ruling. BY         By Lucas van Grinsven, European Technology Correspondent

AMSTERDAM, April 7 (Reuters) - RealNetworks (RNWK.O) said on Wednesday it had held exploratory talks with computer makers about the impact of a landmark ruling by the  European Commission that could help boost the adoption of its media player.

Chief Executive Rob Glaser, who is in Europe to announce European versions of the latest music and video player, said RealNetworks was growing despite tough  competition from rival Microsoft (MSFT.O).

TD
The Commission two weeks ago  fined Microsoft for abusing its dominance in the market and ordered it to open its server software and dominant personal computer software to give rivals such as RealNetworks a better chance to compete.

"We've grown our business six quarters in a row in the personal computer content and services area, and the number of RealPlayers is higher than it has ever been. This is a long-term growth market," Glaser told Reuters in a telephone interview.

At the moment  Microsoft includes its own media player in its Windows operating system, which is used to run almost all PCs. RealNetworks has to convince consumers to download its Real Player over the Internet and also change default settings. Only then can consumers start buying music and video from Real.

Glaser, whose customers include Virgin Radio, BT (BT.L) and soccer body UEFA, is hopeful the ruling will open up the wider computer market even though it applied only to the European Union.

RealNetworks made a $5.3 million fourth-quarter loss on 17 percent higher revenues of $54.1 million, partly because of large legal fees in its  antitrust lawsuits against  Microsoft.

"In a few very preliminary talks with computer makers we've discussed options ... Europe is the first jurisdiction to rule on this," Glaser said, adding the ruling could set PC makers on a new course.

BIG LEGAL FEES With its latest media player, RealNetworks is positioning itself as a company that can play most of the different Internet media formats, including piracy-protected music from Web stores
such as Apple's (AAPL.O) iTunes Music Store,  Microsoft's MSN Music Club and Sony Corp's (6758.T) Connect.

Media players from RealNetworks' rivals cannot play all the different media formats, and some only support the popular MP3 format alongside their own format. Media players are necessary on the Internet, because music and video files must be compressed by software programmes for efficient distribution. Record companies also demand piracy protection, for which yet more special software has been developed by the different companies.

Glaser said his company has integrated all these different standards into its latest Real Player 10 but declined to say how much in licence fees he was paying to his rivals.

He did say that the fragmentation seen in the computer industry was probably not going to be repeated in the mobile phone industry, which RealNetworks is targeting as the next big growth opportunity.
Page 63 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
All handset makers and wireless telecommunications operators are working together on a single and open media format in a group called Open Mobile Alliance. "For the PC we used software to integrate all digital rights management systems. In a mobile phone there's not so much (memory) space, so the industry has to work together. The mobile industry is doing the right thing. It will lead the way," Glaser said.

RealNetworks has signed key deals with handset makers such as Nokia (NOK1V.HE) and mobile operators such as Vodafone (VOD.L) to use its software to stream music and video to mobile phones.

Glaser said the revenues in this industry, which is not dominated by  Microsoft operating software, were still modest.

"The bulk of our business is still in the PC segment, but we're focusing on both (PC and mobile phones). We so see significant mobile growth," he said.

More than 70m people in central Europe will wake up on May 1st to find themselves citizens of the European Union. Eight countries in the region, along with the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta, will become the EU's newest members. European laws will take precedence over national ones, customs codes will be replaced by the rules of Europe's single market, and Brussels will have the last word on matters ranging from  competition policy and value-added tax to sex discrimination in the work place.

TD
Governments and firms have been hoping and planning for this moment since communism collapsed in
1989-91. With so much advance notice, big economic adjustments in the private sector have already
taken place. Foreign direct investment has poured into central Europe in the past decade, drawn by a
combination of low wages and guaranteed access to EU markets. A wave of new factory-building in the
region may even have passed its peak, as the  competition from China has grown stronger. Now the EU's
new members must move up-market, to lure higher-paid, higher-skilled jobs in service industries such as
scientific research and information technology.

They have a good chance of succeeding. By banning or limiting legal inflows of cheap workers from central Europe for two-to-seven years after enlargement, the governments of France, Germany and other rich EU countries are forcing their firms to go on pursuing cheap labour by investing abroad. Even for big companies, central Europe will retain some advantages over Bangalore or Beijing when viewed from the West: productivity is higher, tariff and border problems are disappearing, shipping costs are lower, and the business environment is more familiar. As for medium-sized firms in western Europe that want to cut costs but lack the resources to cope with exotic business environments, central Europe will offer a very reassuring option for investment and outsourcing once it is within the EU.

Most barriers to trade in goods between the EU and the new members have already fallen, leaving only a few to go in May. These last restrictions cover about 5% of current trade by value, mostly farm products. Alas for consumers, there is little prospect that their removal will flood western Europe with cheap food, as protectionists claim. Prices for many farm products in central Europe have risen close to EU levels; farm productivity remains low; the region's big dairy industry will be hobbled by EU milk quotas; and the EU's tough health standards will limit meat exports.

Multinational firms are fighting as fiercely for sales in the consumer-goods markets of central Europe as they are in those of western Europe, often more so. But though the EU's new members no longer count as emerging markets, they are not quite mature ones either. Prague and Warsaw may be full of smart supermarkets, but outside the big cities there are very few moneyed consumers. Average incomes in central Europe are barely one-fifth of those in the current EU, so full convergence of living standards is decades away at best. Given this, most multinationals plan to retain separate divisions and strategies for western and central Europe, despite enlargement. They are more likely to integrate operations across the EU later in the decade, as the central Europeans begin to adopt the euro, according to a survey
conducted by the Economist Corporate Network
, a sister firm of The Economist.

For firms of all kinds in central Europe, the main change on May 1st will come with the need to know and obey EU laws and regulations. But these are so extensive and complicated that few firms (and no governments) have mastered them fully. Some countries have not even finished translating them. It will take months and years for inexperienced courts, tax offices and other government agencies to gain

Page 65 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
experience in interpreting and implementing them. As long as differences between old national rules and new EU ones remain to be ironed out, firms may encounter inconsistencies between the twoâfor example, in the collection of value-added tax, where the EU establishes the over-riding principles but national governments decide the practical implementation. Companies caught in such conflicts should "follow the rule that suits them best, and hope", says one tax consultant.

The accession countries already have national laws on  competition and state aid, drawn up with EU entry in mind. But the rules here are likely to be implemented more rigorously after May 1st, when EU law takes effect directly and the final authority to enforce it passes to the European Commission, the EU's executive body. "If you have 40% of the market...then worry," says Ann LaFrance, a competition lawyer with Squire, Sanders & Dempsey.

If the commission determines that a company has seriously breached  competition law, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover, as  Microsoft found recently. Suppliers and customers in central Europe will have a few months' grace to make sure that their contracts contain no unfair pricing provisions or other restraints. Then the commission will be on the prowl, and may well be looking for some
high-profile cases that will send clear messages to the market. State aid will also be policed more strictly:
companies receiving illegal aid in cash or in kind may be forced to repay it all.

Business people in central Europe know that the problems of EU membership will not end with the many teething troubles of accession. Membership will mean a constantly evolving body of restrictive laws in areas such as environmental standards, health and safety, and corporate governanceâquite a lot of them ill-adapted to the needs of poorer countries. Yet they are optimistic on balance. They expect such costs to be dwarfed by the benefits of better public administration and a stable, uniform and more open business environment. From May 1st, this optimism can be put to the test.

HD       FOCUS ON EUROPE: The European Union takes on Microsoft ? monopolists beware
WC      858 words
PD       8 April 2004

LP
It has taken almost a decade for any type of substantial action to be taken against Microsoft?s alleged monopolistic behaviour, and the world community should congratulate the European Commission?s Competition Directorate General for its brave decision to  fine the software giant US$610 million (Bt23.9 billion) for violating anti-trust regulations.

It took American courts almost seven years to decide that only ?behavioural? remedies needed be applied to redress Microsoft?s practices. In the case of  Microsoft versus the US Justice Department, the multinational managed to stall until the Clinton administration was replaced by the more
business-friendly George W Bush.

TD
Microsoft was rumoured to have been one of Bush?s major financial supporters during his election campaign. One is left wondering whether it was a coincidence that after Bush came to power at the end of January 2001, the appeals court rejected a break-up of  Microsoft, a solution many believed to be the best way of thwarting the company?s monopolistic tendencies.
The US Justice Department?s case came about because of complaints over  Microsoft?s inclusion, or
?bundling?, of the Internet Explorer web browser in its Windows operating system. The legal action
against Microsoft left the company?s main competitor in the area of web browsers, Netscape,
completely crippled. Today, few Thai youths will have heard of Netscape?s legendary Navigator
browser, which was a leap forward on the Internet scene when it first appeared.

The fact that the Americans failed to significantly punish  Microsoft for squashing its  competition so unfairly makes the EU ruling even more courageous. It is not customary for EU institutions to be so forward-looking, and what is even more surprising is they actually managed to act in a timely manner.

The EU ruling came about as a result of complaints in February 2000 that  Microsoft was bundling features in the Windows 2000 operating system. This eventually led to further accusations by the EU that Microsoft was blocking competition from Sun Microsystems and other rivals making audio-visual software. In August 2003, the EU ordered  Microsoft to either ?unbundle? its Media Player from its operating systems or to carry rival software.

On March 15, before Microsoft?s audio-visual rival Realnetworks could die like Netscape, the EU slapped on the $610-million fine. In addition, the grouping required  Microsoft to release a version of Windows that does not include media-playback functions so that PC suppliers can opt for whatever software they want. These measures are considered to be substantial, but they are perhaps not drastic enough.

Microsoft has appealed, a strategy which has proven extremely successful in the past in stalling action, and has often resulted in potentially severe punishments becoming mere slaps on the wrist.

Without jumping to conclusions over the possible consequences of the EU ruling, it is clear that it has set a precedent. And for once  Microsoft appears to be troubled by the prospects of having to unbundle its software from its operating system. Indications are that the company is desperate to fight this ruling. Steve Ballmer,  Microsoft?s chief executive, flew to Brussels for three days of talks, but failed to reach a settlement.

One can only hope that the ruling survives the appeal, something that would be a first on its own. Ever since Netscape was driven out of the market, we simply haven?t seen any dramatic innovations in web

browsers. When  competition was intense, upgrades of the web browsers came out every few months to the joy of the common user. One struggles to think of a unique  Microsoft innovation, despite the fact
that it is the richest company in the world and employs some of the highest-paid software engineers.

The case now goes on to the European Court of First Instance, which is responsible for the bulk of cases relating to  competition policy. ?The  European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word,? said  Microsoft?s general counsel Brad Smith.

Smith is correct, but needs to be reminded that the trend in the European Court of Justice?s jurisprudence has been to strengthen the Commission?s powers. In general, the ECJ has supported the Commission?s decisions. This gives further hope that, for once, a decision to punish  Microsoft for its antitrust behaviour will not be overturned.

Meanwhile, the European Commission?s Competition Directorate General?s landmark decision against Microsoft may have added a new dimension to the EU?s external relations. Previously, in the case of Boeing-McDonnell Douglas in 1997, in which the European Union intervened in a merger already approved by its American counterparts, Chad Damro of the University of Pittsburgh argued that the EU had asserted its international identity by means of its commercial policy.

If the EU?s ruling sticks, there can be no doubt that multinational firms with monopolistic tendencies will stand up and take notice of the EU as an international entity. After all, the grouping will have succeeded in setting a precedent that the Americans themselves have failed to do.

German Jobless Rate Up

The number of jobless in Germany in March rose to a seasonally adjusted 44,000 from February, according to figures released by the Labour Office. The unadjusted jobless total was 4.5 million in March, down 93,600 month-on-month, and down 62,200 year-on-year. The unadjusted jobless rate was 10.9%, the office confirmed.
The Deal

There has long been a suspicion that  Fine Gael is out of touch with the electorate. For many, John Deasy's naughty cigarettes in the Dail bar last week were just another confirmation of this. On the other hand, some would say it's the most coverage a  Fine Gael politician has received in a very long time.
Deasy Stubs Out Fag On His Own Foot
THE DETAILS

As the infamous smoking ban grew ever closer, even Fianna Fail councillor Michael Healy-Rae, one of the new legislation's fiercest critics, was forced to accept that he would have to uphold the law of the land in
his own public house. Meanwhile, smokers everywhere took to the streets, not in protest but in

Page 70 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
supplication, as the ban was generally welcomed. High odds would have been available that the most public flaunting of the ban would have come from the justice spokesman from  Fine Gael, a party that prides itself on holding the moral high ground.

With that in mind, party leader Enda Kenny had little option but to fire Deasy from his front bench. The great pity for the party is that Deasy is young, articulate and strongly opinionated - just the type of person Fine Gael needs to be promoting if it is ever to become relevant.
THE DAYS AHEAD

Bertie Ahern may fear a whitewash in the upcoming local and European elections but Enda Kenny must fear obliteration. By smoking a cigarette, John Deasy got far more attention than Kenny ever manages when trying to pick holes in the Fianna Fail-PD Government. The fact that he is forced to agree with the coalition on so many issues - from the EU to bin taxes - puts him at a major disadvantage.
The electorate is also at a disadvantage if it hopes for an alternative to the current Government. THE DEAL
Posh 'n' Backs have always been about far more than just football and pop songs. Indeed, some would argue that they were rarely really about either.

Nevertheless, the two have become one of the most successful branded couples in history. While infidelity is always a prospect among high flying superstar couples, there is little room for it in the Posh'n'Becks brand.


THE DETAILS

Marriage is supposed to be about a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. Never has this been truer than in the case of David and Victoria Beckham. Granted, Beckham has proven himself a talented and adaptable player on the field since he transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United in a stgPounds 25m deal last year. Yet his true worth is still off the pitch. Real Madrid is likely to have recouped this fee easily through merchandising since the English star arrived - in Beckham's first month, the club estimated it sold Â£3m worth of Beckham-branded replica Real Madrid jerseys. Beckham is also quite adept at gathering his own personal stash. Adidas pays him Eur4.2m annually in personal
sponsorship, and last year he earned a further Eur4m from Marks Pounds and Spencer and Eur2.8m from
Pepsi, while Vodafone and Brylcreem each forked out Eurl.4m.
THE DAYS AHEAD

Beckham's squeaky clean image has been his greatest asset. Until now, Posh has managed to keep him on the straight and narrow. The happy, successful, good-looking Beckham family has been an advertiser's dream. Getting there meant courting the press to a massive degree and the tabloids have profited handsomely. But, as Charles and Diana found out, marital strife is as lucrative as wedded bliss. It will take more than some PR shots in the snow to keep the hounds at bay.

With road deaths rising once again to pre-penalty-points levels, Transport Minister Seamus Brennan is once again under pressure. Much remains to be done in the area at Government level but, while Irish people continue to drive like lunatics, there is little prospect of any change.
Penalty Points To Penalise Pernicious Drivers
THE DETAILS

From June 1, a conviction for careless driving will automatically incur five penalty points on a driver's licence. Anybody who takes a drive on a national primary route will know that there are plenty of candidates for such a sanction. However, going on experience of the penalty points system thus far, it is unlikely that dangerous drivers will be overly worried. So far, just one driver has been disqualified from driving for six months for accumulating the maximum 12 points (although 117,000 drivers have received penalty points). Last year, the number of road fatalities decreased by 34 to 377 people but most drivers have realised that they are statistically unlikely to get caught speeding so the fatality figure has risen once again.
THE DAYS AHEAD
Justice Minister Michael McDowell has admitted that he will not be able to honour a commitment in the
Programme for Government to establish a separate traffic corps. The gardai are already struggling to cope

Page 71 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
with public order offences and drug-related crime. Policing the EU presidency has only increased that burden. But it is not all bad news. Massive investment of up to Eur10bn in motorways over the next five years is to be augmented by a new programme to upgrade other single carriageway routes. These
"two-plus-one" routes have cut fatalities in other countries and involve an alternating passing lane and a crash barrier.

In the EU's prosecution for breach of  antitrust laws, chief  antitrust enforcer Mario Monti has emerged as a David figure to  Microsoft's Goliath, writes Mark Landler.

When Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, arrived in Brussels in March to negotiate with the European Commission over its antitrust case, lawyers involved in the talks said they believed a settlement was within reach.

TD
But Mario Monti, the Commission's chief  antitrust enforcer, insisted on provisions that would constrain
Microsoft from future practices similar to the bundling of its Media Player into Windows.

Microsoft said a lawyer representing the company in the case, was "absolutely astonished".

Still, he said, Ballmer did not reject the demand outright. After two days of trying to close the gap, however, the company was not willing to expand the scope of the agreement enough to suit Monti.

Monti has stalked plenty of big corporations in his five turbulent years overseeing  antitrust enforcement for the European Union. With his term in Brussels coming to an end this autumn, his latest trophy, Microsoft, is without a doubt his biggest.

The European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft - issued here on March 24 - brands the company as an abusive monopolist, and imposes remedies on it that go much further than those negotiated between Microsoft and the US Justice Department three years ago.

Brussels also hit Microsoft with a fine of Eur497m ($603m), the largest it has ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case. But the money, both sides agree, pales in comparison to the message.


Europe continues to chart an aggressive course in regulating the behaviour of big corporations, despite the more laissez-faire approach in the US under the Bush administration, and despite a series of legal setbacks that many predicted would blunt Monti's aggressive
style.

For Monti - a courtly, silverhaired former economics professor from Milan - the  Microsoft case is also something of a bookend to the Commission's landmark decision in 2001, when it blocked General Electric's (GE) planned $45bn takeover of Honeywell.

That decision, which came after bruising negotiations with GE's former chairman, Jack Welch, and despite intense pressure from Washington, brought Monti sudden notoriety. An obscure European bureaucrat had thwarted one of America's leading industrial empires.

Now, Monti (61) has taken on arguably the leading American technology company, and again refused to settle, despite face-to-face negotiations with Ballmer.

"We wanted a settlement which would set clear principles concerning the future conduct of  Microsoft, to avoid going back to these sort of abuses," Monti said in an interview. "They were not prepared to do this. We had to agree that on this point, we disagreed." Monti's critics said the ruling perpetuated the EU's tendency to take a more restrictive approach to business.
"There is still a broad gulf between  competition policy in Europe and the United States," said William
Kolasky, a former  antitrust official in the Justice Department" who had criticised the GEHoneywell ruling.

Page 73 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"European agencies come from a more corporatist perspective," Kolasky said. "There really is less stomach in Europe for the kind of Darwinian  competition that we've embraced in the United States," he added.

While Monti may take a harder line than American regulators these days, legal experts say he has brought Europe closer to the US in the prosecution of  antitrust cases. "There is a marked convergence," said James F. Rill, a former director of the anti-trust division in the US Justice Department. "That has to be a large part of the legacy of Mario Monti."

None of this mollified  Microsoft, which said the Commission's ruling would stifle innovation and deprive consumers of choices. If the ruling survives legal challenge, the company will be required to offer PC manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system minus its Media Player software.

Microsoft had offered to sell Windows with three rival mediaplayer programs already installed. The company's general counsel, Brad Smith, said that would have resulted in  Microsoft distributing 300 million competing programs a year for the next three years. Monti's muscular performance-on  Microsoft positions him for a prominent future role in Europe, even after his term expires.

HD     Bringing Peace to the Valley; Army of lawyers paved way for historic truce between Sun, Microsoft

The parking lots were empty and the hallways were still as  Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates and his entourage of top executives strolled into the boardroom at Sun Microsystems Inc.

The July 4 gathering was the first time the companies' leaders met face to face to see if they could resolve their differences. Sun's Menlo Park campus, shut down for the holiday, offered a secluded spot for the
top-secret negotiations.

TD
Sun Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy first raised the idea of settling Sun's  antitrust litigation against  Microsoft in a phone call to  Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. And after a round of golf and several phone calls, they'd pulled together a summit meeting.

Ballmer and Microsoft General Counsel Bradford Smith were with Gates at that initial meeting. On the other side of the table sat McNealy, then-General Counsel John Croll and Lee Patch, vice president of legal affairs.

"There was an agenda of topics to consider to see if there was common ground," Patch said in a telephone interview Tuesday. "Each side gave its perspective to see if there was interest in doing something on each topic."

The executives talked for nine more months before reaching a deal, announced at an elaborate press conference in San Francisco last week, that calls for  Microsoft to pay Sun nearly $2 billion to settle litigation, avoid future patent infringement suits, and use Sun's technology. The companies also agreed to collaborate on developing new server software products compatible with each other.
The truce was worked out internally, but only after an army of lawyers helped lay the groundwork. Lloyd "Rusty" Day Jr., of Cupertino's Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder, led a six-year court battle
against Microsoft. "Rusty Day was the Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander-in-chief going into battle
and directing the action," Patch said. "I was in D.C., [serving as] the chief of staff."

In its antitrust suit, Sun alleged that  Microsoft was illegally using its monopoly in the PC operating systems market. Day Casebeer was backed on the battlefield by four other firms: Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal; Clifford Chance; Townsend and Townsend and Crew; and Baltimore's Tydings & Rosenberg.

"When things ramped up, there were about 50 lawyers working on the case," plus 50 to 60 outside contract document reviewers, Day Casebeer partner Robert Galvin told The Recorder during a conference call Tuesday that included Patch and Day Casebeer partner Craig Casebeer.

Microsoft's lead counsel in the litigation was Sullivan & Cromwell partner Steven Holley. Seattle's
Preston Gates & Ellis also jumped in to provide help.

Patch said that after the initial meeting in July, negotiations sputtered along, stopping and starting several times. In late December, talks came to a halt.
"We decided we would never reach an agreement and to go our separate ways," Patch said.

Page 75 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Then in March, representatives of the European Union decided to go ahead and issue a decision on Sun's
antitrust complaint - a decision likely to go against  Microsoft.

"That was the triggering element that allowed the parties to get back together with flexibility and optimism," Patch said. "A few weeks ago things picked up aggressively and we took a number of topics" off the table in order to hammer out a final resolution.

Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp agreed that the European decision "provided greater clarity" about the next steps to take.

As the two companies ramped up discussions, the European Commission announced March 24 that Microsoft had broken the European Union's competition law by abusing its near monopoly in the PC operating system market. The commission fined the software giant $613 million and ordered it to turn over technical information to rivals to allow their competing server software to work smoothly with Windows.

Days later,  Microsoft and Sun began the last leg of negotiations in New York City. The Sun team included Patch, senior lawyer Damien Eastwood and Chief Strategy Officer Mark Tolliver.

The Microsoft line-up consisted of GC Smith; Deputy GC Snapp; attorneys Hossein Nowbar, Nancy Nakayama and David Hayes; Corporate Vice President of Strategy Hank Vigil; and business developer Gene Chellis.

On track to finalize a deal by the end of the week, the two teams flew to New York to work around Smith's schedule. With the dealmakers holed up at the offices of Covington & Burling - which does work for Microsoft and where Smith was once a partner - Smith attended prior commitments, including a speaking engagement at Columbia Law School.

Covington provided a conference room, Internet access and food and drink to the dealmakers, who hauled in their own printers and paper.

After two and a half days of discussion, the negotiators all raced to the airport Thursday afternoon in separate vans and flew back to San Francisco. The Sun team took the company jet - McNealy was in New York too - while the  Microsoft team chartered a plane.

By midnight the two teams had reassembled - this time at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati's Palo Alto headquarters. At 4:22 a.m. a final deal was inked.

Hours later, the CEOs of both companies took the stage to joke about their years of bitter bickering and new collaboration. Behind the scenes, the lawyers marveled at the outcome.

Usually in litigation settlements, one party pays the other and the two part ways. "We didn't part ways," Snapp said. "We not only went into neutral but agreed to collaborate."

Patch said the trust built up by the negotiating teams bodes well for the future as the companies "try to find solutions to other issues that were taken off the table."
For Day Casebeer, the agreement wraps up a war that spurred the formation of the firm itself, back in
1998. Day and four other partners split from Cooley Godward after disputes about staffing Sun matters.
Day and his colleagues first represented Sun in a dispute over Microsoft's licensing of Sun's Java
programming language. That case settled in 2001, and the antitrust complaint was filed the following
year.
Galvin said the case has been a good opportunity for Day Casebeer to develop its  antitrust practice. While the firm has historically been focused on IP and contract disputes, "so many clients have an
intersection of IP and patent and  antitrust issues," he said.
"It's been a wonderful opportunity for us," Casebeer said. "Now we have time to devote to other clients." Senior Writer Brenda Sandburg's e-mail address is bsandburg@therecorder.com.

HD     Monopolists beware EU takes on Microsoft.

It has taken almost a decade for any type of substantial action to be taken against Microsoft's alleged monopolistic behavior, and the world community should congratulate the European Commission's Competition Directorate General for its brave decision to  fine the software giant $610 million for violating antitrust regulations.It took U.S. courts almost seven years to decide that only "behavioral"remedies needed be applied to redress  Microsoft's practices. In the case of  Microsoft versus the U.S. Justice Department, the multinational managed to stall until the Clinton administration was replaced by the more business-friendly George W. Bush.  Microsoft was rumored to have been one of Bush's major financial supporters during his election campaign.

TD
One is left wondering whether it was a coincidence that after Bush came to power at the end of January
2001, the appeals court rejected a breakup of  Microsoft, a solution many believed to be the best way of
thwarting the company's monopolistic tendencies.The U.S. Justice Department's case came about
because of complaints over  Microsoft's inclusion, or "bundling,"of the Internet Explorer Web browser in
its Windows operating system. The legal action against  Microsoft left the company's main competitor in
the area of Web browsers, Netscape, completely crippled. Today, few Thai youths will have heard of
Netscape's legendary Navigator browser, which was a leap forward on the Internet scene when it first
appeared.The EU ruling came about as a result of complaints in February 2000 that  Microsoft was
bundling features in the Windows 2000 operating system. This eventually led to further accusations by the
EU that  Microsoft was blocking competition from Sun Microsystems and other rivals making
audio-visual software. In August 2003, the E.U. ordered  Microsoft to either unbundle its Media Player
from its operating systems or to carry rival software.On March 15, before Microsoft's audio-visual rival
RealNetworks could die like Netscape, the E.U. slapped on the $610-million fine. In addition, the grouping
required Microsoft to release a version of Windows that does not include media-playback functions so
that PC suppliers can opt for whatever software they want. These measures are considered to be
substantial, but they are perhaps not drastic enough.Microsoft has appealed, a strategy which has
proven extremely successful in the past in stalling action, and has often resulted in potentially severe
punishments becoming mere slaps on the wrist. Without jumping to conclusions over the possible
consequences of the EU ruling, it is clear that it has set a precedent. And for once  Microsoft appears to
be troubled by the prospects of having to unbundle its software from its operating system. Indications are
that the company is desperate to fight this ruling. Steve Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, flew to
Brussels for three days of talks but failed to reach a settlement.One can only hope that the ruling survives
the appeal, something that would be a first on its own. Ever since Netscape was driven out of the market,
we simply haven't seen any dramatic innovations in web browsers. When  competition was intense,
upgrades of the web browsers came out every few months to the joy of the common user. One struggles
to think of a unique  Microsoft innovation, despite the fact that it is the richest company in the world and
employs some of the highest-paid software engineers.The case now goes on to the European Court of
First Instance, which is responsible for the bulk of cases relating to  competition policy. The trend in the
European Court of Justice's jurisprudence has been to strengthen the commission's powers. In general,
the court has supported the commission's decisions. If the EU's ruling sticks, multinational firms with
monopolistic tendencies will stand up and take notice of the EU as an international entity. After all, the
grouping will have succeeded in setting a precedent that the Americans themselves have failed to do.

Coca-Cola shareholders were urged by Institutional Shareholder Services to withhold votes for billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett for reelection to the beverage giant's board, and to support a proposal to separate the company's chairman and chief executive positions. Institutional Shareholder Services argues that Buffett can't be considered an independent director because of ties between Coca-Cola and some of his outside business interests. Buffet is on the board of The Washington Post Co., to which Coca-Cola paid advertising fees.

AMSTERDAM -- RealNetworks Inc. says it has held exploratory talks with computer makers about the impact of a landmark ruling by the  European Commission that could help boost the adoption of its media player.

Chief executive Rob Glaser, who is in Europe to announce European versions of the latest music and video player, said this week that RealNetworks was growing despite tough  competition from rival Microsoft.

TD
The Commission two weeks ago  fined Microsoft for abusing its dominance in the market and ordered it to open its server software and dominant personal computer software to give rivals such as RealNetworks a better chance to compete.

"We've grown our business six quarters in a row in the personal computer content and services area, and the number of RealPlayers is higher than it has ever been. This is a long-term growth market," Glaser said in a telephone interview.

At the moment  Microsoft includes its own media player in its Windows operating system, which is used to run almost all PCs. RealNetworks has to convince consumers to download its Real Player over the Internet and also change default settings. Only then can consumers start buying music and video from Real.

Glaser, whose customers include Virgin Radio, BT and soccer body UEFA, hopes the ruling will open up the wider computer market even though it applied only to the European Union.

RealNetworks made a $5.3 million (U.S.) fourth-quarter loss on 17 per cent higher revenues of $54.1 million, partly because of large legal fees in its  antitrust lawsuits against  Microsoft.

"In a few very preliminary talks with computer makers we've discussed options ... Europe is the first jurisdiction to rule on this," Glaser said, adding the ruling could set PC makers on a new course.

With its latest media player, RealNetworks is positioning itself as a company that can play most of the different Internet media formats, including piracy-protected music from Web stores such as Apple's iTunes Music Store,  Microsoft's MSN Music Club and Sony Corp.'s Connect.

He said the fragmentation seen in the computer field probably would not be repeated in the mobile phone industry, which RealNetworks is targeting as the next big growth opportunity.

All handset makers and wireless telecommunications operators are working together on a single and open media format in a group called Open Mobile Alliance. "For the PC we used software to
integrate all digital rights management systems. In a mobile phone there's not so much (memory)

space, so the industry has to work together. The mobile industry is doing the right thing. It will lead the way," Glaser said.
RealNetworks has signed deals with handset makers such as Nokia and mobile operators such as
Vodafone to use its software to stream music and video to mobile phones.

HD         Microsoft appeal is due in June.

The countdown to  Microsoft's next battle with the  European Commission has begun, with the company's appeal against Brussels'  antitrust decision due by early June.

At the same time  Microsoft will ask a European court to suspend the Commission's demands for it to share information with its rivals and offer a version of Windows without its Media Player program. Brussels also fined Microsoft E497m ($601m).

TD
A court ruling on the suspension request is likely between July and September and could shape the fate of Microsoft products during the half decade the case may take to decide. It could also affect a
separate Commission investigation of its Windows XP operating system.

If the Commission's current ruling is prevented from taking immediate effect, Brussels is likely to be much more cautious in pursuing the wider-ranging XP case. But if  Microsoft fails in its suspension request, the Commission could be on track to wind up the XP case in about two years.

Microsoft officially received Brussels' ruling that it had abused its Windows virtual monopoly on Monday
March 29.

Under European Union rules, it has two months and 10 days from that date to appeal against the ruling to the EU's Court of First Instance - which means its submission is due by June 8.

The appeal as a whole may not be decided until 2009. But the suspension request can be ruled on relatively speedily by Bo Vesterdorf, the president of the court.

Mr Vesterdorf can call for an oral hearing, which is not necessary in the EU's document-heavy judicial process, but may be considered helpful for such an important issue. Such a step could slow him down, but the judge may be willing to decide on the suspension request during the August holiday.

Microsoft is likely to argue that it is uniquely damaging for a company to reveal its inner workings and to produce a "defective" product such as Windows without the Media Player program.

Commission officials contend that  Microsoft's recent deal with Sun Microsystems revealed its willingness to share information with some rivals and add that the Commission ruling takes pains not to hamper Windows' basic functions. Once  Microsoft has asked for a suspension, it will not have to comply with the Commission demands before the request is decided.

But one Commission deadline looms before then. The company has to inform the Commission how it plans to share interface information with its rivals within 60 days of the Commission decision - or by late May in this case. However, it may simply ask for an extension.

Mr Vesterdorf has indicated in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires that he might be prepared to help the companies agree an interim arrangement ahead of the final verdict in the case.

In some previous cases the Commission has extended its deadlines in return for its opponent simplifying its case and the court putting the case on "fast track" - with a decision in nine months or a year.
However, due to its complexity, few participants in the  Microsoft case believe it is suited to fast track.

You can buy your way out of any situation. Or so  Microsoft Corp. has demonstrated yet again. Over the years, the software giant has toyed with various opponents -- Digital Research, WordPerfect, Corel, Caldera. In a surprising number of these cases, it ended up disguised as a "white knight," eliminating its competition through legal agreements and strategic injections of cash -- "go away" money, in effect. And the competing products are what do the "going." Now there's a settlement between Sun Microsystems
and Microsoft -- a "cooperating agreement," Sun called it.  Microsoft pays Sun, which has been struggling, about $2 billion.  Microsoft is clear about its world view: one world, one operating system, one vendor. For years, Sun claimed that it believed in alternative operating systems, such as Linux, alongside its own products. That's why the settlement with  Microsoft leaves such a confusing impression.

TD
Like those other beneficiaries of  Microsoft's largess before it, Sun has stepped onto the slippery slope to oblivion, a company with a temporarily fat wallet but no coherent vision. In the old days, Sun frequently, correctly and emphatically labeled  Microsoft an unrepentant monopolist. The softened rhetoric of recent months should have warned us. In buying Sun's silence,  Microsoft has effectively disposed of another competitor. In Europe and elsewhere, however, things are not going so smoothly for  Microsoft. Local and regional governments are ripping up expensive Microsoft licenses and mandating free and open-source software -- Linux, BSD, Open Office and so on. The European Commission has fined Microsoft $613 million for monopolizing the media-player market by bundling its own media player with Windows. Remember the browser wars of the late 20th century? Because of  Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior back then, it's taken years for competing browsers -- such as lightning-fast Opera and the powerful
Mozilla -- to gain a foothold. The successful European digital media-player case against Microsoft could benefit Real Networks. Real has brought a similar suit here in the United States. When Microsoft was formed, young Bill Gates explained to the first group of employees that everything would go well if it was understood that he was in charge. When he unveiled his vision of "a computer on every desk and in every home," it wasn't clear that he also meant "running only our software." Like all mature empires,  Microsoft knows the end is in sight. The real enemy -- Linux, BSD and the open-source philosophy -- is eating away at its future revenues. Alternative office software and browsers have achieved parity with  Microsoft Office and almost equal ease of installation. The tipping point approaches. But for the moment, these products are really the expressions of a movement and a philosophy -- not corporations with enough cash to take
on Microsoft. Real Networks may have won in Europe, but you can be sure that someone at  Microsoft is muttering: "Let's get Real." Malcolm Dean is a broadcast journalist and information technology consultant.

HD          Microsoft Strikes New Patent Accord  --- Payment of $440 Million  To InterTrust Clears Way For
Antipiracy Software
BY          By Don Clark
WC        848 words

CY         (Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LP
In the latest in a series of moves to clear up legal issues,  Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay $440 million to InterTrust Technologies Corp. to settle a broad patent suit that had cast a cloud over Microsoft's plans in digital media.

The deal gives the software giant a license to InterTrust's large portfolio of patents in technology for protecting music, movies and other digital content against unauthorized copying.

TD
Stopping unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material has been a pressing issue for media concerns ever since the early days of Napster and similar Internet services that opened the way to freely swapping music. New legal download services, such as Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes Music Store, use "digital rights management," or DRM, technology to limit the number of copies that can be made from a song the consumer purchases. DRM technology is also essential to plans by the movie industry to
begin distributing high-definition movies on disks and over the Internet, without fear of losing sales to piracy.

Microsoft has been trying to convince music and movie companies to use its digital-media software, which includes antipiracy technology. InterTrust's patent suit against the company, filed in April 2001, raised the possibility that  Microsoft customers might have to pay royalties to InterTrust for use of such features.

As a result of the deal, customers generally won't be required to license InterTrust patents for using Microsoft software, though they may need to seek a license if they combine it with other technology to create new products.

Microsoft has been spending freely to settle outstanding court cases. In its biggest deal to date, the company on April 2 agreed to pay Sun Microsystems Inc. $1.95 billion as part of a settlement that ended Sun's  antitrust suit against  Microsoft. Though  antitrust cases have made most of the headlines, the company also has been named since 1998 in at least 35 patent suits.

Last May, Microsoft reached a settlement with Time Warner Inc. over  Microsoft's alleged tactics against the Netscape Communications business acquired by Time Warner's America Online unit. Also last year, Microsoft agreed to pay $35 million to settle a suit filed by Immersion Corp. over technology that allows joysticks and other devices to move along with action in a game or other software. Microsoft last month agreed to settle a patent suit filed by AT&T Corp. over voice-recognition technology; financial terms weren't disclosed.

Of course,  Microsoft, which had more than $50 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of December, continues to fight many of its legal challenges, including the long-running antitrust case in Europe. Last month, the  European Commission, in addition to leveling a $614 million fine against Microsoft, ordered the company to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player program. Microsoft is appealing the ruling.



Page 89 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the settlement with InterTrust furthers  Microsoft's aim of defining digital-media formats and DRM technology, giving the software giant important influence about how home gadgets evolve and work with one another.
The deal is also a boost to InterTrust, a Silicon Valley company that was purchased for $453 million in
2002 by a joint venture of Sony Corp., Philips Electronics NV and Stephens Inc., an investment-banking
company based in Little Rock, Ark. Besides the cash infusion, the settlement could strengthen
InterTrust's hand in seeking licensing deals from other companies for DRM technology.

"The floodgates are now open," said Talal Shamoon, InterTrust's chief executive. "I think you will see very rapid adoption of DRM technology."

Will Poole, a  Microsoft senior vice president, said the InterTrust licenses augment his company's own intellectual property as well as patents that  Microsoft had licensed from ContentGuard, a start-up spun off from Xerox Corp. He argued that all the patent rights give  Microsoft advantages over competitors in digital media, such as Apple Computer and RealNetworks Inc.

InterTrust, founded in 1990 by entrepreneur Victor Shear, went public during the Internet boom and swelled to 360 employees. But the Santa Clara, Calif., company failed to commercialize its DRM software and retrenched sharply, switching from selling products to licensing its 30 U.S. patents. It now has just 32 employees.

Mr. Poole acknowledged the breadth of InterTrust's patent portfolio, which he said stretched beyond digital media to cover products such as a file-protection feature in a recent version of  Microsoft Office.

Microsoft came close to investing more than $100 million in InterTrust during a series of licensing negotiations between 1998 and the end of 2000. Those talks broke down, and InterTrust sued Microsoft in federal court in Oakland, Calif., for allegedly infringing 11 patents with Windows and other popular products.  Microsoft denied the allegations and filed counterclaims. A judge last summer pressured the two companies to begin settlement talks.

(Adds Microsoft comments, details, byline; previous NEW YORK))

SEATTLE, April 12 (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp. will pay InterTrust Technologies Corp. $440 million to settle a lawsuit over anti-piracy technology for digital files, music and movies, the companies said on Monday.

TD
The agreement is the latest move by the world's largest software maker to resolve its legal disputes, after it agreed earlier this month to pay longtime rival Sun Microsystems Inc. $2 billion to end an antitrust battle.

Microsoft, which was hit with a $600 million  antitrust fine by the European Commission in March, faces tougher questions over its growing $53 billion cash pile, which the company has said it needs as a safeguard against numerous legal disputes.

By acquiring the right to use InterTrust's digital rights management technology and settle outstanding litigation,  Microsoft said consumers and businesses will see more digital content being distributed over its Windows, Office, media player and other software products.
"We will be able to work with more businesses and governments, unleashing a torrent of content," said
Will Poole, the senior vice president in charge of  Microsoft's Windows desktop business.

The settlement is a windfall for InterTrust, which is owned by an investment group led by Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics. It follows on the heels of an investment that  Microsoft made in another digital rights technology provider, ContentGuard, last week.

Microsoft shares were up 16 cents to $25.64 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.

Content providers, especially movie studios, have been reluctant to distribute their content in digital form after seeing how digital copying and distribution has led to weaker CD sales for music companies.

Microsoft also says digital rights technology has wider applications, such as protecting medical, legal and business information stored in digital form.

Under the terms of the deal,  Microsoft will be able to use InterTrust's patented technology in its products and all outstanding legal action between the companies is resolved.

Santa Clara, California-based InterTrust, a pioneer of software used to control digital distribution rights for media products ranging from software to music, sued  Microsoft three years ago.

"Today's announcement validates InterTrust's intellectual property portfolio as seminal to advancing DRM and trusted computing in the marketplace," said Talal Shamoon, chief executive officer of InterTrust. (Additional reporting by Daniel Sorid and Chris Sanders in New York).

This month,  Microsoft agreed to pay longtime rival Sun Microsystems Inc. $2 billion to end an antitrust battle and in March, a $600 million  antitrust fine was levied on Microsoft by the European Commission.

Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox said that the legal settlements reflect the efforts of  Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, and general counsel, Brad Smith, to put the company's legal issues to rest.

"This current leadership is trying to get beyond these legal problems and get moving," said Wilcox. "The one common thing in these settlements is that they all carry some benefit for  Microsoft."

The latest settlement is also a windfall for InterTrust, which is owned by an investment group led by Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics and also follows on the heels of an investment  Microsoft made in another digital rights technology provider ContentGuard last week.

HD      South Korean Internet portal files anti-trust suit against  Microsoft

SEOUL, April 12 (AFP) -

South Korea's top Internet portal filed an anti-trust suit Monday against US software giant  Microsoft, alleging it broke fair trade rules by bundling its instant messenger service with its Windows XP platform.

TD
"We have just filed the lawsuit against  Microsoft," Park Hyun-Jung, a Daum Communications Corp. official, told AFP after emerging from the Seoul district court.

The 10 billion won (8.8 million dollars) suit followed last month's  European Commission fine of 500 million euros on Microsoft for bundling audio-video software into its operating system.

The suit was the latest development in Daum's attempts to block the sale of  Microsoft's Windows XP operating system in South Korea, the world's broadband Internet leader, where about 70 percent of households have broadband connections.
Daum filed a complaint with the South Korean anti-trust watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission, in 2001.

Microsoft disputed Daum's anti-trust charge, saying the use of its instant messenger system depended on consumers as they must download it, meaning they are under no obligation to use the service, Microsoft Korea spokesman Seo Min-Seog said.

"It s difficult to comment on a case that is being investigated by the FTC. We are waiting for the results of the investigation," he said.

Analysts see Daum's legal action as a strategic move to secure a better position against the US software giant.

Daum, the country's biggest portal with 35 million registered users for its free e-mail service, competes with Microsft in South Korea's booming instant messaging market.

The Internet company provides South Korea's most popular service for online communities, known here as "cafes."
In its suit, Daum accused Microst of illegally using Windows to control markets in operating systems. Daum's chief executive officer Lee Jae-Woong said in a statement that the suit is designed to establish "a
fair trade environment by correcting  Microsoft's practices hurting fair  competition.

"Microsoft is using its monopolistic status in the computer operating system market, expanding its monopoly into the instant messaging market to drive out its comeptitors and disrupting fair trade," Lee said.

Daum said that its domestic market share in instant messenger services fell sharply to 6.4 percent as of April 2003 from 20.3 percent in August 2001, while  Microsoft's share rose to 75.5 percent from 29.4 percent.


Page 95 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Although the basic instant messenger service is provided free, it can generate profitable Internet business such as a short-messaging service, music downloading and online shopping, Daum said.
Analysts said Daum is in a strong legal position, considering the recent ruling by the EU against
Microsoft and its Windows Media Player.

"The two cases are similar in nature and thus it seems Daum has some chance (of winning)," said LG Investment Securities analyst Lee Wang-Sang.

The instant messenger service has potential to become a major source of income over time although it yields limited revenue now, he said.

"Daum's decision appears to be a strategic move to secure a better position against the world's most powerful player in the sector," he said.
The court process is expected to take months, he said. jkw-lim/cw/bmm

But open-source software is eating into its revenues
YOU can buy your way out of any situation. Or so  Microsoft Corp has demonstrated yet again.

TD
Over the years, the software giant has toyed with various opponents - Digital Research, WordPerfect, Corel, Caldera. In a surprising number of these cases, it ended up disguised as a 'white knight', eliminating its  competition through legal agreements and strategic injections of cash - 'go away' money, in effect. And the competing products are what do the 'going'.

Now there's a settlement between Sun Microsystems and  Microsoft - a 'cooperating agreement', Sun called it.  Microsoft pays Sun, which has been struggling, about US$2 billion.  Microsoft is clear about its worldview: one world, one operating system, one vendor.

For years, Sun claimed that it believed in alternative operating systems, such as Linux, alongside its own products. That's why the settlement with  Microsoft leaves such a confusing impression. Like other beneficiaries of  Microsoft's largess before it, Sun has stepped onto the slippery slope to oblivion, a company with a temporarily fat wallet but no coherent vision.

In the old days, Sun frequently, correctly and emphatically labelled  Microsoft an unrepentant monopolist. The softened rhetoric of recent months should have warned us. In buying Sun's silence, Microsoft has effectively disposed of another competitor.

In Europe and elsewhere, however, things are not going so smoothly for  Microsoft. Local and regional governments are ripping up expensive  Microsoft licences and mandating free and open-source software - Linux, BSD, Open Office and so on. The  European Commission has fined Microsoft US$613 million for monopolising the media-player market by bundling its own media player with Windows.

Remember the browser wars of the late 20th century? Because of  Microsoft's anti-competitive behaviour back then, it's taken years for competing browsers - such as lightning-fast Opera and the powerful Mozilla - to gain a foothold.

The successful European digital media-player case against  Microsoft could benefit Real Networks. Real has brought a similar suit in the United States.

When Microsoft was formed, young Bill Gates explained to the first group of employees that everything would go well if it was understood that he was in charge. When he unveiled his vision of 'a computer on every desk and in every home', it wasn't clear that he also meant 'running only our software'.

Like all mature empires,  Microsoft knows the end is in sight. The real enemy - Linux, BSD and the open-source philosophy - is eating away at its future revenues. Alternative office software and browsers have achieved parity with  Microsoft Office and almost equal ease of installation. The tipping point approaches.

But for the moment, these products are really the expressions of a movement and a philosophy - not corporations with enough cash to take on  Microsoft. Real Networks may have won in Europe, but you can be sure that someone at  Microsoft is muttering: 'Let's get Real.' - LAT-WP

Samuel Len of the International Herald Tribune reported from Seoul: *

Daum Communications, the largest Internet portal in South Korea, filed a 10 billion won, or $8.8 million, lawsuit Monday against  Microsoft, claiming the software giant's bundling of its instant messaging service with its Windows XP platform violated the country's  antitrust regulations.

TD
Microsoft has caused significant damage to Daum, the South Korean company said. By using its dominance in PC operating systems,  Microsoft is excluding rivals from Internet messenger markets.

Daum, which filed the compensatory lawsuit at the Seoul District Court, said its share of South Korea's instant messaging market fell to 9.6 percent last year from around 20 percent in 2001.

In contrast,  Microsoft's share of the instant messaging market rose to more than 60 percent from around 20 percent in the same period, Daum said.

Last month, the  European Commission imposed a 500 million, or $604 million,  fine on Microsoft for bundling its audio- and video- playing software, called MediaPlayer with Windows.

Daum filed a complaint in 2001 with the South Korean Fair Trade Commission regarding  Microsoft's bundling of its instant messaging software. That investigation has not been completed.

Microsoft has run into competition concerns recently in Japan, too. The Fair Trade Commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices on Feb. 26. A commission official said then that  Microsoft had been suspected of setting unfair conditions in deals with Japanese companies.

Microsoft Korea said it had not had an opportunity to fully review the suit, but added it had not violated any regulations involving fair  competition.

The country's largest Internet portal, Daum Communications Corp., launched a 10 billion won ($9 million) antitrust lawsuit against  Microsoft yesterday, demanding that the U.S. software giant exclude the Windows Messenger software from its Windows XP operating system."Microsoft continues to  abuse their market dominance in computer operating systems by bundling the Windows Messenger into their Windows XP software, which apparently is a violation of antitrust law. Daum Communications suffered significant losses with its instant messaging services due to Microsoft's unlawful actions," said the company in the lawsuit filed with the Seoul Central District Court against  Microsoft and its Korean
branch Microsoft Korea.Daum's lawsuit is an extension of its 2001 complaint filed with the Fair Trade
Commission, when the company first protested the bundling of Messenger with Windows XP.

TD
The FTC has not yet made a ruling on the issue."We believe that the legal actions against  Microsoft's antitrust violations would help recover fair  competition in the local industry, where Internet portals such as Daum and other software companies have suffered under a disadvantage," said Park Hyun-jeong of Daum's public relations bureau. Company officials declined to release the details of the financial losses they claim in the lawsuit.  Microsoft Korea did not release an official response to Daum's lawsuit yesterday.Microsoft first bundled Windows Messenger into its Windows XP operating system in June
2001 to tighten the integration between instant-message software and operating system, in order to give them a competitive edge over competitors such as AOL Time Warner of the U.S., whose AOL Instant Messenger service gained worldwide popularity.Microsoft had already been providing instant-message services with their MSN Messenger program, which could be downloaded online. The software giant used similar tactics to success in the past, such as when they linked Internet Explorer with Windows 95
and dominated the Web-browsing software market. Daum has been offering its instant-message services since 2000.The lawsuit comes less than a month after the  European Commission fined Microsoft for a record 497 million euros ($600 million) for  antitrust violations and ordered them to exclude Windows Media Player from their Windows operating system and make available some of the operating system's source code. Microsoft is expected to appeal against the commission's ruling.Daum is the country's largest Internet portal with more than 35 million subscribers. The company reported more than 141 billion won in reveune last year.(thkim@heraldm.com).

Korea's Daum Communications on Monday filed a 10 billion won ($8.8 million) lawsuit against
Microsoft for allegedly violating the nation's anti-trust law.

Daum contended that  Microsoft and its Korean affiliate violated fair-trade regulations by bundling the Windows XP operating system with the instant messaging program MSN Messenger.

TD
``We decided to bring  Microsoft to court because it has tried to extend its monopolistic position to the instant messaging market by illegally banking on its operating system's strong foothold,'' Daum spokesperson Park Hyun-jung said.

Microsoft has committed foul play and such anti-competitive activities should not recur as they hurt Korean consumers rights to select applications on their own, she added.
This is not the first time that Daum took issue of  Microsoft's business activities in Korea. Back in
2001, the portal site made a complaint with the Fair Trade Commission regarding the bundling of
MSN Messenger and the anti-trust agency is still investigating the case.

Market analysts said Daum's suit might be encouraged by the latest decision of European authorities who ruled in favor of local entities in a suit against  Microsoft for grouping its operating system with Windows Media Player.

Earlier last month, the European Commission, a regulatory unit of the European Union, slapped fines of 500 million euros on Microsoft for riding the wave Window's popularity to control the audio and video software market.

When Microsoft Korea, the software giant's affiliate, was contacted, they said they had yet to fully review the suit but claimed they had not committed any wrongdoings.

``We believe Microsoft's actions have been fairly consistent with Korean competition laws. There is robust competition in the Korean instant messenger market and that competition continues to be a good thing for Korean consumers,'' Seo Min-seong, public relations manager of Microsoft Korea, said.

HD       Microsoft's long-playing business record;  Have courtroom battles become just another business expense for the software  giant?

The antitrust investigation into  Microsoft's activities lasted nearly half a decade, but by the time regulators finally came to a landmark conclusion,  Microsoft had already established its position and the rival product was all but defunct.

The European Union's ruling against  Microsoft last month? Or was that the outcome to the case involving Netscape? Neither: Try Novell's suit over the DR-DOS operating system in 1994, which followed four years of investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. Since that first serious brush with regulators,  Microsoft has been perpetually in and out of court, accruing fines and settlement payments in the billions of dollars.

TD
Losing or settling case after case,  Microsoft has tested the bounds of  antitrust and patent infringement law, with little evidence that its power has waned or that its behavior has been substantially changed. Rivals and many legal experts say  antitrust law itself has come out the worse for the skirmishes, while Microsoft appears to have built the ongoing scrutiny, fines and remedies into a strategy showing scant sign of reform. Even last month's tough stance by the European Commission may not be able to slow the giant.

"I can't see how (the courts) have learned," said Marc Schildkraut, an antitrust attorney at Howrey & Simon in Washington, D.C., who led the FTC's early 1990s investigation of Microsoft's business practices. "They're confronting problems (on a case-by-case basis) that they haven't been able to solve in any meaningful way."

A decade of investigations and lawsuits involving  Microsoft's business practices has outlined a pattern of high-pressure business deals and unceasing expansionary aims. The company's core strategy has been to make its OS--MS-DOS, then Windows--as ubiquitous as possible, while continually adding features that often started off as separate products developed outside  Microsoft. In some cases, rivals have charged abuse of market, while others have claimed  Microsoft has infringed on their patented technology without payments.

For years, the company has settled most of these complaints, while staunchly defending its right to add new features to its products. In 2003, the price tag for these court actions skyrocketed close to $2 billion. The agreement with Sun Microsystems earlier this month added another $1.6 billion ($700 million to settle antitrust claims and $900 million over patent claims). And Monday's settlement with InterTrust
over patent infringement charges tacked on $440 million.

None of this has appeared to be a significant financial drain on a company with more than $52 billion in cash and short-term investments. Some experts say the costs have simply become a part of doing business for the company.

"If you incur a  fine of a billion dollars, but it protects that monopoly, that might be worth it from a pure dollars-and-cents perspective," said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business, who once testified for the Justice Department in its case against  Microsoft. "What's the Windows franchise worth?"

So far, shareholders have been mute, but the stock has traded in a tight range as  Microsoft continues to write one nine-digit check after another. The company's shares now trade at about $25, essentially

unchanged from a year ago. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has climbed about 40 percent in 12 months, though the Nasdaq tumbled much further during the tech bust than  Microsoft did.

A Microsoft spokesman said the company has changed its behavior, particularly after the settlement with the U.S. government, however. The company has since instituted extensive training and a legal review process before new products are released, the spokesman said.

"I think throughout (the company's life), we have worked very hard to conduct ourselves in a way that is fully compliant with all laws and regulations,"  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said.

But what exactly is compliance? In a recent interview with CNET News.com,  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer explained that the consent decree with the Department of Justice "says we can do, from a product design standpoint, most anything we think is appropriate. But we have to do it with certain obligations for flexibility, publishing, etc. Between the district court and the appellate court, there is some notion of what they call a 'rule of reason'--that is, what we are doing has to be better for consumers than it is bad for competitors."

Asked whether the "rule of reason" test would have prevented  Microsoft from bundling the browser, the issue at the heart of the Justice Department's  antitrust lawsuit, Ballmer was adamant: "I would still integrate a browser. We would still integrate the Media Player...Nobody ever said the browser did not meet the rule-of-reason test. It absolutely met the rule-of-reason test to go in."

While Ballmer is correct that no court ever said the browser bundling failed the rule-of-reason test, it must be noted that no court has ever had the opportunity to weigh the issue. In dismissing the original verdict against  Microsoft, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the lower court had misjudged  antitrust law, and that the so-called rule of reason should be applied to  Microsoft's efforts to bundle the browser with Windows.

However, the Department of Justice soon afterward dropped the portion of the case dealing with "tying" the browser. Thus, that test of reason was never applied in the courtroom.
Adding features, building 'moats'

In a 1997 e-mail to investor Warren Buffett, senior  Microsoft executive Jeff Raikes summarized the company's strategy in simple terms. The operating system is the core business, and others are "moats" that protect it, he wrote. The Office software, the Web businesses, and other feature additions served as layers of protection for the company's core product, as well as potential profit centers, he said.

"If we own the key 'franchises' built on top of the operating system, we dramatically widen the 'moat' that protects the operating system business," Raikes wrote. "If I owned the most successful daily newspaper in Buffalo, I wouldn't want to leave it to my competitor to own the Sunday edition."

Microsoft's recent statements have made it clear that it is set on continuing to widen those moats via other features and businesses, despite the growing pressure of  fines and judgments. Here are a few examples of what  Microsoft now refers to as "integrated innovation" that could become fodder for future court skirmishes:

â¢  Search--In a widely covered recent speech, CEO Steve Ballmer conceded that the company was late to recognizing the importance of Internet and data searching. He reiterated earlier statements that Microsoft is building its own new search engine to be added into the next version of Windows, bringing it in close competition with current leaders Google and Yahoo.

â¢  Gaming--The company continues to subsidize heavy losses on the Xbox game console, while trying to catch up to leader Sony.  Microsoft recently released new tools that would let game developers streamline an increasingly expensive production process by using the same components for PC and Xbox games.

â¢  Mobile phones--The company has tried with little success for a decade to move into the mobile phone OS business. But recent product releases from Motorola and AT&T have some worried that the company is finally gaining traction, aided by the high-powered phones' ability to tap into corporate Outlook e-mail servers.

Microsoft has argued consistently in court that it must add new features to its products simply by virtue of being in the fast-paced software business. If the company doesn't consistently innovate, it will be out of business itself, its executives say publicly and in the internal e-mails that have come to light in the course of various trials.

In response, several respected economists have argued in articles and books that  Microsoft's dominance in succeeding markets has come because it creates high-quality products that consumers choose in the marketplace.

Indeed, many close observers say the company's developers do not have  antitrust on their minds when they're trying to improve their products.

"I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that when managers are deciding what features to put inside products, they are not considering  antitrust issues unless it is in a very narrow area covered by the DOJ settlement," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on  Microsoft, a research firm that closely
covers the company.
Has the EU really changed anything?

Some believe that the European Union decision last month, if upheld, will be the first one to put serious constraints on  Microsoft's actions in these new areas.
In contrast to the U.S. Appeals Court, which set rules for analyzing Microsoft's bundling but did not
issue a final opinion on its legality, the Europeans said they thought Microsoft's addition of Media Player
to the operating system had clearly crossed a line. They ordered a version of Windows to be produced
without it. This doesn't directly affect future products, but some believe it will serve as enough of a
precedent that  Microsoft will be more careful.

"This will make them have to think harder about when and how they bundle," said Bob Kimball, general counsel for multimedia software company RealNetworks, which is suing  Microsoft for $1 billion on its own antitrust charge. "It will make regulators quicker to go after them for future bundling activity."

Others aren't so sure. According to statements from Ballmer and European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, settlement talks failed over issues dealing with future products. Had that settlement been struck, a process might have been put in place to deal quickly with future complaints about bundled products.

"They wanted to go beyond the specific issues in this case to try to create a precedent that would govern our ability to include new features into future versions of Windows," Ballmer wrote in a March 18 e-mail
to employees. "While this is not the outcome we wanted, it is an outcome that I am confident will ultimately work out for the best."

Ballmer's "best" could mean that future issues will also have to be independently investigated and litigated, a process that often has taken a half-decade or more. That has typically given  Microsoft enough time to solidly establish itself in the new markets, often with lethal effect on competitors, some observers say.

"In the case of Standard Oil or the rail industry, those markets developed over decades," Berkeley's Shapiro said. "But what can happen in two or three years in the software industry is much more significant in terms of market structure and irreversibility than was the case with oil in 1895."

"Government is really not equipped to regulate in such a fast-moving industry as technology," Rosoff added. "That's why the most aggressive  antitrust commentators originally pressed for the breakup of the company."

What's new:

Losing or settling case after case,  Microsoft has tested the bounds of  antitrust and patent infringement law, with little evidence that its power has waned or that its behavior has been substantially changed.
Bottom line:

Microsoft appears to have built the ongoing scrutiny, fines and remedies into a strategy showing scant sign of reform. Even last month's tough stance by the European Commission may not be able to slow the company as it heads for additional showdowns with new adversaries.

The National Taxpayers Union and 10 other groups in the United States and Europe on Monday urged European regulators to reverse their recent  antitrust ruling against Microsoft's business behavior in European markets. After five years of deliberations, the European Commission decided March 24 that Microsoft violated European Union  competition policy and fined the company about $613 million. But in an "open letter" to the commission, the groups argued that the case against  Microsoft has been nothing but "a boon for the legal profession" that has unnecessarily cost taxpayers money. The case also has cost investors by undermining the value of "stock portfolios on both sides of the Atlantic," the letter said.
Groups from Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Sweden signed the letter.

HD            Microsoft settles InterTrust suit for $440 million

Microsoft Corp. will pay InterTrust Technologies Corp. $440 million to settle a lawsuit over anti-piracy technology for digital files, music and movies, the companies said on Monday.

By acquiring the right to use InterTrust's digital rights management (DRM) technology and settle outstanding litigation, the world's largest software maker said that consumers and businesses will see more digital content being distributed over its Windows, Office, Media Player and other software products.

TD
"We will be able to work with more businesses and governments, unleashing a torrent of content," said
Will Poole, the senior vice president in charge of  Microsoft's Windows desktop business.

The Redmond, Washington-based software maker has been steadily resolving its legal disputes as it faces tougher questions over its growing $53 billion cash pile, which the company has said it needs as a safeguard against its numerous legal disputes.

This month,  Microsoft agreed to pay longtime rival Sun Microsystems Inc. $2 billion to end an antitrust battle and in March, a $600 million  antitrust fine was levied on Microsoft by the European Commission.

Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox said that the legal settlements reflect the efforts of  Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, and general counsel, Brad Smith, to put the company's legal issues to rest.

"This current leadership is trying to get beyond these legal problems and get moving," said Wilcox. "The one common thing in these settlements is that they all carry some benefit for  Microsoft."

The latest settlement is also a windfall for InterTrust, which is owned by an investment group led by Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics and also follows on the heels of an investment  Microsoft made in another digital rights technology provider ContentGuard last week.

Microsoft shares closed up 13 cents at $25.64 on Nasdaq.
PIRACY CONCERNS

Content providers, especially movie studios, have been reluctant to distribute their content in digital form, after seeing how digital copying and distribution have coincided with weaker CD sales.

Microsoft also says that digital rights technology has wider applications, such as protecting medical, legal and business information stored in digital form.

Under the terms of the deal,  Microsoft will be able to use InterTrust's patented technology in its products and resolves all outstanding legal action between the companies.

"There's no question this removes a barrier to widespread (digital rights) adoption," said Jupiter's Wilcox, adding that it would be a while until most end-users see changes in the availability or distribution of digital content.

Santa Clara, California-based InterTrust, a pioneer of software used to control digital distribution rights for media ranging from software to music, sued  Microsoft three years ago.

SEATTLE -- By agreeing on Monday to pay InterTrust Technologies $440 million to settle a long-running patent-infringement lawsuit,  Microsoft advanced on two strategic fronts.

The software giant brought closure to another resource-sapping legal dispute. It also added a potent weapon to use against its most threatening rival, the open-source-code Linux movement.

TD
InterTrust's 3-year-old lawsuit accused  Microsoft of 144 counts of infringing on patents for anti-piracy technology, known as digital rights management, or DRM. By agreeing to license InterTrust's DRM patents,  Microsoft can now move freely to develop software that restricts illegal sharing of digital music, movies and games.

The deal comes 10 days after  Microsoft agreed to a $1.95 billion settlement with Sun Microsystems. As part of that deal, the tech giants agreed to license each other's computer server patents for years to come. Last month,  Microsoft strove to settle a 5-year-old European Commission antitrust lawsuit. But settlement talks failed, and the EC hit  Microsoft with a $613 million fine and business practice restrictions, which the company is appealing.

"Microsoft clearly wants a clean slate," says Laura DiDio, tech industry analyst at the Yankee Group. "You can't go full speed ahead on all of your initiatives with lawsuits as sandbags around your ankles."

Microsoft has also quietly gained a big advantage over Linux, the computing system created and continually improved by volunteers, analysts say. Linux has become the fastest-growing software for computer servers used to build corporate networks. It recently has begun spreading to desktop PCs, a market Microsoft dominates.

But by getting its patents in order,  Microsoft reinforces a distinct advantage over Linux.  Microsoft tightly controls its proprietary code, while Linux taps ideas from hundreds of sources. That has triggered accusations of copyright violations from a tiny Utah software maker, SCO Group, for copyright
violations.

Microsoft can now tout its ability to insulate tech buyers against future copyright challenges. The company appears to be setting itself up "as the big intellectual property protector," says Matt Rosoff, analyst at research firm Directions on  Microsoft.

Marshall Phelps,  Microsoft deputy general counsel, says the software maker aims to "provide peace of mind for our customers and partners."
Challenges for Linux

While Linux isn't dealing specifically with anti-piracy coding issues now, it generally remains stuck under a darkening copyright cloud. SCO began by suing IBM, saying it contributed alleged copyrighted

material to Linux. It has since also sued Linux supplier Novell and Linux users DaimlerChrysler and
AutoZone, citing copyright violations.

SCO appears to have done little to slow the rising popularity of Linux. Supplier Red Hat signed 4,000 new Linux customers in its most recent quarter, up from 1,500 the previous quarter.
But the threats have made some companies nervous. Linux suppliers Novell, Red Hat and
Hewlett-Packard now offer limited legal protection for customers worried about being sued. IBM, the
biggest Linux backer, has declined to indemnify Linux users.

Microsoft last year gave big customers unlimited copyright protection for Windows products, underscoring the benefit of tight control over its code base. "Microsoft can stand behind its code because it is proprietary," DiDio says.

European health insurance card

Draft European directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights  http://masl.to/?P28E54208

MEPs Malcolm Harbour and Arlene McCarthy support the directive

IP Justice campaigned against the directive

The European commission demanded a euros 497m fine from Microsoft for infringing EU
competition law Paul O Driscoll

A huge Europe-wide IT project, which will involve issuing more than 160m smart cards by the end of the decade, has just been announced. It will dwarf David Blunkett's ID card scheme, but the chances are that you haven't even heard of it.

Perhaps this is because it is European, and plans from this source often seem to catch Britain by surprise. Thirteen of the European Union's current and new members (joining on May 1) are introducing the European health insurance card from June 1. It will replace national health insurance cards used by everyone in countries including France and Germany. Previously, travellers had to apply for an E111 form or similar for access to EU countries' health services.

The cards issued from June will not have a chip, but a smart card version will be introduced towards the end of the decade. A computer network allowing health insurance claims to flow between EU countries
is also planned, using the smart technology.

"The European health insurance card will be another piece of Europe in your pocket," said  European    commission president Romano Prodi; a similar phrase was used for the euro. Like euros, the cards will have one side designed by the issuing nation and the other standard across the EU.

Although it will be issued only to those who want it, the Department of Health says that it will start producing cards only by the end of 2005, the last date allowed by the EU. The UK will issue cards centrally, and there are no plans to move to smart cards.

Projects and legislation affecting UK IT are often decided or heavily affected by European institutions. For example, the commission rather than the member states  fined Microsoft euros 497m for breaking EU competition law, although the  fine was agreed by individual countries. More significantly, laws
Page 111 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
affecting trade are often decided by European directives aiming to create a "common market" across the European Union. But when IT meets security, such as on the extent of state-sponsored bugging, countries make up their own minds - and the UK normally takes a much harder line than anyone else.

Directives, which compel countries to enact laws but leave them to decide how, are agreed by the commission, European parliament and the council of ministers (the relevant government ministers from each member state), and those ministers have final say. The process can be slow: the data privacy directive negotiated in Europe from 1990-95, was implemented in the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, and came into force in 2001, 11 years later.

Implementions vary widely, according to Shelagh Gaskill, head of information law for law firm Masons. She says the Spanish privacy commissioner is known to come down hard on those who break data protection law: "The  fines can be huge: euros 1m is not uncommon," she says.

The UK information commissioner takes a softer approach, first asking organisations to change their ways, then issuing an enforcement notice and only then going to court - where the largest  fine and costs Gaskill has heard of totalled pounds 5,000. Similarly, there are big differences in penalties for sending spam, although it has been banned in the EU.

Gaskill thinks that those seeking to influence IT legislation must do so at the European level. "There's no point in lobbying London if you miss the boat in Europe," she says. "The room for manoeuvre is limited
in London."

So what is coming our way? On March 9, the European parliament passed a draft directive on enforcement of intellectual property rights by 330 votes to 151; if passed by the council of ministers (which is likely), member states will have to implement it by early 2006. Some civil rights campaigners compared it to the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which media firms have used to charge teenagers for illegally downloading music. It didn't help that the directive's rapporteur (member leading it through the parliament) was French MEP Janelly Fourtou, married to Jean-Rene Fourtou, chief executive of Vivendi Universal.

Professor Sir Neil MacCormick, an MEP for the Scottish National party, voted against the directive. He says the directive gives more power to patent holders, which could hit producers of generic medicines, and extends patents to cover software, specifically that embedded in hardware. He says this is of concern, depending on legal interpretation.

The European commission demanded a euros 497m fine from Microsoft for infringing EU
competition law Paul O Driscoll

A huge Europe-wide IT project, which will involve issuing more than 160m smart cards by the end of the decade, has just been announced. It will dwarf David Blunkett's ID card scheme, but the chances are that you haven't even heard of it.

TD
Perhaps this is because it is European, and plans from this source often seem to catch Britain by surprise. Thirteen of the European Union's current and new members (joining on May 1) are introducing the European health insurance card from June 1. It will replace national health insurance cards used by everyone in countries including France and Germany. Previously, travellers had to apply for an E111 form or similar for access to EU countries' health services.

The cards issued from June will not have a chip, but a smart card version will be introduced towards the end of the decade. A computer network allowing health insurance claims to flow between EU countries
is also planned, using the smart technology.

"The European health insurance card will be another piece of Europe in your pocket," said  European    commission president Romano Prodi; a similar phrase was used for the euro. Like euros, the cards will have one side designed by the issuing nation and the other standard across the EU.

Although it will be issued only to those who want it, the Department of Health says that it will start producing cards only by the end of 2005, the last date allowed by the EU. The UK will issue cards centrally, and there are no plans to move to smart cards.

Projects and legislation affecting UK IT are often decided or heavily affected by European institutions. For example, the commission rather than the member states  fined Microsoft euros 497m for breaking EU competition law, although the  fine was agreed by individual countries. More significantly, laws affecting trade are often decided by European directives aiming to create a "common market" across the European Union. But when IT meets security, such as on the extent of state-sponsored bugging, countries make up their own minds - and the UK normally takes a much harder line than anyone else.

Directives, which compel countries to enact laws but leave them to decide how, are agreed by the commission, European parliament and the council of ministers (the relevant government ministers from each member state), and those ministers have final say. The process can be slow: the data privacy directive negotiated in Europe from 1990-95, was implemented in the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, and came into force in 2001, 11 years later.

Implementions vary widely, according to Shelagh Gaskill, head of information law for law firm Masons. She says the Spanish privacy commissioner is known to come down hard on those who break data protection law: "The  fines can be huge: euros 1m is not uncommon," she says.



Page 113 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The UK information commissioner takes a softer approach, first asking organisations to change their ways, then issuing an enforcement notice and only then going to court - where the largest  fine and costs Gaskill has heard of totalled pounds 5,000. Similarly, there are big differences in penalties for sending spam, although it has been banned in the EU.

Gaskill thinks that those seeking to influence IT legislation must do so at the European level. "There's no point in lobbying London if you miss the boat in Europe," she says. "The room for manoeuvre is limited
in London."

So what is coming our way? On March 9, the European parliament passed a draft directive on enforcement of intellectual property rights by 330 votes to 151; if passed by the council of ministers (which is likely), member states will have to implement it by early 2006. Some civil rights campaigners compared it to the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which media firms have used to charge teenagers for illegally downloading music. It didn't help that the directive's rapporteur (member leading it through the parliament) was French MEP Janelly Fourtou, married to Jean-Rene Fourtou, chief executive of Vivendi Universal.

Professor Sir Neil MacCormick, an MEP for the Scottish National party, voted against the directive. He says the directive gives more power to patent holders, which could hit producers of generic medicines, and extends patents to cover software, specifically that embedded in hardware. He says this is of concern, depending on legal interpretation. The US already allows software patents, generating many court battles, for example SCO's claims over open source operating system Linux.

But MacCormick says there is not too much to worry teenage file-swappers. "You've got to stop counterfeiting and piracy - it's a serious problem - but what you want to do is deal with commercial-scale infringements," he says. Sections of the directive were altered to target commercial-scale piracy rather than individuals, although MacCormick thinks this caveat should have been applied to the whole directive.
Those who see the June 10 European elections as irrelevant may note that MEPs do affect the UK's IT
laws - possibly more than MPs.

Now it's Europe's turn to have its way with  Microsoft. Looking to one-up U.S. sanctions against this U.S.-based company, the European Union has seized on complaints by a handful of  Microsoft's U.S. competitors and imposed its own set of penalties on the company for allegedly abusing its Windows dominance.

After rejecting  Microsoft's attempts to settle the five-year-old case, European Commission competition czar Mario Monti ruled last month that the company must pay a record $613 million fine, untie Media Player from future versions of Windows, and share Windows APIs to make it easier for competing server makers to work with the operating system. Adding insult to injury, the commission is pulling together an advisory body to monitor  Microsoft's future behavior. Why not pattern it after the U.N. Security Council and offer rivals veto power over future versions of Windows?

TD
If the  competition commissioner weren't so bureaucratically solemn, you could call the entire affair Monti's Flying Circus. The Full Monti is more like it, with Europe's trustbusters exposing their smallness to the general public. It isn't just misguided  antitrust policy; it's a monumental waste of time and resources.

This ruling does little to help European consumers, the supposed beneficiaries of EU  antitrust efforts. It's hard to see, for instance, how forcing  Microsoft to remove its multimedia software from the Windows OS without cutting the price of that scaled-back version serves Windows customers. As for making  Microsoft disclose its Windows server APIs: The U.S. Justice Department ruling a year and a half ago set stringent requirements for how Microsoft is to share such documentation. Why lay down two sets of rules-simply because rivals want to slow Microsoft down at every turn?

Microsoft says it offered to ship competitors' media players. But those settlement talks broke down, Monti maintains, over the vendor's refusal to agree to "clear principles for future conduct," as if the
ever-changing software sector can be mapped out in clear five-year plans. So  Microsoft will appeal the EU ruling, and the status quo will prevail as the case lingers in the courts for several more years-nothing accomplished in close to a decade of posturing.

You have to wonder whether the commission intends to subject Europe's few remaining technology titans to the same scrutiny. Would SAP be forced to withhold certain CRM or supply-chain extensions from its market-leading business application suite should Siebel or i2 complain about the German developer's dominance? And what about future Windows features? Would  Microsoft's addition of antivirus or search functionality also be deemed verboten? If so, who would make that call: the United States, Europe or both?

Meantime, the EU is behind the times-18 months behind U.S. regulators and at least a year behind market developments. Its crackdown on  Microsoft's Windows dominance comes as Linux is taking off across Europe. More than 160,000 Linux servers were shipped in Western Europe last year, according to IDC, which forecasts that volume to triple by 2007. Some of Europe's most prominent multinational companies are moving key applications to Linux, while European governments are standardizing on the operating system. IDC also sees Linux gaining ground on the desktop in Europe, with 15.5 percent of companies surveyed considering using the platform. Meantime, this month's landmark deal between  Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, under which the two companies agreed to share technical information to make it

easier for Sun servers to interoperate with Windows, shows that customer pressure is the best way to get
Microsoft to open up.

Microsoft is no Boy Scout. It plays to win, and its Windows leverage remains considerable. But in the
end, savvy customers and competitors, driving new technology movements such as open source, are a far
better match than regulators for muscular would-be monopolists.

BILL Gates'  Microsoft will be back on familiar territory next week: warning EU policymakers not to make a costly mistake that would set back innovation and harm customers.

But this time, the issue is not the software giant's monopoly on the market. Instead, the company and its allies will try to convince the  European Commission not to bow to pressure to tamper with market forces and issue a legal mandate for the technology behind the new wave of interactive digital TV technology.

TD
The warning comes as Erkki Liikanen, the commissioner for enterprise and information society, prepares to decide this summer whether to impose a standard for the computer systems lurking inside the 'set-top boxes' that let viewers receive interactive TV systems.

The deadline for a decision on the smart new TV technology - which grants viewers greater control over programmes and gives access to vast amounts of information at the flick of a button - was stipulated in a raft of new EU telecom laws approved two years ago.

Ministers and MEPs said industry must make an effort to ensure their systems work together so that the future of TV is not undermined by industry infighting.

Proponents say insisting on a single standard for the so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, would prevent the biggest TV companies from cornering the market for content - such as films, sitcoms or even sports events - by insisting it is tailored to work for their systems. That is because it costs a lot of money to adapt content to work on different systems.

At the same time, they argue, consumers would be able to receive many different TV services from the same type of set-top box.

An openly available system known as MHP, short for multimedia home system, developed by big name electronics companies including Philips, is the choice of many pro-standardizers, such as powerful German public broadcasters and MEPs from all parties in the country.

In a statement, German Christian Democrat MEP Ruth Hieronymi, Socialist Karin Junker and Liberal Astrid Thors said: "Mandating a single standard is not desirable, but it remains an option, in case the market does not satisfy consumer demands."
But Microsoft, which has developed an array of TV products, including its MediaCenter software,
which can turn a PC into a home cinema, is part of a coalition of companies, including France's Canal+
and Rupert Murdoch's Sky, determined to quell the standards talk at a Brussels hearing next Tuesday
(20 April).

"We don't think any standards should be mandated," said Jim Beveridge,  Microsoft's European broadcast and broadband policy director, adding that such a move would "freeze technology".

Digital TV pioneers Sky and Canal+ claim Commission interference could undermine billions of euro of investments in systems.

Beveridge says talk of imposing standards ignores market developments - which mean pictures and video are now likely to appear in future in a host of technological systems - from mobile phones and PCs to digital assistants.
Page 117 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Scot says it makes little sense imposing a standard for the technology used to receive just digital
TV pictures - given the diversity of other platforms with different characteristics.

Instead, he says the focus should be on supporting efforts to at least ensure content providers have the tools to make certain that their programmes can be adapted to work on any technology.

The cross-industry Digital Video Broadcasting group, which helped develop the MHP system, has also worked on voluntary 'portable content format' standards to do just that. "If you know what type of content you have and you can signal it, it does not matter what you have on the receiver side," he explained.

To emphasize this, Beveridge points to the success of the iPod, marketed by rivals Apple to play standard music - not video - files downloaded from the internet.
"iPod doesn't have any open standards in it, but it does a  fine job if you are a consumer.
"It competes with my [company's] technology... but you have to admire those [Apple] guys." Commissioner Liikanen told European Voice earlier this month he is still making up his mind on the
issue.

"We have not yet taken a decision on the need to mandate a particular standard to support interactive television services. A decision is not due until the end of July," he said. In the meantime, Beveridge is hopeful the Finnish commissioner and his aides will take on board his arguments - unlike when his company's CEO Steve Ballmer lost out to the Commission's  competition chief Mario Monti in the
anti-trust battle of the giants.

Is Microsoft finally about to face real  competition in desktop-computer software, asks The Economist
For years, hope has ebbed and flowed among many in the computer business that Linux, a freely
available computer operating system that uses a penguin as its symbol, would become a viable alternative
to Microsoft's Windows, the near universal standard for the world's personal computers. The
industryâexcluding  Microsoft and its founder Bill Gates, of courseâis currently riding another wave of
hope. Will disappointment follow?

TD
Within the past month, some of the world's most powerful technology firms have pledged considerable support for Linux on the desktop. Hewlett-Packard (HP), which runs neck-and-neck with Dell as the largest seller of PCs in the world, said it will begin shipping some machines that run on Novell's flavour of the free operating system, called SuSE Linux. And Sun Microsystems, an arch-rival of  Microsoft, announcedâeven as it was preparing to bury the hatchet with  Microsoft officiallyâthat it had persuaded Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, to sell cheap PCs using Linux and Sun's StarOffice suite of application programs, instead of the ubiquitous  Microsoft Office. This follows a deal that Sun struck last autumn with several Chinese ministries to ship up to 1m PCs with Sun's Linux package to China this year, rising to âtens of millions in future yearsâ, according to Jonathan Schwartz, Sun's chief operating officer.

Is this the beginning of the end for  Microsoft's virtual monopoly on the desktop? Certainly not right away, says Al Gillen, an analyst at IDC, a technology consultancy. Today, almost 94% of all PCs in the world run on Windows, while slightly more than 3%âmostly in creative industries and universitiesâuse Apple's Macintosh system. Fewer than 3% use Linux. By the end of the decade, Linux's share could grow to
7-10%, reckons Mr Gillen, displacing Macs as the main alternative. That would still fall far short of Linux's growing popularity in the market for powerful server computers. Linux aficionados, however, say its chances on the desktop should be much better.

They cite several reasons why. First, the quality of Linuxâwhich like other open-source software is developed by a community of volunteers who share their work freelyâhas been rising steadily. Linux PCs are no longer just for geeks. Second,  Microsoft itself looks temporarily chastened, if not weak. A series of worms and viruses has wrought havoc on Windows PCs.  Microsoft faced further embarrassment this week when it warned about more security flaws in its software. Meanwhile Linux, which hackers tend not
to target, looks safe in comparison. And distrust of  Microsoft as a bullying monopolist remains high. Last month the  European Commission fined the company â¬497m (US$612m) and ordered it to behave better.

More specifically, two windows, so to speak, of opportunity appear to be opening. One is that the next version of Windows, called Longhorn, has been delayed to 2006 at the earliest, in part by  Microsoft's realisation that it has to tighten up security a lot more. So, for the next two years, companies and home users thinking about updating their operating system might be reluctant to buy the current version, Windows XP, knowing it will soon be overtaken.

Hence they may consider alternatives more seriously. If Linux can establish a good reputation during this period, it might look even more attractive once Longhorn, which will be expensive and is likely to require new hardware, is released. Linux, after all, can be very cheap: US$100 per user if bought as part of Sun's package, for instance. It can even be downloaded for nothing from the Internet.


Page 119 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Starting from scratch

The other opportunity lies in poor countries. Unlike rich countries, which have a huge installed base of Windows computers and billions of documents in  Microsoft's fiddly file formats, most users in Asia and South America are starting with a clean slate. For a country such as China, says Sun's Mr Schwartz, the attraction of open-source software is obvious: it is cheaper, so it will reduce the incentive to get pirated software (most copies of Windows in China are fake) and thus help China improve its relations with the World Trade Organisation. Better still, it allows China to avoid being locked into a single vendorâand an American one at that.

This is why even some of Linux's main backers have relatively modest ambitions for the operating system. âThere is no real market for a consumer-grade Linux desktop,â says Martin Fink, HP's Linux boss. Rather than trying to upstage  Microsoft, HP is simply responding to its corporate customers, whose technology bosses have been asking to try out Linux on the desktops of a few dozen employees before committing to any big deployment. âThey are at the point where they want to kick the tyres,â adds Mr Fink.

Linux's main appeal, in other words, is likely to be to companies rather than home users. And even companies are unlikely to ditch their Windows PCs for the sort of employees that  Microsoft calls âinformation workersââthe lawyers, consultants, accountants and so forth who use presentation applications, spreadsheets, fancy graphics and the like. Linux is perfect, on the other hand, for call centres, cash tellers, customer-support departments and other types of work that require employees to use only the same one or two computer functions (and whom their employers might actually want to discourage from goofing off with other applications while on the job). Instead of the âinformation workerâ, says Mr Fink, he is targeting the âtransaction workerâ.

That casts a different light on Linux's future on the PC. Companies such as HP do not see it as a way to make money, but as a way for them to drive sales of server computers in company data centres as part of a complete Linux âsolutionâ. And Sun, according to Pip Coburn, an analyst at UBS, a bank, probably âaims to distract folks in suggesting that  Microsoftâcertainly damaged by Linux in serversâwill get burned at the desktop.â

So Microsoft may not need to worry about Linux on PCs all that much. Insofar as it can point to competition from Linux, as it has been doing with Apple, as âproofâ that it is not a monopoly, Linux may even help Microsoft in its legal battles.

But the future is uncertain, and Linux still might yet represent another kind of threat to the company. No standard operating system has yet emerged for mobile handsets, robots, watches, televisions, printers, car gadgets and other such devices.  Microsoft, naturally, wants to extend Windows' dominance to these as well. It is here, rather than the desktop, that Linux could be a real threat to the mighty company's ambitions.

RealNetworks, the internet media company, yesterday said its chief executive had appealed directly to Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer, to team up in battle with  Microsoft in the digital music industry.

The company said that Rob Glaser had e-mailed Mr Jobs with a proposal to form a "tactical alliance" that would involve Apple allowing consumers to download music on to its popular iPod music players from sources other than its own iTunes.

TD
RealNetworks offers a service called Rhapsody that competes with iTunes by allowing customers to buy individual songs over the internet or subscribe to a service for a monthly fee. In exchange, RealNetworks would make the iPod its primary device for Rhapsody store and for its RealPlayer audio-visual software.
Both iTunes and Rhapsody support the same music format, known as AAC, which competes with
Microsoft's WMA format. The services are expected to be launched in Europe later this year.
"Rob Glaser reached out to Steve Jobs along the lines of forming a united front, but it appears that Mr
Jobs is not interested," a spokesman for RealNetworks said.

Mr Glaser issued a veiled warning that if Apple was not interested in allying itself with RealNetworks it might be forced to seek a partnership with  Microsoft and switch its download format to WMA.

Such a situation would herald a stark about-face for RealNetworks, which helped to instigate an antitrust inquiry into Microsoft by the European Commission, resulting in the software company being fined Euro 497 million.

Take a close look at these faces. On the performance of these young executives - and others of their generation - depends Europe's commercial future. They will help to determine whether the old continent can prove its critics wrong and find a new streak of innovation, or whether it will sink into relative decline compared with the US and the tiger economies of Asia.

To mark the 25th anniversary of the launch of our European expansion, the Financial Times has picked out 25 worth watching from the new wave of business leaders across the continent. They are a
cross-section who, taken together, are likely to have an impact on the way European capitalism evolves.

TD
They will help to decide, for example, how far European business methods continue to be Americanised. Their actions will determine issues ranging from the health of the owner-manager model to whether Europe has a future in manufacturing. They will shape its openness to capital markets and the transparency of its corporate governance.

Typically in their mid-30s to mid-40s, this group has been chosen for its ability to shape the way business is done. Some have already reached the top and are making a difference; some are on their way there, creating expectations as they go; others are entrepreneurs. The group is not exclusive, but all are achievers.

Of our sample, five - Edouard Michelin, James Murdoch, Cristina Stenbeck, Ernesto Bertarelli and Ana Patricia Botin - have inherited or are rising through their family business empires. We could have chosen more. Family ownership remains a big part of Europe's corporate scene and it has been thriving.
Studies show that companies with a dominant family shareholder have outperformed non-family stocks
on Europe's main markets over the past decade. Parmalat aside, family controlled companies have been
notable for their steady balance sheet management, for preferring long-term strategies over daily share
price performance and for focusing on cash flow over accounting earnings.

Whether they sustain their lead depends on the imagination of these sons and daughters and their peers in other family businesses. Even the most conservative can be quietly radical: look at how Mr Michelin is opening up the secretive tyre maker to new relationships with competitors and component manufacturers.

Others are challenging traditional practices. Dennis Hennequin started as a McDonald's restaurant manager and is now teaching his US bosses a lesson in modernising menus. Anne Lauvergeon is resisting France's dirigiste impulses in the form of pressure for her nuclear group to rescue the stricken Alstom. Leszek Czarnecki introduced leasing to Poland and is trying to repeat the trick in Russia.

This group faces big challenges, not least more aggressive questioning by shareholders. Whether they are up to it, the coming years will tell.
Edouard Michelin

The last thing Edouard Michelin likes is to put himself centre-stage. But however much he dislikes the idea of celebrity executives, he has been in the spotlight ever since he succeeded his father to take charge of the secretive French tyremaker in 1999.


Page 122 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
At 40, he is the youngest boss of a CAC-40 French blue chip company. While maintaining a family- orientated culture, Mr Michelin has brought about profound changes in the company's organisation and business approach.

In a difficult and mature industry, he has consolidated Michelin's position as the world's leading tyre manufacturer. He has also made the 115-year-old company less secretive, developing more open relationships with competitors and car components manufacturers.

Unlike his father, Francois, who ran the company for 44 years, he regularly meets analysts and investors and has brought car engineers into Michelin's research facilities to advise on tyre design.

He joined the company at 22, and later spent time running its North American operations, which now account for about 40 per cent of its annual $15bn (GBP8bn) sales.

On taking over the company, he launched a politically sensitive restructuring of its European operations, cutting 7,500 jobs, and restructuring the North American activities to improve productivity.

His aim is to give Michelin "an all-terrain capability" to enable the company to ride through rough patches as well as take advantage of the good times. The strategy has proved such a success it has propelled a reluctant Mr Michelin into the limelight.

Jean-Philippe Courtois

Jean-Philippe Courtois, 43, was appointed chief executive of  Microsoft Europe, Middle East and Africa last year. His new role is at the heart of the software group's struggle to improve its image in Europe and to negotiate a settlement with the European Union's  antitrust body.

Mr Courtois, a French national, joined Microsoft in 1984 as a channel sales representative, and was promoted to general manager for Microsoft France in 1994.

He has been the force behind  Microsoft's introduction of an annual citizenship report and likes to say things like: "Corporate citizenship is a journey not a destination." Such initiatives are central to Microsoft's plan to improve its standing in Europe at a time when open-source software is a growing challenge to the Windows operating system.

Mr Courtois lacks the brashness of his boss Steve Ballmer or of Bill Gates, but his subtle charm may win more support in Europe. If  Microsoft needs to project a softer, friendlier image, the appointment of a diplomatic Frenchman to smooth relations with governments, regulators, local authorities, 400,000 software developers, 280,000 re-sellers and millions of small and medium-sized business customers may be a smart idea.

Like his friend Dennis Hennequin, executive vice-president of McDonald's Europe, Mr Courtois symbolises a new generation of outward-looking French business leaders without knee-jerk hostility to America. Unlike most of the French business establishment, Mr Courtois is not a product of the French grandes ecoles system - he is a graduate of the Ecole Superieur de Commerce, Nice.

Wolfgang Bernhard

At 43, Wolfgang Bernhard is about to walk into one of the most coveted jobs in the motor industry. He will take over Mercedes Car Group, the holding company for Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands, at an age when most of his rivals are still vying for power in middle management.

He is the youngest member of the board of DaimlerChrysler, the German carmaker that owns Mercedes, and is being talked about as a possible CEO of the group, the world's fourth biggest vehicle manufacturer.

He began as a consultant at McKinsey, working on costs and productivity in Mercedes factories. The carmaker took him on, and within two years gave him responsibility for the production launch of the important S-Class saloon in Sindelfingen, its biggest factory.

During this time he made it on to the list kept by Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive, of up-and-coming young executives ripe for promotion. Sure enough, a few years later he got one of the best mid-level jobs at Mercedes: running its AMG performance engineering division. After just a year he was promoted
again, sent to the troubled Chrysler operation in the US as part of the team led by Dieter Zetsche that was supposed to revitalise the business.
Page 123 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company is still not a success, but Mr Bernhard earned a reputation as a tough negotiator, pushing through impressive cost cuts and made record-breaking annual improvements in productivity.

He combines a manufacturing background with a "car guy" enthusiasm for vehicles, rushing out of an interview at this year's Detroit motor show in order to demonstrate the fold-flat seats just added to the company's minivans.
James Mackintosh
Kai-Uwe Ricke

When Kai-Uwe Ricke, 42, took over as head of Europe's largest telecommunications operator in November 2002, he faced one of the most difficult corporate tasks in Europe. Deutsche Telekom was reeling from the dramatic ousting of his predecessor Ron Sommer a few months earlier, and was struggling with a E64.2bn (GBP43bn) debt mountain, a bloated workforce and a depressed share price.

Mr Ricke, a former business graduate, had originally been seen as the last choice from a long list of contenders to take over from Mr Sommer, after several leading German executives rejected the job.

In the event, the son of Helmut Ricke, DT's chairman between 1990 and 1994, was a perfect inside choice, not least because of his four years' experience as a senior manager at DT, including playing a pivotal part in the acquisition and subsequent integration of VoiceStream in the US. Prior to that, a stint as chief executive of Talkline, an alternative telecoms operator, had deepened his experience of the sector.

Eighteen months after taking the top job at DT, the unobtrusive and unflappable Mr Ricke has confounded his sceptics. Steady progress on non-core asset sales has eroded debt much faster than anyone would have believed possible, to a much more manageable E46.6bn, earning DT a credit-rating upgrade in the process. The company generated a net profit of E1.25bn last year, a massive improvement on the record E24.6bn loss in 2002.

His ambitions for the future are no less challenging: Mr Ricke's stated goal is to make DT "the leading services company in the telecoms and IT industry".
Bettina Wassener
Michael O'Leary

Michael O'Leary, the 42-year-old chief executive of Ryanair, has come to personify the brash new Irish business elite. An accountant by training, he has none of the grey attributes of that profession.
But his head for numbers, a shrewd marketing brain and a ruthless competitive streak has helped turn
Ryanair into Europe's leading low-cost airline.

The sector has attracted its fair share of extroverts. But Mr O'Leary more than most has cultivated the image of a business rebel fighting the airline establishment.

Take his views on travel agents: "Screw the travel agent. Take the fuckers out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the years?"

Or his view on Ryanair customers who want their money back because a relative has fallen ill. "We don't fall over ourselves if they say: 'My granny fell ill'. What part of 'no refund' don't they understand? You are not getting a refund so fuck off."

His publicity-seeking sometimes seems ill-judged, as when the airline's millionth passenger sued the company after it reneged on a promise to give her free flights for life. He handled his recent dispute with the European Commission over illegal airport subsidies in the only way he knows how - attacking the members of the Commission as Soviet-era bureaucrats who are bad for business.

Mr O'Leary, who eschews suit and tie in favour of check shirts and jeans, projects himself as the common man's capitalist. He likes to play football with his pilots and has been known to help out baggage handlers at Dublin airport.
But for all this bonhomie, he has no time for unions - or government ministers - who get in his way. John Murray-Brown
James Murdoch


Page 124 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
When James Murdoch stood beside his father at the annual meeting of British Sky Broadcasting last November, the youngest chief executive of a FTSE-100 company said: "I am joining a company that has become one of the most formidable pay television companies in the world."

Moments earlier, Rupert Murdoch, BSkyB chairman, admitted: "Speaking personally, I can fully understand the suspicion of possible nepotism with my son as a candidate, not to speak of the salivations of my newspaper competitors."

Four months later, the shareholder outcry over the appointment of the media mogul's 31-year-old son has largely died down. Investors have been appeased by the resumption of dividend payments after a
five-year gap, subscriber numbers advancing beyond 7m and an 84 per cent rise in underlying first-half operating profits at Europe's largest media company.

A Harvard graduate, Mr Murdoch initially spurned the "family firm" in favour of running his own music company. When he later joined NewsCorp, he ran its internet operations before heading StarTV in Asia.
Mr Murdoch believes growth in multi-channel television through satellite and cable could lift penetration in
Britain from 43 per cent to 70-80 per cent.

Sky, which has become a model for other News Corp pay-TV affiliates such as Sky Italia and DirecTV in the US, sees growth in transforming TV sets into home entertainment centres, capable of downloading films and TV programmes. For Mr Murdoch this is the next market place, offering Sky an alternative earnings stream to DVDs and videos. If he succeeds, he could be credited with setting a new standard in video on demand.
Tim Burt
Marcel Rohner

Even by the standards of UBS, where meteoric career advancement is not unusual, Marcel Rohner's rise has been remarkable. Peter Wuffli may have become chief executive of Switzerland's biggest and most successful bank at 46, but at just 39, Mr Rohner is already heading private banking, the group's cash
cow, and firmly seated on the executive board.

His career path has been untarnished. After studying, economics at Zurich university, Mr Rohner joined the investment banking arm of the then Swiss Bank Corporation before its effective takeover of UBS. By
1999 he had become chief risk officer for investment banking; two years later he shifted to private banking.

With SFr701bn (GBP301.3bn) in invested assets, private banks do not get much bigger. Under Mr Rohner, the operation has flourished, consistently attracting new funds, even in a difficult period when rivals lost clients. In June 2002, Mr Rohner's empire was extended to embrace retail and business banking in Switzerland too - a model sufficiently successful, it seems, for rival Credit Suisse to have decided to copy it.

Responsibility for one of the bank's four business groups inevitably places Mr Rohner in the public eye. But the man remains an enigma. Married, with one child, his main activity seems to be work.

All the better, perhaps, when Switzerland's hallowed bank secrecy comes under increasing pressure. With no shortage of resources, UBS has responded by expanding into private banking outside Switzerland, pushing Mr Rohner's star further up the firmament.
Haig Simonian
Gyorgy Jaksity

At 38, Gyorgy Jaksity may already have outgrown his role as chairman of Concorde Securities, Hungary's only independent brokerage and investment bank of note.

Founded by Mr Jaksity and two colleagues in 1993, Concorde soon gained a strong international reputation for integrity in a market filled with multinational players and dodgy local start-ups.
Most recently Mr Jaksity helped Hungary's government sell the last large state-owned bank for a price
that far exceeded expectations. But he has a hands-off approach to daily operations. "Ideally, I don't have
to get involved. That means things are running properly," he says.

This has allowed Mr Jaksity to widen his pursuits. He is chairman of the Budapest Stock Exchange and last December published a 620-page volume, The Nature of Money, that links religion, technology and

Page 125 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
sociology with the logic of money and markets. Mr Jaksity also writes in the Hungarian media, criticising
"whatever I see that is screwed up".

Mr Jaksity sets a badly needed example of philanthropy following the the vacuum left by the collapse of communism. The Smile Foundation he helped found in 1996 backs projects ranging from a summer camp for children recovering from cancer to a campaign supporting disabled rights.
Some believe Mr Jaksity is destined for a government role. But for now, at least, he dismisses the
thought. No one remembers who ruled Athens 2,000 years ago, he says, but everyone knows its greatest
philosophers.

"Socrates walked around the marketplace asking questions and pissing people off. I think I'm doing the same thing."
Chris Condon
Christiane zu Salm

Euvia, the Munich-based television group headed by Christiane zu Salm, is just one player in a crowded German television market. But it is profitable, in spite of, or perhaps because of, being unconventional and innovative.
"We see ourselves as a pacemaker for the development of the television of the future," says the
37-year-old former head of MTV Germany.

Euvia's main channel, quiz channel Neun Live, invites viewers to telephone in to solve clues in quiz games and tele-shopping programmes. Although it hardly sounds like a recipe for success, it receives
20m calls a month.

The group's lack of reliance on advertising revenues has stood it in good stead when much of the industry is suffering from the advertising market's collapse. Instead, Neun Live generates revenues from calls to quiz shows, and sonnenklar, Euvia's travel sales channel, through travel bookings.
Euvia saw a 46 per cent rise in sales last year to E92.3m (GBP61m) last year, and operating profits of
E21.8m, up from E312,000 in 2002.

Ms zu Salm is not ashamed of the fact that viewers tend to be in their 30s and 40s, and that the content can be low-brow. "We do on television what is widespread and accepted in print media, such as tabloid newspapers," she says.

The technology employed is as simple as it gets: viewers interact using the telephone. "I don't see why television should not be able to do more than entertain and inform - why it should not also develop into a tool for getting a job, for example," says Ms zu Salm.
Bettina Wassener
Ernesto Bertarelli

Ernesto Bertarelli seems to have it all: at 38 he has youth, wealth and good looks. He is also the man who secured the America's Cup for land-locked Switzerland. It is for that feat, rather than the estimated SFr10bn-11bn (GBP4.3bn-GBP4.7bn) value of his family's controlling stake in Serono, Europe's biggest biotechnology group, for which he is best known.
For years, Ernesto remained in the shadow of his father Fabio, who moved the company from Italy to
Geneva in the days when Red Brigade terrorists were threatening "years of lead" for Italy's business elite.

Only on his father's death in 1998 did Mr Bertarelli, appointed chief executive two years earlier, emerge as a business leader in his own right. He had been well trained: "There was no escape from my father's eye and dominance," he once reflected.

After gaining a science degree in the US, Mr Bertarelli took an MBA at Harvard - an experience he says helped him to appreciate the importance of teamwork in the America's Cup. An avid and expert sailor, he deferred to the team's real competitive professionals during the racing, taking the role of navigator.

The ability to assemble talent, prioritise and delegate has served him as well at Serono as on the water. Since taking over, Mr Bertarelli has developed the group, which pioneered the production of fertility hormones, into a full-scale biotechnology powerhouse. Sales last year broke $2bn (GBP1.1bn) for the first time and net profits reached $390m. The family coffers have benefited accordingly.

Andrea Guerra

Andrea Guerra, 38, finds it difficult to see why the world of washing machines and cookers cannot be at least as interesting and glamorous as that of luxury clothing or sports cars.

For the past four years, he has been chief executive of Merloni, an Italian company that is Europe's third biggest maker of white goods - behind Electrolux of Sweden and BSH (owned by Bosch and Siemens) of Germany.
Mr Guerra joined Merloni - based in the small town of Fabriano close to Italy's eastern seaboard - in
1994. His background was in marketing and he had worked for the Marriott hotel chain.

Most of his time is spent far from the fashionable centres of Milan and Rome, which may explain his down-to-earth manner - he is as at home explaining the  finer points of Merloni's business strategy as he is examining one of the company's plastic moulding machines.

In the next few years, Mr Guerra is anxious to put Merloni in at least the number two position in Europe's white goods industry.

But the name of Merloni sparks little recognition with the public, partly because it sells through other brands, such as Indesit, Ariston and - for the past two years - Hotpoint, the UK's best-selling white goods brand. Of the company's sales last year of E3bn (GBP2bn), one-third came from Britain.

Merloni's relative obscurity may also stem from its family ownership. The chairman and main owner is the patriarchal Vittorio Merloni, whose father founded the company - although a minority of the shares are traded on the Milan stock exchange. One of Mr Guerra's ambitions is to raise Merloni's profile in Europe.
Peter Marsh
Riccardo Ruggiero

As chief executive of Telecom Italia Wireline, 43-year-old Riccardo Ruggiero is charged with injecting life into the former Italian phone monopoly's fixed-line operations. That is not easy in a country whose mobile phone explosion was due largely to consumers seeking an alternative to the old-style incumbent.

He has managed to lift margins - a rare feat in the fixed-line segment - and is concentrating on broadband. The effort includes an aggressive move on German and French markets, setting up a broadband clash with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.

Until now, Mr Ruggiero has rarely brushed with failure. Like Marco De Benedetti, his 41-year-old counterpart at Telecom Italia's mobile division, Mr Ruggiero was born with a silver spoon in his mouth - but he quickly learnt how to use the rest of the silverware on his own.

The son of a former director-general of the World Trade Organisation, he was handed top jobs after a law degree: first as a sales director at Fininvest, Silvio Berlusconi's media empire, then at AT&T's Italian unit.

Alongside Mr De Benedetti, he benefited from Telecom Italia's fixed-line woes. In the mid-1990s the two started Infostrada, the Olivetti-Mannesmann joint venture that became the only serious competitor to TI. After Olivetti sold Infostrada to take over Telecom Italia in 1997, Mr De Benedetti switched sides. Mr Ruggiero stayed at Infostrada. Since 2001, the two have been back together. Mr Ruggiero has the more daunting task but it could prove more rewarding in the long run.
Fred Kapner
Ana Patricia Botin

Few Spaniards doubt that Ana Patricia Botin is being groomed to take over Santander Central Hispano when her 69-year-old father, Emilio Botin, decides to retire as the chairman of Spain's largest bank.

Ms Botin, 43, belongs to the fourth generation of Spain's best-known banking dynasty. Following a family tradition, she has spent most of her professional life working for her father, building Banco Santander's Latin American network in the 1990s, and running the group's investment banking and asset management divisions.

Santander's merger with Central Hispano in 1999 was a painful experience for Ms Botin. The Central Hispano camp feared the Botin clan and demanded that Ana Patricia give up her executive responsibilities, although she remained a member of the SCH board.

Page 127 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Ms Botin returned to her father's side in 2002 after a power struggle ended with the departure of senior figures at SCH. Mr Botin, now firmly in control, named her chairwoman of Banesto, a
medium-sized Spanish bank within the group.

The bank has fared well under her stewardship, winning market share in mortgages and in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Banesto, with about E57bn (GBP38.1bn) in assets, contributed E380m to group profits last year, about 12 per cent of the SCH total.

Ms Botin admits that her family ties have been both a boost and a handicap in her career, but she insists she wants to be judged by her track record. "What I most care about is my professional reputation," she has said.
Leslie Crawford
Leszek Czarnecki

Leszek Czarnecki, 42, made a fortune in the early days of Poland's economic transformation. Now he wants to repeat the same feat in Russia.

During the final years of Polish communism, Mr Czarnecki, who is a commercial diver and holds a PhD in economics, spent much of his time below the surface as the founder of an underwater construction company. In 1991, as Poland shifted away from communism, he founded Europejski Fundusz
Leasingowy (EFL), bringing the then-unknown idea of leasing to Poland.
Growth exploded and by 2000 revenues stood at E445m (GBP297m) a year and profits at E28m. In 2001
Mr Czarnecki sold his company to France's Credit Agricole, and became one of the richest Poles. After
toying with the idea of a tourist trip to the International Space Station, Mr Czarnecki, who still spends his
holidays diving to bone-crushing depths, decided to recreate his success to the east.

Using his new company Getin Holding, formerly a business-to-business internet company turned investment fund, he bought Cardcade, a small leasing company based in Russia's Kaliningrad region on the Baltic Sea. Mr Czarnecki aims for the rapidly growing business to become the largest leasing company servicing Russia's small and medium-sized companies within three years.

He is also seeking to buy a Russian bank, which would specialise in car loans. Prevented from competing in the Polish leasing market until the end of 2004 by his sales agreement with Credit Agricole, Mr Czarnecki earlier this year bought a small Silesian bank, PBK SA, for 225m zlotys (GBP32m), which he plans to recapitalise with a 330m zlotys share issue this year. Jan Cienski
Anne Lauvergeon

Like the famous mustard from her native Dijon, Anne Lauvergeon has shown a fiery determination to consolidate France's leadership in the nuclear industry.

In barely two years, the 44-year-old "iron lady" of the French nuclear sector has brought the various components of the country's nuclear industry into one group, Areva, turning it into the world's largest nuclear energy company.

To do this she has had to overcome political obstacles and rival appetites for sections of the state-owned group. A former close adviser to the late socialist president Francois Mitterrand, her future was by no means secure when the right returned to power in France.

After leaving the presidential palace in 1995, she had a not altogether happy experience at Lazard, the global advisory firm, and subsequently moved to Alcatel, the telecommunications group. Later, she took charge of the Cogema nuclear fuels company that was subsequently absorbed into Areva with Framatome and CEA Industrie.

As executive chairman at Areva, she has had to continue fighting her corner against political intervention. She has so far resisted attempts by the government and the French banking system to force cash-rich Areva to rescue Alstom, the stricken heavy engineering group. As a compromise she acquired Alstom's transmission and distribution business.

Her ambition now is to persuade the government partially to privatise Areva at a time of a revival of international interest in nuclear energy. She says she is ready for immediate flotation - and has recently launched an advertising blitz in France and abroad.

Jochen Zeitz
Page 128 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A decade ago, Jochen Zeitz, then aged 30, became the youngest ever head of a German stock exchange listed group when he was appointed chief executive of the Puma sportswear company. The group, he says, "was a sleeping cat that needed to be woken".

He not only awoke the beast; he made it leap. In his first year the group made its first profit for eight years; a decade later the company has a top-performing brand with a share price performance to match.

Mr Zeitz began his career at Colgate-Palmolive in New York and Hamburg, where he specialised in marketing. But at Puma he concentrated for the first four years on turning the group around financially, only later building the brand - previously regarded as something your parents would like - into one of the hottest in the high street, helped by tie-ins with sports stars such as the tennis champion Serena Williams. Marketing expenditure was increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of sales.
Mr Zeitz remains Puma's chief financial officer as well as chief executive.

He believes Puma's goal should not be growth for growth's sake; indeed sales are still far behind those of rival Adidas. His aim is to make Puma the most desirable "sports lifestyle" brand. That means being selective in the use of distribution channels and not selling everything to everyone.

Mr Zeitz does not give the impression he is about to slip on a pair of Puma shoes and run off to another firm. He says he prefers to spend time doing business - rather than attend conferences with Germany's great and good.
Ralph Atkins
Andy Hornby

Former Asda executive Andy Hornby, 37, has used his retail skills to spearhead HBOS's aggressive push into financial services.

Mr Hornby is chief executive of retail banking at HBOS, the UK's fourth largest bank, and has been one of the architects of the bank's strategy of offering customers "value for money" products.

He was closely involved in HBOS's high-profile advertising campaigns, which featured Howard, a singing bank manager, and which attacked the UK's Big Four clearing banks.

The strategy certainly seems to be working. HBOS attracted 1.2m new bank accounts and 1m new credit card accounts customers last year and profits at the retail bank rose by 19 per cent to GBP1.69bn.

Before he joined HBOS in 1999, Mr Hornby spent three years at Asda, the alma mater of Allan Leighton and Archie Norman, where he was one of a high-flying bunch of proteges. He held several roles including managing director of George, Asda's clothing business.

Mr Hornby, who was paid GBP680,000 in 2002, also has experience of other sectors: he was at Blue Circle and spent three years at the Boston Consulting Group working on projects in media and retail sectors.

An Oxford graduate, he was top out of 800 students in his Harvard MBA class, where his wife, Cathy, was a fellow student. He is also a non-executive director of GUS, the retail and business services conglomerate.

Mr Hornby, who has two young children, lives in North Yorkshire and spends his spare time watching horse racing and supporting his home team, Bristol City.
Jane Croft
Dennis Hennequin

Dennis Hennequin, 45, was appointed executive vice-president, Europe, of McDonald's in January 2004. A graduate in law and economics, Mr Hennequin is a McDonald's lifer who started with the company in
1984 as a restaurant manager and rose to become managing director of McDonald's France by 1996.

Under his leadership, McDonald's in France became one of the most profitable markets in the world and one of the group's main growth drivers in Europe over the last five years.

Mr Hennequin is at the centre of McDonald's efforts to tackle the threat of litigation and more intrusive regulation. He plans to introduce a pictogram-based "smart labelling" system that should be ready by the end of the year. Legal experts believe the new pan-European system of nutritional labelling will be an important element in McDonald's defence against future litigation.

Page 129 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
His latest promotion was a reward for McDonald's excellent results in France, which will account for almost a quarter of all European restaurant openings in 2004.

Mr Hennequin has lost no time introducing changes. In the most sweeping overhaul of the McDonald's menu in the chain's 50-year history, restaurants in 16 European countries will soon slash their line-up of burgers to make way for chicken salads, yoghurts and chopped fruit.

He will have to work hard. Introducing new products is difficult and in recent years McDonald's has struggled to replicate the success of chicken McNuggets, launched in 1983. Jo Johnson
Tony Hayward
When Tony Hayward cut his sometimes unruly hair, some BP watchers would speculate that Lord
Browne, the current chief executive, was about to step down.

Such is the reputation of the 46-year-old head of exploration and production that he is considered one of the potential next leaders of Europe's largest listed energy group. He is also a non-executive director at Corus and a member of Citibank's advisory board.

But Mr Hayward has  competition. BP has a bull pen full of 40-somethings: Ralph Alexander, chief executive of gas, power and renewables, John Manzoni, chief executive of refining and marketing, and Iain Conn, chief executive of petrochemicals.

They will all have to wait. Lord Browne made clear a few weeks ago that he intended to stay at BP until his natural retirement in 2008 as long as the board would have him. Barring any nasty surprises Mr Hayward has more time to prove himself.

Having done well as deputy to Dick Olver, Mr Hayward took up his reins as CEO of BP's most profitable division in January 2003.

But finding oil and gas is becoming more difficult and more expensive. Unlike Lord Browne, who made his name developing the Forties North Sea field, Mr Hayward, who gained much of his experience in Colombia and Venezuela, has no obvious career highlights.

Instead the geologist, who joined BP in 1982 after getting his PhD from Edinburgh university and spent time as Lord Browne's executive assistant, is said to have analytical powers second to none.
Carola Hoyos
Fred Goodwin

Fred Goodwin, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland since March 2000, has taken a small provincial bank and transformed it into the world's fifth largest. Further, he has done so through a string of successful acquisitions in an industry where such moves have a notoriously poor record.

The turning point was nearly four years ago, when he and Sir George Mathewson led RBS to victory in the bruising GBP22bn hostile bid for NatWest.

At the time, NatWest was three times the size of RBS and the bid was more than seven times the size of the previous largest hostile bank bid.

The swift and effective integration of the two banks and their information technology platforms by this amateur car mechanic has confounded the sceptics and RBS has used the firepower this gave it to make another 17 acquisitions.

Many of these have been in North American banking, where RBS is one of the few European banks to have established a real beachhead. Last year it bought the Churchill insurance company, making it the UK's second largest general insurer.

Until HSBC surpassed it a few days later, RBS in February briefly held the record for the largest profit reported by a UK bank, when it announced a GBP6.16bn profit before tax for 2003.

Recently, investors have begun to worry that Mr Goodwin will rush into another deal in the US or in continental Europe. He says he will give them back any funds he feels he cannot earn a sufficient return on. Aged just 44, Mr Goodwin has time on his side.

If ever there was a challenging time to take over leadership of a media company, it was 2002. The advertising industry had collapsed, revenues were plummeting and no improvement was in sight.

Mathias Dopfner took over as chief executive of Axel Springer, Europe's largest press publisher, at the beginning of that year. Since then, he has steered the media group through the worst industry crisis in decades, while at the same time sprucing it up for an increased presence on the capital markets.

A doctor of musicology and former editor of the daily Die Welt, Mr Dopfner had little management experience when he was appointed by controlling family shareholder Friede Springer, in spite of internal opposition.

But he quickly sought to discard the group's free-spending culture and launched an ambitious restructuring plan. Springer, which publishes Germany's mighty tabloid, Bild, has sold or closed a string of assets and shed more than one-tenth of its workforce.

At the same time, the prospect of a secondary offering of shares is no longer imminent. A US private equity firm took the bulk of a stake in Springer from Deutsche Bank last October and is prepared to wait a few years before exiting.

Now Springer can afford to think about spending again. Earnings almost doubled last year and sales from continuing operations edged up slightly in spite of the still-dismal advertising environment. The group launched its first foreign daily newspaper in Poland late last year. Mr Dopfner now has his eye on expansion in Russia, China and India - and aims to turn Springer into Germany's most profitable media group.

Sly Bailey
Sly Bailey faced a formidable task when she was appointed chief executive of Trinity Mirror, the UK
media group, last year.

Circulation at the company's flagship title, the Daily Mirror, was declining to near-record lows, some shareholders were calling for a sale of the group's national newspapers, and in the 42-year-old platinum blonde CEO's own words "progress ceased to be made" by previous management in the years following the company's transformative merger of 1999.

The appointment was also Ms Bailey's first at the helm of a publicly traded company. Within months of her tenure, Ms Bailey announced a reorganisation of the company that some critics have complained does not go far enough in addressing its structural problems. Still, shares in Trinity have risen more than
55 per cent under Ms Bailey's watch.

By most accounts, her biggest asset is a no-nonsense, tough-talking and action-oriented approach. It appears that the sheer force of her personality has even won over one of Trinity's harshest critics under earlier management: US investment firm Tweedy Browne.

Her rise to publishing stardom was not conventional. Ms Bailey's formal education ended at the age of 16 and was followed by a brief stint at drama school. At 22, after years of "clubbing and having a good time", she joined The Guardian's advertising sales department.

A few years later she held a series of senior commercial jobs at IPC and in 1994, aged 31, joined the magazine publisher's board. After being named chief executive, she oversaw the company's sale to Time Warner, the US media group, for GBP1.15bn.

Cristina Stenbeck

Talk about daunting. Cristina Stenbeck was only 24 when she took the reins of her father's Swedish business empire in August 2002, after he died suddenly from a heart attack at the age of 59.

It was not just her youth and inexperience that made the task ahead unusually challenging. The Stenbeck sphere spans media, telecommunications and other activities in more than 60 countries - companies
such as Tele2, the pan-European telecoms operator, and Metro International, the world's biggest free newspaper group. Several companies had such big debt loads that there were worries they would not survive.

Moreover, Jan Stenbeck had been so dominant that nobody quite knew what might emerge from the group's complex and opaque structure after his death.
Page 131 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fears have proved unfounded. Ms Stenbeck, now 26, has presided over a period of consolidation that has soothed investor nerves and brought strong share price performances by many of the companies in the family sphere.

Now she is broadening the competence of the various Stenbeck company boards and this week announced the appointment of Pehr Gyllenhammer, former head of Volvo, as chairman of the new holding company, Investment AB Kinnevik.

Ms Stenbeck had some preparation for the succession. She worked for Polo Ralph Lauren in New York for two years before joining the Stenbeck group. She reportedly attended her first management conference at the age of 14 and at 19 was elected a deputy board member of Invik.

Matteo Arpe

Matteo Arpe has the toughest banking job in Italy. Not only must he clean up Capitalia, formerly Banca di Roma and Italy's fourth largest bank by assets, but he must do so with a loan portfolio that hides more political skeletons than Westminster Abbey.

The job is made tougher by the presence of Cesare Geronzi, the long-time chairman whose dealmaking - and close friendship with Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio - allowed the mess to grow unchecked.

The 39-year-old Mr Arpe is prepared for the challenge. A speed-chess fanatic at school, he has never lost his tactical skills. He spent 12 years at the centre of Italian capitalism at Mediobanca, eventually overseeing the powerful investment bank's financial services group. Following a stint at Lehman Brothers, he came to Capitalia after two older hands failed to overcome Mr Geronzi's interference.

In little more than two years, Mr Arpe has moved rapidly. He has shored up the bank's weak capital ratios by drastically writing off bad loans and selling billions more. He has also placed no-nonsense young bankers from Wall Street firms in key positions once held by political appointees.

Still, the job is only half done. The Parmalat scandal and the bankruptcy of Cirio, another food group, have exposed many of the bank's worst habits from pre-Arpe days. Mr Geronzi is under judicial scrutiny in both cases, but he could try to bring down Mr Arpe with him. Unless Capitalia's key shareholders, notably ABN Amro, strongly side with Mr Arpe, Italian banking could register yet another loss, this one human.

Mikhail Fridman

There are no tough or sharp features in the appearance of Mikhail Fridman, 40, one of Russia's richest and most powerful businessmen.

A stocky man with gentle manner and a pudgy face, he could be mistaken for a jolly baker in a market town. In fact he is one of the country's smartest and toughest oligarchs, and is chairman of Alfa Group, a powerful financial and industrial empire.

His appearance is not the only thing that marks him out. Brought up in a traditional Jewish family in western Ukraine, far from the corridors of Moscow power, he used his brain and his ability to adapt to changing circumstances to rise to the top of Russia's business elite.

With some of his peers now in exile and others in jail, he has adjusted better than many to the regime of Vladimir Putin. Last year Mr Fridman pulled off one of the most spectacular transactions in Russia's corporate history. Alfa group and its partners sold half of their TNK oil company to BP for $6.75bn (GBP3.75bn), the biggest investment in Russia ever by a foreign company.

The deal was a double achievement for Mr Fridman: not only had he managed to sell his oil asset to a foreign company just as Russia started to get more protective of its natural resources, but he had also managed to sell it to his former sworn enemy.

But there are challenges ahead for Mr Fridman. Making the BP-TNK partnership work is one. Staying out of trouble with Russia's president is another. He will need all his business and political skills to remain
one of Russia's top businessmen.

An important day for the European Commission and the application of European competition rules came on 24 March. With its largest ever fine of e479m (Â£314.9m) against Microsoft, Mario Monti showed that European  competition rules can touch the biggest players. But with such a firm stance against Microsoft he has reopened the transatlantic  antitrust v competition debate.

TD
Many in the US have since criticised the Commission. Members of the US House of Representative's International Relations Committee are reported to have sent Monti an open letter complaining that he ignored the fact that the US authorities had already addressed  Microsoft competition issues. Microsoft itself, when talking to US journalists, stated that the Commission "today embarked on a remedy that shows so little regard for the work and decision-making of the US government...". However, is the Commission's decision really so far removed from the US authorities' decision?

In 2001 the US Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's finding that  Microsoft had maintained a monopoly in the market for operating systems, breaching Section 2 of the Sherman Act 1890. Likewise, the Commission has found that  Microsoft abused its dominant position by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows-operated PCs and non-Microsoft operating systems. In both jurisdictions, the fundamental elements of  Microsoft's business were found to be in breach of competition rules.

Where the decisions differ is in relation to tying additional products to the operating system. The US Court of Appeals held that, in order to decide whether the tying of  Microsoft's internet browser to its operating system was illegal, it was necessary to apply the "rule of reason". This required assessing the potential pro-competitive effects of the arrangement before deciding whether there was any breach of the antitrust rules. The Commission, however, has found that by tying its Media Player to its operating system, Microsoft deliberately abused its dominant position.

This divergence arises more from a difference between US and European  competition rules than from inconsistent decision-making. The Sherman Act does not contain the concept of dominant position, but makes the existence of a monopoly a violation of the antitrust rules, whereas abuse of a dominant position is a fundamental element of European competition rules. European case law recognises the existence of a super-dominant position when an undertaking has an excessively high market share of over 90 per cent, just like  Microsoft. The greater the undertaking's market share the greater its requirement to comply with European  competition rules. The Commission's decision was made against this backdrop.

Much has been made of the Commission's failure to reach a settlement with  Microsoft. This ignores the fact that the original US District Court judgment required  Microsoft to break into two companies. While this decision was reversed on appeal (some may say due to political pressure), it is harsher than the Commission's current sanctions. The US authorities did negotiate a settlement with  Microsoft, which aimed to open up the market by requiring it to license its operating protocols to competitors. The settlement is closely monitored by the US authorities, with the US courts issuing periodic status reports on Microsoft's compliance.



Page 134 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The most recent report is concerned that the effects of the arrangement are insufficient to open the operating systems market, suggesting that the US settlement is not working and is not robust enough to reduce Microsoft's monopoly. Monti must have been aware of this during his  Microsoft negotiations.

Not only would he have wanted to ensure that robust remedies were put in place, he was also looking to the future. He wants to see the market opened up and to ensure  Microsoft's dominance does not overflow into other markets. Whether his remedies (if they survive appeal) are sufficiently robust remains to be seen.

Microsoft Corp., which has settled 10 consumer  antitrust suits for $1.55 billion, agreed yesterday to resolve a similar suit in Minnesota for an undisclosed sum after one month of trial.

The Minnesota suit claimed that  Microsoft's Windows operating system monopoly drove up the price of software for consumers. Windows runs about 95 percent of the world's personal computers. The consumers sought at least $425 million, which could have been tripled under state law.

TD
Microsoft also settled legal disputes with Sun Microsystems Inc. earlier this month for $1.6 billion and a patent suit last week with InterTrust Technologies Corp. for $440 million. The company is facing a
$597 million fine from the European Commission, which ruled that the company illegally stifled
competition and ordered it to share some data with rivals.

"What's interesting about  Microsoft's settlement is that since the EU decision, the company has made three significant cases go away," said Colin Underwood, an attorney at Proskauer Rose LLP. "They may have been concerned about what effect the EU's decision could have on these cases and trying to clear the decks to focus their attention on their appeal."

E-mails disclosed at the Minnesota trial showed a  Microsoft executive said Windows had been compared with a "toll bridge," with the company collecting $45 on every personal computer sold.

Microsoft attorneys apologized for the company's past anticompetitive behavior after the judge presiding over the case ruled that jurors should be told that an appeals court found that  Microsoft had violated federal  antitrust law.

"This has been a hard-fought battle. We're very pleased with the result, otherwise we wouldn't have settled at this time," said Richard Hagstrom, an attorney for the consumers.
Terms of the Minnesota settlement are being worked out and will be released in early July, Microsoft
spokeswoman Stacy Drake said. The case is the only consumer  antitrust suit against Microsoft to
go to trial. Ten similar suits are still pending against the company.

Drake said the decision to settle the Minnesota case wasn't related to the EU's findings.  Microsoft is appealing the fine.

"We remained confident in our case, but we've said that we'd be open to looking at reasonable ways of settling this case," Drake said.
Shares of Redmond, Wash.-based  Microsoft rose 37 cents to $25.53 in Nasdaq trading yesterday.

HD           Microsoft settles suit; Minnesota  trial ends after five weeks

Microsoft and attorneys representing Minnesota consumers abruptly settled their class-action lawsuit
Monday after five weeks of testimony in Hennepin County District Court.

The suit alleged that the software giant misused its pricing power to overcharge customers for its operating systems, word-processing software and spreadsheet programs. Terms of the settlement won't be disclosed for several months, until they are approved by a Hennepin County district judge in
``early summer,''  Microsoft said. Plaintiffs' attorneys said settlement terms probably would come in
July.

TD
Nobody understood why  Microsoft took the risk of going to trial in Minnesota, the only state where it did not settle in advance. And it was unclear Monday why  Microsoft folded its defense.
``It's all a mystery,'' said Robert H. Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore. ``Maybe
Microsoft decided to call the plaintiffs' bluff and see if they had good evidence.''

Microsoft previously paid $1.55 billion to settle similar suits in nine other states and the District of
Columbia. Adjusted to today's dollars, plaintiffs in the Minnesota suit sought damages ranging from
$340 million to $505 million.

That would cover about 1 million state consumers and businesses that allegedly were overcharged when they bought Microsoft Windows, Word or Excel software from 1994 to 2001. Consumers who purchased Microsoft products during that period will be able to apply online for partial refunds.
.
European angle

Colin Underwood, an  antitrust lawyer with the New York law firm of Proskauer Rose, said  Microsoft might have settled the Minnesota case as part of a strategy to clean up  antitrust-related lawsuits in the United States before appealing  antitrust penalties in Europe.

The European Commission in March said Microsoft was an abusive monopolist; it required Microsoft to change its business practices and fined the company $603 million, the largest  fine Europe has ever imposed on a company in an antitrust case.

Because Microsoft soon will seek to have its European antitrust penalties suspended pending appeal, this would be a good time to eliminate any domestic antitrust embarrassments, Underwood said. He noted that  Microsoft recently agreed to pay Sun Microsystems $1.6 billion to settle an antitrust suit.

``My belief is that  Microsoft is not concerned about the payment of money here,'' Underwood said. ``A finding of anticompetitive behavior in the U.S. market might have a much greater reach than the amount of the damages awarded in that case.''

Richard Hagstrom, a plaintiffs' attorney with the Minneapolis firm of Zelle, Hofmann, Voelbel, Mason & Gette, labeled the settlement ``a done deal'' even though some details remain to be worked out.

``I can't disclose any of the terms until we get through the binding arbitration that wraps up the few odds and ends that are left. But we're very pleased with the result,'' Hagstrom said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the settlement.
.
Settlement claims

Few details were disclosed about how consumers and businesses will claim their share of the settlement money. But Hagstrom said consumers will not need to produce sales receipts for long-ago purchases.

``Consumers will be able to print a form off a Web site, describe what they had and when they purchased it, then sign the form under penalty of perjury,'' Hagstrom said.

Since the trial began March 15, plaintiffs' attorneys have been presenting their case to the jury and Microsoft has been cross-examining witnesses. Microsoft had been expected to begin its presentation to the jury soon, and had promised that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates would testify.

The jury of eight women and four men was dismissed Monday, but its members could not be reached for comment.

The named claimants in the suit were Daniel Gordon, Michael Stolle, Brandon Welter, David Ellingson and Kari Wallace, all Minnesota residents at the time of the alleged  antitrust violations, and two businesses, Vocal Signs, a business that appears to have closed, and Reclaim Center Inc. in St. Paul.

The plaintiffs based their case on the idea that  Microsoft's business practices had hurt consumers and businesses by forcing competitors out of business. Plaintiffs argued this had reduced the number of choices for software purchases and enabled  Microsoft to overcharge for PC operating systems, word processing software and spreadsheet programs.

But in its defense,  Microsoft compared itself with low-price merchant Wal-Mart and told the jury that while it had bruised some competitors, it had never harmed consumers.

The plaintiffs' attorneys in the Minnesota suit built their case around witnesses as well as e-mails and internal memos from  Microsoft and its corporate customers. Software executive Jerry Kaplan told the jury that his once-promising California software company, Go Corp., had been driven out of business by Microsoft, which he said stole his firm's technology and used its clout to undermine Go's business deals and fundraising efforts. Internal  Microsoft memos and e-mails from the early 1990s appeared to support Kaplan's allegations.

But Microsoft said that Go Corp. failed because of internal management mistakes, and that Kaplan wanted to blame  Microsoft for Go's troubles.

Plaintiffs' attorneys also alleged that  Microsoft hurt competitors by spreading negative rumors about rival products, bundling products into Windows, forcing computer makers to accept restrictive contracts and misleading other software developers into believing  Microsoft was abandoning Windows. Microsoft attorneys dispute those claims and said they were based on fragmentary and misleading information.
The Minnesota  antitrust suit was far more limited in scope than the federal lawsuit that was settled in
2001 and ordered changes in  Microsoft's business practices. But the Minnesota suit was greatly
influenced by the federal case, which established that  Microsoft had violated monopoly law in
Minnesota as a result of violating federal law.

Concluding a five-year investigation on March 24, 2004, the European  Competition Commission found that Microsoft Corporation engaged in anticompetitive activity that broke European Union  competition law.1 In short, the Commission found that  Microsoft had leveraged its near monopoly in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group server operating systems and for media players.2
The penalties to be incurred by  Microsoft include a fine in excess of $600 million; forced production of a stripped-down version of Windows excluding Media Player; and certain disclosure of interface data to allow competitor interoperability with Windows.3

TD
Even though the Commission's investigation addressed  Microsoft's conduct regarding media players and low-end servers operating systems, the remedies it ordered go beyond the Department of Justice's Nov. 12, 2002 final judgment against  Microsoft that addressed browsers.4 The precise extent of this divergence between United States and European regulators is uncertain since the Commission's decision is in its incipient stages, yet some conclusions can be drawn from the already voiced negative reactions of the Department of Justice, concerned members of Congress and  antitrust commentators.

Mario Monti, the Commission's chief  antitrust enforcer, is widely credited with being the driving force behind the Microsoft ruling.5 Monti explained in the Commission's press release announcing the decision that "[d]ominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation."6
According to the Commission, Microsoft not only failed in executing this responsibility, but it also abused its position by leveraging its monopoly in PC Operating Systems.7 Specifically, the Commission found
two distinct violations: one, Microsoft abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Microsoft PCs and non-Microsoft servers; and two,  Microsoft illegally tied Windows Media Player with the Windows operating system.8

To redress these violations, the Commission ordered three remedies. First,  Microsoft has 120 days to disclose the necessary information about Windows to rival makers of software for computer servers to allow these competitors to produce programs that seamlessly work with  Microsoft's own server software.9 Second, the company must, within 90 days, offer a version of Windows with the media player stripped out.10 Finally, the Commission  fined Microsoft 497.2 million euros ($603 on March 25).11 In addition, similar to the final judgment's appointment of a Technical Committee, the Commission will appoint a Monitoring Trustee to ensure that  Microsoft completes its responsibilities in a timely manner.12

A few observations about the EU's remedies, which are only effective in Europe, merit discussion. Without a doubt,  Microsoft will reveal its protected intellectual property when it complies with the requirement that it provide for interoperability by handing over its interface data to rival companies.13
Microsoft argues that this is a draconian remedy, akin to ordering a film company to hand over its movie scripts to rival companies.14 Apparently attempting to mollify  Microsoft's concerns, the EU stated that Microsoft is entitled to "reasonable remuneration" for its protected intellectual property.15 It is unclear


Page 141 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
whether such licenses will be sufficient, certainly  Microsoft does not believe they will be adequately compensated.

In addition, although Microsoft must create a version of Windows in which the media player has been unbundled, Microsoft is free to continue to market the current, bundled version.16  Microsoft is
restricted in that it cannot favor the bundled version by offering discounts to manufacturers conditional on their purchase of Windows together with the media player, however the company may charge the same price for the bundled and unbundled versions.17 Consequently, an important question about efficacy of the remedy arises -- whether Windows lacking media player will effectively compete with the bundled version. At this point in time, it seems unlikely that such a paired down version will be attractive to purchasers more likely to buy the complete package for the same price.18

It should come as no surprise that the Commission's decision has precipitated much discussion and concern from United States  antitrust officials, members of Congress and  antitrust practitioners. These commentators have flagged the previous observations, and generally seem concerned with the perceived breadth of the decision, as related to both  Microsoft and future United States corporations that find their European operation the target of Commission investigations. To be sure, comment and apprehension regarding the meaning and implications of the decision are well deserved.

It was clear upon notice of the decision that the Commission knew its rulings would be evaluated against the backdrop of the Justice Department's final judgment.19 The Commission initially volunteered a comparison, stating that where there were similarities in the two cases, it did "take on board those points where the US settlement had addressed its own concerns."20 The EU was quick to flag, however, that the case it pursued included facts different from those presented in the Department of Justice's action.21
Moreover, EU law (e.g., there is no U.S. counterpart to Article 82) necessitated a different analysis than was conducted in the United States.22 As a result, the Commission's interoperability and tying decisions were significantly different than those embodied in the final judgment.23
Assistant Attorney General for  Antitrust, R. Hewitt Pate, recognized this asymmetry in a March 24, 2004
Justice Department press release.24 Pate noted that the enforcement approach pursued by the
Commission included a 'code removal' remedy, which was notably absent from the final judgment.25
When the United States crafted the appropriate remedy, it took the position that code removal "would
impose a wholly unnecessary and artificial restraint on software design and could have adverse
implications for consumers."26 Consequently, code removal was shunned by the Justice Department.27
Pate's press release reiterated the potential deleterious ramifications of code removal, stating "[s]ound
antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies. A
contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm
innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."28 The fact that a bedrock of the EU decision had
been wholly rebuffed by the Justice Department illustrates once again the significant dissimilarities
between EU and U.S.  competition policies.

In addition to the United States' central code removal concerns, Pate also took exception to the size of the fine imposed by the EU.29 In particular, Pate highlighted the fact that it is the largest  antitrust fine ever levied, which creates an inevitable perception problem regarding the "appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities" since Microsoft's conduct, which is unilateral and consequently a controversial and ambiguous area of antitrust law, is fined in excess of members of the most "notorious" price cartels.30

Pate did acknowledge some consonance in the two decisions. In particular, the interoperability remedy parallels the United States' approach. The EU's decision highlighted the importance of  Microsoft providing competing software developers with the necessary technical specifications such that they are able to build Windows-compatible products.31 To accomplish this interoperability, the EU will require Microsoft to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation.32 Similarly, the final judgment seeks to achieve an analogous compatibility through mandating several  Microsoft technology disclosures.33

Despite this concession of correlation, the Justice Department seems to have taken the position that the EU decision represents a gross divergence from the final judgment, a sentiment echoed by several members of Congress and the private  antitrust bar.34 Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, for example, condemned the decision, claiming that the Commission targeted  Microsoft, "whose products and technologies have been engines of global economic growth."35 Frist went on to castigate the excessive fine on Microsoft, arguing that this is money that belongs to  Microsoft shareholders rather than Commission bureaucrats.36 Moreover, he reiterated Pate's critique of the code removal remedy, calling it inherently anti-consumer, since  Microsoft will now be forced to expend valuable resources creating a paired down version of Windows, rather than continue with its tradition of innovation.37 Other commentators have mirrored Pate's and Frist's qualms, indicating that this recent decision illustrates diverging competition policies between the United States and the EU.38

Only time will tell the true impact of the Commission's  Microsoft decision, as well as how greatly it actually differs from the United States' final judgment. As an initial matter, Microsoft will appeal the EU decision to the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance by June.39 Microsoft's best grounds for appeal seems to be based on the compulsory licenses mandated by the Commission.40 In addition to
the sure appeal,  Microsoft will also try to persuade United States trade officials to register a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the grounds that the decision violates the Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.41 Any success  Microsoft has at overturning all or part of the Commission's decision, however, appears as though it will come along the appellate avenue, rather than from a WTO complaint.42

Justices to hearfalse-arrest case
Bloomberg News

TD
The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear an appeal by Washington state police trying to fend off a suit by a motorist who was arrested for tape-recording them after they stopped his car.

At stake is whether police can be sued for false arrest for taking someone into custody on an invalid charge, even if the suspect could have been charged with an unrelated offense.

The recording wasn't illegal, and the man later sued for false arrest. The police officers say the arrest was valid because they could have charged him instead with impersonating a police officer.

A federal appeals court ruled for the motorist, saying an arrest on an invalid charge can't be upheld unless police could have filed a different charge over the same conduct. The motorist's use of flashing lights on his car, similar to those on police cars, wasn't related to his use of a tape recorder, the court said in granting a new trial in his false arrest suit.
The appeals court ruling "will frustrate the administration of justice by encouraging law enforcement
officers to stack charges" to ensure an arrest is considered valid, lawyers for the two troopers said in court
papers.

Microsoft to settlesuit in Minnesota
Bloomberg News

Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software company, agreed Monday to settle an  antitrust suit filed by
Minnesota consumers that could have cost the company as much as $1.3 billion if it lost the case.

Microsoft spokeswoman Stacy Drake said terms of the settlement are still being worked out and will be announced later this year. The settlement came amid a trial, the first ever for consumer  antitrust suit against Microsoft. The company has settled similar suits in 10 states for $1.55 billion.

Microsoft faces a $594 million  fine from the European Commission, which accused the company of maintaining a monopoly over Windows software and stifling competition. Microsoft plans to appeal the fine.

The Minnesota lawsuit alleged  Microsoft's Windows monopoly drove up the price of software for consumers. The plaintiffs sought at least $425 million, which could have been trebled under state law.

SUMMARY

The law provides adequate protection of property and contractual rights, including guarantees against expropriation, but institutions for enforcement are weak. This is especially apparent in commercial law, with judges demonstrating little grasp of new laws. The reform of the judicial system has yet to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, which is compromised by executive interference. The risk of foreign investors being subject to discrimination is low, but public procurement procedures have suffered from a lack of transparency that has benefited domestic companies. The adoption of new public procurement procedures and the introduction of a right of appeal in the award of public contracts will help. The legal framework of  competition policy is almost complete, but enforcement is inadequate. The risk of price
controls being re-imposed is small. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index will continue to fall as the energy sector is deregulated, restructured and privatised in 2004-05.
ANALYSIS
Red tape is pervasive and a major impediment to business (High Risk)

The bureaucracy and the difficulties of dealing with it can vary greatly between regions and sectors, but overall Romania is one of the most difficult countries in the region in which to do business without
resorting to bribery. It can take from 49 to 102 days to register a new company: 83 pages of forms have to be completed (in the US it takes a day and 7 pages). It can take an excessive amount of time to secure
the necessary zoning permits, property titles, licenses and utility connections. Regulations change frequently and without advance notice. These changes can add significantly to costs and make it difficult
to develop effective business plans. The bureaucracy can be a significant burden for foreign investors, but it can be handled by following a few rules of thumb. It is helpful to work with a local Romanian partner to alleviate some of these problems. Investors can also be selective about where they locate: Timisoara in Transylvania has become a favoured location for foreign business and Bucharest has improved under the present City Hall regime. The mayor of Bucharest, Traian Basescu, has opened a one-stop shop for investors in City Hall: previously investors needed 13 permits, collected in person from 13 different offices, to operate in Bucharest.
Foreign investors are disadvantaged by a lack of transparency in forthcoming major privatisations (High
Risk)

The state privatisation agency, APAPS, faces thousands of court challenges in disputes arising from previous privatisations. The numbers reflect the ease with which interested parties, including workers and

Page 147 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
managers as well as buyers, can take legal action. More than one hundred of these cases involve serious attempts to cancel privatisation contracts. There have been a number of recent controversial cases of cancelled privatisations involving foreign investors, as well as instances in which the process has been less than transparent. The government is under pressure from the IMF to change its overall attitude towards privatisation, and to avoid imposing conditions to preserve employment or rapidly increase investments in privatised companies. Checking commitments on employment and investment, and suing non-performing firms, has become one of the main activities of the state privatisation agency. Frequent
delays in privatisation deals and changes in the terms of privatisation in other cases, have also heightened concerns about transparency. Although the law guarantees equal treatment to domestic and foreign investors, in practice the lack of transparency of the regulatory system has often worked against
non-locals. Investors should insist that forthcoming sales be handled in a transparent way and in line with international standards.
BACKGROUND
(Background material is updated twice yearly. Last update: March 22nd, 2004) Enforceability of Contracts
Most of the legal framework of a market economy is in place in Romania. However, the institutions to implement or enforce it are either weak or have not yet been established. Romanian law thus affords adequate protection of property and contractual rights, but the legal system is unable to arbitrate effectively property rights and contractual disputes. Foreign companies often express concern about the
lack of international commercial experience of Romanian courts. Judges generally have little experience of the functioning of a market economy, international business methods or the application of new commercial laws. The weakness of the judicial system is particularly apparent with regard to commercial law. Romania's bankruptcy law contains provisions for the liquidation of bankrupt enterprises that are
consistent with Western legal standards, but the lack of qualified personnel hampers the application of
law. Although it is possible to pursue administrative liquidation as an alternative to bankruptcy--thus saving
the company and creditors a lengthy and costly judicial process--the lack of legal personnel means it is
hard to get these cases into court and to obtain consistent judgements.

Other problems reflect the failure to determine who are the legal owners of assets--this is a particular problem with regard to land--and the continued failure to settle property-restitution claims dating from before the communist period. There are a large number of outstanding cases involving property nationalised during the communist period, with Romania having done less to resolve these claims than any other non-Soviet Eastern-bloc country. This undoubtedly causes some uncertainty, but it is of limited concern to foreign investors: since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 there have no cases of foreign assets being expropriated. The Stimulation of Direct Investment Law includes a guarantee against nationalisation and expropriation of assets, and allows investors to choose the court or arbitration body they want to settle any potential legal action.
Independence of the Judiciary

Romania has made progress in reforming its legal system in recent years, but much remains to be done to improve the independence of the judiciary. The involvement of the executive in judicial affairs continues to be a problem. For example, in March 2001 the Ministry of Justice sent a circular letter to courts asking them to pay attention to the social consequences in cases involving the restitution of nationalised houses. The Ministry of Justice also wields great influence over the Superior Council of Magistracy, which makes decisions about the transfer or removal of judges, as the former appoints one-third of Council members
and the Minister chairs its meetings. During the first half of 2001 a number of court presidents and
vice-presidents were removed from their posts without clear reasons being given. Also, the Constitutional
Courtâs decisions may be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the parliament, which constitutes a serious
infringement of judicial independence.

Measures have been taken by the government to improve the efficiency of the judicial system. A revised version of the Civil Procedure Code came into force in April 2001, aimed at speeding up legal proceedings and improving the enforcement of judicial decisions, with disciplinary action now a possibility where unexplained delays take place. In a separate measure, the government made it necessary for judges to publish a reasoning for all their decisions (previously this was necessary only in cases involving appeals to higher courts).

However, a few of the changes in the Civil Procedure Code have raised concern. The overburdened Supreme Court has been given additional tasks (hearing appeals in commercially significant cases) and the process of simplifying procedures has restricted greatly the right to appeal in certain cases. Also of concern is the extension of the Prosecutor-Generalâs right to introduce extraordinary appeals against judicial decisions. This provision already existed in Romanian law but an Emergency Ordinance extends

Page 148 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the period (from six months to one year) during which extraordinary appeals can be brought; allows extraordinary appeals to be made before all other legal avenues have been exhausted; and makes the right to introduce such appeals more discretionary (they can now be exercised against âobviously ungrounded judicial decisionsâ, an ill-defined criterion). This is a concern as the extension of such extraordinary procedures risks undermining the principle of legal certainty.

The lack of competence of many members of the judiciary and their relatively low status is another concern. Magistrates continue to rank among the best paid public officials, but changes in the wages policy means that this preference is being eroded. Unlike other public employees, magistrates did not receive a wage adjustment in 2001 to compensate for inflation. Low wages make judges susceptible to bribery. Training for judges is improving: the initial training period has been extended to two years with effect from academic year 2001/02 and the training programmes broadened-âbut attention needs to be given to intensifying training in the specific fields of anti-trust and state aid legislation. Preserving the National Institute of Magistracy as the sole entry point for a career as a judge and granting it
self-governing status are important in developing an independent and professional judiciary.

Corruption is a widespread and systemic problem that undermines the legal system, the economy and public confidence in government. A study published by the World Bank in March 2001 found that corruption and bribery have become institutionalised in Romania and Transparency International ranked Romania 69 out of 90 countries in 2001 (with the 90th country being the most corrupt). Frequent changes
in legal regulations and their discretionary interpretation by public officials encourages corruption. The civil service is over-staffed and underpaid and highly susceptible to corruption, with a culture of bribe-taking being pervasive. In a recent survey, 51% of Romanian companies revealed that they frequently had to provide bribes to run their business. Reports on the funding of all political parties have indicated that expenditure (especially election expenditure) is substantially higher than declared revenue. In order to address this potential source of corruption, Romania needs to adopt a fully transparent system of party funding.

Despite a general recognition of the seriousness of the problem, and its negative impact on the business environment, measures to tackle the problem by successive governments have been limited and ineffective. A new law on the prevention and punishment of acts of corruption came into force in May
2000, designed to penalise corrupt behaviour in the private sector that distorts  competition. A special
Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Unit was set up within the Prosecutor-Generalâs office in October
2000, with the task of leading the fight against corruption. However, it has never functioned due to a lack
of staff and equipment. Secondary legislation detailing institutional arrangements for the anti-corruption
section has not yet been adopted and as a result there has been virtually no progress in implementing the
anti-corruption law. Out of 38 posts for prosecutors, less than half are filled. The division of tasks among
the various bodies involved in tackling corruption remains unclear, and co-ordination among them needs
to be improved. Just about the only positive development in the fight against corruption was the adoption,
in April 2001, of an ordinance introducing public procurement procedures and establishing the right to
appeal against the award of public contracts.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

The foreign investment regime is liberal and foreign companies are subject to little active discrimination. The law commits Romania to equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors, provides protection against nationalisation and expropriation and guarantees the right of foreign investors to repatriate profits. Foreign investors may participate in privatisation bids and there are no limits set on the level of permitted foreign participation in commercial companies.
Although there are no specific restrictions on inward direct investment, the law is ambiguous and
open-ended regarding âsensitiveâ sectors where prior authorisation can be imposed through âspecial laws.â
The constitution forbids the purchase of real estate by non-nationals. However, companies established in
the country, even if wholly foreign-owned, can purchase land for the purposes of business, although they
are prohibited from purchasing agricultural land. In law, domestic and foreign enterprises are treated
equally in terms of public procurement, but in practice bidding procedures have suffered from a lack of
transparency. Sales of state assets to foreigners have often been stymied by vested interests or become
subject to political wrangling within government. The adoption, in April 2001, of an ordinance introducing
public procurement procedures and establishing the right to appeal against the award of public contracts
should alleviate some of these problems.

Following an agreement with the international financial institutions, discretionary incentives for foreign investors were abolished in 1999, but investors were compensated with the introduction of major tax cuts in corporate tax (reduced from 38% to 25%), VAT (reduced to 19% from a standard rate of 22%) and excise duty (revised and still at a lower level than minimum rates in the EU) at the start of 2000. However, several tax initiatives aimed at promoting investment have been introduced, and in July 2001 a law on the promotion of investments came into force. The law covers large-scale investments and grants tax
Page 149 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
exemptions and fiscal facilities for cash greenfield projects that exceed US$1m, and includes other measures to improve the business environment.

As well as the incentives for large investors, Romaniaâs six free-trade zones all offer customs and tax incentives. These include unrestricted entry and re-export of goods, as well as exemption from customs duties and value-added tax. They also include an exemption from profit taxes for the duration of a companyâs operations in free-trade zones. There are also concessions made in âdisadvantaged zonesâ (regions with high unemployment), including full restitution of import duties for depreciable goods; exemption from profit tax; exemption from any fees associated with re-zoning of agricultural land for industrial purposes; and access to a special development fund for stimulating exports, guaranteeing external credits, and financing special programmes and state-sponsored equity investments.

The most significant impediment to foreign investors is Romania's unpredictable legal and regulatory system. Excessive red tape makes any investment unnecessarily time-consuming and costly. There is now a robust framework of  competition law, which forbids price fixing,  abuse of market position and lays
down guidelines for the behaviour of monopolies. However, the lack of regulatory transparency, combined with the lack of transparency in the privatisation of state assets, continues to work against the interests of foreign investors. Some improvement can be expected given that the government is prioritising investment promotion as part of its national industrial strategy, in particular through the simplification of legal and administrative procedures. The authorities have created a new government department for relations with foreign investors, which will act as a one-stop shop for investments above US$10m.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Romania has made great progress in creating a legal framework in the area of  competition policy that is broadly aligned with the EUâs aquis communautaire (the body of EU law). However, the legal framework is still incomplete and enforcement is inadequate.

After more than a decade of transition, the private sector is still under-developed and state enterprises continue to play a major role in many sectors of the economy, such as the utilities, finance and manufacturing. State support for loss-making state enterprises continues to distort the investment environment and prevents the efficient allocation of capital. A new law on state aid came into effect in January 2000, aimed at regulating and controlling the provision of state aid (in the form of direct state subsidies, debt rescheduling and favourable prices). However, implementation of the law has been slow, and the granting of preferential debt rescheduling for state-owned enterprises continues to undermine attempts to create a more competitive business environment. The existing legislation covers the basic principles of state aid control, but the field of application of the law is not comprehensive and numerous state aid measures are not notified to the  competition authorities. The national state aid monitoring authority is the  Competition Office, which operates under the authority of the Ministry of Public Finance. The investigative and decision-making body is the Competition Council, which dealt with 72 state aid cases in 2000, and has broad powers to enforce competition rules. However, the state aid authorities were not consulted systematically on all state aid measures and in some cases their opinions were not observed by the government. Romania needs to adopt the required secondary legislation on state aids (now under preparation) as a precondition for effective enforcement activity. A large number of unaligned state aid schemes remains, such as the profit tax rate of 6% on export earnings and the law on direct investment promotion. Implementation of state aid policy in sensitive areas is still at an early stage.

In the field of anti-trust law, Romaniaâs legislation is largely in line with, and covers most of, the acquis provisions. However, further secondary legislation still needs to be adopted. The enforcement record of the Competition Council has improved. In 2000, the Council Board handled 437 cases, including two prohibition decisions concerning vertical restraints and horizontal co-operation agreements. However, the Council needs to focus its resources more effectively on cases that present the most serious distortion to competition. A more deterrent sanctioning policy is also necessary. General transparency, including improved public access to relevant documents, needs to increase.
Intellectual Property Rights

Romania has enacted legislation protecting patents, trademarks and copyrights, but the unlicensed use of intellectual property--in particular the piracy of compact discs and CD-ROMs--remains a problem due to weak enforcement. Romania fails to provide its border and other authorities sufficient legal authority, resources and tools to combat the widespread piracy of copyrighted works. This inadequate enforcement against copyright piracy led to Romania being placed on the US governmentâs Special 301 Watch List in
2002. The  European Commission has repeatedly criticised Romaniaâs record on safeguarding intellectual property rights, as has the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA).
There has been some improvement in recent years. The video piracy rate, which was once estimated at
100%, has fallen to about 60% due to more vigorous police action and the entry of legitimate businesses

into the market in 2000. Since the implementation of copyright law, the piracy rate for business software is estimated to have declined from a high of 95% in the early 1990s. According to the Global Piracy Report
of the Business Software Alliance, a private-sector industry group supported by  Microsoft and other major players, 70% of software in use in Romania was not licensed. In dollar terms, this amounted to an estimated US$25.5m in lost revenue to the software makers. However, Romanian criminal courts have concluded very few cases concerning copyright and related rights. Furthermore, the deterrence effect of
the financial penalties for non-compliance is limited because they are constantly being eroded by inflation. A new bill under consideration by the Romanian Copyright Office (ORDA) will provide for higher  fines of US$500-5,000, grant a sui generis right to database producers for 15 years, extend the software copyright protection period from 50 to 70 years and introduce special regulations regarding intellectual property rights for materials available on the Internet.
Price Controls

There is little threat of price controls being imposed. Most price controls were abolished in 1997, and the government will resist calls for their reinstatement unless there is a severe economic crisis. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index is 18%, of which 9% are energy prices. These remaining price controls create large distortions, which can be costly to the economy. Thus the decision by the previous government to cap energy prices at their August 2000 levels had a deleterious impact on enterprise sector financial discipline. In order to bring energy prices above cost recovery levels, electricity and energy prices for household consumption increased by 6% and 15% in April and July 2001, respectively. Under its agreement with the IMF, the government is committed to a series of further adjustments in energy prices in 2002-03, which are required to reduce the losses of the main
thermoelectric power producer. The deregulation, restructuring and privatisation of the energy sector is the centrepiece of the governmentâs stand-by programme with the IMF, which aims gradually to eliminate
state subsidies and improve tariff collection.

The fixed-line telephony market was liberalised on January 1st 2003, breaking the monopoly of the national operator, Romtelecom, in which the Greek company OTE has a 53% stake, after acquiring an additional 18% share in November 2002. Twenty operators (including companies from Europe, the US and Asia) and four state-owned operators, including Romania Post, are interested in entering the market. Romtelecomâs monopoly position had contributed to high tariffs, low levels of penetration, and a consequent high level of usage of mobile phones, particularly on long-distance calls, where charges were comparable with fixed-line charges. Increased  competition forced Romtelecom to reduce tariffs for
long-distance calls in early 2003, although it increased charges for local calls. Liberalisation is expected to result in a fall in tariffs of at least 30% (and perhaps up to 50%) in 23 major cities, and an increase in telephone-line density.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union  antitrust regulators are investigating whether member governments illegally favored Intel Corp. chips in public procurement deals, EU officials said Wednesday.

An investigation was opened after the EU head office received complaints from Intel's competitors. Officials would not name the companies that lodged complaints.

TD
Intel's largest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., had complained to the  European Commission in October 2000 about Intel's alleged monopolistic  abuse. The company has a strong presence in Europe, producing its microprocessor wafers in Dresden, Germany, where it is building a second plant. It declined to comment Wednesday.

Under EU rules, government agencies are free to specify what standards they require for their computer systems when putting out bids for tender. Such details, including the speed at which microchips should operate, must not exclude competitors, said EU spokesman Jonathan Todd.

EU officials said they did not know why governments put Intel-only clauses in bid requirements. They also said they didn't know the total number of contracts involved, but said the countries involved were
Germany and Italy.

Both countries have received a request to provide information within two months. Regulators then must decide whether to bring court cases to change the practices.

Intel said it was evaluating questions from the EU head office. Spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the company was also investigating how the Intel-only requirements came about.
"Based on our understanding, there is no allegation of wrongdoing on Intel's part," Mulloy said.

Five other countries -- Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands -- are being probed. But they have not received formal requests for information.

Todd cited Sweden, which forced municipal governments to change Intel-only procurement rules earlier this year, as a model for fixing the problem. If other countries do the same, Todd said the investigations will be dropped.

"We hope to resolve this in satisfactory manner without further infringement," he said. "As ever with public procurement, we want open and competitive procedures."

While less important than the EU's  antitrust crackdown on Microsoft Corp., which resulted in a record fine of about $600 million, the case resembles attempts by Microsoft's Linux competitors to abolish any public-procurement requirements for proprietary software standards. In recent months, EU governments have been taking the side of open software standards.

SUMMARY

The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. The Hungarian judicial system operates under clearly specified guidelines. Even so, some reforms are still needed to harmonise Hungarian law with EU standards; the transparency of the legal system is inadequate; and delays in processing court cases are a major problem. As a result, contract disputes are
unlikely to be dealt with speedily. Regulatory disputes have arisen over the government's use of price caps in certain sectors. In particular, foreign pharmaceutical companies have complained in the past about their treatment at the hands of the government. The Socialists, who came to power in 2002, have been
reluctant or slow to address the wrongs of the Fidesz administration. More worryingly, the Socialist-led government has whittled away the powers of some nominally independent regulatory bodies in an effort to replace Fidesz appointments with individuals more loyal to the sitting government.
ANALYSIS
Judicial reform is delayed, keeping the courts overburdened and slow (Moderate Risk)

The court system is overburdened and scarce budgetary resources are making it difficult for remaining judicial reforms that would help streamline procedures to be implemented. Depending on the issue and the court, firms can wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. After years of delay,
however, the Socialist-led administration has finally established five Courts of Appeal at the county level, which should help alleviate the Supreme Courtâs substantial backlog of cases. But the  European               Commission in its most recent accession report noted that a lack of adequate funding was still hampering the establishment of additional regional courts, which would streamline processes further. Businesses will want to pursue accelerated procedures that are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for intellectual property violations. Businesses may also want to include in their contracts that disputes be settled by binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The government maintains the use of price caps in sensitive sectors (Low Risk)

The previous government used the argument that there is no real  competition in certain sectors as a rationale to force utilities, including telecoms, and pharmaceuticals to implement price increases that lag inflation. It also expanded the use of price caps in the pharmaceuticals market to drugs not subject to government subsidies and thus not originally subject to price caps of any kind. The government's ambitious inflation targets and need to reduce its fiscal deficit intensified the use of such methods to the

detriment of companies' profitability. As part of Hungaryâs drive for EU membership, it must phase out
most regulated prices. Although a more business-friendly government has been in power since May 2002,
it has been slow to move on deregulation, until now. As a result, Hungary is now in the midst of energy
market liberalisation, which is resulting in rising prices in the short to medium term. This leaves
pharmaceuticals as one of the last markets with regulated prices. Companies operating in this sector have
repeatedly clashed with the government over price rises, with the current administration cancelling an
agreement by its predecessor and replacing it with a less favourable pricing scheme. The government has
also favoured domestic producers, especially in its regulation of generic drugs. International
pharmaceutical companies should lobby government officials to present their case for their proposed
pricing schemes and removal of price caps. Companies should also be prepared for a slow deregulation
process.
BACKGROUND
(Background material is updated twice yearly. Last update: March 22nd, 2004) Enforceability of Contracts
Among the EU candidate countries, Hungaryâs reforms have proceeded furthest for those necessary to create a market economy, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Contract disputes may be taken to court, but the court system is severely overburdened. Depending on the issue and the court, firms might have to wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. Accelerated procedures are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for
intellectual property violations and for other economic crimes. The courtsâ burdens were alleviated with the introduction of regional courts under Act XXII of 2002. This law established regional courts in Budapest, Szeged and Pecs beginning July 1st 2003; others will be created in Gyor and Debrecen on July 1st 2004.

Contracts may also provide for settling disputes through binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Independence of the Judiciary

The Hungarian judicial system is adequate, apart from delays in processing court cases, and it operates under clearly specified guidelines. The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. Some reforms must still be made to harmonise Hungarian law with EU requirements.

The efficiency, reliability and integrity of public-sector employees vary, and corruption is not unknown. Personal connections can considerably accelerate and improve the chances of success in bureaucratic and many other processes. A study by Gallup, in co-operation with the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations, has shown that 32% of small and medium-sized enterprises had encountered corruption in the course of business. This was most common in relationships with other companies, however, rather than with government bodies. For state organisations, corruption was found to be most common in
public-procurement procedures, customs procedures and obtaining government permits. According to a
2003 survey by Transparency International, 54% of Hungarians perceived public officials as corrupt.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

Hungary welcomes foreign direct investment (FDI) and implements policies to encourage it. Nevertheless, the previous governmentâs statements and behaviour have somewhat tarnished Hungaryâs image as an investor-friendly haven in central Europe. It generally supported domestic capital and sometimes directed unfriendly rhetoric towards foreign companies. Price caps also hurt the profitability of foreign investors,
and they were known to complain of occasional discrimination over public-procurement contracts. Compared with the previous government of Victor Orban, official attitudes are now improving.

The Medgyessy government has promised to lure back foreign investors, since Hungary is experiencing a decline in FDI as emerging markets vie fiercely for investment. Besides  competition from other countries, local factors are also eroding growth in FDI: local labour costs are rising, there are fewer potential acquisition targets and the bulk of privatisation is now complete. To make matters worse, EU accession is forcing modifications to Hungaryâs corporate tax-holiday scheme, completely scrapping some measures.

These factors, coupled with a global stockmarket downturn, caused a noticeable slowing of foreign portfolio investment in 2002, and foreign direct investors followed suit. Total FDI inflow to Hungary amounted to Euro1bn in 2002, which is only 40% of the inflow in 2001, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport. But uncertainties over the outcome of the military action in Iraq and rising oil prices also had an adverse effect, and FDI in the first four months of 2003 hit its lowest point, totalling

Page 155 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Euro39m--compared with Euro181m in the same period of 2002, according to the central bank. The months of February and April saw negative FDI figures as capital left the country.

In terms of per-capita FDI, Hungary has lost the regional lead it held between 1996 and 2000. Per-capita FDI in Hungary totalled US$127 in 2002, far below the average for Central and Eastern Europe, according to preliminary figures from the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Per-capita FDI inflows amounted to US$936 in Slovenia, US$880 in the Czech Republic and US$706 in Slovakia in 2002. Tangible evidence of an FDI slowdown also included announcements by companies on specific projects suspended or cancelled.

Nevertheless, Hungarian authorities are generally well aware of the need for capital from abroad. The government continues to offer a range of incentives to attract investment. Meanwhile, Hungary is being forced to put an end to the tax waivers for major foreign investments after the country joins the European Union. The government is introducing new investment incentives of a similar size as existing ones that are compatible with EU rules before the accession. The medium-term investment incentives programme, Smart Hungary, for example, aims to reverse the slowing influx of foreign capital in order to modernise the countryâs business structure and boost its employment and income-generating capacity.

Overall, Hungary remains one of the most positive environments for foreign investors among Europeâs transition countries (with the temporary exception of industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals). Most of Hungaryâs FDI inflows are in high-technology production industries, and almost all are greenfield investments.

The attitude of the business community and the general public towards foreign investment is generally positive. Local businesses welcome foreign participation as a way to access more-developed technology, export markets and critical working capital. Majority foreign ownership and decision-making is increasingly accepted in the Hungarian business community.

Hungary is the only transition economy in Europe to have entered a post-privatisation phase of foreign investment. Although privatisation is still the dominating force in FDI statistics in Poland and the Czech Republic, the process has all but ended in Hungary.

The largest foreign investor in 2002 was the Netherlands, with Euro438m, followed by Germany (Euro158m), the United States (Euro104m), Sweden (Euro103m) and Austria (Euro62m). Although 51% of the FDI inflow in 2002 went to production industries, the largest investments during the fourth quarter were in real estate, business services and equipment manufacturing. Foreign-owned companies produce more than one-third of GDP and account for more than one-quarter of employment. The government depends
on a consistent FDI inflow of US$1.5bn-2bn as a crucial part of its economic planning.

There are no general local-content requirements that discriminate against foreigners. However, under the requirements of the tender for the two commercial television stations sold by the National Radio and Television Board, at least 35% of programming must be Hungarian produced. Parliament modified Act I of
1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) by Act XX of 2002. The amendment adjusts the legislation to EU requirements, allowing Hungary temporarily to close the audio-visual chapter of its accession talks with the EU. Changes include a clause that comes into force upon Hungaryâs EU entry, requiring that 50% of all programming be European in origin. The EU has expressed dissatisfaction, however, with the clause setting the minimum of Hungarian-made programming at 7% instead of the originally proposed 5%. The government is planning to draft a new Media Act in the second half of 2003.

Although there are no Hungarian local-content requirements, exporters to the European Union must consider EU rules. For example, Magyar Suzuki, the local automotive manufacturing subsidiary of Suzuki (Japan), had to pay the EU some Euro32m in retrospective customs duties, plus interest, that it failed to pay in 1994-97. The European Anti-fraud Office found that Suzuki used false declarations of Hungarian origin involving 58,000 vehicles during this period. Under the customs agreement between the EU and Hungary, car exporters are exempt from customs duties if combined Hungarian- and EU-origin content accounts for at least 60% of the value of the finished product. Suzuki failed to comply with these requirements in 1994-97 but still claimed the exemption.
Unfair Competitive Practices

A part of the economy remains strongly influenced by large state-owned or formerly state-owned enterprises that are sometimes monopolies. And because of the relatively small size of the Hungarian market (the population is about 10m), producers tend to establish dominant market positions rapidly, becoming monopolists or duopolists from economies of scale.

Hungarian competition policy is governed by Act LVII of 1996 on the Prohibition of Unfair and Restrictive Market Practices. This law, commonly known as the  Competition Act, includes provisions against unfair competition, consumer deception, collusive and trust practices, and  abuse of market dominance. The law
Page 156 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
also regulates mergers and acquisitions; it provides for their supervision by the Office of Economic Competition (OEC), which reports directly to parliament. Modelled on Germanyâs Federal Cartel Office, the OEC is the chief regulatory body for  competition policy in all sectors.

In a June 1998 decision, the Constitutional Court stated that the OEC may not directly apply the laws and practices of the European Union without their first being incorporated into Hungarian law.

The Competition Act introduced several changes to align Hungarian policy with that of the EU, and it more clearly defined the functioning and responsibilities of the OEC. The most significant aspects of the law include the following:

Parliament modified the  Competition Act in December 2000, introducing changes in February 2001 to harmonise Hungarian regulations with EU standards and to clarify the wording of certain parts. Although the structure and fundamental regulations of the law remained intact, the changes extended the scope of the law and the authority of the OEC and simplified certain procedures. Major changes have been made on provisions on the prohibition of agreements restricting  competition. Although under previous regulations, the total joint market share of the parties to minor agreements could not exceed 10%, the market share now held by companies controlled by the parties must also be considered when assessing the limit. If the market share still remains below 10%, the agreement will be exempt.
The changes to the  Competition Act also give the OEC new licence to monitor market processes. If in
any market sector pricing tendencies or other circumstances indicate that certain businesses have entered
into an agreement restricting  competition or that a business is abusing its dominant position, the OECâs
chairman may request information from businesses involved in that sector.

Act X of 2002 came into force on April 1st 2002, introducing certain EU norms into the Hungarian legal system. These new norms must be applied in cases where the content of cartels or the abuses of dominant market position affect free trade between the European Union and Hungary.
Price controls are provided for by the Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990).

The Consumer Protection Act (CLV of 1997) affects  competition policy with its requirements for product safety and consumer information. The legislation reflects further harmonisation of Hungarian law with EU norms. Government Decree 89/1998 establishes the scope of authority and procedures for the Central Consumer Protection Supervisor, which implements the law. If an entity achieves unfair market advantages by breaching provisions of the act, competitors whose market positions are jeopardised may assert a claim under the provisions of the  Competition Act (in addition to an action before the Central Consumer Protection Supervisor).

Amendments to Act IV of 1959 on the Civil Code, which came into force on March 1st 1998, set legal requirements on the general terms and conditions in contracts between businesses and their customers, providing customers with more effective civil law remedies against abusive contractual arrangements dictated by businesses.

The Commercial Advertising Act (LVIII of 1997) comprehensively regulates advertising. For comparative or other advertising that qualifies as unfair competition or consumer deception, the act refers to the provisions of the  Competition Act. Under the Competition Act, the courts or the OEC decide whether an advertisement is anti-competitive or deceptive. The Commercial Advertising Act was modified in
December 2000 in line with EU regulations. Changes included a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media from July 1st 2001 and in the outdoor media from January 1st 2002, and stricter regulations on comparative advertising.

Rather than prohibiting monopolies and market dominance per se, the  Competition Act bans abuse of a dominant position that restricts  competition. Under the act, a dominant position occurs when goods reasonably substituting those of a company cannot be acquired, or can be acquired only under conditions substantially less favourable; when a companyâs goods cannot be sold to another party, or can be sold
only to a party under substantially less favourable conditions; or when a company can pursue its economic activities in a manner substantially independent of other participants in the market or without having to consider the attitudes of its competitors, suppliers, customers or other business partners.

The act includes the following non-exclusive list of agreements or concerned practices that might be considered impermissible if they have, as their object or effect, the prevention, restriction or distortion of economic competition:

Nevertheless, agreements between companies to engage in the practices listed above are not forbidden if the combined market share of the parties to the agreement does not exceed 10% or if the companies are not independent from each other (that is, if one controls the other or if both are controlled by the same owner). In 2002 the Office of Economic  Competition (OEC) fined Matav, the dominant telecoms provider,
Page 157 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ft5m and Magyar Posta Ft20m for abusing their dominant market positions. In early 2003 the OEC  fined Auchan (a French retailer) and Hungarian Cetelem Bank Ft1m and Ft2m, respectively, for deceiving customers with misleading advertisements. The OEC also  fined Tesco Global Stores (UK) Ft5m for similar reasons. Among the companies under scrutiny in mid-2003 were Henkel (a German household goods manufacturer), Tetra Pak (a Swedish packaging company) and EMKTV (a Hungarian cable provider).

In total, the OEC imposed Ft15m in  fines in the first six months of 2003. Most penalty decisions related to unfair influence on customers.

Hungary opened its electricity market on January 1st 2003. Consumers using at least 6.5 gwh per year may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice. Local distribution companies still have monopolies on their own territories; further market liberalisation measures will be gradually introduced over future years. The natural gas market will be liberalised in January 2004.
Hungary liberalised its telecoms market with the passage of the Unified Telecommunication Act on June
12th 2001. It established the framework for a liberalised telecoms market; this took effect on December
23rd 2001, when the monopoly rights of Matav, the dominant fixed-line provider, expired. The act
regulates and ensures  competition in different segments of the telecoms market, including telecoms,
postal activities, broadcasting and programme distribution. The act is forcing dominant market players to
unbundle their networks and provide local-loop access to smaller market players for two years after their
concession expires, if they receive a relevant offer from other service providers. Fixed-line telephone rates
and access charge to the Internet remain regulated, and this rule is extended to the rates charged for calls
from fixed-line networks to mobile networks.

Hungary now has local monopolies in wire-based voice-telephone services, established by concession contracts concluded between telecoms providers and the former Ministry of Transport and Water. Besides its monopoly to provide local telephone services in 39 of the 54 primary areas, Matav (the formerly
state-owned giant) held a monopoly on providing domestic long-distance and international voice-telephony services until December 23rd 2001. The monopoly concessions of the providers in the remaining 15 primary areas expired on November 1st 2002. The new firms attempting to challenge Matavâs status as dominant provider have opened business in most areas of  competition, including closed-network and
intra-company services. At present, Matav (Hungary), Vivendi Telecom Hungary (now owned by US-based
AIG Emerging Europe and GMT Communications Partners), Monor Telephone Company (of United
Pan-Europe Communications based in the Netherlands), Emitel (a subsidiary of Matav) and Hungarotel
provide land-line phone services.

Competition has been slow to develop, however, and rivals accused Matav of blocking real  competition by charging high prices for interconnecting its network with competitors. The Association of Alternative Telecom Service Providers decided in July 2002 to challenge Matavâs reference interconnection offer (RIO) in court. The organisation called for immediate government involvement in redefining the conditions of competition and in eliminating the interconnection pricing mechanism of the former monopoly.

The telecommunications arbitration panel ruled in May 2003 that Matav must lower its interconnect fees by an average 28%, and further declines will follow by the time Hungary joins the EU on May 1st 2004.

To address additional issues that have arisen, the IT and telecoms ministry is drafting a fully EU-compliant new Unified Telecommunication Act, to be submitted to parliament in the autumn and take effect from January 1st 2004. The new law would introduce number transferability for fixed-line phones from January
2004 and for mobile phones from May 1st; reduce fees charged for terminating calls from fixed-line networks to mobile networks; reform the financing of universal-access telecom services and narrow the range of those eligible to use them. It would also set up a new Communications Council.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial designs and models are all legally recognised. Legislation on intellectual property rights is comparable to that in western European countries, but foreign producers still cite local piracy of software, music, branded apparel and pharmaceutical patents as problem areas for enforcement. However, much has already been done to improve respect for intellectual property rights, as required by the EU, OECD and WTO. Patents are protected for 20 years from the date of filing the patent application; an annual fee is required to maintain the patent. The Act on the Protection of Inventions by Patents (XXXIII of 1995) conforms to EU legislation.

The law includes detailed provisions against infringement. A patent holder or licenser that suspects patent infringement may file a lawsuit at the Budapest Metropolitan Court (Fovarosi Birosag) and may request an injunction to halt the alleged  abuse, an award of compensation and damages, or confiscation of the goods produced under the infringing activity. Cases may be appealed to the Supreme Court (Legfelsobb
Birosag). Disputes may be settled by either direct ruling or trial. A licensee also may sue an infringer in

Page 158 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
court. It should be noted that Hungaryâs overburdened court system often leads to lengthy delays in pursuing legal remedy, and even injunctions against infringing activity can be difficult to obtain. Holders of copyrights and trademarks suffer frequent infringement, and industry groups have been set up to lobby the government and assist authorities.

Hungary joined the European Patent Convention (EPC) on January 1st 2003, when Act XXXIX of 2002 modified Act XXXIII of 1995 and fully integrated the Hungarian patent system into the EPC. European patents can now be applied for at the Hungarian office in Hungarian. The Hungarian Patent Office (HPO) said the changes will not slow the patent process or increase costs.
Act XLVIII of 2001 codified the protection of industrial designs.

Act LX of 1995 extended the availability of interlocutory injunctions (temporary restraining orders) to intellectual property matters. The applicant must file a written claim showing that, without the injunction, imminent and direct damages cannot be avoided, the status quo giving rise to the dispute cannot be preserved or the position of the applicant requires protection. An interlocutory injunction may be requested only within the context of an existing litigation. The applicant must also show that the advantages of the injunction would probably outweigh its disadvantages. If granted, an injunction takes effect on the day following the date of receipt of the order on the injunction or on the date determined by the court; it
remains in force until it is revoked or until judgment is passed on the merits of the case.
Increasingly, foreign firms are registering their patents in Hungary, according to the annual report of the
HPO. The number of patents registered has risen steadily since 1990; 5,906 patents were registered in
2002, and only 842 of these belonged to Hungarian companies. In 2001, domestic companies submitted
842 patent applications, and foreign companies filed 5,064 claims. Main growth areas for patent
applications were pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry and biotechnology.

The Highest Court dismissed a patent infringement case brought by Merck, a US pharmaceuticals producer, against Richter, a domestic pharmaceuticals producer in February 2003. Merck filed its suit in
1995, claiming that Richter used its patented compound in Richterâs Ednyt blood-pressure medicine. Richter said it used its own patented ingredients.
The HPO revoked one of Merckâs patents on simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering compound in February
2003, and the company appealed against the move at the Budapest Municipal Court. Merck is also suing
Teva-Biogal, an Israeli-owned pharmaceuticals producer, in a patent-infringement case related to
simvastatin.

The HPO is planning to encourage local SMEs to apply for patents through new tax cuts. The cost of registering a patent is already deductible from pre-tax profits, but SMEs making little or no profit would be allowed to write off costs as expenses. In the HPOâs estimate, about 60,000 Hungarian companies could be competitive on the global innovation market with the help of the measure instead of the 3,000 at present. The HPOâs new strategy will go before the government for approval in September.

Copyrights are protected by the Copyright Act (Act LXXVI of 1999). This strengthened protection by providing the courts with authority to decide on issuing injunctions for alleged copyright violation within 15 days of receiving the request if certain conditions are met. The act came into force on September 1st 1999 and fully harmonised Hungaryâs copyright law with EU requirements. It also modernised copyright provisions to account for the spread of information technologies and incorporated the provisions of international copyright treaties.

Following the first award for damages to a foreign copyright owner (Microsoft of the US) for illegal use of software in the first half of 1999, another landmark court case in November 1999 saw the first imposition of (suspended) prison terms on two individuals for copyright infringement. Additional cases were successfully completed or launched in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to defend software copyrights. In February 2003 a Budapest court sentenced the managing director of Philos Laboratories, a Hungarian software developer, to one year in prison, the first such sentence for illegal software use in Hungary. Co-operation with the authorities reduces sanctions, but violators face up to eight years in prison for copyright infringement.

The Business Software Alliance (BSA), a private industry group, helps its members defend their copyrights, in part by initiating legal action against illegal use. The BSA says that software morality is improving; it estimates that software piracy rates dropped to 45% in 2002, from 48% in 2001, 51% in 2000 and 76% in 1994. Still, this far exceeds Western Europeâs average of around 35%.

The Hungarian Association of Record Producers (Mahasz) estimates that 18% of the recorded works sold in Hungary in 2002 were illegal copies and that about Ft2bn in revenues was lost to the rightful copyright holders. The Audiovisual Copyright Foundation estimates that the video industry suffers Ft2bn-3bn in lost revenues per year because of pirated videos.

Act I of 1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) requires cable operators to complete contracts or obtain contract waivers from the broadcasters whose programmes they transmit. The operators must also register their programme offerings with the National Radio and Television Board (the ORTT). The ORTT must allow any broadcaster to check the registry for information regarding their programmes retransmitted by the cable operators and the protection of copyrights.

The Copyright Act of 1999 prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain decoding devices used illegally to view pay-television programming (such as HBO). Industry associations believe the number of those illegally viewing premium cable-TV programming to be about equal to the number of paying subscribers. Act LXXVII of 2001 modified the law to include electronic databases as well.

Trademarks are covered by Act XI of 1997 on Trademark Protection, which further harmonised Hungarian intellectual property legislation with EU and international norms. The act expanded trademark protection (for example, to protect colours, voices, numbers and letters), added more precise definitions for
distinctive symbols and denied protection for illegally obtained trademarks. It also strengthened the rights of trademark holders by accelerating legal proceedings on trademark infringement. The court must decide on the infringement claim within 15 days of submitting the claim. Temporary measures in trademark infringements may be enforced. The protection of geographic indicators is also allowed under the Act on Trademark Protection, in limited circumstances. Hence, names such as Tokaj (where Hungaryâs famous dessert wines are produced) are protected from forgeries. Act CXXI of 1997 on Grape Growing and the Wine Economy also introduced strict rules protecting Tokaj wines, including a precise definition of the right to use of the name Tokaji. The act also tightened customs regulations to prevent the importing of counterfeit products.

In February 2003 the Budapest Municipal Court ruled against Hid Radio, a US publishing company, in a trademark-infringement case brought against it by Ringier of Switzerland, a rival publisher. Ringier claimed Hid Radioâs tabloid Szines Mai Lap greatly resembled the format and design of Mai Nap, the Ringier groupâs tabloid. Under the court ruling, Szines Mai Lap must change its logo and pay a certain amount
from its profit generated during the period in question to Ringier. Hid Radio has appealed against the verdict.
Price Controls

The Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990) provides for price controls. Hungaryâs economic reform has liberalised the prices of most products and services offered by private concerns. Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport Decree 30 of May 9th 2003 regulates natural gas prices; Decrees 58 and 61 of December 29th 2002 regulate the prices of retail electricity services and district heating. Decree 3 of January 21st 2002 of the Prime Ministerâs Office regulates telecom tariffs for 2003. Government Decree 175/2001 required former monopoly Matav to come up with a reference interconnection offer (RIO), which lays out the key terms and conditions for making interconnections with other providers, including tariffs. The Telecommunications Authorityâs arbitration panel, a regulatory body established by the Telecommunication Act, approved Matavâs RIO on July 18th 2002, but the Association of Alternative Telecom Service Providers challenged the RIO in court. The arbitration panel ruled in May
2003 that Matav must lower its interconnect fees by an average 28%, and additional cuts must be implemented by the time Hungary joins the EU on May 1st 2004.
Internet charges are regulated by Decree 3/2003 of the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications.

The government took a strong anti-inflationary stance in 2002. As in previous years, this created strong controversy over price controls, affecting energy, telecoms and pharmaceuticals.

In pharmaceuticals, the prices of non-subsidised drugs are not supposed to be regulated (only a notification requirement exists). In 2000, international and domestic producers signed a three-year pricing pact over subsidised drugs with the government. However, the Medgyessy government postponed the agreed average 5% hike from July 1st 2002, intending to renegotiate the three-year deal and sign a
four-year agreement instead. A deal finally materialised on February 1st 2003, when the price of subsidised drugs rose by an average of 4.5%. The hike was set at a fixed amount for drugs that cost less than Ft550, thus benefiting domestic manufacturers, which sell large quantities of low-priced generic drugs, such as Richter, Egis and Chinoin.

Under the three-year agreement, subsidised drug prices were scheduled to rise again by 3.7% on July 1st, but this hike was postponed until February 2004. At the same time, the government increased the 2003 drug budget by Ft26bn but capped the amount of monthly subsidies on medications until the end of 2003. The government is planning to introduce a new subsidy system in 2004 that would altogether eliminate price talks with manufacturers, a move opposed by the Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Hungary (AIPM), which represents drug importers. Among the many foreign companies

affected by the dispute are AstraZeneca (UK), Bayer (Germany), GlaxoSmithKline (UK), Merck (US), Novartis (Switzerland) and Pfizer (US).

The Ministry of Health also capped pharmaciesâ profit margins from July 1st 2001, limiting them to no more than Ft630 on medications that cost more than Ft3,500. The Hungarian Pharmacist Chamber announced
in early 2003 that it is turning to the Constitutional Court over the estimated Ft4bn drop in revenue the sector has suffered since the margin cut in 2001. The chamber submitted a similar complaint in August
2001, with no results so far.

Matav, the national telecoms provider, was allowed to raise the price of its subscription packages by 10% and the tariffs for local calls by 6% from January 1st 2003. However, it chose to increase its prices by an average of only 4.3% from February 1st in an attempt to ward off competitors.

The government approved an average 10% electricity price hike on February 1st 2003. Retail prices rose by an average 8.7%. The government also decided to lift the price caps that caused power distributor Hungarian Electricity Works (MVM) to accumulate Ft73bn in losses by end-2002, according to the Hungarian Energy Office.

The Electricity Act (Act CX of 2001), which parliament passed on December 18th 2001, is gradually introducing competition to the electricity market between January 2003 and 2010. About 35% of the market was liberalised in the first step, involving about 200 large consumers that used 6.5 gwh of electricity a year. These consumers may freely choose suppliers but only for up to 50% of their total electricity needs--at least until Hungary becomes an EU member.

Natural gas retail prices did not rise in 2002, but were hiked by 12% on May 15th 2003. Gas prices for large industrial consumers rose by 5.2% on July 1st 2002, affecting about 350 companies, and have remained unchanged since then.

Parliament adopted a new natural-gas-supply law (Act XLII of 2003) in June 2003, aligning the gas market with EU norms. Under the new law, domestic natural gas prices will be pegged to world market prices, and discount household gas prices will be subsidised by higher mining fees for MOL, the oil and gas company. The law will open a part of the market to a selected group of gas users, who together consume about 40% of the total, as from January 1st 2004.

MOL welcomed the new law, saying it would enable the company to operate its gas business profitably from 2004, putting it on equal footing with other market players. But MOLâs natural-gas division expects to register a loss again this year because of the price caps, which are forcing the company to sell gas for less than it costs to import it. Nevertheless, the company expects losses far lower than the Ft120bn amount in
2001.

HD        UPDATE: EU Investigating Intel Chip Sales To Governments
WC       666 words
PD        21 April 2004
ET         08:19 PM
SN        Dow Jones International News

CY        (c) 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LP
(Updates an item from 1250 GMT with additional comment from Intel, the  European Commission and the Swedish government)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Regulators are investigating whether European governments illegally favored
Intel Corp. (INTC) chips in public procurement, the European Union Commission said Wednesday.

TD
The probe was opened after complaints from Intel's competitors. Although E.U. officials wouldn't give names, Intel's largest competitor is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD). AMD has a strong presence in Europe, producing its microprocessor wafers in Dresden, Germany, where it is building a second plant.

"Under public procurement rules, you may not say computers must contain chips by particular manufacturer," said E.U. spokesman Jonathan Todd.

Government agencies are free to specify what standards they require for their IT systems when putting out bids for tender. But Todd said that such specifications - such as listing the "clockrates" at which microchips operate - mustn't exclude makers of similar equipment from consideration. He warned that such specifications can be used to undermine "open and competitive procedures" in public bids.

While less important than the recent E.U.  antitrust crackdown on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which resulted in a record EUR497 million  fine, the case resembles similar attempts by  Microsoft's Linux competitors to abolish any public-procurement requirements for proprietary software standards. In recent months, E.U. governments have been taking the side of open software standards.

AMD declined to comment. Intel said it is evaluating the E.U. letters sent and their potential impact on its customers in Europe. Spokesman Chuck Malloy said the company is also investigating how the
Intel-only requirements came about.

"Based on our understanding, there is no allegation of wrongdoing on Intel's part," Malloy said. E.U. officials also refrained from accusing Intel of malfeasance and said they didn't know exactly why governments put Intel-only clauses in bid requirements. They also said they didn't know how large the total number of contracts involved could be. Analysts said the Intel-only contracts came about as a way of standardizing hardware.
"There are reasons why governments would want to standardize on an IT platform - the administration
of management of computers become less expensive the more homogeneous the environment is," said
Jeremy Donovan, an analyst with Gartner in New Jersey. "This is quite common."

Officials did say they were focusing on two heavyweight countries - Germany and Italy. Both countries have received a request to provide information within two months. Regulators then must decide whether to bring court cases to change the practices.

Five other countries are being probed - Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands. But these countries haven't yet received formal requests for information. The European Free Trade Association is also looking at Norway.

As a model for fixing the problem, E.U. spokesman Todd cited Sweden. When regulators complained that the northern Swedish city of Luleaa required Intel processors by name, the government in Stockholm sent a warning to the municipality, which agreed to change its future procurement habits.

Page 163 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Luleaa municipality admitted after European Union complaints that it was mistaken in its technical description of computers referring directly to the brand "Intel Pentium IV," Sweden's national board for public procurement published in its March newsletter. "The municipality said that it was possible to design demand specifications in a more neutral way and decided to cancel the bid process" and "in the future, bid requests must be designed in a way that references to a specific brand or product origination."
If other countries do the same, Todd said the investigations will be dropped.

"We hope to resolve this in satisfactory manner without further infringement," he said. "As ever with public procurement, we want open and competitive procedures" so "European governments get value for money."

HD            Microsoft set to argue EC ruling  is out of step-FT. WC          342 words

LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) -  Microsoft (MSFT.O) is set to argue that the  European Commission's landmark decision against it is out of step with business realities and legal precedent, the Financial Times Web site reported on Wednesday.

Last month, the world's largest software maker was told by European Union regulators to pay a 497 million euro ($587.8 million)  fine, decouple Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system and provide information on how its server software for networked computers works.

TD
Microsoft said at that time it planned to appeal the decision.
Citing a company briefing note, which the newspaper said sets out the arguments Microsoft is likely
to use in its appeal, the Financial Times said  Microsoft attacks the European Commission's working
methods, as well as the conclusions it reaches.

Microsoft accuses the Commission of "seeking to make new law ... reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth," the Financial Times reported.

The newspaper said  Microsoft had circulated the note to its lawyers and economists ahead of its appeal, expected to be lodged later this year.

The newspaper said the Commission's ruling, set to be published shortly, argues that  Microsoft choked off  competition in the markets for server systems by denying its rivals interface information and illegally "tied" its Media Player program to Windows, reducing demand for rival products.

Microsoft argues that the Commission decision requires it "to make available to its competitors well over 100 communications protocols" for which it holds "dozens of patents."

As well as launching an appeal, the company will ask for a suspension of the Commission orders for it to license such information and to offer computer manufacturers in Europe a version of Windows without Media Player.

The company says the Commission's stance on sharing information "rests on a very narrow product market definition that bears little resemblance to the real world."
Officials at  Microsoft's U.S. headquarters were not immediately available for comment.

HD     Taking Stock In Emerging  Markets. WC    1,371 words

Stock markets in the EU accession countries are small - and the countries are poor. But the economies are growing fast and they provide investment opportunities, writes John Friel.

A joke from the Czech Republic tells of a man who applies to emigrate and is informed that he has an appointment on August 2, 2019. He asks "morning or afternoon?" and the officials look puzzled. Then he explains that between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. he has to be at home because the gasman's due.

TD
Central European bureaucracy isn't quite that bad, though, like many jokes, this one has an element of truth. Years of decline under Soviet rule left a bitter aftertaste. There remains much to be done in the way of restructuring the EU accession countries.

Years of inefficiency in the allocation of capital are reflected in average incomes running at less than a quarter of those in Western Europe.

But this also provides opportunity. The advantages on a corporate level are obvious. European companies will continue to develop regions such as the Baltic countries as low-cost production bases in the heart of Europe.
How the equity investor should participate is less clear. Should the Irish investor target the markets of the
EU candidates, and if so, how can they best gain exposure?
Faster Growth
Much is made out of the fact that the inclusion of these ten countries will increase Europe's population by
20% (around 75 million added to 375 million), but only boost GDP by around 5%.
So these countries are poor, which is why they are falling over themselves to join the EU. Switzerland and
Norway, for example, don't appear anywhere in the queue.

This can be viewed as negative from a macroeconomic standpoint, but positive from the investor's perspective since the economies of these developing nations have the scope to grow much faster than those currently using the euro. They are starting out from a much lower base and will be helped, of course, by EU subsidies.

This is reflected in the price/earnings multiples of some of these markets relative to our own. That the Czech market, for example, trades on a comparable valuation to the ISEQ is as clear a comment as any of the growth potential of the region.
Stock Picking
May 1 will introduce some factors of which the stock-picker should be mindful.

Readying themselves for joining Europe, the candidate countries have had laws on  competition in place for some time. But, from next month, the  European Commission will be enforcing EU law directly in these countries. And we are likely to see some corporate casualties.

Buying the dominant company in a respective area is usually a good idea in emerging market investment. In the case of the EU's newest members, this is not as obvious a strategy.

The European Commission will likely start its investigations later on in the year, and may look to make examples out of high-profile cases - as  Microsoft shareholders have recently found out. It may wish to

Page 167 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
send out a clear signal to the market by singling out one or more dominant "flagship" companies, and fining them accordingly.
In other words, be wary of holding companies that enjoy monopoly powers in their respective industry.
Competition law is mentioned by way of example.
Similar adjustments apply in areas such as health and safety, and environmental care. Direct Investing
The EU candidate countries are not significant commodity-exporting countries, and thus their external and fiscal positions are usually in deficit. That is, they need capital.

This is natural, and indeed healthy, given their developing nature. These imbalances, however, have to be controlled.

A general theme currently in the region is political listlessness. Weak coalition governments seem to be constantly bickering, threatening the pace of structural reform.

This affects the investor directly, since the stability of the local currencies can be strongly influenced by the degree of budgetary discipline. Foreign institutions play an active role in the local treasury bond markets and auctions, and the lack of a clear commitment to fiscal prudency and reform can prompt the selling of bonds and bills. This affects the demand for the local currency and therefore influences the foreign exchange rate.

Poland, for example, is the most significant prospective member - having around half of the population of the combined ten countries - and thus attracts the most attention from investors. The cyclical attractions are clear: interest rates have been cut savagely in recent years, boosting consumer demand and economic growth.

But returns for the foreign investor have been dampened in recent months by the zloty's underperformance against the euro, and other Central European currencies. This is a benchmark case of political and fiscal weakness directly influencing the investor's total return.

The performance of the local currency is an extremely important factor when considering whether to invest directly in the local stock market of an accession country.
Case Study: Banks

The banking sector provides an interesting insight into the investment dynamics of the region. There are Central European banks quoted on local exchanges, and western banks have expanded intrepidly into the region and now own many of the region's top banks.

This also illustrates how the investor can gain exposure to the region by indirect means: that is, buying shares in western companies that have operations or investments in Central Europe.

That this type of exposure can influence investment returns will be all too obvious to, for example, those holding AIB shares. The announcement of its last set of results disappointed due to a sharp drop in the profitability of the bank's Polish operations (owing to the steep fall in Polish interest rates).

Retail banking seems to be where the margins are, and the involvement of western institutions means that there can be a bewildering array of products available to a Central European market that is not yet ready
to take them up.

Access to asset management products and Internet banking, for example, is  fine in, say, Germany, where over 95% of the population over 15 years old have bank accounts. The number of bank account holders in Hungary, for example, is less than half this figure. In the case of Poland, it is even less. The scope for growth is compelling.

Austrian bank Erste Bank has been successful in this regard. Over half of its operations and profits come from the region, mainly the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Its shares have appreciated, in euro, around
80%, 120%, and 170%, over the last one, three and five years, respectfully, and it looks a solid play on the region.

Information on the degree of exposure by region of various Western European companies can be obtained through your broker, or indeed, from the companies themselves.
Buying Shares

Page 168 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Shares in Central European equities can be bought through an Irish bank or broker. Typically, the trade is settled in euro, sterling or US dollars. But the investor will own shares denominated in the respective local currency, and will be exposed to this currency's movements against the euro.

This is not to be confused with buying shares in Central European companies that are quoted in, for example, euro. This is true of some of the larger companies of the region that have quotes in foreign exchanges to deepen their investor bases and raise their profiles.

Another option is to buy one or more of the many investment funds that invest in the region. Most are classified as "emerging Europe" however, and thus have heavy weightings in Russia, which has completely different investment dynamics than the economies of central Europe.
Changing Dynamics
Central European stock markets should meet their growth potential as the region assimilates the benefit of
EU accession and we see greater progress in, for example, privatisation and pension fund reform.

The true financial transition for the accession countries, however, will take place when they adopt the euro and allow the ECB to manage their monetary policy: This remains some way off.


But for the prospective investor, May 1 is, nevertheless, an important date due to the change in the operating and regulatory environment for Central European companies. .

"Broad-based demand and solid execution across all our businesses drove outstanding results for the quarter," said John Connors, chief financial officer at  Microsoft. "All of our businesses met or exceeded our expectations this quarter with the Client, Information Worker and Server and Tools businesses growing a combined 17%. Overall corporate IT spending continued to improve and we expect to see healthy demand through the end of our fiscal year."

Information Worker revenue grew 18% over the prior year as Office experienced strong sales across all customer segments. Worldwide retail license sales of Office 2003 since its launch in October 2003 were double those of Office XP over its first five months. Office OEM sales grew 35% benefiting from increased adoption of Office 2003 including penetration of the Small Business and Professional editions. Customers acquiring Office during the quarter included Circuit City, Del Monte Foods, Perot Systems, The Thomson Corporation, and Unisys Corporation.

Server and Tools grew a solid 19% driven by healthy demand for Windows(R), Exchange, SQL Server(TM), and Visual Studio(R) products. Rapid customer adoption of Windows Server(TM) 2003 continued with new licenses growing 31%. "Windows Server 2003 is our most successful server operating system product ever with customer license sales doubling any previous version over a comparable period since launch," said Eric Rudder, senior vice president, Server and Tools business. "It is also rewarding to see customers and partners excited about the recently released Windows Small Business Server 2003 product, as is reflected by our early strong sales and already having 47,000 partners trained to deploy and service the platform."

MSN(R) reported another profitable quarter on robust revenue growth of 16% over last year driven by continued success in growing its advertising business. MSN advertising revenue increased 43% during the quarter, again showing strength in both traditional online and search-based advertising. Customers and advertisers continue to recognize MSN as a worldwide leader in online services with more than 350
million unique users to the MSN network, over 170 million active MSN Hotmail(R) unique users, and more than 120 million active MSN Messenger unique users worldwide on a monthly basis.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: entry into markets with vigorous  competition, market acceptance of new products and services, continued acceptance of existing products and services, changes in licensing programs, product price discounts, delays in product development and related product release schedules, and reliance on sole source suppliers for key components of Xbox that could result in component shortages and delays in product delivery, any of which may cause revenues and income to fall short of anticipated levels; obsolete inventory or product returns by distributors, resellers and retailers; warranty and other claims on hardware products such as Xbox; changes in the rate of PC shipments; technological shifts; the support of third
party software developers for new or existing platforms; the availability of competitive products or services such as the Linux operating system at prices below our prices or for no charge; the ability to have access
to MSN service distribution channels that are controlled by third parties; the risk of unanticipated increased costs for network services; the continued ability to protect the company's intellectual property rights; the ability to obtain on acceptable terms the right to incorporate in the company's products and services technology patented by others; changes in product and service mix; maturing product life cycles; product sale terms and conditions; the risk that actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues; implementation of operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; the financial condition of our customers and vendors; variations in equity compensation expenses under FAS 123, which will fluctuate based on factors such as the actual number of stock awards issued and the market value of the awards on the dates of grant; unavailability of insurance; uninsured losses; adverse results in litigation; the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in our operations and security arrangements; the level of corporate information technology spending and changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software; currency fluctuations; trade sanctions or changes to U.S. tax law resulting from the World Trade Organization decision with respect to the extraterritorial income provisions of U.S.
tax law; and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges.

HD      Microsoft appeal to argue EU antitrust ruling  damages its busines  model - memo. WC     490 words
PD      22 April 2004
SN      AFX Asia SC      AFXASI LA      English

LP
BRUSSELS (AFX) - Microsoft Corp will argue in its court appeal against the EU's  antitrust decision that the European Commission is creating legal precedents that damage its business model, according to a memo seen by AFX News.

The software giant will also argue that the Commission verdict threatens all industrial innovation and ignores international treaty obligations, according to the internal memo which has been circulated to the company's lawyers.

Microsoft is appealing the decision, announced March 24, to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. The commission ruled that the company has violated EU  antitrust laws and ordered it to pay a fine of 497.2 mln eur for abusing its market power in the EU.

It also said  Microsoft must licence out interface information to its competitors so that their computer operating systems can communicate with each other. It must also offer a stripped-down version of Windows without the Windows Media Player.

In the memo, the company said: "The novel legal standards announced in the decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth."

Concerning the sharing of information,  Microsoft said: "The decision goes well beyond established legal precedents by asserting a broad and ill-defined duty on dominant firms to share the fruits of their research and development with other companies in the same product market."

On the issue of unbundling Windows Media Player, the company said this "opens the door for even a single complaining component supplier to argue that innovation should be thwarted if its market position may be harmed."

Microsoft said it must now offer a downgraded version of Windows but continue to market it under the same trademark "even though there is no reason to believe a consumer would want the resulting product".

The company added that the decision is "so squarely stacked against innovation that one may fairly question whether any dominant firm can be confident when integrating a new component of features in the future".

Microsoft also takes issue with the decision's cursory treatment of international treaty obligations. It refers to the WTO agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) which only permits compulsory licensing in special cases.

It said that the treaty obligations should protect its intellectual property rights and that the decision by the commission takes a "troubling departure" from international legal rules.

Finally,  Microsoft argues that the commission has made a definition of the market that is too narrow. It said that while the commission looks at four discrete tasks performed by servers, Windows actually performs more than a dozen tasks.

In conclusion, the company memo said that the commission's decision will allow intrusive regulation of product design which will "spell bad news" for the European and global economies.

HD     Legal Expenses Take Bite Out Of Microsoft's Earnings

Microsoft reported a 38% drop in third-quarter profits Thursday, as charges related to its  antitrust troubles dragged down earnings. The world's largest software company also reported another sequential decline in its unearned revenue account, indicating customers may be waiting for new products several years out before they sign multiyear license agreements with built-in upgrade triggers.

For the quarter ended March 31,  Microsoft reported net income of $1.32 billion, or 12 cents per share, compared with $2.14 billion, or 20 cents per share, during the same quarter a year ago. Sapping profits were a $501 million expense for stock compensation, a $1.89 billion charge related to its settlement of an antitrust dispute with Sun Microsystems, and a $605 million  fine by the European Commission. Excluding the legal charges,  Microsoft said it would have turned a profit of 34 cents a share, ahead of the
29 cents per share expected by analysts polled by Thomson First Call.

TD
Revenue for the quarter increased 17%, to $9.18 billion, from $7.84 billion a year ago. Sales of Windows, Office, database and E-mail software, and software development tools combined for 17% year-over-year growth. In addition, IT spending by companies improved during the quarter, and CFO John Connors said the company expects "healthy demand" for its products through the June 30 end of  Microsoft's fiscal year.

"We are in the midst of a corporate recovery," Connors said during a conference call with analysts. "Corporate profits are up, and businesses seem more willing to invest in IT projects." The company's Office 2003 suite, for example, sold double the amount of its predecessor, Office XP, during each product's first five months on the shelf.

But Microsoft is still trying to convert business customers to its newest products and get them to sign long-term license agreements with additional upgrade rights, called Software Assurance.  Microsoft's unearned-revenue account, which reflects revenue from multiyear contacts that the company hasn't yet booked, declined by $326 million sequentially during the third quarter, indicating customers aren't renewing long-term deals as quickly as they once did. The account declined for the third consecutive quarter, and Connors said he expects a continued decrease. But the decline was less than the $600 million sequential decline forecast by Lehman Brothers, according to a research note from analyst Neil Herman.
The next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, isn't due until at least 2006, and new versions of its
SQL Server database and Visual Studio development tools won't ship until next year.

Microsoft has received a revenue boost from shorter-term upgrade contracts signed before its new licensing rules went into effect, but virtually all of the revenue from that program is expected to be recognized by the end of the current fiscal year.

For the fourth quarter,  Microsoft said it expects to report revenue of between $8.9 billion and $9 billion and earn 23 cents per share. For the 2005 fiscal year, the company expects revenue of between $37.8 billion to $38.2 billion and earnings between $1.16 and $1.18 per share. That would be a historically low revenue growth rate of about 7%.

Also in question is what  Microsoft plans to do with its more than $50 billion in cash. The company has been using the cash to settle lawsuits with companies including Sun, Time Warner's AOL unit, and Intertrust Technologies, as well as class-action lawsuits by U.S. states. Connors said  Microsoft will disclose more information about plans for its cash at its annual meeting with financial analysts in July.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) posted lower net income despite strong revenue, as profit was weighed down by several large charges related to its  antitrust disputes.

TD
For the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, the Redmond, Wash., software giant reported net income of $1.32 billion, or 12 cents a share, down from $2.14 billion, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

The recent period included stock-based compensation expense of $748 million before taxes, or 5 cents a share after taxes. It also had legal charges of $2.53 billion before taxes, or 17 cents a
share after taxes, related to its recent settlement of its dispute with Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW)
and a fine imposed by the European Commission.

The prior year period included stock-based compensation expense of $978 million pretax or 6 cents a share after taxes.

Revenue rose 17% to $9.18 billion from $7.84 billion in the prior year. That was above  Microsoft's forecast of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion in sales.

The company said all areas of its business performed well, and it was helped by rebounding spending by businesses. "Overall corporate IT spending continued to improve and we expect to see healthy demand through the end of our fiscal year," said John Connors, the company's chief financial officer, in a statement.

The company said its Information Worker revenue grew 18% thanks to strong sales of its Office productivity suite. Server and Tools revenue grew 19%, amid "healthy demand" for Windows, Exchange and SQL Server products.

Microsoft said its MSN Internet unit was profitable. MSN posted revenue growth of 16% from a year earlier, helped by a 43% increase in advertising revenue.

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said costs from its legal woes and stock-based compensation dragged down third-quarter earnings, but strong sales of personal computers caused a
17% jump in revenue.

TD
The software giant raised its earnings forecast for the current quarter and full fiscal year, ending June
30, and the company's shares jumped in after-hours trading following the announcement. In its first
comments about the fiscal year ending in June 2005, however,  Microsoft forecast sales and profits
below analysts' expectations.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

For the fiscal period ended March 30, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $1.32 billion, or 12 cents a share, off nearly 39% from the $2.14 billion, or 20 cents a share, recorded in the previous year. Those figures included charges of $1.89 billion, after taxes, related to the company's legal settlement with Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) and a  fine imposed by the European Commission, which last month ruled that  Microsoft had violated European antitrust laws. The
latest quarter also included $501 million in expenses related to stock-based compensation.

Excluding those one-time costs, the company's net income per share was 34 cents, topping analysts' average estimate on that basis of 29 cents, according to Thomson First Call.

Microsoft's sales in the quarter grew to $9.18 billion from $7.84 billion, also exceeding analysts' average estimate of $8.66 billion, as tallied by First Call. In an interview,  Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors credited better-than-expected sales of personal computers, server computers and its software tools as the driver of the strong results from operations and the company's decision to raise its forecasts. The positive environment helped sales of  Microsoft's core Windows operating system and Office 2003 suite of productivity software.
"Nearly every one of our businesses were above our expectations," Connors said.

Microsoft's shares traded at 4 p.m. at $25.95, up 50 cents. In after-hours trading following the announcement, the stock rose to $27.24, according to Inet ATS Inc.

Microsoft Corp. engaged in a "general pattern of conduct" to deny competitors critical information to allow their products to work properly with the software giant's Windows systems, according to a final ruling by European  antitrust enforcers.

The 302-page decision details why the  European Commission last month hit  Microsoft with the largest antitrust fine in history, more than $600 million.

TD
The commission also ordered  Microsoft to develop two versions of its ubiquitous Windows operating system, one with its software for playing digital entertainment and one without, which would be more damaging to the company than a  fine.

While the  fine was announced last month, the commission's final written order on the case was not made public. It was expected to be released this week. A copy was obtained by The Washington Post.

The commission ruled that by bundling its media player into Windows,  Microsoft put makers of rival digital media software at a disadvantage, since users might have to download them separately.

Microsoft is appealing the ruling, and has lobbied Congress and U.S. trade officials to put pressure on European Union regulators to settle the case rather than go through years of appeals.

The sanctions are significantly tougher than those imposed in an  antitrust settlement between the company and the Justice Department in 2001. Both the company and the Justice Department want the EU order to mirror the U.S. settlement.

"This is the first time in EU history that an  antitrust agency has ordered a company to invest time and engineering resources to create a version of a very popular product that is less capable than the version consumers are already using,"  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said last night.

But the EU ruling makes no apologies for its decision, which it said was necessary to protect consumers from markets that are, or might soon become, noncompetitive.

"Tying [the Windows Media Player] with the dominant Windows . . . risks foreclosing competition in the market for media players," the order states. "This has spillover effects on competition in related products such as media encoding and management software . . . but also in client PC operating systems."
The ruling draws on evidence the EU collected, including testimony from rivals, internal  Microsoft
documents and e-mails, and marketplace surveys.



Page 184 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As U.S. prosecutors often did in their case, EU regulators used  Microsoft's own communications against it, especially in the realm of keeping key code away from rivals so their products would not work as well with Windows.

"What we are trying to do is use our server control to do new protocols and lock out Sun [Microsystems Inc.] and Oracle [Corp.] specifically," said  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in a speech to his sales force in 1997.
The EU case is aimed in part at servers, computers that power networks of other computers. "If  Microsoft's strategy is successful, new products other than  Microsoft's work-group server
operating systems will be confined to niche existences or not be viable at all," the ruling said.

In a seven-page response,  Microsoft said that the EU is making new law and that its ruling will rob the company of its intellectual property by forcing disclosure of proprietary code.
Edward J. Black, head of a U.S. trade group that was one of the groups filing complaints against
Microsoft, praised the ruling as thorough.

"The ruling lays out the solid foundation for the EU decision in law and fact . . . and even lays out all of Microsoft's defenses before showing how they are inadequate or irrelevant," he said. "It's a shame the tens of thousands of pages of detailed evidence can't be released as well. "

The case now moves to Europe's Court of First Instance, which will first determine whether to put the penalties on hold until the appeals are heard.
That decision is expected later this year.

HD          Deterrence Was Aim of Microsoft Fine --- EU Doubled Initial Figure Due to Company's Wealth; Penalty for Foot-Dragging
BY          By Brandon Mitchener

BRUSSELS -- To arrive at its record  antitrust fine against Microsoft Corp., European  antitrust regulators doubled their initial figure to take account of the company's wealth, and raised it again for its five years of refusal to change its behavior during the investigation, according to a copy of the full text
of the decision to be published later this week.

The final amount was 497.2 million euros, about twice what  Microsoft officials had said they expected. When it was announced last month following failed settlement talks, the  European Commission didn't explain how it arrived at the figure.  Microsoft's top lawyer in Europe, Horacio Gutierrez, denounced it
at the time as "unprecedented and inappropriate" given that the U.S. government and a U.S. court had previously permitted the conduct at issue, an assertion European regulators contest.

TD
A Microsoft internal response to the decision largely ignores the  fine, but sets out the company's thinking ahead of a likely appeal. The document, dated April 19, blasts European regulators for "seeking to make new law" that would not only punish  Microsoft unfairly, but also hit any other company with a commanding market share.

"The novel legal standards announced in this decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth," says the document, prepared for senior  Microsoft management and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

It goes on to compare the commission's reasoning in one part of the case -- requiring the company to separate its multimedia player from its Windows operating system -- as akin to requiring a shoe company to sell its shoes without laces so that lace makers could improve their business. The example attempts to turn the commission's own guidelines against it. The guidelines, the memo notes, use the shoe example to demonstrate what types of products can legitimately be bundled together.

The 300-page commission decision, reviewed by the Journal, lays out the history of the case and regulators' view of  Microsoft's behavior in painstaking detail. The commission concluded that Microsoft abused the dominance of its Windows software in the personal-computer market to illegally muscle its way into related markets, such as those involving software that allows computers to communicate over networks and play digital music and video.

It ordered  Microsoft to license information needed by competitors and others to take full advantage of the networking functions built into Windows software, as well as ordering the company to sell a version of Windows stripped of the media player so that PC makers might be encouraged to install rival players on new PCs.

The decision asserts that the order "does not mean that consumers will obtain PCs and operating systems without media players. . . . The configuration of such bundles will reflect what consumers desire and not what  Microsoft imposes." The order also reserves the right for the commission to impose a harsher punishment later, "should it prove that  Microsoft demotes the performance of the unbundled version of Windows, thus rendering the remedy ineffective."


Page 186 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The decision says the fine was initially set at 165.7 million euros "to reflect the gravity of the infringement" posed by Microsoft's business practices. It was doubled to ensure a "sufficient deterrent effect" on the world's richest company. It was then raised by another 50% because the company had continued violating EU law for five years and five months after it had been put on notice that its business activities could run afoul of EU law.

Microsoft has about two months to appeal the commission's decision to an EU court in Luxembourg, where it is expected to seek a quick suspension of the commission's order. A full appeal could last as long as five years.

European antitrust regulators, meanwhile, are already investigating other complaints related to other Microsoft business activities and the latest version of its dominant Windows software. Those complaints could result in additional  fines and sanctions.

Separately,  Microsoft told a U.S. federal judge in Washington that it will extend a major element of its antitrust settlement with the U.S. government for an additional two years, to better comply with the pact.

At a court hearing yesterday on the status of the settlement,  Microsoft said it now will offer competitors licenses for some of its technology until 2009, in response to complaints from rivals and the U.S.
Justice Department that the licenses were too complicated and limited.

The technology, allowing non-Microsoft network-server software to communicate easily with the dominant Windows operating system, was viewed as a way to bring more  competition to the personal-computer market and to keep  Microsoft from dominating the server-software market. But only 14 companies have licensed the protocols, largely for limited use rather than general-purpose
server software.  Microsoft last week announced that it had simplified and broadened the licenses, and also had improved technical documentation.

The extension will also apply to Windows' successor software for servers and clients -- code-named "Longhorn" -- when it is released. But U.S. government enforcement of the settlement won't continue beyond the November 2007 expiration date.

SE      Antitrust
HD      Microsoft Hints At Possible  Appeal Points For European Ruling

Microsoft has shed light on the potential direction of its coming appeal of a European  antitrust decision against the software firm. A new brief from the company argues that the decision will hinder innovation and create new laws and precedents.

"The [European] decision creates new law in an effort to justify unprecedented regulatory intervention with respect to the integration of new functionality into finished products by a dominant firm,"  Microsoft said in the brief.

TD
"The decision opens the door to intrusive regulation of product design -- not to mention a record  fine -- based on a complaint by a single component supplier, even when this integration is the market norm and other suppliers continue to grow," the company wrote. "Such a result, if allowed to stand, would almost certainly spell bad news for the European and global economies."

The company's analysis -- sent to legal analysts, elected officials and other interested parties -- came as the European Commission competition directorate prepared to publicly release its 300-page decision Thursday. The paper was not intended to strictly identify the appeal that  Microsoft must file in the coming weeks, company spokesman Jim Desler said.

The main points highlighted by  Microsoft include the impact the decision could have on consumers, the technology industry and other sectors by "stifling innovation."  Microsoft also said the decision could cause economic harm by undercutting the benefits of technology integration, lead to consumer confusion and pave the way for multiple versions of  Microsoft's Windows computer-operating system.

The commission decision issued March 24 resulted in fines of about $613 million on the U.S. software maker after a five-year investigation found that Microsoft abused its hold on the market for
computer-operating systems to hurt rivals who make software for audiovisual players and computer servers.

The commission also ordered  Microsoft to reveal details of its Windows software within 120 days, to make it easier for rivals to design compatible products that work on low-end servers. In addition, the company has 90 days to provide customers with a Windows version that does not contain  Microsoft's own audiovisual player.

Microsoft's paper said the commission decision puts two questions in "bold relief." First, it asked whether a firm with a dominant position has a legal duty to license its proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to its competitors for them to use against the dominant firm.

"The decision goes well beyond established legal precedents by asserting a broad and ill-defined duty on dominant firms to share the fruits of their research and development with other companies in the same product market," the brief said.

Second,  Microsoft asked whether it is unlawful for a dominant firm to incorporate new components or features that improve its product. The decision finds that such product integration is unlawful if an alternative component supplier suffers a loss of market share, unless the dominant firm can prove the integration is "indispensable" to achieving pro-competitive results,  Microsoft said.

HD     IT: MICROSOFT PAYS $440 MILLION TO INTERTRUST TO END LEGAL BATTLE WC     466 words

LP
Software giant  Microsoft ended its legal battle with InterTrust over a breach of patent on April 12, by paying $440 million. The agreement concluded with InterTrust - where the Dutch and Japanese giants Philips and Sony hold significant stakes - will allow users of  Microsoft software (and programmers working with Microsoft software) to use this material without needing a licence from InterTrust, according to Microsoft press release.

TD
InterTrust's patent portfolio covers software and hardware techniques that can be implemented in a broad range of products that use DRM and trusted computing technologies, including computer operating systems, digital media platforms, Web services and enterprise infrastructure. The company accused Microsoft of breaching InterTrust patents in the majority of its software products, and especially in its flagship operating system, Windows (which is installed on some 90% of the world's PCs). It made similar claims with regards to Micrsoft's games console XBox. In making peace with InterTrust, after three years of conflict,  Microsoft has once more succeeded in ending litigation in exchange for the payment of a
large sum of money. On April 2, it caused real surprise by announcing a friendship agreement with arch-rival Sun Microsystems, for the payment of $1.6 billion.

These sums will hardly make a dent in the impressive war-chest accumulated by  Microsoft over the years. According to the most recent information, the Redmond giant now has over $55 billion at its disposal. The world leader in IT was, however, censured in March by the  European Commission for abuse of its dominant position and ordered to pay a fine of $600 million. It was, moreover, required to make fundamental changes to its software. Microsoft announced its intention to fight this censure every step of the way. And just as  Microsoft encountered legal problems in Europe, it is now being prosecuted in South Korea. The first South-Korean Internet portal announced on April 12 that it had started judicial proceedings against the US company, accusing it of infringing  antitrust regulations.
The fight against IT piracy.

In addition,  Microsoft indicated on April 7 its desire to redouble its efforts against IT piracy, in particular by enhancing computer protection systems. A new Firewall against hackers, a kind of anti-spam security barrier, will be offered to users during 2004, explained the Chairman of  Microsoft, Steve Ballmer. Mr Ballmer also insisted on the importance of users keeping these security systems up to date. However, he stated that the number of US complaints against spam had dropped by 75% in 2003 compared to the year before. A number of highly dangerous computer viruses, such as Netsky, Mydoom, Sobig, Slammer and Blaster, have infected hundreds of thousands of computers throughout the world over the past few years.

HD       Software giant to outline  case for consumer: Microsoft delivers  its arguments in battle with
Brussels, writes Daniel Dombey.

Just what were the consequences of the  European Commission's decision to punish  Microsoft last month and who did Brussels want to protect?
Those questions will be at the heart of the legal battle over the landmark decision to  fine Microsoft
Euros 497m (Dollars 590m) and order it to change its ways.

TD
The case could drag on five or six years, although it should take only a few months for Europe's Court of First Instance to decide whether to suspend the Commission's concrete demands ahead of a final verdict.

But the FT has already seen the main arguments on both sides, in the form of a  Microsoft briefing note for Microsoft lawyers and econo mists and a recent version of the Commission decision against the group. Microsoft argues that the Commission is "making law" in defiance of the facts and serving the interests of competitors rather than customers.

The Commission responds that high technology cannot be ring-fenced from the same  antitrust rules that govern other industries.
The Commission decision argues that it cannot wait until the company has foreclosed all competition
because "at that point  Microsoft could no longer be subjected to any meaningful antitrust remedy".

However, Microsoft maintains that the Commission has imposed startling new measures without backing them with evidence of consumer harm. "The decision goes well beyond established legal precedents by asserting a broad and ill-defined duty on dominant firms to share the fruits of their research and development," it says. "These rulings put at risk the economic incentives for a broad range of companies and industries."

The company faults the Commission decision for sloppy workmanship behind such mould-breaking conclusions, finding "little explanation and no economic analysis for its conclusion that industry-wide innovation will be boosted in the long term if one firm is divested of its exclusive intellectual property rights".

It says the Commission breaks with precedent in forcing the licensing of intellectual property to direct competitors, rather than companies in a distinct and secondary market. And  Microsoft says the information concerned, a range of protocols demanded by rival companies in the server market, are not necessary for "the creation of competing server operating systems".

Microsoft also criticises the Commission for censuring it for "tying" its Media Player program with Windows and ordering it to offer computer manufacturers in Europe a version of Windows without Media Player.



Page 191 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"There is no evidence that the alleged tie has restricted consumer choice or eliminated incentives for consumers to use third-party media players. The entire case rests on the purported adverse impact on a single competitor, RealNetworks."

Microsoft contends that consumers do not want an operating system that lacks Media Player, even if rival programs are available. "The fact that there is a market for shoelaces does not mean there is a market for shoes that have their laces missing." But Commission officials argue that the 300-page decision is thoroughly researched and in line with case law - with more than 1,300 footnotes and reference to high-profile cases.

In particular, the decision says that data provided by  Microsoft itself "confirm that  Microsoft's withholding of interoperability information results in customers directing their purchasing decisions to Microsoft . .. products".

It adds that a licensing arrangement under the US settlement "does not resolve the problem of insufficient disclosure of interoperability information by  Microsoft" and that the company's Windows monopoly allows it to set the rules and draw up the protocols other companies need "to viably stay on the market".

The Commission argues that far from battling for a single competitor, it is concerned with the future of the IT and communications industries.

"If  Microsoft's digital rights management technology, which is bundled with Media Player, becomes dominant, any company wishing to sell content (games, video, audio) in a secure way will need to have access to it," it says. "Microsoft would be able to set a 'toll' on each such transaction."

CLM       ANTITRUST PROBE

HD          EU doubled  original Microsoft fine

To arrive at its record  antitrust fine against Microsoft Corp., European  antitrust regulators doubled their initial figure to take account of the company's wealth, and raised it again for its five years of refusal to change its behaviour during the investigation, according to a copy of the full text of the decision to be published later this week.

TD
The final amount was 497.2 million euros ($588.6-million U.S.), about twice what  Microsoft officials had said they expected. When it was announced last month following failed settlement talks, the European Commission didn't explain how it arrived at the figure.  Microsoft's top lawyer in Europe, Horacio Gutierrez, denounced it at the time as âunprecedented and inappropriateâ given that the U.S. government and a U.S. court had previously permitted the conduct at issue, an assertion European regulators contest.

A Microsoft internal response to the decision largely ignores the  fine, but sets out the company's thinking ahead of a likely appeal. The document, dated April 19, blasts European regulators for âseeking to make new lawâ that would not only punish  Microsoft unfairly, but also hit any other company with a commanding market share.

The document, prepared for senior  Microsoft management and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, goes on to compare the commission's reasoning in one part of the case â requiring the company to separate its multimedia player from its Windows operating system â as akin to requiring a shoe company to sell its shoes without laces so that lace makers could improve their business. The example attempts to turn the commission's own guidelines against it. The guidelines, the memo notes, use the shoe example to demonstrate what types of products can legitimately be bundled together.

The 300-page commission decision, reviewed by the Journal, lays out the history of the case and regulators' view of  Microsoft's behaviour in painstaking detail. The commission concluded that Microsoft abused the dominance of its Windows software in the personal computer market to illegally muscle its way into related markets, such as those involving software that allows computers to communicate over networks and play digital music and video.

It ordered  Microsoft to license information needed by competitors and others to take full advantage of the networking functions built into Windows software, as well as ordering the company to sell a version of Windows stripped of the media player so that PC makers might be encouraged to install rival
players.

The order also reserves the right for the commission to impose a harsher punishment later, âshould it prove that  Microsoft demotes the performance of the unbundled version of Windows, thus rendering the remedy ineffective.â

Page 193 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The decision says the fine was initially set at 165.7 million euros âto reflect the gravity of the infringementâ posed by Microsoft's business practices. It was doubled to ensure a âsufficient deterrent effectâ on the world's richest company. It was then raised by another 50 per cent because the company had continued violating EU law for more than five years after it had been put on notice that its business activities could run afoul of EU law.

Microsoft has about two months to appeal the commission's decision to an EU court in Luxembourg. A
full appeal could last as long as five years.

HD          EU Investigates Claims That Intel Was Favored for Public Contracts

BRUSSELS -- Regulators are investigating whether some European governments illegally favored Intel
Corp. chips in public procurement of computers, the  European Commission said.

The probe was opened after complaints from Intel's competitors, whose names the European Union officials declined to disclose.

TD
Intel said it is evaluating the EU investigation and its potential impact on its customers in Europe. Spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the Santa Clara, Calif., company also is looking into how the Intel-only requirements came about.
"Based on our understanding, there is no allegation of wrongdoing on Intel's part," Mr. Mulloy said. EU officials didn't accuse Intel of wrongdoing and said they didn't yet know exactly why governments
put Intel-only clauses in bid requirements. They also said they didn't know how large the total number
of contracts involved could be.

Intel's largest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., has a strong presence in Europe. AMD, which produces its microprocessor wafers in Dresden, Germany, where it is building a second plant, declined to comment on the matter.

While less important than the recent EU  antitrust crackdown on Redmond, Wash.-based  Microsoft Corp., which resulted in a record 497 million euro  fine ($589.4 million), this case resembles similar attempts by  Microsoft's Linux competitors to try and seek regulatory help in abolishing any
public-procurement requirements for proprietary software standards.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said that "under public procurement rules, you may not say computers must contain chips by particular manufacturer." Government agencies are free to specify what standards they require for their computer systems when putting out bids for tender. But, Mr. Todd said, such technical specifications must not exclude specific makers of similar equipment as they could undermine "open and competitive procedures" in public bids.

EU officials said they were primarily focusing on two large countries: Germany and Italy. Both countries have received a request to provide information within two months. Regulators then must decide
whether to bring court cases to change the practices.

Other countries that also are being looked at as part of the investigation include Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands, Mr. Todd said. But these countries haven't yet received formal requests for information.

Mr. Todd cited Sweden as an example of how the issue could potentially be resolved. When regulators complained that the northern Swedish city of Luleaa was requiring Intel processors by name, the Swedish government sent a warning to the municipality, which then agreed to change its future procurement habits.

"Luleaa municipality admitted after European Union complaints that it was mistaken in its technical description of computers referring directly to the brand "Intel Pentium IV," Sweden's national board for
Page 195 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
public procurement published in its March newsletter. "The municipality said that it was possible to design demand specifications in a more neutral way and decided to cancel the bid process" and agreed that, "in the future, bid requests must be designed in a way that references to a specific brand or product origination" would be eliminated.
If those countries that are currently being investigated agree to follow Luleaa's approach, the EU
investigations will be dropped, Mr. Todd said.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission calculated its huge  antitrust fine against Microsoft Corp. by doubling and then raising again its first figure, basing its computations on the software giant's vast financial resources and on its refusal to alter its business practices during a five year investigation, according to a copy of the decision to be published this week.

The final amount of its record  antitrust fine was 497.2 million euros ($588.6 million), about twice what Microsoft officials had said they expected. When the  fine was announced following failed settlement talks, the European Commission didn't explain how it arrived at the number.

continued violating EU law for five years and five months after it had been put on notice.

A Microsoft internal response to the decision, dated April 19, blasts European regulators for "seeking to make new law" that not only would punish  Microsoft unfairly, but also hit any other company with a commanding market share. "The novel legal standards announced in this decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth," says the document, prepared for senior  Microsoft management and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

In resolving a different legal wrangle yesterday,  Microsoft told a U.S. federal judge in Washington that it will extend a major element of its  antitrust settlement with the U.S. government for an additional two years, to better comply with that pact.

At a court hearing on the status of the U.S. settlement,  Microsoft said it now will offer competitors licenses for some of its technology until 2009, in response to complaints from rivals and the U.S. Justice Department that the licenses were too complicated and limited.

The technology, allowing non-Microsoft network-server software to communicate easily with the dominant Windows operating system, was viewed as a way to bring more  competition to the personal-computer market and to keep  Microsoft from dominating the server-software market.

The 300-page European Commission decision, also reviewed by the Journal, concluded that Microsoft abused the dominance of its Windows software in the PC market to illegally muscle its way into related software markets, such as those that allow computers to communicate over networks and to play digital music and video.

A record fine imposed on Microsoft in Europe last month arose from the longstanding nature of the software company's anticompetitive practices, according to a massive report from European regulators.

The European Commission's 300-page document says the more than five-year duration of those practices pushed the fine to 497 million euros--now about $590 million--well above what  Microsoft would have been charged simply on the basis of its business practices.

TD
"The amount of the  fine to be imposed on the basis of the gravity of the infringement should therefore be increased by 50% to take account of its duration. On that basis, the base amount of the  fine is EUR
497,196,304," the document says.
The report is a full account of the investigation by the  European Commission, the executive arm of the
15-nation European Union, into the way  Microsoft sells software, and had been expected, since
regulators announced their decision in March. That ruling found that the Redmond, Wash., company had
failed to give rivals information that they needed to compete fairly in the market for server software and
that it had been offering the Windows operating system on the condition that it come bundled with
Windows Media Player, stifling  competition.

The commission made the document available publicly Thursday at the end of its workday. Some of the findings from the report were first published by the online edition of The Wall Street Journal.

Responding to the report, which it had seen before the public release,  Microsoft posted a seven-page paper to its Web site that aimed to portray the company as the victim of overreaching regulators. The paper called the March ruling a "new law" and cited both the ruling's potential to cause damage and its alleged legal shortcomings.
The commission's reponse to the  Microsoft paper was terse.

"This is a decision the commission has taken. We will be explaining our decision in court and not in the press," Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the agency, said Thursday.

Microsoft intends to appeal the remedies outlined by the regulators, taking the legal battle to Europe's
Court of First Instance.

"As our document points out, the commission's decision will have an adverse effect on consumers, the technology industry and many other sectors by stifling innovation," said Jim Desler, a  Microsoft spokesman. The company also maintains that the size of the  fine is excessive.
Much ado about Media Player
The March ruling gave  Microsoft 90 days to provide a version of Windows without Media Player,
although it can also continue to provide a version that includes the media software. Thursday's document
offered additional details on that mandate.

"The remedy applies to Windows licensed directly to end users and licensed to (computer makers) for sale" in the European Union, the report stated.
Page 199 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft would be required to offer an operating system without Media Player that would perform as well as the bundled version of the Windows. It would be prohibited from offering a Media Player download link without also providing a similar link to its competitors' players.

"Microsoft must not give OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) or users a discount conditional on their obtaining Windows together with WMP (Windows Media Player)...or otherwise, remove or restrict OEMs' or users' freedom to choose the version of Windows without (Media Player)," the report said.
The commission also prohibited  Microsoft from shipping Media Player with another  Microsoft
product--such as its Office software suite--that is dominant in its own market much as Windows is among
operating systems.

The EU document also offers historical insight into  Microsoft's business and how company executives viewed the software maker's market position. For instance, it notes that  Microsoft withheld information from rival Sun Microsystems on the issue of interoperability.

In September 1998, Richard Green, a Sun vice president, wrote a letter to Paul Maritz, a  Microsoft executive vice president, in which Green requested from  Microsoft "the complete information required to allow Sun...to provide native support for the complete set of Active Directory technologies on Solaris."

Sun's request encompassed the specifications for certain protocols used by Windows work group servers. Although Maritz responded that the information was already available to Sun and other software developers via the Microsoft Developer Network and that relevant source code could be licensed from other sources, the commission found that  Microsoft withheld information.

"Microsoft has acknowledged a number of specific instances of interoperability information that fall within what was requested in Mr. Green's letter and that  Microsoft refuses to provide to any work group server operating system vendor," the report states.

As a result, the commission's remedies call for  Microsoft to provide complete and accurate disclosure of protocols used by the Windows work group servers to provide file, print, group and user administration services to Windows work group networks, according to the report. The protocols should be shared with competitors at about the same time  Microsoft releases its products to beta testers, the order said.

In addressing the future development of  Microsoft products, the commission also said it preferred to define the scope of the relevant protocols, based on generic services such as file and print rather than on specific versions of products.
The commission notes that its remedies do not require  Microsoft to share its own source code. An "exclusive franchise"
The report also includes a memo written for  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates by C++ General Manager Aaron Contorer in 1997 that describes one of the reasons why he felt  Microsoft's Windows operating system was becoming a must-have product for client PC vendors.

Contorer wrote that end users stuck with Windows, despite the operating system's shortcomings, based on the high costs of abandoning heavy investments already made in APIs.

"The Windows API is so broad, so deep and so functional that most ISVs (independent software vendors) would be crazy not to use it. And it is so deeply embedded in the source code of many Windows apps that there is a huge switching cost to using a different operating system, instead," the e-mail reads.

"It is this switching cost that has given the customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy drivers, our high TCO (total cost of ownership), our lack of a sexy vision, at times, and many other difficulties," the e-mail said. "Customers constantly evaluate other desktop platforms, (but) it would be so much work to move over that they hope we just improve Windows rather than force them to move."

The Contorer e-mail continues: "In short, without this exclusive franchise, called the Windows API, we would have been dead a long time ago."

In making its conclusions on the bundling of Microsoft's media player with its operating system, Mario Monti, the head of the European Commission's competition bureau, said: "The commission does not purport to pass judgment as to the desirability of one unique media player, or set of media technologies coming to dominate the market. However, the manner in which  competition unfolds in the media player market, which may or may not bring about such a result, is of competitive concern."

Page 200 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission alleged  Microsoft has a "clear incentive" to achieve a strong role in the media player market, which would serve as leverage in propagating its stake in proprietary media formats and technologies for its server software efforts, as well as bolster its relationship with content developers.
"It has been shown that what Microsoft presents as the benefits of tying (its media player to its OS)
could be achieved in the absence of Microsoft tying WMP with Windows. As regards (the) other benefits
identified by  Microsoft, they primarily relate to  Microsoft's own profitability and, being furthermore
disproportionate to the anticompetitive effects in the market caused by the tying, cannot therefore serve
as a valid justification," the commission said.

We will be making statements in this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the management discussion and analysis section of our 2004 Form 10-Qs, our
2003 Form 10-K, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
With that let me now turn it over to Scott for a more detailed discussion of the results.

SCOTT DI VELARIO, CORPORATE VP, CORPORATE CONTROLLER,  MICROSOFT: Thanks Curt and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. At this time I'll provide an overview on the quarter and highlight a few significant financial and business momentum points. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the third quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.

From a revenue perspective, we had a strong quarter with net revenue up 17% to $9.2 billion with nearly all of our seven business segments exceeding expectations and growing double digits. Better than expected OEM sales of Windows XP, continued strength and sales of Office 2003, strong demand for server products, healthy Xbox console and software sales and higher MSN advertising revenue contributed to our overall excellent performance.

Page 202 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We continue to receive a benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the weakened U.S. dollar. However, the impact was generally in line with the guidance we gave you in January. Had rates been constant with the prior year, revenue would have been approximately $350 million lower. We estimate that total PC growth was about 14% driven by strong business demand in both mature and emerging markets. Total server hardware units grew about 17%, with Windows sever shipments growing faster than the overall market at 25%.

Total operating expenses came in at $7.9 billion, including $748 million of stock-based compensation expense. G&A costs were higher than expected due to $2.5 billion of legal charges, resulting from the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and the accrual related to the  European commission fine. Operating income decreased 53% to $1.3 billion, primarily due to the legal expenses I just discussed. Investment income totaled $1 billion, higher than our guidance, primarily due to higher realized gains resulting from generally improved market conditions.

Net income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, with diluted earnings per share of 12 cents. Including 17 cents related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the accrual as related to the  European commission fine, and 5 cents in stock-based compensation. Recognition of revenue related to annuity licensing agreements during the quarter, accounted for approximately 24% of total revenue. This compares to 26% in the prior year and 22% in the second quarter of this year.

Now let me take a minute to provide some color around PC demand. We estimate that total PC unit shipments worldwide grew about 14% during the quarter. The U.S., EMEA and Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, all showed low to mid double-digit growth. Japan and Latin America grew in the mid to high single-digit range. We continue to see strong unit growth in emerging markets where a greater percentage of PCs ship with pirated copies of our product or without a  Microsoft operating system. As a result, growth in underlying PC unit shipments does not always correlate directly with our operating system license growth numbers.

Now let's get to the business segment results. Client revenue grew 16% to $2.9 billion driven by stronger than expected PC shipments. Windows OEM license units grew 16%, which drove 18% growth in OEM revenue. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth was driven principally by 2 point increase in the mix of professional versions of Windows up to 58% as we experienced strong business PC shipments.

Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew less than the OEM channel as customers purchased or upgraded their operating systems through the PC purchase of a new PC. During the quarter client
operating income declined 16%, primarily as a result of the $700 million charge related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystem litigation.

Revenue from Server and Tools grew 19% to $2.2 billion, driven by healthy demand for Windows server, Exchange, SQL Server and Visual Studio products. Rapid customer adoption of Windows server continued with new licenses growing 31% compared to the prior year. Similar to previous quarters, we saw strong growth in server OEM sales.

Our consulting and premier product support businesses grew 11%. Revenue from developer tools, training and certification and MS press business decreased 38% due to the recognition of $128 million of previously deferred revenue in Q3 of the prior year. Server and Tools had an operating loss of $940 million primarily due to a charge related to settlement of Sun Microsystems litigation of approximately $1.2 billion.

Information Worker revenue was up 18% to $2.7 billion, as Office experienced strong sales across all customer segments. During the quarter OEM licensing revenues grew 35% and revenue from preinstalled versions of Office 2003 in Japan, volume licensing and retail package products grew an aggregate of 15%. Information Worker operating income improved 14% during the quarter, primarily due to the increase in revenue.

Revenue from Microsoft Business Solutions was $153 million, up 4% primarily due to continued growth in licensing of Navision products outside the United States. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering high-value products to our customers and improving our execution across the board. The operating losses from Microsoft Business Solutions improved 29% on lower operating expenses.

MSN reported another profitable quarter with improved margins, as well as better than expected revenue growth of 16%. MSN advertising revenue increased 43% during the quarter, again showing strength in both traditional on-line and search-based advertising.

Revenue in the subscription side of the business decreased about 6% year-over-year as the business continues to see a decline in its narrow band subscriber base. The subscription number ended up slightly above the December quarter at 8.2 million as the loss of narrow band subscribers was offset by the gain of

Page 203 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Internet services and hot mail extra storage subscription. Revenue in the mobile and embedded devices grew 33% to $61 million on strong growth across all our business.

Additionally, upcoming Windows mobile-based smartphones like Motorola MPx and MPx100 generated tremendous enthusiasm at the 3GSM conference in February. We released Windows mobile 2003 second edition software during the quarter as we continue to improve the software experience on mobile devices. Mobile and embedded devices operating loss improved 47% due to lower operating expenses.

Now turning to home and entertainment, revenues increased 17% to $530 million. Xbox console volumes increased 30% over the same quarter last year. In the U.S., March NPD data showed that Xbox market share has increased 8 percentage points from 22% in March 2003 to 30% in March of 2004.

The Xbox business continues to execute with steady console growth, strong software sales, increasing numbers of subscribers using our Xbox Live gaming service and the highest U.S. attach rate of any console after just over two years in the market at 6.8. Operating loss for the third quarter improved 25% driven by revenue growth and improved Xbox console and third-party software margins.

Moving on to the rest of the income statement, cost of revenue increased slightly to $1.4 billion due to the higher cost of services, as well as the higher volume of Xbox consoles. The balance of operating expenses increased $2.7 billion primarily due to charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation, accrual for the  European commission fine, and other legal expenses. Sales and marketing came in about where we expected, and R&D was a bit below our guidance due to lower headcount-related costs.

Operating income was $1.3 billion, including the legal expenses which were partially offset by stronger than expected revenue. Investment income of $1 billion increased significantly from the third quarter of 2003 due to improved market conditions, resulting in higher gains on the sales of investments and significantly lower impairments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 42% reflecting the nondeductability of  European     commission fine.

Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations increased 19% to $4.9 billion reflecting strong revenue and changes to working capital. During the quarter we spent approximately $1.4 billion to repurchase nearly 50 million shares. Accounts receivable decreased $671 million sequentially consist went seasonal trends. DSO was at 51 days compared to 49 days in the prior year March quarter.
As we usually point out, our DSO computation includes changes in unearned revenue in the average sales number so it is consistent with what is included in receivables.

Other current liabilities increased $2.5 billion primarily as a result of the accrual for the settlement of legal claims with Sun Microsystems and InterTrust. The $440 million InterTrust settlement involved a combination of license of IP assets valued at $266 million and a payment of $174 million for past infringement. This settlement is reflected in our financial results, do not impact the income statement because it was partially funded through insurance.

Unearned revenue was down seqentually $326 million to $7.5 billion, slightly better than our forecast. Annuity billing showed year-over-year growth driven primarily by new enterprise agreements signed with large corporations. License-only billings were stronger than we anticipated, partially driven by continued momentum for Office 2003 and strong demand for our server products.

The upgrade advantage contract amortization during the quarter was $261 million compared to $296 million in December 2003 quarter and $450 million in the prior year March quarter. The undelivered element
portion of unearned revenue decreased by $123 million due to the reduction in our product deferral rates for Windows and Office during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. We expect the undelivered elements portion of unearned revenue to continue to decrease as the lower deferral rates add to the account at a
slower rate than the current period recognition. Contracted but unbilled revenue increased sequentially and remains over $6 billion as customers continue to buy or renew enterprise agreements consistent with the previous few quarters.

Finally, I'd like to point out our average diluted weighted shares outstanding were 10.86 billion right about where we expected. We continue to actively manage share dilution through our various buyback programs.
Let me turn it back to Curt and John.

CURT ANDERSON: Thanks, Scott. I'd now like to turn it over to John for his thoughts on the forecast and guidance. Thanks.

JOHN CONNORS, CFO, SR. VP,  MICROSOFT: Thanks, Scott and Curt. And good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin with a couple of announcements. I'm pleased to announce that Brent Callinicos will transition from his current role as Corporate Vice President and Treasurer to lead our Worldwide Licensing and Pricing group. Replacing Brent as Treasurer will be Assistant Treasurer, George Zin. Each of these
Page 204 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
executives has made significant contributions in their current positions and brings a wealth of experience to their new roles. I want to offer my congratulations to both of them.

As a reminder, investors should continue to be aware of risks that we have identified in the past and that we include in our filings. Now a few comment regarding this quarter's outstanding performance. Our three largest businesses each turned in excellent results with Information Worker, Client and Server and Tools growing a combined 17%, and our emerging businesses all met or beat our expectations. With MSN outperforming on continued strength in the advertising business, and Xbox turning in better than expected console and game sales.

Business PC demand for the third quarter was much better than we had forecast with particular strength in North America, EMEA, and Japan. The server segment did better with Windows Server shipments growing almost 25%. Last quarter we said we were beginning to see evidence of an improvement in the corporate
IT market. Our results this quarter demonstrate that we are in the midst of a corporate recovery. Our customers are really seeing the great value in our newer products.
Office 2003 had retail sales that were twice that of Office XP at the five-month mark. Small Business Server
2003 had unit sales 170% higher than that for Small Business Server 2003 at the six-month milestone. And
Windows Server 2003, which was launched a year ago, is our most successful server operating system
product to date with customer license sales double any previous version over a comparable period since its
launch. Finally, our long-term operating model is also benefiting from total costs, excluding legal
settlements, growing at lower rates than revenue growth.

Now let me turn to the details of our forecast for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, beginning with our assumptions for the macroeconomic environment. We expect the improvement we saw in corporate spending to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. Corporate profits are up and businesses seem more willing to invest in IT projects. Growth in consumer PCs should slow a bit relative to the very strong first half we saw this year. Our forecast for the fourth quarter reflects these trends.

For full fiscal year '04 we are raising our PC forecast a bit to the low teens. We now expect that business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth in the second half of the fiscal year, reversing the trend that we saw in the first half. For the fourth quarter, we're looking for roughly 10% overall growth. Our early view for FY '05 is that PC unit growth will likely be mid to upper single digits.

For the full fiscal year '04, we have raised the server hardware forecast to a little over 14%. As always, this represents a roll-up of both Intel and proprietary UNIX hardware. We expect the Windows platform to grow faster than both the Intel and overall server segments. For the fourth quarter, we are looking for roughly
13% growth in the overall server segment. In fiscal year '05 we think server shipment growth should be between 11% and 13%.

Now to revenue. And unless I specifically mention otherwise, all comparisons refer to the same period in the prior year. Net revenue for the June quarter should be in the range of $8.9 to $9 billion, up 10 to 12%. This implies that the full year FY '04 revenue, will be approximately $36.4 to $36.5 billion, or growth of about 13 to 14% over fiscal year '03.

Now let me break this guidance down by business segment. Starting with client. Fourth quarter revenue should increase 8 to 9%. This growth rate is slightly lower than PC unit growth expectations due to exceptionally strong relative emerging market growth in Q4, as well as lower client revenue growth rates in the retail and commercial channels.

Server and tools. In the fourth quarter, revenue should grow between 15 and 18%. We feel great about our performance this year in an extremely competitive environment. Customers are adding more server products and access licenses to their enterprise agreements and our mid-market and small business
results continue to be very solid.

Information Worker revenue for the fourth quarter should be up 15 to 16%. We will continue to focus on driving adoption of the new Office system during the fourth quarter and in fiscal year '05. Our SKU differentiation for Office 2003 with the new small business and student and teacher editions, has been received quite positively by customers driving accelerated adoption in small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as at retail.

Revenue from Business Solutions should be just about $180 million for the June quarter. This is down from the implied fourth quarter guidance we gave in January by roughly $25 million. The reduction is due principally to lowered expectations in the United States. Non-United States results and sales of the
Navision line of products continue to fuel the growth of the MBS business. MBS continues to outgrow many of its competitors and our focus is to improve this business unit's performance over a multi-year period.


Page 205 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MSN revenue for the fourth quarter should be approximately $570 million. We continue to benefit from the same trends we have discussed over the course of this fiscal year. Our gains in the advertising segment of our business have outpaced lower access subscription revenue as our narrow band subscriber base declines. MSN also continues to contribute to our bottom line with another profitable quarter. This business has definitely emerged.

Mobile and embedded devices revenue for the June quarter should be about $55 million. This represents growth of over 25% on an increasing base of business. Home and entertainment revenue for the fourth quarter should be approximately $460 million. Consistent with the guidance we reiterated after the holiday quarter, we still are on track to have 1 million Xbox Live subscribers and life to date Xbox console sales of
$14.5 to $16 million by the end of the fiscal year.

We forecasted in January that the unearned revenue balance would end the fiscal year pretty close to where we ended the December quarter. March ended a little better than we expected, driven by signings of enterprise agreements and open annuity contracts. We should end fiscal year 2004 at or a little higher than we ended December. As a reminder, when we complete this fiscal year we will have recognized virtually all of our upgrade advantage revenue.

Now for the rest of the P&L. All of our guidance on cost of revenue and operating expenses includes stock-based compensation. Total stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter should be approximately $750 million. For the fourth quarter and as a percent of net revenue, cost of revenue should be a little over 16%. Research and development expense should be just under 20%. Sales and marketing expense should be just under 27%. Finally, general and administrative expenses should be just under 6%. So in total, operating expenses for the fourth quarter should be approximately 52% of net revenue.

This drives an operating income range of $2.8 to $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $8.7 to $8.8 billion for the full fiscal year, which includes the $2.5 billion of charges in the third quarter for the Sun settlement and the European commission fine, as well as $5.7 billion for all stock-based compensation in FY '04. For the fourth quarter, investment income should be roughly $900 million, a little higher than our prior guidance due primarily to higher realized gains in fixed income and emerging market portfolios.

As a reminder, this forecast does not include any potential investment impairments or gains and losses attributable to derivative instruments. With an effective tax rate of 33% and a projected outstanding share count of 10.86 billion shares for the fourth quarter, we arrived at fully diluted EPS guidance of 23 cents. For the full fiscal year, assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 35% and 10.89 billion shares outstanding, we arrive at fully diluted EPS guidance of 73 to 74 cents.

So we had a fantastic quarter and it looks like we're going to have a great year. At this point I would like to talk about our preliminary view of fiscal 2005, as we're in the middle of finalizing our planning. Our current forecast for FY '05 has revenue of $37.8 to $38.2 billion, operating income of $15.9 to $16.3 billion, and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.16 to $1.18. The forecast includes approximately $2.5 billion of
stock-based compensation.

Now let me take a few minutes to outline some of the key items necessary to understand our FY '05 guidance. First upgrade advantage. In FY '04 we will recognize about $1.1 billion from upgrade advantage. We continued to assume that conversion rates from upgrade advantage to software assurance will be between 10 and 30%, and while we consider those conversion metrics quite good, it leaves us with tough comparables for the year, particularly in our Information Worker and Server and Tools businesses.

Second, foreign exchange. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2004 we would have recognized approximately $830 million less in revenue if currency rates had stayed constant with those rates of fiscal year 2003. We are forecasting little to no foreign exchange benefit in FY '05.

Third, PC and server unit forecasts. Given the high growth rates in PC and server units in the first three quarters of this year, the comparables are more difficult next year, even if IT spending continues to improve and we continue to execute as well or better than we did this year.

Fourth, MSN and home and entertainment have executed very well over the course of fiscal 2004. Next year MSN will continue to see subscription access revenues from narrow band subscribers decline, and that will make overall revenue growth challenging for the business. Home and entertainment will also be challenged to grow revenue as recent pricing actions, normal in this stage of the lifecycle, lead to difficult year-over-year comps for the Xbox business.

Finally, our operating income guidance implies that operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and our fiscal year '04 legal settlements and  fine, are essentially flat year-over-year. This should result in roughly two points of operating margin improvement.

We are proud of the efforts and very good progress we are making and have made as a company in terms of cost efficacy. These efforts will continue and contribute to value creation for all shareholders. So while FY '05 has tough revenue comparables, our absolute results should be quite good.

Before I close, I would like to make a quick comment on the question of cash. We've worked hard to clear up a substantial amount of our legal exposure. AOL, Sun, InterTrust, and all but a handful of the state class-action suits. Brad Smith and the legal team have done a tremendous job. We will continue to focus on getting closure on our legal matters, but tremendous progress has been made. We are still on track to be able to share more details by the financial analyst meeting in July.

In closing, I want to broadly frame the opportunity we see in front of us in terms of products and technologies, as well as our opportunity to increase shareholder value. Over the past three years, we have done a better job of growing absolute revenue, profits, and cash flow than any of our technology peers. We've also generated a portfolio of products that have delivered real value to customers. We've shipped Windows XP, Office 2003, Windows Server 2003, Exchange 2003, Small Business Server 2003, Visual Studio, CRM, Tablet PC, Media Center, MSN 9, Smartphone, Pocket PC, and Xbox.

We've invested heavily and made very, very good progress on a number of ground-breaking technologies. Rights management, collaboration, business intelligence, management, search, security, speech, inking, to name just a few. Over the next several years we will deliver some fantastic products including SQL Server
2005, Longhorn Client, Longhorn Server, Visual Studio 2005, Office 12, our next-generation business solutions platform, next-generation Xbox console and a host of additional products.

We believe that we clearly have the broadest portfolio of products and the best pipeline of technology of any company in the industry, bar none. We have made very good progress on our equity compensation profile by designing a program that is better for employees and shareholders. We have made and will continue to make progress on the cost efficacy front. Finally, we have a balance sheet that will allow us to provide significant value to shareholders.

FY '04 has been a great year, and FY '05 can be as well. As we look out over the next several years, we see a very, very bright future for the Company and its shareholders. We have the opportunity to deliver incredible innovation to both business and consumer customers and show very meaningful revenue growth. We'll also continue to be very focused on relentlessly driving cost efficacy and executing on a
multi-year plan to reach profitability in all of our emerging businesses. If we do all of these things, which we are confident we can do, we'll likely see revenue and operating income growth improve in FY '06 and beyond.
With that, let me turn it back to Curt for questions.

CURT ANDERSON: Thanks, John. We'd like to now proceed to the question section of our call. We'd like to accommodate as many of your questions as possible so please limit yourself to just one question. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions.

OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone, you will be announced by name prior to asking your question. To withdraw your question, you may press star two. Once again, if you do wish to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. Your first question comes from Drew Brosseau with SG Cowen.

DREW BROSSEAU, SG COWEN SECURITIES: Hi, John. Nice job on the quarter. In fact, I'm pleased to hear you make the first ever CFO comment from  Microsoft about two years out, so that's encouraging. But my question was about your '05 guidance. I'm looking back a year ago and noticing that your guidance for
'04 then turned out to be about 10% low on revenue and 15% low on earnings, so you think you're being similarly conservative now or less so about '05?

JOHN CONNORS: Thanks, Drew. We're just giving you the view we have today. I think the big difference from a year ago would be the big improvement in both PC hardware and server hardware relative to our expectations, and then secondly, foreign exchange. We didn't have expectations for the kind of move in the euro and yen and other non-U.S. currencies that we actually experienced. We think it's a realistic view, I hope a year from now when we're having this call you ask the same question, but I wouldn't put it in your model.
DREW BROSSEAU: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.
OPERATOR: Next question comes from Gibboney Huske with Credit Suisse First Boston.

GIBBONEY HUSKE, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Thank you. Just could you talk a little bit in terms of cost containment program for next year and just how that's being executed among the different business groups. Presumably there's some businesses where you think there's bigger opportunity and they have
Page 207 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
more short term R&D requirements. How are you kind of working that through the different business units? And is there going to be some areas where you're going to have to invest or you're going to have to cut back in other areas?

JOHN CONNORS: The first thing, to frame it appropriately, we view it not as a cost-cutting exercise but as an efficacy program. We are still continuing to hire, we're giving people raises, we're investing very heavily as a company generally. We have a 13-point program where we really look at how do we get more impact for dollars spent? And how do we get improvements in our end-to-end business processes such that we get more output at lower cost? There's obvious things we're doing. For example, we acquired PlaceWare, it's now Office Live Meeting, about 20% of what would have been trips people took in the past are now office live meeting sessions saving us tens of millions of dollars.

We've done great work on a global advertising program. We've done great work on a cross company direct marketing and customer relationship management strategy, terrific work on vendor negotiation, a lot of
work on various R&D efficacy programs that some of which have to do with localization, some of which to have do with tools. We've done very good work in terms of our support, operations, and supply chain groups. So it's really pretty broad-based, and the idea to get more for each dollar spent and get our
end-to-end business processes improved and we've made good progress there.

DREW BROSSEAU: Just one follow-up question, in terms of, looks like your bookings are pretty good in annuities. How are you talking to your customers about some of the product push-outs you've had, obviously there's still some uncertainty in terms of the timing of Longhorn, depending on the timing of their contract, obviously that has an influence on their decisions. How are you talking to customers who are, one, renewing, or secondly, are looking to sign up for one of the programs as a new customer

JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think each customer has a unique circumstance depending on what products they've covered and when. Most importantly we've got a great product lineup and an overwhelming majority of customers are not on our newest products and we have a great product portfolio coming. If you think about the growth we've seen in Windows Server 2003, new license sales this quarter were up 31%, Small Business Server units are up dramatically over a year ago, Exchange, SQL, we've seen good results.

We have factored in, Gibboney, those customers who we would not anticipate would renew or perhaps buy new licenses based on their existing agreements or expired agreements, but we basically see the same type of EA renewal rates that we've seen in the past. And secondly, we haven't changed our assumptions
of those customers that signed up for upgrade advantage how many will go to software assurance. I think the key thing is, we've got to get a great value message out and we think with the products we have and the road map we've got we've got a pretty compelling value proposition.
GIBBONEY HUSKE: Great. Thanks very much. Nice quarter.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.

HEATHER BELLINI, UBS WARBURG: Hi, thank you. John, I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on the OEM trends that you guys have been seeing in the server segment. Seems like the past few quarters there's been upside surprises in terms of the OEM contribution. And secondly, I just was wondering if you could touch on if you're seeing Oracle anymore in the database market with new SMV offering. Thank you.

JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, thanks. We really have been pleasantly surprised with server demand generally and our OEM results specifically. For the third quarter, going into the quarter we thought total server unit shipments would be up kind of 12%. We think they're now up 17%. We think in the next quarter they'll be up about 13% versus January expectation of 9%. And we are seeing good results with a broad range of products, whether it's Windows Server 2003, whether it's Office attached with OEM is quite strong.

Another real pleasant surprise for us is just the really superb product we have for small and mid-size companies called Small Business Server 2003. It has won a lot of awards and deserved it and the demand is quite good, so we've got great products to attach to a market where units are growing. We're very
mindful of Oracle's move in the OEM space, particularly for small businesses and we'll work hard to compete aggressively and I think customers will benefit from what we do and what they do and we're looking forward to doing that over the next few quarters.
HEATHER BELLINI: Great. Thank you.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Charles Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein. CHARLES DI BONA, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: John, I was wondering if we could maybe dig into the
one sector that sort of stands out for its relatively slow performance here in Business Solutions. What are
you seeing in particular around, I guess Great Plains in the U.S. that is making it lag the rest of your

Page 208 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
business? Is it product related? Is it some of the sales force reorganization or is it just a weak application spending environment?

JOHN CONNORS: Thanks, Charlie. MBS probably had on a relative basis the weakest results of any of the seven businesses. It did come in where we expected, which I think is important, so the group has a very good handle on where things are. Our non-U.S. results are terrific. We're outgrowing the  competition significantly. And our U.S. results are really kind of in line with what software sales are in the U.S. for business apps.

We aren't having very good U.S. execution and I think the majority of it is a function of us having a lot of new people in district positions over the course of the year, and we're being less effective with the traditional MBS partners than the MBS group was a year ago. The group has a very clear mission in terms
of getting that U.S. execution improved. I don't think we'll see that in Q4 but we're hopefully see it in FY '05.

It isn't really a product issue, I think it's more of our execution issue and we're just not doing a lot better than competition the way we expected. We're kind of doing what the  competition is doing.
CHARLES DI BONA: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Goldman Sachs.
RICK SHERLUND, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks. John, first you said on the cash you'd say more by the
July analyst meeting. I just wasn't clear if that means you're going to tell us what you're going to do with the
cash or if that was just sort of, we're going to tell you something more about that? Wasn't real clear.

Also to follow up on Drew's question on the 4% revenue growth guidance you gave for '05. If it turns out that EMEA and Japan is getting better as the U.S. has this year, would we expect that to translate into additional margin expansion or would we see you spending more money?

JOHN CONNORS: Good questions on both fronts, Rick. On the cash, it was sort of a round about way of saying I'm not going to say anything today. We do feel good about the legal issues we've cleared, which were significant, and we do feel like we have a clearer view of what our business model impacts could have been or could be. We've got a hearing from the Court of Appeals related to Massachusetts coming up anytime. And we're anxious for that. We've got a court of first instance. We're really hearing folks in terms
of wanting more direction with respect to our cash strategy. We will have a lot more to say no later than the analyst meeting.

In terms of kind of the P&L earnout if you will, if businesses do better on the revenue front than we have guided or we expect, we would expect to see some of that drop to the bottom line, but we would also
expect to see people in businesses have ideas for opportunities to drive more revenue or to drive customer sat. So basically in the earnout process, folks will drop that to the bottom line or they'll have specific programs, but you shouldn't expect all revenue increases to go to expense increase.
RICK SHERLUND: Thanks.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mary Meeker with Morgan Stanley.

MARY MEEKER, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. John, you talked earlier several times on the call about the cost efficacy efforts, if you look at the guidance for fiscal '05 it looks like the, as you pointed out, operating margin expansion should play out. Could you talk about the buy-in process within the organization? At different levels regarding the focus on the cost control and the operating margin expansion? And then a second question relates to where are we, if you know off the top of your head, in the Windows upgrade cycle, i.e. how many of the PCs in the installed base have the newest versions of Windows? Thanks.

JOHN CONNORS: On the first question, Mary, in terms of the endorsement or the agreement or buy-in on cost efficacy, I think generally people here, they're shareholders and/or they're option holders and they're interested in value creation just like the people on the phone, and so they understand that. There's, I think, good strong leadership in our business groups and our management team. I think people as they see the efforts on cost translate into value creation, the picture becomes clearer.

I think in any organization, including this one, it's kind of like a budget anyplace, I'm all for overall lower spending as long as it isn't my group. And so, we clearly have that. But I think in general, the Company has a good ability to get people rallied behind the things it needs to do, and I don't think we'll have any
exception here. We do think, too, there's good opportunity long-term to improve our business processes, improve our efficacy, and as part of growing value for shareholders it's something we'll have to do.

In terms of where we are in the Windows upgrade, we still have enormous opportunity both on the server side of getting NT4 and even predecessor versions of servers and Windows 2000 moved to 2003. And

Page 209 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
really the most meaningful units that have Windows XP in the PC environment are those units that started shipping when we released the product. We did a terrific job of getting aligned with our OEM partners to get Windows XP on machines at launch. We probably did the best job in the history of the Company with a release of an OS, but if you look at the installed base of PCs there's a significant number that aren't running Windows XP. So the opportunity is still good and exists, but our absolute number that we have to grow is also a big number.
RICK SHERLUND: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Keith Gay with Thomas Weisel Partners.

KEITH GAY, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: Hi. A couple of home entertainment questions. How does the Xbox price cut impact gross margins in the June time frame, particularly if it more successful than perhaps you planned? And then second part of this is, does this indicate a shift in your strategy to be out in front of Sony this time you're first with price cut and perhaps with Xbox 2, is there a shift in strategy to be out front perhaps to take additional share?

JOHN CONNORS: Thanks, Keith. On the first front, in terms of where we are in the product lifecycle, our cost of goods is better than it was early in the lifecycle, so the P&L can absorb price cuts more easily than it could previously. The June forecast for revenue and for operating income includes the expectation for what will happen, and we'll just see how the unit volumes play out.

In terms of a price cut, the most important thing we want to do is be very competitive, gain share, and build a large installed base of customers, and we saw that opportunity to do that. The group has both the share objectives in mind as well as P&L objectives, and that's a balance they have to reach, and in this quarter they decided that it was a good time to gain some share.
KEITH GAY: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom Berquist with Smith Barney.

TOM BERQUIST, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: Thank you. Two quick questions. First, you mentioned, John, something on the Windows on Intel gaining share versus Intel shipments. My question is, is that because you're planning on gaining share versus Linux over the next year or is that more related to the Yukon shipment? Secondly, does your forecast for '05 include any revenue for this rumored -- or speculated XP reloaded product that we've heard about in the press?

JOHN CONNORS: In terms of our growth on the Windows front versus Linux, only Linux and Windows are gaining share, and both of us are growing faster than the market, obviously. We had faster growth in Windows Server shipments in the third quarter than hardware units, due in large part to software-only
sales. We also, obviously, sell more absolute units in the quarter in terms of growth than Linux, so we're the two guys that are growing.

In terms of the XP, SP2, or what you might have heard of reload, we've got an incredible opportunity to really get consumers to understand the value behind Windows XP both from an improved security perspective, as well as a digital media and entertainment perspective. Both that Tablet, Media Center, we've got a lot of value to sell. And you'll see us be very aggressive on the XP front in fiscal year '05 and what we plan to do is reflected in these numbers.

TOM BERQUIST: Okay. Thank you. As part of an adjunct to that first one, the Yukon, is that factored into your growth expectations on the server business next year as well, the Yukon shipment I mean?

JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, obviously we take our product road map and then we look at what impact will that have on revenue for the fiscal year, and given where we think SQL 2005 is going to come out in half one of calendar year '05, you can do the math and it will probably be late in that time period. We won't get the benefit from it that we will in fiscal year '06, but it looks like it's going to be a great product. We're fortunate
to have a great product in the market now between that and its release.
TOM BERQUIST: Okay. Thank you.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brier Dudley with the Seattle Times.

BRIER DUDLEY, SEATTLE TIMES: Hi, John. You said that you were going to continue hiring, but you're also going to hold operating expenses flat. Does that mean headcount will also remain flat? And could you also shed light on construction spending plans in the Seattle area?

JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, thanks, Brier. We don't have anything to announce today on our headcount plans for fiscal year '05. We'll talk about that more in the analyst time frame. We have a lot of open positions.

Page 210 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We're still hiring. What we've tried to do is give business groups targets for their P&L's and for their expenses and they make the trade-offs in terms of headcount and other types of costs. We are on track, though, to continue to grow consistent with the goals we set for heads in the prior year.

Secondly, we still have a number Puget Sound area projects underway with respect to construction and this is our home and we'll continue to grow here.
BRIER DUDLEY: Are you going to defer Issaquah?

JOHN CONNORS: I don't have any comment on Issaquah. We'll start building out Issaquah when and if we need the space.
BRIER DUDLEY: Thank you. JOHN CONNORS: You bet.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Your next question comes from Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan.

ADAM HOLT, J.P. MORGAN: Good afternoon. It sounds like some of the strength in IW was driven by better performance in the mid-market, is that driven by the trend you spoke about last quarter of the small and mid-size businesses opting more towards up-front licenses than subscriptions. And what can we extrapolate from some of the current S&P initiatives about your ability to convert that base within the UA renewals going forward?

JOHN CONNORS: Thanks for the question. Yeah, we did see good strength with our IW business and office specifically in the small and mid-market space. And very good results with license-only sales. Our enterprise sales were good and about where we thought, maybe a little better, but our license-only billings in the select L and open L license-only were strong year-over-year.

I think our SMS&P group is executing well. We'll expect good execution in Q4. We're also seeing good success with Office in terms of OEM attach, and Japan has grown nicely as the PC market and business spending recovers there. In terms of our SMS&P efforts, they are critical to the UA to SA conversion. If we do a great job we'll see those conversion rates at the higher end of what we had hoped, and we'll just have an important six-month period as those upgrade advantage contracts expire.
CURT ANDERSON: Operator we'll take just one more question now, please.
OPERATOR: Thank you. And our final question comes from Jason Maynard with Merrill Lynch.

JASON MAYNARD, MERRILL LYNCH: Hi, guys. On the server business unit, you talked about being sort of 2X ahead at this point in the product release cycle, would you characterize that gain or that ramp being attributable to the upgrade cycle of say NT being ahead of plan, or is it share gain versus UNIX? And then one quick one on the FY '05 revenue guidance. Is there any sort of implied ballpark delivery time frame on Longhorn on that number and then the conversion rate of the UA customers?

JOHN CONNORS: Thanks a lot, Jason. In terms of server 2003, I think it's a combination of things. Clearly, it is share gain and it's also a function of the economy. And spending being better than it was from the launch. And finally, upgrades from what is a large install base of NT4. So I think it's a combination of those things and we're fortunate to have a superb product. Could you repeat the last part of your question? I think I didn't get that noted.

JASON MAYNARD: Yeah. If we look at the fiscal '05 revenue growth rate and you've talked about sort of consistent, I think conversion rates for UA to SA's, I'm wondering what sort of influence you're thinking about that will have from sort of a rough ballpark delivery time frame for Longhorn.

JOHN CONNORS: The rates that we've provided for UA to SA conversion are the rates we see in light of the product schedule that we have in front of us, and we don't see the Longhorn time frame having an impact on those conversion rates.
JASON MAYNARD: Okay. Thank you.
JOHN CONNORS: Great. Thanks very much.

CURT ANDERSON: Well, thanks everybody for your participation in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me or the IR team directly.

PRESENTATION SUMMARY

S1. Overview and Highlights (S.D.) 1. 3Q04 Overview: 1. Comparisons relate to 3Q03 unless otherwise stated. 2. Strong quarter from a revenue perspective with net revenue up 17% to $9.2b. 1. Nearly all of seven businesses exceeded expectations and grew double digits. 2. Contributors included: 1. Better than expected OEM sales of Windows XP. 2. Strong sales of Office 2003. 3. Strong demand for server products.
4. Healthy Xbox console and software sales. 5. Higher MSN advertising revenues. 3. Continued to receive benefit from favorable FX rates, primarily driven by the weakened US dollar. 1. Impact was generally in line with guidance given in January. 2. Had rates been constant revenue would have been approx. $350m lower. 4. Estimate total PC unit growth was 14%, driven by strong business demand in mature and emerging markets. 5. Windows server shipments grew faster than the overall market at 25%. 6. Total operating expenses came in at $7.9b, including $748m of stock based compensation expense. 7. G&A costs were higher than expected due to $2.5b of legal charges, resulting from settlement of Sun Microsystem litigation and accrual related to the  European Commission fine. 8. Operating income decreased 53% to $1.3b, primarily due to these legal expenses. 9. Investment income totaled $1b, higher than guidance due to higher realized gains from generally improved market conditions. 10. Net income was
$1.3b with diluted EPS of $0.12, including $0.17 related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and accrual related to  European Commission fine and $0.05 in stock based compensation. 11. Recognition of revenue related to annuity licensing agreements accounted for approx. 24% of total revenue. 1. Compares to 26% in the prior year and 22% in 2Q03. 2. PC Demand: 1. Estimate total PC unit shipments worldwide grew 14% during the quarter. 1. US, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, all showed low to mid double-digit growth. 2. Japan and Latin America grew in the mid to high single-digit range. 2. Continue to see strong unit growth in emerging markets where greater percentage of PCs shipped with pirated copies of product or without MSFT operating systems. 1. Therefore growth in underlying PC unit shipments does not always correlate directly with MSFT license growth numbers.

S2. Business Segment Results (S.D.) 1. Results By Segment: 1. Client revenue grew 16% to $2.9b, driven by stronger than expected PC shipments. 1. Windows OEM license units grew 16%, driving 18% growth in OEM revenue. 2. Difference between OEM unit and revenue growth was driven by two point increase in
mix of Professional Versions of Windows up to 58%. 3. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew less than the OEM channel as customers purchased or upgraded operating systems through purchase of new PCs. 4. Client operating income declined 16% primarily as a result of the $700m charge related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystem litigation. 2. Revenue from server and tools grew 19% to $2.2b, driven by healthy demand for Windows Server, Exchange, SQL Server and Visual Studio products. 1. Rapid customer adoption of Windows server continued with new licenses growing 31% compared to the prior year. 2. Similar to previous quarters, server OEM sales grew strongly. 3. Consulting and premier product support businesses grew 11%. 1. Revenue from developer tools, training and certification and MS Press businesses decreased 38% due to the recognition of $128m of previously deferred revenue in 3Q03. 2. Server and tools had an operating loss of $940m primarily due to a charge related to settlement of Sun Microsystems litigation of approx. $1.2b. 4. Information Worker revenue was up 18% to $2.7b as Office experienced strong sales across all customer segments. 1. OEM licensing revenues grew 35% and
revenue from pre-installed versions of Office 2003 in Japan, volume licensing, and retail packaged product grew an aggregate of 15%. 2. Information Worker operating income improved 14% due to increase in revenue. 5. Revenue from MSFT Business Solutions was $153m, up 4% primarily due to continued growth in license of non-Vision product outside the US. 1. Continue to focus on delivering high value product and improving execution across the board. 2. Operating losses from MSFT Business Solutions improved 29% on lower operating expenses. 6. MSN reported another profitable quarter with improved margins and better than expected revenue growth of 16%. 1.

decreased about 6% YoverY as the business continues to see a decline in narrow band subscriber base. 3. Subscription number ended up slightly above December quarter at 8.2m as loss of narrow band
subscribers was offset by gain of Internet services and Hotmail extra storage subscriptions. 7. Revenue in mobile and embedded devices grew 33% to $61m on strong growth across all businesses. 1. Upcoming Windows mobile-based smart phones like Motorola generated tremendous enthusiasm at the February
3GSM conference. 2. Mobile and embedded devices' operating loss improved 47% due to lower operating expenses. 8. Home and entertainment revenues increased 17% to $530m. 1. Xbox console values increased 30% over the same quarter last year. 2. In the US, March NPD data showed Xbox market share increased eight points to 30% in March 2004. 3. Xbox business continues to execute with steady console growth, strong software sales, increasing number of subscribers using live gaming service, and highest US attach rate at 6.8. 4. Operating loss for 3Q04 improved 25%, driven by revenue growth and improved Xbox console and third party software margins.

S3. Financials (S.D.) 1. Income Statement: 1. Cost of revenue increased slightly to $1.4b due to higher cost of service and higher Xbox volume. 2. Balance of operating expenses increased $2.7b due to charges related to Sun settlement, accrual for European  fine, and other legal expenses. 3. Sales and marketing was as expected, and R&D a bit lower due to lower headcount. 4. Operating income was $1.3b, including legal expenses partially offset by stronger than expected revenue. 5. Investment income of $1b increased significantly from the 3Q03 due to improved market conditions resulting in higher gains on the sales of investments and significantly lower impairments. 6. Effective tax rate was 42%, reflecting the
non-deductibility of European  fine. 2. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow: 1. Cash flow from operations increased
19% to $4.9b, reflecting strong revenue and changes to working capital. 2. Spent approximately $1.4b to

to $7.5b, slightly better than forecast. 7. Annuity billing showed YoverY growth, driven primarily by new
enterprise agreements signed with large corporations. 8. License-only billings were stronger than
anticipated partially driven by continued momentum for Office 2003 and strong demand for server product.
9. Upgrade advantage contract amortization $261m. 10. The undelivered elements portion of unearned
revenue decreased by $123m due to reduction in product deferral rates for Windows and Office during
4Q03. 1. Expect this to continue to decrease. 11. Contracted but unbilled revenue increased sequentially
and remains over $6b as customers continue to buy or renew enterprise agreements consistent with the
previous few quarters. 12. Average diluted weighted shares outstanding were 10.86b.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY

Page 215 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Q1. (Drew Brosseau, SG Cowan) I'm pleased to hear you make the first ever CFO comment from
Microsoft about two years out so that's encouraging. About your '05 guidance, I'm looking back a year ago
and noticing your guidance for '04 then turned out to be about 10% low on revenue and 15% low on
earnings, so do you think you're being similarly conservative now or less so about '05?

A. (John Connors) We're just giving you the view we have today. I think the big difference from a year ago would be the big improvement in both PC hardware and server hardware relative to our expectations, and then secondly, foreign exchange. We didn't have expectations for the kind of move in the euro and yen and other non US currencies that we actually experienced. We think it's a realistic view. I hope a year from now when we're having this call you ask the same question, but I wouldn't put it in your model.

Q2. (Gibony Husk [phonetic], CSFB) Could you talk a little bit in terms of cost containment program for next year and just how that's being executed among the business groups? Presumably there's business where you think bigger opportunity and more short-term R&D requirement. How are you working that through the business units? Is there going to be some areas where you're going to have to invest and cut back in other areas?

A. (John Connors) The first thing, to frame it appropriately, we view it not as a cost cutting exercise but as an efficacy program. We are still continuing to hire; we're giving people raises. We're investing very heavily as a company generally. We have a 13-point program where we really look at how do we get more impact for dollar spent and how do we get improvements in our end-to-end business processes such that we get more output at lower cost. There's obvious things we're doing. For example, we acquired Placeware, it's now Office Live Meeting. About 20% of what would have been trips people took in the past are now Office Live Meeting sessions, saving us tens of millions of dollars. We've done great work on a global advertising program. We've done great work on a cross company direct marketing and customer relationship management strategy, terrific work on vendor negotiation, a lot of work on various R&D efficacy programs, some of which have to do with localization, some of which to have do with tools. We've done very good work in terms of our support, operations, and supply chain groups so it's really pretty broad-based. The
idea is to get more for each dollar spent and get our end-to-end business processes improved, and we've made good progress there.

Q3. (Gibony Husk, CSFB) It looks like your bookings are pretty good and annuities. How are you talking to your customers about some of the product push outs you've had. Obviously there's still some uncertainty in terms of timing of Longhorn. Depending on the timing of their contract, obviously that has an influence on their decision. How are you talking to customers who are, one, renewing, or secondly, are looking to sign
up for one of the programs as a new customer?

A. (John Connors) I think each customer has a unique circumstance depending on what products they've covered and when. Most importantly we've got a great product lineup, and an overwhelming majority of customers are not on our newest products, and we have a great product portfolio coming. If you think about the growth we've seen in Windows Server 2003, new license sales this quarter were up 31%, Small Business Server units are up dramatically over a year ago, Exchange, SQL, we've seen good results. We have factored in those customers who we would not anticipate would renew or perhaps buy new licenses based on their existing agreements or expired agreements, but we basically see the same type of EA renewal rates that we've seen in the past. Secondly, we have not changed our assumptions of those customers that signed up for upgrade advantage, how many will go to software assurance. I think the key thing is we've got to get a great value message out, and we think with the products we have and the road map we've got, we've got a pretty compelling value proposition.

Q4. (Heather Bellini, Salomon Smith Barney) I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on the OEM trends that you guys have been seeing in the server segment? Seems like the past few quarters there's been upside surprises in terms of the OEM contribution. If you could touch on if you're seeing Oracle anymore in the database market with their new SMD offering?
A. (John Connors) We really have been pleasantly surprised with server demand generally, and our OEM
results specifically. For the 3Q, going into the quarter we thought total server unit shipments would be up
12%. We think they're now up 17%. We think in the next quarter they'll be up about 13% vs. January
expectation of 9%. And we are seeing good results with a broad range of products, whether it's Windows
Server 2003, whether it's Office attached with OEM is quite strong. Another real pleasant surprise for us is
just the really superb product we have for small- and mid-size companies called Small Business Server
2003. It has won a lot of awards and deserved it, and the demand is quite good, so we've got great
products to attach to a market where units are growing. We're very mindful of Oracle's move in the OEM
space, particularly for small businesses, and we'll work hard to compete aggressively and I think customers
will benefit from what we do and what they do, and we're looking forward to doing that over the next few
quarters.

Q5. (Charles Di Bona, Sanford Bernstein & Co.) I was wondering if we could dig into the one sector that stands out for its relatively slow performance in business solutions. What are you seeing in particular around Great Plains in the US that is making it lag the rest of your business? Is it product related? Is it some of the sales force reorganization? Or is it just a weak application spending environment?

A. (John Connors) MBS probably had on a relative basis the weakest results of any of the seven businesses. It did come in where we expected, which I think is important, so the group has a very good handle on where things are. Our non-US results are terrific. We're outgrowing the  competition significantly, and our US results are really in line with what software sales are in the US for business apps. We aren't having very good US execution, and I think the majority of it is a function of us having a lot of new people in district positions over the course of the year and we're being less effective with the traditional MBS partners than the MBS group was a year ago. The group has a very clear mission in terms of getting that US execution improved. I don't think we'll see that in 4Q, but we'll hopefully see it in FY05. It isn't really a
product issue. I think it's more of our execution issue, and we're just not doing a lot better than  competition
the way we expected. We're kind of doing what the  competition is doing.

Q6. (Rick Sherlund, Goldman Sachs & Co.) You said on cash, you'd say more by the July analyst meeting. I just wasn't clear if that means you're going to tell us what you're going to do with the cash, or if that was we're going to tell you something more about that? On the 4% revenue growth guidance for '05, if it turns out that EMEA and Japan are getting better next year as the US has this year, would we expect that to translate into additional margin expansion? Or would we see you spending more money?

A. (John Connors) On the cash, it was a roundabout way of saying I'm not going to say anything today. We do feel good about the legal issues we've cleared, which were significant, and we do feel like we have a clearer view of what our business model impacts could have been or could be. We've got a hearing from
the Court of Appeals related to Massachusetts coming up any time. And we're anxious for that. We've got a court of first instance. We're really hearing folks in terms of wanting more direction with respect to our cash strategy. We will have a lot more to say no later than the analyst meeting. In terms of the P&L earnout, if
you will, if businesses do better on the revenue front than we have guided or we expect, we would expect to see some of that drop to the bottom line, but we would also expect to see people in businesses have ideas for opportunities to drive more revenue or to drive customer sat. So basically in the earnout process, folks will drop that to the bottom line, or they'll have specific programs, but you shouldn't expect all revenue increases to go to expense increase.

Q7. (Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley) You talked earlier several times on the call about the cost efficacy efforts. If you look at the guidance for FY05 it looks like the, as you pointed out, operating margin expansion should play out. Could you talk about the buy in process within the organization at different levels regarding the focus on the cost control and the operating margin expansion? Where are we, if you know off the top of your head, in the Windows upgrade cycle, i.e. how many of the PCs in the installed base have the newest version of Windows?
A. (John Connors) In terms of the endorsement or the agreement or buy in on cost efficacy, I think
generally people, they're shareholders and/or they're option holders and they're interested in value creation
just like the people on the phone, and so they understand that. There's, I think, good strong leadership in
our business groups and our management team. I think people, as they see the efforts on cost translate
into value creation, the picture becomes clearer. I think in any organization, including this one, it's like a
budget anyplace. I'm all for overall lower spending as long as it isn't my group. And so we clearly have that.
But I think in general the company has a good ability to get people rallied behind the things it needs to do,
and I don't think we'll have any exception here. We do think, too, there's good opportunity long-term to
improve our business processes, improve our efficacy, and as part of growing value for shareholders, it's
something we'll have to do. In terms of where we are in the Windows upgrade, we still have enormous
opportunity both on the server side of getting NT4 and even predecessor versions of servers and Windows
2000 moved to 2003, and really the most meaningful units that have Windows XP in the PC environment
are those units that started shipping when we released the product. We did a terrific job of getting aligned
with our OEM partners to get Windows XP on machines at launch. We probably did the best job in the
history of the company with a release of an OS, but if you look at the installed base of PCs, there's a
significant number that aren't running Windows XP, so the opportunity is still good and exists, but our
absolute number that we have to grow is also a big number.

Q8. (Keith Gay [phonetic], Thomas Weisel Partners) Couple of home entertainment questions. How does the Xbox price cut impact gross margins in the June time frame, particularly if it is more successful than perhaps you planned? Does this indicate a shift in your strategy to be out in front of Sony? This time you're first with price cut and perhaps with Xbox 2? Is there a shift in strategy to be out front perhaps to take additional share?

A. (John Connors) On the first front, in terms of where we are in the product life cycle, our cost of goods is better than it was early in the life cycle, so the P&L can absorb price cuts more easily than it could
Page 217 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
previously. The June forecast for revenue and for operating income includes the expectation for what will happen, and we'll just see how the unit volumes play out. In terms of a price cut, the most important thing
we want to do is be very competitive, gain share, and build a large installed base of customers, and we saw that opportunity to do that. The group has both the share objectives in mind as well as P&L objectives, and that's a balance they have to reach, and in this quarter they decided that it was a good time to gain some share.

Q9. (Tom Berquist, Smith Barney) You mentioned something on Windows on Intel gaining share versus Intel shipments. My question is that because you're planning on gaining share vs. Linux over the next year, or is that more related to the Yukon [phonetic] shipment? Secondly, does your forecast for '05 include any revenue for this speculated XP reloaded product that we've heard about in the press?

A. (John Connors) In terms of our growth on the Windows front vs. Linux, only Linux and Windows are gaining share, and both of us are growing faster than the market, obviously. We had faster growth in Windows Server shipments in the third quarter than hardware units, due in large part to software-only sales. We also, obviously, sell more absolute units in the quarter in terms of growth than Linux, so we're the two guys that are growing. In terms of the XP, SP2, or what you might have heard of reload, we've got an incredible opportunity to really get consumers to understand the value behind Windows XP, both from an improved security perspective as well as a digital media and entertainment perspective. Both that, tablet, media center, we've got a lot of value to sell. And you'll see us be very aggressive on the XP front in FY05, and what we plan to do is reflected in these numbers.

Q10. (Tom Berquist, Smith Barney) The Yukon, is that factored into your growth expectation on the server business next year as well, the Yukon shipment?

A. (John Connors) Obviously we take our product road map and then we look at what impact will that have on revenue for the fiscal year, and given where we think SQL 2005 is going to come out in 1H of calendar year '05, you can do the math and it will probably be late in that time period. We won't get the benefit from it that we will in FY06, but it looks like it's going to be a great product. We're fortunate to have a great product in the market now between that and its release.

Q11. (Briar Dudley, The Seattle Times) You said that you were going to continue hiring, but you are also going to hold operating expenses flat. Does that mean headcount will also remain flat? Could you also shed light on construction spending plans in the Seattle area?

A. (John Connors) We don't have anything to announce on headcount plans for FY05. We'll talk about that more in the analyst time frame. We have a lot of open positions. We're still hiring. What we've tried to do is give business groups targets for their P&Ls and for their expenses, and they make the trade-offs in terms of headcount and other types of costs. We are on track, though, to continue to grow consistent with the goals we set for heads in the prior year. Secondly, we still have a number of Peugot Sound area projects underway with respect to construction. This is our home, and we'll continue to grow here.
Q12. (Briar Dudley, The Seattle Times) Are you going to defer Issaquah?

A. (John Connors) I don't have any comment. We'll start building out Issaquah when and if we need the space.

Q13. (Adam Holt, JP Morgan) Sounds like some of the strength in IW was driven by better performance in the mid-market. Is that driven by the trend you spoke about last quarter of the small and mid-size businesses opting more toward up-front licenses than subscription? What can we extrapolate from some of the current S&P initiatives about your ability to convert that base within the UA renewals going forward?

A. (John Connors) We did see good strength with our IW business and Office specifically in the small and mid-market space and very good results with license-only sales. Our enterprise sales were good and about where we thought, maybe a little better, but our license-only billings in the select-L and open-L license-only were strong YoverY. You know, I think our SMS&P [phonetic] group is executing well. We'll expect good execution in 4Q. We're also seeing good success with Office in terms of OEM attach, and Japan has grown nicely as the PC market and business spending recovers there. In terms of our SMS&P efforts, they are critical to the UA to SA conversion. If we do a great job, we'll see those conversion rates at the higher end
of what we had hoped, and we'll just have an important six-month period as those upgrade advantage contracts expire.

Q14. (Jason Maynard, Merrill Lynch) On the server business unit, you talked about being 2X ahead in the product release cycle. Would you characterize that gain or that ramp being attributable to the upgrade cycle, say NT being ahead of plan? Or is it share gain versus UNIX? On the FY05 revenue guidance, is there any sort of implied ballpark delivery time frame on Longhorn and the conversion rate of the UA customers?

A. (John Connors) In terms of Server 2003, I think it's combination of things. Clearly it is share gain and it's also a function of the economy and spending being better than it was from the launch. And finally upgrades from what is a large install base of NT4. So I think it's a combination of those things, and we're fortunate to have a superb product.

Q15. (Jason Maynard, Merrill Lynch) If we look at the FY05 revenue growth rate, and you've talked about consistent conversion rates for UA to SA, I'm wondering what sort of influence you're thinking about that will have from sort of a rough ballpark delivery time frame for Longhorn?

A. (John Connors) The rates that we've provided for UA to SA conversion are the rates we see in light of the product schedule that we have in front of us, and we don't see the Longhorn time frame having an impact on those conversion rates.

LP
BRUSSELS, April 22 -- The  European Commission released the full text of its  antitrust ruling against Microsoft on Thursday, prompting a strong rebuttal from the company in a widely disseminated internal memorandum.

Arguments made behind closed doors before the ruling was made last month are now being vented publicly as both sides seek support before  Microsoft appeals to the European Court of Justice, probably in late May or June.

TD
Microsoft is fine-tuning its arguments asking the court to suspend the corrective actions ordered by the commission until the appeal is resolved, which could take as long as five years.

The commission's ruling lacks any convincing evidence and will have an ''adverse effect on consumers, the computer industry and many other sectors by stifling  competition,'' Horacio Guttierez,  Microsoft's chief legal counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a telephone interview.

In the memorandum,  Microsoft said, ''Novel legal standards announced in the decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth.''

The 302-page ruling will make it difficult for the court to grant  Microsoft's request,  antitrust lawyers in Brussels said. ''The wording of the decision has been formulated specifically to avoid a suspension of the remedies,'' said Thomas Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Clifford Chance, who has been representing  Microsoft rivals during the commission's investigation.

Mario Monti, the European Union's  competition commissioner, has said he thinks the ruling will withstand an appeal.

The ruling requires  Microsoft to sell within 90 days a version of its Windows operating system in Europe without the audio and video Media Player, which comes as part of Windows. It also  fined       Microsoft $603 million.

The commission ruled that by including Media Player in Windows,  Microsoft was abusing its dominant position by putting rival players at a competitive disadvantage.

The ruling permits  Microsoft to continue selling Windows with Media Player, as long as the company does not give it an unfair advantage over the unbundled one.

Within 120 days of the ruling, which was made on March 24,  Microsoft must disclose enough Windows code to rivals to allow them to build server software that works as well with Windows as Microsoft's own software does.


Page 220 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Withholding details about the Windows code has prevented rivals from competing on an even basis with Microsoft in server software, the commission ruled.

If the corrective actions are suspended pending the appeal, ''the harm will be irreparable,'' said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a critic of  Microsoft in antitrust actions on both sides of the Atlantic. ''The longer it takes to impose these remedies, the less likely they will work.''

The actions intended to restore  competition among media players are particularly urgent because Microsoft is gaining market share each year, the commission said, citing a market analysis conducted by independent researchers, including IDC of Boston.

In five years, makers of rival media players like RealNetworks may have disappeared, just as Netscape, the Web browser, has been almost totally eclipsed by  Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Mr. Black said.

The ruling details  Microsoft's arguments and rebuts each one. For example,  Microsoft asserted that removing all media code from Windows would disrupt the operating system's narrator function, an aid to the visually impaired.
The commission said it was not ordering all media code removed from Windows, only the Media
Player code, which does not include the narrator function.

Similarly, when detailing the remedies for the server software market, the commission repeated Microsoft's argument that requiring it to reveal the source code for Windows would result in the cloning of Microsoft products and hurt  Microsoft's incentive to innovate.

The commission said that it had not ordered  Microsoft to disclose, or license to rivals, Windows source code, only the code necessary to comply with the requirement on the server market. ''The commission does not envisage ordering compulsory licensing of  Microsoft's source code,'' the ruling said.

In the interview, Mr. Guttierez said: ''The commission is belittling our argument. Our case was not limited to source code. We said that compulsory licensing of our intellectual property would result in the cloning or replication of our products.''

Last month, when the ruling was announced, some industry experts said they were concerned that the measures to restore  competition to the media player market would not work. Some of those concerns were lifted Thursday after they saw the full text of the ruling.

There is a clause saying that if the remedies fail, the commission ''retains the possibility to review the present decision and impose an alternative remedy that will put an end to the  abuse.''

Mr. Vinje said: ''The way the commission has termed the remedies is solid. If I had to bet on it, I'd say it is more likely than not that the court will refuse to suspend them. If this ruling doesn't withstand a suspension order by the court, then I can't see what ruling could.''

HD     Microsoft expected to post solid Q3. WC    572 words

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -  Microsoft is expected to report strong fiscal third-quarter earnings Thursday, aided by better-than-expected personal-computer sales and a recent focus on quashing costs. Yet that might not be enough to excite Wall Street analysts, who have patiently been waiting for  Microsoft's stock
to take off. Many have been expecting the stock to break out of its trading range on hopes of reduced legal woes and an expected dividend increase. So far this year, that hasn't happened, as the stock continues to lag the Nasdaq's performance. "People are in a wait-and-see mode with  Microsoft," said Alan Davis, an analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. "I think it all depends on how management characterizes fiscal 2005 on the earnings call.

TD
So far, they've said it's going to be tough to manage revenue, and they're going to focus on controlling costs."  Microsoft shares recently changed hands at $25.79, up about 1 percent on the session but down from the $27.37 at which it opened the year and down from $30 last September What  Microsoft has detailed about its costs strategy so far has not been met with investor applause, analysts say, with the exception of some value-oriented investors who usually take little interest in growth-geared technology stocks. Microsoft's stock continues to trade at about 20 times fiscal 2005 earnings - a discount when compared with the multiples of some other large names in its sector. Some analysts say the stock could catch up to other software companies' valuations in coming months based on two factors: a possible dividend boost and an announcement concerning cost cuts. It's not clear to what extent  Microsoft is ready to talk about either of those issues in its post-earnings-report conference call, after the close of market. Most analysts have been expecting Microsoft to boost its dividend this summer, as the company
continues to clear up its legal picture. The European Commission fined Microsoft about $613 million earlier in the quarter for antitrust violations - a figure that was lower than the maximum allowable, which was about $3.5 billion. Also, Microsoft settled a private  antitrust suit brought by rival Sun Microsystems, and the two companies signed a software licensing agreement. So, for now, the focus is on quarterly operating performance. Analysts at Friedman Billings Ramsey told clients they expect  Microsoft to earn
29 cents a share, meeting expectations of analysts polled by Thomson First Call. They expect revenue of about $8.6 billion, up 11 percent from last year, also in line with most analysts' expectations, but the FBR analysts said Microsoft could show some sales upside. Davis said he expects quarterly sales of $8.8 billion, up about 12 percent from a year earlier, due to improving PC sales in Europe and in other parts of the world. He noted that  Microsoft had raised its PC unit-growth forecast to the "low double digits" last quarter. One possible setback in the quarter could be an expected decrease in  Microsoft's
unearned-revenue balance - contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The company's unearned-revenue balance dropped $400 million in the previous period and could drop another $200 million this quarter, Davis said, to $7.6 billion.

HD     Microsoft hit by cost of court cases. BY     JIM STANTON Deputy Business Editor.

MICROSOFT, the global software market leader, saw profits tumble by 38 per cent after the company was hit by the cost of fighting legal cases. However, the Washington-based giant still managed to sell more products, with revenues for its third quarter rising by a better-than-expected 17 per cent. Sales of its Xbox games console hit "record-setting" levels during March, it added. Over the quarter to March 31, the company announced a profit of GBP 743 million. That compared with a profit of GBP 1.2 billion in the
same period the year before. The sales figures topped Wall Street expectations, at the same time underscoring the sustained recovery in technology spending. Expenses over the reporting period included GBP 1.06bn in costs to settle a dispute with server maker Sun Microsystems and payment of a GBP 331m fine recently imposed by the  European Commission for breaching anti-competition rules.

TD
Microsoft also revealed that it had a cash pile of GBP 31.5bn, which it has said will remain largely intact
as it still faces a number of legal disputes over its market-dominant Windows operating system. Charles Di
Bona, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co, said: "The next big catalyst is for them to do something
with that cash that's constructive."  Microsoft chief financial officer John Connors said the company would
provide clearer direction for the cash pile later this year. "I think we've made a good progress on a number
of legal fronts," Mr Connors said. He said all of  Microsoft's business units met company expectations
during the quarter, boosted by increases in technology spending. Looking ahead, he added: "I think we are
seeing a pretty solid level of demand."  Microsoft said shipments of personal computers, a key driver of
the company's sales, were up 14 per cent, helping underpin the 17 per cent lift in group revenues to GBP
5.17bn, from GBP 4.41bn a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for about GBP 4.98bn.  Microsoft said
it expected sales of about the same level in the final quarter. The software maker said sales of its
Windows-focused Client division grew 16 per cent, while its Server and Tools division grew 19 per cent
and its Information Worker division, responsible for Office, grew 18 per cent. Clark Chang, an analyst at
Fulcrum Global Partners, said: "PC and server growth has been phenomenal. That's the big driver." Mr
Connors said the MSN internet division showed "robust advertising growth" that offset declining revenue
from dial-up internet access subscribers. And its Xbox video game console remained on track for
shipments of between 14.5 million and 16 million globally by the end of June, with one million subscribers
to its Xbox Live online gaming service, Mr Connors said. He added that March had seen "record-setting"
sales of Xbox, fuelled in part by a price cut. Mr Connors said it would be difficult to replicate the robust
growth seen so far this year in 2005, partly because of the one-off nature of gains from the weaker dollar,
investments and revenue recognition from long-term software contracts. Analysts warned that a potential
drop-off in long-term contracts, which surged two years ago as  Microsoft transitioned to a new licensing
plan that encouraged customers to pay for software over time, could hurt future revenue since income
from such contracts is recognised over time.

THREE CEOS TELL COKE NO, THANKS: Gillette chairman and CEO James Kilts has taken himself out of consideration to be Coca-Cola Co.'s new CEO, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. The Journal also said Carlos Gutierrez, chairman and CEO of Kellogg, and Robert Eckert, chairman and CEO of Mattel Inc., have also told Coke directors they weren't interested. Coke officials have said little about their search beyond that Steve Heyer, the No. 2 executive at the Atlanta company, is the top internal candidate and that others will be considered.

COKE EX-EXEC CLAIMS COVERUP: Former Coca-Cola Co. vice president Robert Lowe says in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta that he was fired because he complained about a coverup of the company's use of defective, moldy beverage dispensers and improper accounting for missing equipment. He accused the soft drink maker of fraud and age discrimination, and added that the company has known for years that the dispensers leave metal deposits in Coca-Cola beverages.
Coca-Cola spokesman Ray Crockett said Lowe's claims are false and already have been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor.

INTERNET PIRACY RAID NETS 100: An international effort to dismantle major Internet piracy groups has identified more than 100 people in the United States and abroad involved in the theft of more than
$50-million in music, movies, games and computer software, U.S. authorities said Thursday. Synchronized searches by the FBI in 27 states and by other authorities in 10 countries beginning Wednesday resulted in the seizure of more than 200 computers, including 30 servers, Attorney General John Ashcroft said. One server contained over 65,000 titles. "This is thievery,'' Ashcroft told reporters. "This is criminal.''

HOMEOWNERSHIP HITS RECORD: U.S. homeownership set a record for the third quarter in a row through March as falling mortgage rates made houses more affordable, according to a Census Bureau report. The share of households that own their home increased to 68.6 percent from 68.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 68.3 percent in the third, a report from the Census Bureau showed. Borrowing costs dipped to a nine-month low in March, but rates on benchmark 30-year mortgages rose this week for the fifth week in a row. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage increased to 5.94 percent this week, Freddie Mac reported Thursday in its weekly nationwide survey of rates.
EARNINGS
Baxter International Inc.

The medical products maker unveiled its second big round of layoffs in less than a year, announcing Thursday it will cut 3,500 to 4,000 more jobs amid a slump in its plasma business that has eroded profits and prompted a management shakeup. The reductions will trim 7 percent to 8 percent more off Baxter's work force of 51,000 and will be accompanied by the closure of plasma collection centers.

The company intends to take a second-quarter charge of up to $400-million for costs associated with the latest layoffs and cutbacks. Baxter's first-quarter net earnings dropped, matching the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.

Microsoft Corp.'s revenue grew by 17 percent last quarter, but legal costs related to its  antitrust
problems dragged down profits, the company reported yesterday.

The company was fined roughly $600 million last month by European regulators, and early this month it agreed to pay Sun Microsystems Inc. $1.6 billion to settle  antitrust and patent claims. As a result,
the company's profits of $1.32 billion for the quarter that ended March 31 were down from $2.14 billion during the same period a year ago.

TD
Increased demand for personal computers helped push revenue to $9.18 billion for the most recent quarter, up sharply from $7.84 billion for the period a year ago, a performance that exceeded analysts' predictions.

Overall, the company earned 12 cents per share, down from 20 cents per share during the same period last year.

"We are in the midst of a corporate recovery," said Chief Financial Officer John G. Connors, adding that all of the company's businesses showed double-digit revenue growth. "We expect the improvement to continue for the rest of the fiscal year," which ends in June.

But the company is predicting flat revenue growth next fiscal year for a variety of reasons, Connors said. Microsoft exceeded expectations this fiscal year in part because of favorable foreign exchange rates, which might not continue. In addition, this year's strong growth in personal and server computer shipments might slow. Server computers power networks of other computers.

Finally, most businesses will have completed software upgrade programs. Connors said that the company will look to controlling costs as a way to improve profits even with little uptick in revenue.

Despite the strong quarter and what will likely be an impressive fiscal year,  Microsoft's stock has been mired in the doldrums even as the technology sector has soared over the past 15 months.

On April 22 last year, the stock closed at $25.74 per share. Yesterday, it closed at $25.95, though it was up by more than $1 in after-hours trading.

"Microsoft performed relatively well in the downturn" from mid-2000 through 2002, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Investors see  Microsoft as a conservative play, he said, unlike many of the more speculative issues that scored large gains in 2003.
With the technology run cooling off this year,  Microsoft could return to favor, he said.

Analysts on  Microsoft's conference call pressed Connors on the company's plans for its cash holdings, which exceed $55 billion.

Page 230 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Many investor groups have been calling on the company to use the money to sharply increase its dividend.

Connors deferred comment until the firm's scheduled July meeting with analysts, when there will be more information, he said. The company has wanted to resolve its myriad  antitrust lawsuits before committing to return more cash to investors.

Although the company has settled numerous  antitrust and patent infringement suits against it by private companies and consumers in several states, several are pending.
Moreover, a decision is pending on an appeal of its 2001  antitrust settlement with the Department of
Justice.

Connors did not discuss how the company's fortunes might change if it is forced to "unbundle" certain features from its Windows operating system, as has been ordered by the  European Commission.

Barnicle said that Wall Street is not focused on that issue because it knows  Microsoft will "fight to the end" to avoid that outcome, including filing appeals that could take years to resolve.

Microsoft turned in a surprisingly robust performance for the first three months of this year, propelled by rising sales of personal computers to businesses, a strong advance in its server software division and a bounce in advertising on the MSN internet service.

However, the software giant's earnings fell by 39 per cent as it took a Dollars 2.53bn charge to cover this month's big legal settlement with Sun Microsystems and a  fine levied by the European Commission.

TD
Microsoft also offered a subdued outlook for its next fiscal year, which begins in July. While it expects revenues in the current financial year to rise by 14 per cent, it predicted growth of just 4 per cent for next year.

The forecast reflects an expected slowdown in PC and server sales next year, said John Connors, chief financial officer. It is also partly the result of the end of a  Microsoft licensing programme known as "upgrade advantage", and the absence of further projected foreign currency gains, he added.

For the first three months of 2004, the third quarter in  Microsoft's fiscal year, the company reported revenues of Dollars 9.18bn, up 17 per cent from a year before and well ahead of Wall Street expectations of Dollars 8.67bn. Although 4.5 percentage points of the growth was due to foreign currency movements, the underlying growth rate was stronger than other big technology companies during the quarter, reflecting the general immunity from price  competition of its core products as PC sales volumes climbed.

Revenues at the company's client division, which includes the Windows PC business, rose 16 per cent, while the information worker division advanced 18 per cent, helped by the launch late last year of a new version of Office.

The company's server business, meanwhile, climbed 19 per cent, and the MSN business extended its recent rebound with 16 per cent growth.

Had it not been for the big legal costs,  Microsoft would also have beaten earnings comfortably. Leaving these aside, as well as the equity compensation costs that  Microsoft now deducts from profits but which Wall Street still ignores, earnings came in at 34 cents a share, 5 cents above estimates.  Microsoft reported that cash and short-term investments totaled Dollars 56.4bn, up from Dollars 53bn at the end of
2003.

Investors have been focusing on the company's growing cash position and whether recent legal settlements give the company more breathing room to start paying out higher dividends.

Microsoft Corp. said costs from its legal woes and stock-based compensation dragged down
third-quarter profit, but strong sales of personal computers caused a 17-per-cent jump in revenue.
The software titan raised its earnings forecast for the current quarter and full fiscal year, ending June
30, and the company's shares jumped in after-hours trading following the announcement.

TD
In its first comments about the fiscal year ending in June, 2005, however,  Microsoft forecast sales and profits below analysts' expectations.

For the fiscal period ended March 30, the Redmond, Wash., company reported profit of $1.32-billion (U.S.), or 12 cents a share, off 39 per cent from the $2.14-billion, or 20 cents, recorded in the previous year.

The latest period's figures included charges of $1.89-billion, after taxes, related to the company's legal settlement with Sun Microsystems Inc. and a  fine imposed by the European Commission, which last month ruled that  Microsoft had violated European  antitrust laws. The latest quarter also included
$501-million in expenses related to stock-based compensation.

Excluding those one-time costs, the company's income per share was 34 cents, topping analysts' average estimate on that basis of 29 cents, according to Thomson First Call.

Microsoft's sales in the quarter grew to $9.18-billion from $7.84-billion, also exceeding analysts' average estimate of $8.66-billion, as tallied by Thomson First Call.

In an interview,  Microsoft chief financial officer John Connors credited better-than-expected sales of personal computers, server computers and its software tools as the driver of the strong results from operations and the company's decision to raise its forecasts. The positive environment helped sales of Microsoft's core Windows operating system and Office 2003 suite of productivity software.
âNearly every one of our businesses were above our expectations,â Mr. Connors said.

Mr. Connors noted the company's gross profit was up strongly, its cash flow rose 19 per cent and the company settled a number of significant legal issues. âSo all in, we're very pleased,â he said.

Microsoft's shares rose 50 cents to $25.95 in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In
after-hours trading following the announcement, the stock rose to $27.24, according to INET ATS Inc.

The company said its MSN on-line service continued to gain from an industry-wide increase in on-line advertising and expects to post its first full-year profit in the year ending June 30, Mr. Connors said. For the quarter, it posted operating income of $107-million on sales of $591-million, compared to a loss of $139-million on sales of $508-million in the previous year.

Page 234 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
âIt's not an emerging business,â Mr. Connor said of the MSN group, âIt has emerged.â
For the year ending June 30,  Microsoft forecast sales would be in the range of $36.4-billion to
$36.5-billion, or an increase of between 13 and 14 per cent over 2003. By comparison Thomson First
Call had expected sales to reach $35.88-billion for the year.

Even as Microsoft's revenue grows the company is increasingly trying to boost profit margins with a new focus on containing costs.

Analysts praised the cost-cutting, which they regard as a sign of  Microsoft's maturation and possibly slower growth. âThese aren't things that you've typically seen from a company like  Microsoft,â said Michael Sansoterra, an analyst at Principal Global Investors, the asset management unit of Principal Financial Group in Des Moines.

Microsoft didn't announce plans to disperse any of its cash as a dividend. As the company's cash horde continues to grow â cash and short-term investments hit $56-billion at the end of the quarter â Microsoft has come under pressure from shareholders to offer a one-time dividend or raise its annual dividend further.  Microsoft last year was able to deflect those calls, pointing to the need to have cash on hand as long as several large lawsuits against it remained.

Mr. Connors said that the company is pleased its progress in resolving most of the largest of those suits and will âhave a lot more to sayâ about the possibility of distributing cash no later than July, when it holds its annual analysts' meeting.

HD            Microsoft says EC is inventing law

Microsoft has hit back hard in its attempt to overturn the record euros 500m (pounds 335m)  fine from the European Commission for abuse of its near-monopoly position.

It accuses the EC of making new law and warns that the decision could harm the European and world economies.

TD
"The novel legal standards announced in the decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential for global economic growth," the company said.

Last month the EC's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, ordered  Microsoft to offer its Windows operating system to PC makers without its digital Media Player.

The decision, reached after a five-year investigation, also ordered  Microsoft to give rival companies information on the code which underpins the Windows system.
When the decision was announced, Mr Monti insisted that the ruling restored "conditions for fair
competition". Microsoft immediately announced its intention to appeal. The court battle could take
up to five more years and prove a running sore in trade relations between the European Union and the
United States.

In its rebuttal of the arguments  Microsoft rejected the EC's claim that its decision upheld a "rule of reason test".

Instead, according to  Microsoft, the decision "opens the door for even a single complaining component supplier to argue that innovation should be thwarted if its market position may be harmed".

In its detailed 300-plus page judgment, the commission rejects  Microsoft's argument that it has made new law.

"In the absence of the application of any novel concept of competition law - and in view of the fact that the software industry is not exempt from the application of competition law - Microsoft should have been aware of the fact that it was infringing the competition rules of both the treaty [of Rome] and and the EEA [European economic area] agreement."
The commission said Microsoft had not submitted "adequate evidence" that tying the Media Player to
Windows could be justified by pro-competition benefits.
Those benefits could be achieved without any such tying, according to the commission's judgment. "As regards 'other benefits' identified by  Microsoft, they primarily relate to  Microsoft's own
profitability."

"The novel legal standards announced in the decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential for global economic growth," the company said.
The dispute has weighed heavily on the software company's third-quarter net income, which fell to

HD         Microsoft attacks EU ruling  as appeal is readied

BRUSSELS:

The European Commission made public its cautiously worded, 302- page  antitrust ruling against Microsoft on Thursday, prompting a strenuous rebuttal in a widely leaked internal memo by the company.

TD
Arguments made behind closed doors prior to the ruling last month are now being vented publicly, as both sides seek support ahead of an appeal of the ruling, to be submitted probably in late May or June, at the European Court of Justice.

At the same time,  Microsoft is fine-tuning arguments it hopes will convince the court to suspend the remedies demanded by the commission pending an outcome of the appeal, which could be as much as five years away.

Horacio Guttierez,  Microsoft's chief legal counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the ruling lacks any convincing evidence, and will have an adverse effect on consumers, the computer industry
and many other sectors by stifling  competition.

The ruling, however, is designed to make it as hard as possible for the court to suspend the remedies, Brussels-based antitrust lawyers said. The wording of the decision has been formulated specifically to avoid a suspension of the remedies, said Thomas Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of law firm Clifford Chance who has been representing  Microsoft rivals during the commission's investigation.

The ruling demands that within 90 days of its issuance last month,  Microsoft must sell a version of its dominant Windows operating system in Europe that has the Media Player software stripped out. Media Player is Microsoft's audio and video playing software, which it currently sells as part of the Windows operating system.

The commission concluded that by bundling Media Player into Windows,  Microsoft was abusing its dominant position by putting rival players at a competitive disadvantage.

The ruling allows  Microsoft to continue selling a version of Windows with Media Player, alongside the unbundled version, as long as  Microsoft does not give it an unfair commercial advantage over the unbundled one.

Within 120 days  Microsoft must reveal enough of the Windows code to allow rivals to build server software that works as well with Windows as  Microsoft's own server software does. Servers connect personal computers into networks.

Withholding details about Windows from rivals has prevented them from competing on a level playing field with  Microsoft in the server software market, the commission ruled.



Page 240 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Microsoft, in its memo, argued that novel legal standards announced in the decision will affect all industries, altering market dynamics and reducing incentives for research and development that are essential to global economic growth.

Critics of Microsoft worry that if the remedies are suspended pending the appeal, the harm will be irreparable, said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a vocal critic of Microsoft on both sides of the Atlantic.
The longer it takes to impose these remedies, the less likely they will work, he said.

The remedy designed to restore  competition in the market for media players is particularly urgent, because Microsoft is gaining market share in this sector each year, according to a detailed market analysis conducted by independent researchers and cited by the commission.

In five years, makers of rival media players such as Real Networks may have disappeared, just as Netscape, the Internet browser, has been almost totally eclipsed by  Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Black said.
The commission's ruling details all  Microsoft's arguments, then seeks to shoot each down.

For example,  Microsoft argued that to remove all media code from Windows would prevent the operating system's narrator function for the visually impaired from working. In response, the commission pointed out that it is not ordering the stripping out of all media code from Windows only the Media Player code, which does not include the narrator function.

Similarly, when detailing the remedies for the server software market, the commission reproduced Microsoft's argument that to insist that all Windows source code be revealed to rivals would result in the cloning of Microsoft products, and this would harm  Microsoft's incentive to innovate.

The commission then points out that it has not ordered  Microsoft to license Windows source code at all. It bears repetition that the commission does not envisage ordering compulsory licensing of  Microsoft's source code, it said.

The commission is belittling our argument, said Guttierez of  Microsoft, adding, Our case was not limited to source code. We said that compulsory licensing of our intellectual property would result in the cloning or replication of our products.

The commission included a clause in its ruling saying that if the remedies fail, it retains the possibility to review the present decision and impose an alternative remedy that will put an end to the  abuse.

The way the commission has termed the remedies is solid, Vinje said. If I had to bet on it I'd say it is more likely than not that the court will refuse to suspend them. If this ruling doesn't withstand a suspension order by the court, then I can't see what ruling could.

There is surprise that such polarised positions allowed such a far-reaching declaration of peace, writes Jim Colgan, as  Microsoft agrees to pay $1.6bn to its underdog rival and both pledge to make their software work better together.

At the press conference announcing a surprise alliance of long-time tech rivals Sun Microsystems and Microsoft, Sun's chief executive Scott McNealy made a minor gaffe.

TD
Attempting a reference to both companies, he uttered the words: "I believe Sun and Microsystems..." Quickly correcting himself, Mr McNealy said: "I can't tell you how many times I've been called Sun Microsoft," to the laughter of listening reporters.

Though it was a simple mistake, and probably a mere consequence of all-night negotiations, it captured the moment for some Sun followers: The end of a decade-long vitriolic battle between an industry underdog and the world's largest software maker.

Sun, Microsoft's most vocal critic up to now, signed on to an unprecedented 10-year collaboration with its rival. Under the deal,  Microsoft agreed to pay $1.6 billion (â¬1.5 billion) to settle long-standing legal action and both companies pledged to make their software work better together.
The announcement, made on April 2nd, ends  Microsoft's longest-running individual suit and injects
Sun with much-needed cash.

The benefits swing both ways, but analysts were surprised that such polarised positions could allow for such a far-reaching declaration of peace.

And following the corporate kiss, experts are questioning the fate of pending litigation since Sun has led the charge on most of the anti-Microsoft legal action to date.
Mr McNealy initiated the meeting with  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, with a golf invitation. The deal was the former's effort to move away from the sort of rhetoric that saw him dub  Microsoft
the "dark empire". Both companies claimed server software clients, reported frustration over lack of
compatibility and this agreement is an attempt to alleviate that.
But the newfound affection doesn't hide a history of bitter litigation.

Microsoft climbed to the top of the software market on the back of the 1990s tech boom, but along with its billions in revenue, it drew a flood of anti-competitive lawsuits.

For an entire decade, the company was the target of the high-profile US government suit, which was eventually settled in 2001. Since then,  Microsoft has been dogged by litigation - this is part of a determined bid to shed these suits once and for all, analysts say. "It's a hindrance for them," David Smith, an analyst for Gartner research says about  Microsoft's legal wrangling.

"It shows the company wanting to move on. They have ambitions to grow in areas where they have regulators on their back," he adds.

Microsoft is vehemently proving this point. In the space of three weeks, the company settled three outstanding cases: $400 million to InterTrust Technologies, the $1.6 billion to Sun, and just this week it announced a settlement with the state of Minnesota for an undisclosed sum.

By removing Sun's legal threat,  Microsoft has avoided what could have amounted to much bigger damages.

But analysts say having Sun out of its legal picture is also a milestone in the company's history. Sun formed a prominent part of the US  antitrust suit and was one of the main complainants in the European Commission's case.

The Commission has indicated it is too late for this alliance to have an impact on its ruling, but Microsoft executives say the ruling and its â¬497 million  fine now have a better chance of getting overturned on appeal.
In fact, in a statement, Sun said the recent agreement "satisfies the objectives it was pursuing in the
EU actions".

Regardless of Microsoft's rationale, analysts note Sun has its own reasons for rescinding its role as vocal agitator. "Sun no longer wants to be seen just as the company that stands out against Microsoft," says Gartner's Mr Smith.
In some ways, he says, this was distracting the company, and it had become a concern for clients. Indeed, Mr McNealy showed his attitude to this at the press conference.
"Maybe we've grown up. Maybe they've grown up. Who knows? Maybe the customers are getting more in charge these days," he said.
One issue Sun did not mention at the conference, though, was its dismal earnings results.

In the midst of the news with  Microsoft, Sun said it would cut 3,300 jobs and bring in much lower revenues. Last week the company posted its fourth straight quarterly loss of $760 million.

Mr McNealy also made management changes, promoting software executive Mr Jonathan Schwarz up to president and chief operating officer.

Analysts describe the  Microsoft cash injection as a means for Sun to bide time while it makes a transition.

To counter concerns the once bitter rivals are getting too close, both companies have pledged to remain fiercely competitive.  Microsoft's Mr Ballmer declared, "Look, we're going to continue to compete. You're going to continue to hear from me and from our guys about why Windows servers are the best and blah, blah, blah."

But analysts say the deal also signals action against their mutual competitor - Linux. The free, open source operating system has dented Sun more than it has  Microsoft, but it's expected the
Windows-maker will feel the heat if Linux gains a foothold on desktop PCs.

Some analysts say the press conference included veiled threats to Linux users by repeatedly invoking intellectual property.

Microsoft's Mr Ballmer described the agreement as coming "from two companies that believe in intellectual property, that develop intellectual property and that are respecting intellectual property".
His comments echoed similar ones by Mr McNealy.

"For Microsoft, this is normal. But for Sun to be harping on about intellectual property, it has been out of character," says Al Gillen, an analyst with IDC.
Some Microsoft critics are cynical at the suggestion the company is a more co-operative player. "What  Microsoft got out of this deal was it got rid of a critic and a lawsuit that could've led to
substantial damages," says Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, a group involved in past lawsuits against  Microsoft, of which Sun remains a member.
"A good faith act would be if you started obeying the law, not buying yourself out of trouble," he adds.

Mr Black believes with Sun no longer publicly criticising  Microsoft, other companies will step in to fill the void.

With Microsoft eager to get into the growing digital media market, he says, "other companies will rise up".

HD         EU Explains  Big Microsoft Fine With Internal Company Memos

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission's 302-page condemnation of  Microsoft Corp. on antitrust grounds, published yesterday, cites internal company memos and statements that help make the case behind last month's ruling that the software maker illegally was abusing a monopoly.

For example, while  Microsoft publicly argues it competes fairly against companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc., Oracle Corp. and RealNetworks Inc., the document cites a 1997 speech in which Chairman Bill Gates told  Microsoft salespeople the company's goal was to use proprietary information to "lock out Sun and Oracle specifically. . . . That's what we are trying to do."

TD
An internal company memo from the same year says  Microsoft "would have been dead a long time ago" if it didn't have a captive community of users, afraid of the expense and complexity of switching to alternative software, according to the decision.

The document also skewers Microsoft with information that the company submitted as part of its defense. One example: Microsoft commissioned a study of 15 reviews comparing its own Windows Media Player with rival software for playing digital music and video in order to demonstrate that it faces healthy competition in the marketplace. The study, submitted last year, also found "the best product to be RealNetworks' player more often than WMP," according to the commission. The study, which covered four years, showed that "RealPlayer takes first place in eight out of these 15 reviews, while Microsoft's WMP comes first in two of them," the Commission notes.

For the Commission, the study provided evidence the steady gains that Windows Media Player has been making on RealNetworks' RealPlayer owe to its bundling with the ubiquitous Windows operating system rather than the merits of the  Microsoft product.

The Commission didn't attach the actual documents it cited in its decision. A  Microsoft spokesman in Brussels had no comment on the disclosures. An internal memo prepared for the company's top management this week blasts the Commission's decision as a prosecution going beyond the bounds of law to benefit individual  Microsoft competitors, not  competition in general.

Microsoft has said it intends to appeal the decision by the Commission, the European Union's executive arm, to EU courts, a process that could take as many as five years.

HD          Microsoft Posts 39% Earnings  Drop --- Legal Costs Hurt Results, But Revenue Climbed 17%, Aided by Strong PC Sales
BY         By Robert A. Guth

LP
Microsoft Corp. said legal costs and stock-based compensation dragged down third-quarter earnings, but an unexpected recovery in corporate spending helped fuel a 17% jump in revenue.
The software titan raised its earnings forecast for the current quarter and full fiscal year, ending June
30, and the shares jumped in after-hours trading following the announcement. In its first comments
about the fiscal year ending in June 2005, however,  Microsoft forecast sales and profit below analysts'
expectations.

TD
For the fiscal period ended March 30, the Redmond, Wash., company said net income fell 39% to
$1.32 billion, or 12 cents a share, from $2.14 billion, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest
period included after-tax charges of $1.89 billion related to the company's legal settlement with Sun
Microsystems Inc. and a fine imposed by the European Commission, which last month ruled that
Microsoft had violated antitrust laws. The quarter also included $501 million in expenses related to
stock-based compensation.

Excluding those costs, the company earned 34 cents a share, topping analysts' average estimate on that basis of 29 cents, according to Thomson First Call.

Microsoft's sales in the quarter grew to $9.18 billion from $7.84 billion, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $8.66 billion, as tallied by Thomson First Call.

Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors credited better-than-expected sales of personal computers and server computers as the driver of the strong results from operations and the company's decision to raise its forecasts. The positive environment helped sales of  Microsoft's core Windows operating system and Office 2003 suite of productivity software.

Microsoft's overall strong quarter is good news for the broader technology industry. Consumer spending helped sustain earnings at  Microsoft and other technology companies in the second half of last year while businesses, the traditional drivers of technology sales, lagged. But several analysts and Microsoft executives said the software maker's results show that business spending is returning more strongly than the technology industry expected. "We are in the midst of a corporate recovery," Mr. Connors said. "We expect the improvement we saw in the quarter to continue for the remainder of the current fiscal year."

As of 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  Microsoft shares were at $25.95, up 50 cents. In after-hours trading, the stock was up 4.8% to $27.20.

The company said its client business unit, which includes its various versions of Windows for PCs, posted sales of $2.9 billion, a 16% increase over the same period a year earlier. Operating income for the unit fell 16% to $1.6 billion.

Meanwhile, revenue at the company's server-and-tools group, considered one of  Microsoft's most promising growth engines, rose 19% to $2.18 billion. But expenses related to the Sun settlement

Page 247 of 249 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
plunged the group into the red, triggering an operating loss of $635 million, compared with a profit of
$305 million the previous year.

Several analysts noted that the strength in servers is because  Microsoft is faring better than expected against the Linux operating system, considered one of the biggest threats facing  Microsoft. "People worry about Linux, but it doesn't seem to have much of an impact," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft's MSN online service continued to gain from an industrywide increase in online advertising and expects to post its first full-year profit in the year ending June 30, Mr. Connors said. For the quarter, it posted operating income of $107 million on sales of $591 million, compared with a loss of
$139 million on sales of $508 million. "It's not an emerging business," Mr. Connor said of the MSN
group. "It has emerged."

For the year ending June 30,  Microsoft forecast sales would be $36.4 billion to $36.5 billion, or an increase of 13% to 14% over 2003. Thomson First Call had expected sales to reach $35.88 billion.

Mr. Connors said Microsoft has been improving its operating margins thanks to an increased focus on containing costs, a push that was advanced last year when he installed in-house "CFOs," or chief financial officers, in each of  Microsoft's seven major business units.

Among other savings, Mr. Connors said  Microsoft has cut training and education expenses by using software for coordinating live meetings, which reduces travel costs. The company has also cut
direct-marketing costs and has simplified internal computer projects, he said. But  Microsoft isn't trimming headcount. "We are still adding people," he said.

Analysts praised the new restraint, which they regard as a sign of the company's maturation. "We're seeing pretty decent cost-cutting measures at  Microsoft," said Michael Sansoterra, an analyst at Principal Global Investors, a unit of Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa. "These aren't things that you've typically seen from a company like  Microsoft," which during its growth years paid less attention to costs.

Microsoft didn't announce plans to disperse any of its cash as a dividend. As the company's cash continues to grow -- it now has cash and short-term investments of $56 billion -- it has come under pressure from shareholders to offer a one-time dividend, raise its annual dividend further or do a large share buyback. Microsoft last year said it to needed to have cash on hand until it resolved several lawsuits.

Mr. Connors acknowledged that  Microsoft has recently resolved the largest of those suits. He said the company will "have a lot more to say" about the possibility of distributing cash by the time it holds its annual analyst meeting in July.
