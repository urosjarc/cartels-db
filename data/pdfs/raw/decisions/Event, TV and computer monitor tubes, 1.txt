LP
LG Electronics, Panasonic and Royal Philips Electronics might be  fined by EU antitrust regulators within weeks over price-fixing  agreements for cathode-ray  tubes used in televisions, four people said.
Technicolor was also among firms earmarked for possible European Commissionfines as soon as
November 28, one of the people said yesterday.

TD
Other manufacturers including Toshiba had been asked to meet with EU officials prior to a preliminary decision on fines by a panel of EU and national competition authorities, another person said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is not public.

Sales of cathode-ray  tubes used in TVs and  computer monitors fell after customers switched to slimmer liquid-crystal and plasma display sets. Philips and Technicolor, previously known as Thomson, received objections in the EU probe in 2009.

Antitrust watchdogs in the EU, Japan and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns they colluded to fix prices for  tubes in computer monitors and colour TVs.
The commission can fine cartel members as much as 10 percent of their annual sales. Antoine
Colombani, a spokesman for the Brussels-based authority, declined to comment on the matter.

Joost Akkermans, a spokesman for Amsterdam-based Philips, declined to comment because the investigation was ongoing. Technicolor, based in Paris, and Tokyo-based Toshiba declined to immediately comment.
LG and Panasonic did not immediately respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment.

Chunghwa Picture Tubes would not be fined because it was the first to inform regulators of the  cartel, two people said. Chunghwa did not immediately respond to calls and |e-mails seeking comment.

Hitachi and Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics, were also involved in the case, one person said.
Hitachi and Samsung did not immediately respond to calls and e-mails.

Philips and LG said in June that they had received supplementary objections from regulators. The EU made the complaint to hold them responsible for the behaviour of LG.Philips Displays, a now-defunct joint venture that made the  tubes, two people familiar with the matter said at the time. LG.Philips Displays' European holding company was declared bankrupt in 2006.

LG Display, partly owned by Seoul-based LG Electronics, was among companies  fined e648.9 million (R7 billion) by the EU in 2010 for  fixing  the price of liquid-crystal display panels used in TVs, computer monitors and notebook computers. - Bloomberg

BRUSSELS--Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHG, PHIA.AE), Panasonic Corp. (PC, 6752.TO), LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE) and three other firms are likely to be slapped with stinging European Unionfines later this month, marking the end game in a long-running probe into the price  fixing  of cathode-ray tubes used in televisions and  computer monitors.

TD
Three people said an announcement detailing the  fines had been slated for Nov. 28, though the date isn't definitive and could shift by a few days.

"We expect the Commission to take a very aggressive approach and slap a very big  fine on the main offenders," one of the people said.

Other firms involved in the alleged  cartel are Technicolor SA (TCH.FR, TCLRY), Toshiba Corp. (TOSYY, 6502.TO), and Samsung Electronics Co. (SSNHY, 005930.SE). Not all firms are expected to receive the same levels of  fines.
The Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes Ltd. (2475.TW) was the whistle-blower in the  cartel
and is unlikely to be  fined, the people said.

A spokesman for the  European Commission declined to comment on the case, saying only that it was an ongoing investigation.

Despite the fact that the cathode-ray technology has been superseded by plasma and liquid-crystal screens, the people said they expected the  fines to be substantial owing to the length of the  cartel and because European Union regulators were viewing this as an important, precedent-setting case.

EU regulators filed a formal complaint in 2009 after raiding the companies' premises in late 2007 as part of an ongoing investigation into price  fixing  for TVs and  computer monitors.

The commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, views price-fixing  as among the most harmful restrictions of competition and imposes heavy  fines as a matter of policy.  Fines are typically related to the value of sales, depending on the degree of gravity of the infringement, multiplied by the number of years of infringement.

Legal experts point out that the number of EU  fines related to cartels has gone down significantly over the past two years. "So this might be a good time for the Commission to make up for the shortfall," another person said.

The largest  fine imposed on all members of a single  cartel was more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.65 billion) in 2008 on four manufacturers of car glass.

BRUSSELS—Royal Philips Electronics NV, Panasonic Corp., LG Electronics and three other firms are likely to be slapped with stinging European Unionfines later this month, marking the end game in a long-running probe into the price  fixing  of cathode-ray tubes used in televisions and  computer monitors.

Three people said an announcement detailing the  fines had been slated for Nov. 28, though the date isn't definitive and could shift by a few days.

TD
"We expect the Commission to take a very aggressive approach and slap a very big  fine on the main offenders," one of the people said.

Other firms involved in the alleged  cartel are Technicolor SA, Toshiba Corp., and Samsung. Not all firms are expected to receive the same levels of  fines.

The Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes was the whistleblower in the  cartel and is unlikely to be fined, the people said.

A spokesman for the  European Commission declined to comment on the case, saying only that it was an ongoing investigation.

Despite the fact that the cathode-ray technology has been superseded by plasma and liquid-crystal screens, the people said they expected the  fines to be substantial owing to the length of the  cartel and because European Union regulators were viewing this as an important, precedent-setting case.

EU regulators filed a formal complaint in 2009 after raiding the companies' premises in late 2007 as part of an ongoing investigation into price  fixing  for TVs and  computer monitors.

The commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, views price-fixing  as among the most harmful restrictions of competition and imposes heavy  fines as a matter of policy.  Fines are typically related to the value of sales, depending on the degree of gravity of the infringement, multiplied by the number of years of infringement.

Legal experts point out that the number of EU  fines related to cartels has gone down significantly over the past two years. "So this might be a good time for the Commission to make up for the shortfall," another person said.

The largest  fine imposed on all members of a single  cartel was more than €1.3 billion in 2008 on four manufacturers of car glass.

BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Six top electronics firms including Philips and LG Electronics face hefty European Unionfines at the end of the month for  fixing  prices of TV cathode-ray tubes, four people with knowledge of the matter said.

The sources said on Friday other companies involved in the  cartel were South Korea's Samsung SDI, French group Thomson, which was renamed Technicolor in 2010, and Japanese companies Matsushita, now known as Panasonic Corp , and Toshiba Corp.
The European Commission, which raided the companies in late 2007, will announce the  fines on
Nov. 28, according to a Commission document seen by Reuters and confirmed by sources.
Sanctions are expected to be substantial because the  cartel lasted more than a decade from the late
1990s, one of the sources said. The EU executive can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their
turnover for breaching EU rules.

In the case of Dutch group Philips that could reach 2.26 billion euros ($2.9 billion), while for South Korea's LG Electronics it could be 5.4 trillion won ($5.0 billion), based on their 2011 revenues. However, sanctions are not expected to hit those levels.
The sources said Taiwanese company Chunghwa Picture  Tubes
alerted the EU antitrust regulators to the existence of the  cartel, so will not be  fined.

LG Philips Display, a joint venture between Philips and LG Electronics, and MT Picture Display, a joint venture between Matsushita and Toshiba, will also be penalised, the sources said.
The European Commission did not respond to a phone call or email seeking comment. Cathode ray tubes, which were also used in  computer monitors, have largely been replaced by
modern display technologies such as LCD, plasma display and organic light-emitting diode.

The EU authority slapped a total  fine of 648 million euros on six LCD companies which included Chunghwa Picture  Tubes, Samsung Electronics and LG Display two years ago for taking part in a cartel.
Last year, it penalised four producers of cathode ray  tubes glass 128.74 million euros for  fixing  prices.

($1 = 0.7868 euro = 1087.75 Korean won)

TWITTER RESETS USERS’ PASSWORDS BY MISTAKE

TWITTER said it mistakenly reset the passwords of “a large number” of its more than 140 million active users while conducting routine security screening to identify accounts that may have been compromised.

TD
A spokesman for the social- networking site declined to say how many Twitter accounts were affected by the error. She added that there had not been a security breach.

Twitter also apologised for any confusion caused by the password resets. Internet-security specialists advise people to regularly change passwords to accounts to thwart hackers.
Twitter also posted a “bug alert”, saying it was working to fix problems with disappearing “tweets”
and direct messages.

NEW LCD PANEL SEEN AS A CLEAR WINNER

JAPAN Display said it has developed a prototype LCD panel that has the world’s highest resolution of 651ppi.

Technology-news website HardwareZone reported that the display has a resolution of 1,280x800 pixels packed into a screen size of 2.3 inches.
This is said to be double that of many high-definition smart- phone displays.

“The resolution of the human eye is said to be about 300ppi. A 5-inch Full HD display has higher resolution, so it may be close to the limit of the human eye,” said Japan Display.

“At that level, sensitivity becomes relevant. So, for example, objects that appear three-dimensional look extremely clear.
“We think that, if we give displays even higher resolution, images may look more realistic.”

Competition policy: Overview

Czech competition policy is set out in the Act on the Protection of Competition (Coll 143/2001), which united pre-existing codes and permits practices to mirror European Union convention. The act defines the following practices as unethical: abuse of a dominant market position;  cartel agreements; collusion and trust practices; consumer deception; and price  fixing.  Similar to statutes in other countries, the legislation permits authorities to act with leniency in such cases; hence, those who voluntarily admit to competition violations-such as cartel agreements-are eligible for reductions in penalties of as much as 75%. If the forthcoming entity can prove it did not initiate the  cartel agreement, potential  fines may be thrown out altogether.

TD
The Office for the Protection of Competition (Urad pro ochranu a hospodarske souteze-UOHS), based in Brno, administers the act. The UOHS, formerly the Ministry of Economic Competition, is an autonomous entity. All mergers need to receive its authorisation.

Once accused of not fully exercising its considerable powers, the UOHS has stepped up its activities in recent years. The office imposed  fines totalling Kc4.1bn over 2005-11-and mostly over mispricing. The UOHS issued  fines worth Kc28.8m in 2011, on par with the Kc29m it issued in 2010. The agency launched 89 proceedings in 2011, versus 60 in 2010. Appeals are commonplace in anti-monopoly adjudication, often lasting more than five years.

In October 2012 an administrative court raised a  fine levied in 2004 by the UOHS on SPT Telecom, the former state-held telephone operator, for abusing its monopoly position. Initially  fined Kc81.7m, the court increased the figure to Kc93m and ruled that Telefónica (a Spanish communications giant), which bought the company in a 2005 privatisation, wilfully misled investigators in the inquiry. Telefónica owns 69% of the Prague-listed utility, now known as Telefónica O2, and said it would appeal.

In June 2012 an administrative court struck down a Kc941m  fine, the UOHS's largest-ever, that was levelled in April 2007 against 16 industrial companies, including subsidiaries of multinationals. The companies had participated in what the UOHS said was a  cartel that fixed the prices when bidding on contracts for the installation of natural-gas pipeline-switching systems, both in the Czech Republic and abroad, from 1988-2004. The European Court of Justice ruled affirmatively earlier in the year on the validity of the  fine. Yet although a Czech administrative court based in the Moravian capital of Brno agreed on the existence of a  cartel among the group, it failed to validate the  fine because, the court said, it could not determine the extent to which each company participated in the bid-rigging.

Other noteworthy recent decisions involving international companies include a Kc29.3m settlement reached in February 2011 with consumer-products giants Henkel (Germany), Procter & Gamble (US) and Reckitt Benckiser (UK) on charges of pricing collusion in the sale of detergents, fabric softeners and hand dish cleaners during 1999-2004. Similarly, in September 2010 the office found an array of
cathode-ray-tube makers, including Panasonic and Samsung of Japan, Chunghwa of Taiwan, Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, and LG Electronics of South Korea, had colluded in the market for television colour-picture tubes over 1998-2004, and it levelled a  fine of Kc51.8m against the companies and several subsidiaries.

Competition policy: Monopolies and market dominance

The Act on Protection of Economic Competition (No. 143/1991) does not directly prohibit monopolies or market dominance. Rather, and since most enterprises were state controlled and enjoyed protected markets at the time of its 1991 passage, it focuses on the prohibition of "abuse of market dominance" by companies with large shares of a given marketplace or economic sector. In practical terms, this approach enables some companies-such as Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ), the state-controlled electricity provider-to retain their monopolies while facing regulatory scrutiny for pricing and service delivery. As such, the UOHS ruled in March 2011 that a plan to unite CSA (state-owned airline) with Prague Airport Authority in a holding company structure was sufficient to prevent abuse. Ownership of CSA was transferred to Czech Aeroholding, a state-owned holding firm, in September 2012.

Market dominance is defined as a combination of two factors, both of which must be present to constitute abuse. These are a dominant market share (control of at least 40% of a market sector) and a willingness to misuse this dominance (a concept that lacks clear legal definition). Enterprises with a dominant market share must report their status to the Office for the Protection of Competition (Urad pro ochranu a hospodarske souteze-UOHS), the Czech agency that is charged with regulating competition.

Parliament amended the competition law in 2001 to require the UOHS to examine any merger or takeover that involves a company with sales exceeding Kc550m. Enacted in July of that year, the amendment mandates a two-stage procedure whereby an initial one-month examination may be followed by a five-month, in-depth investigation if warranted. The amendment also allows interest groups and
other affected organisations to give their opinion on a merger. Mergers can be frozen until the entire investigation is completed. A 2009 amendment simplified the approvals process for mergers not involving the threat of "distortion of market competition" (that is, for vertical integration). The changes shortened
the evaluation period to 20 days, enable electronic notifications and decisions, and bring Czech law more closely in line with European Union competition directives.

In 2003 the Czech parliament enacted legislation to ban  cartel agreements, even those considered to be "insignificant". (An insignificant agreement is one in which the parties to the agreement together control less than 5% of the market for their goods or services.)

Monopolies per se are not illegal under Czech law, and some do exist. One is RWE Transgas, the formerly state-owned natural-gas importer sold in 2002 to RWE of Germany for EUR4.1bn. In 1997 the Ministry of Industry and Trade set licensing restrictions for the import of natural gas that required applicants to possess a high-pressure gas and water system capable of supplying gas throughout the entire country. Transgas was-and is-the only company that meets the requirement. The company was further strengthened when eight regional gas distributors were rolled into it ahead of privatisation.

In 2006 RWE Transgas was  fined Kc370m for abuse of market dominance (later reduced to Kc240m since RWE Transgas co-operated with the UOHS and amended some of the contested contractual arrangements). RWE Transgas appealed, and a regional court rejected the  fine on procedural grounds in the third quarter of 2007. The UOHS appealed against the regional court's decision to the Supreme Administrative Court, which ruled in 2008 that the UOHS's procedure was correct, transferring the case back to the regional court to decide once again on the material substance (that is, abuse of market position). The regional court ruled a year later, in October 2009, that the UOHS had erred in its definition of the "relevant market". The court returned a subsequent appeal to the lower court in September 2011, and no date had then been set for a new hearing.

In an unrelated matter, the UHOS announced in June 2009 that RWE Transgas would pay Kc10m to settle charges stemming from a September 2008 investigation that the company overcharged more than
76,000 customers by as much as 10% in an advance-billing scheme-70% of the  fine is to compensate affected consumers. In addition, it said RWE Transgas would free some 20% of underground-storage capacity for independent suppliers lest it be accused of abusing its dominant position in the Czech natural-gas marketplace.
Competition policy: Mergers

The Act on the Transformation of Business Companies and Co-operatives (Col 125/2008), implemented in July 2008, aligns Czech legislation with a 2005 EU directive governing crossborder merger of
limited-liability companies. The act governs national and international mergers conducted via the formation of a new company and via acquisition. The law permits takeovers of both listed and non-listed companies, enabling the holder(s) of 90% of a company's shares to buy out minority shareholders; for contested bids, the takeover is at a price determined by a court-appointed arbitrator.

For competition purposes, the Office for the Protection of Competition (Urad pro ochranu a hospodarske souteze-UOHS) places the same constraints on mergers as on all companies. The government has

Page 21 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
never openly forbidden a merger, and there have been no major court cases involving mergers. An amendment in September 2009 to the Act on Protection of Economic Competition (Col 143/2001) streamlined approval processes for mergers that do not lead to market dominance, such as vertical integrations. The simplified procedure cuts the evaluation period to 20 days (from 30), and enables electronic notifications and decisions, thus aligning Czech law more closely with EU directives. And in September 2011 CzechInvest, the government's investment-promotion agency, launched an internet portal to foster mergers of domestic companies with foreign partners.
Competition policy: Freedom to sell

Companies face no formal legal restrictions on their freedom to sell. However, recent actions on the part of the Office for the Protection of Competition (Urad pro ochranu a hospodarske souteze-UOHS) indicate that this freedom might be curtailed somewhat when companies hold dominant market positions.

Companies are free to set up exclusive distributorships but are generally not permitted to force retailers into restrictive selling arrangements. Producers are not bound in principle to any particular distribution channel and are free to offer discounts on bulk orders and other types of pricing incentives. But they are expected to treat customers equally and to refrain from price discrimination. In January 2010 the UOHS fined Karlovarske mineralni vody (a bottler) Kc5m for restraint of trade in export-distribution agreements. In September 2010 the office  finedSokolovska uhelna (a coal company) nearly Kc17.3m, after ruling that its distribution agreements limiting export affected the local-market price for brown-coal briquettes and other products.

It is technically possible to sue an unauthorised dealer. In practice, however, this almost never happens since the congested court system is notoriously slow.
Competition policy: Price controls

The Price Law (No. 526/1990), enacted in January 1991, governs price controls and gives the government broad powers to regulate prices. The Ministry of Finance (Ministerstvo financi)-and for pharmaceuticals, the Ministry of Health-can fix prices directly, set minimum or maximum prices for any commercial transaction, and establish periods when prices may not change. The ministry may require sellers deemed to be in a position of market dominance to give a one-month notice of any planned price changes. The government must publish a list of goods and services for which price regulations apply.

Despite its authority, the government favours a laissez-faire pricing policy on most products. Goods and services that are subject to controls include energy, some raw materials, pharmaceuticals, domestic rents, and rail and bus transport. Maximum prices also apply on mail and telecommunications tariffs.

The three-stage liberalisation of the electricity market, begun in 1999 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Ministerstvo prumyslu a obchodu), reached completion in 2006, when customers could choose a supplier. The gas market was liberalised in 2007, when first businesses and then households could choose their supplier, though the state regulator still set maximum prices. Imports are not subject to price controls.

In December 2012 the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU), the market regulator, proposed establishing price controls for network access as a means of encouraging greater competition in the mobile-telephony market. By forcing the three owners of the country's network operators
licences-T-Mobile (Germany), Telefónica (Spain) and Vodafone (UK)-to make public their wholesale pricing policies, the CTU hopes to encourage so-called virtual operators to enter the market. Virtual providers, which would lease capacity from network operators, would boost competition by offering services at a cost lower than that offered by the major providers. Following a period of public comment, expected to close at the end of January 2013, the CTU and Office for the Protection of Competition (Urad pro ochranu a hospodarske souteze-UOHS) will jointly prepare a draft policy to be advanced to the European Commission ahead of implementation, anticipated in early in 2014.

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union on Wednesday slapped a 1.47-billion-euro (1.92-billion-dollar)  fine on seven electronics companies - including giants Philips, Samsung, LG Electronics and Panasonic - for having illegally formed a cathode ray tube  cartel during the 1990s.

The firms illegally "fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output" from 1996 until 2006 in the markets for television and computer cathode ray tubes, according to the EU's executive, the European Commission.

It said the worldwide  cartel was "among the most organized" it had ever investigated. With cathode ray tubes become less and less prevalent, the  cartel participants "were trying to address the decline of the CRT market in a collusive way," the commission said.

"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes ... feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 to 70 per cent of the price of a screen," he added, arguing that European consumers were harmed as a result.

The commission said that Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI participated in both cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD and Technicolor participated only in the  television cartel.

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union on Wednesday slapped a record 1.47-billion-euro
(1.92-billion-dollar)  fine on seven electronics companies - including giants Philips, Samsung, LG
Electronics and Panasonic - for forming a cathode ray tube (CRT)  cartel during the 1990s.

The firms illegally "fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output" from 1996 until 2006 in the markets for  television and computer CRTs, according to the EU's executive, the  European Commission.

TD
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes ... feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"The cartellists knew very well that their conduct was illegal," Almunia added. "This is why they did everything they could to hide it."
"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer
screens. They accounted for 50 to 70 per cent of the price of a screen," Almunia added.

He said the worldwide  cartel was "among the most organized" the commission had ever investigated, imposing "serious harm" on both manufacturers and private households.
The combined fine was the commission's biggest ever in a  cartel decision, the commissioner said.

With cathode ray  tubes becoming less and less prevalent, the  cartel participants "were trying to address the decline of the CRT market in a collusive way," the commission said in a statement.

The cartellists would hold so-called green meetings in Asia and Europe, Almunia said, explaining that they were "called this way because they took place very often at a golf course."
Other gatherings, referred to by the cartellists as glass meetings, had been the "engine room of the
cartel," according to information from a whistleblower.

"Because of the success of the glass meeting, everybody has been enjoying business this year," Almunia quoted from one company memo.

"The word 'glass' was not because of the objective of being transparent," Almunia responded to speculation on the meaning of the term.

The commission said that Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI participated in both cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD and Technicolor participated only in the  television cartel.

Philips and LG Electronics face the largest  fines, while Chunghwa's penalties were waived because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.
Philips said in a statement that it intended to appeal its  fines - 313 million euros plus a joint
392-million-euro fine with LG Electronics - calling them "disproportionate and unjustified."

The Dutch-based company said it had transferred its CRT activities in 2001 to a separate joint venture with LG Electronics that had since gone bankrupt.

"We regret any association with this type of behavior," said Philips chief executive Frans van Houten. "Our ethical standards ... are very clear and must be strictly adhered to."

Technicolor stated that it had made provisions for a  fine, which would feature as an "extraordinary item" in its income statement for the second half of 2012. dpa amh hm npr Authors: Alexandra Mayer-Hohdahl, Helen Maguire

Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI and three other firms were fined a record €1.47 billion by EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday (5 December) for  fixing  prices of TV and monitor cathode-ray  tubes for nearly a decade.

The European Commission slapped the biggest penalty, of €313.4 million, on Dutch-based Philips. LG Electronics came in second with a €295.6 million  fine.
The EU competition authority  finedPanasonic Corp €157.5 million, Samsung SDI €150.8 million, Toshiba
Corp. €28 million, and French company Technicolor €38.6 million.

Two Panasonic joint ventures were also  fined. Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes blew the whistle on the cartels in  TV and computer monitors and escaped a  fine.
Philips announced that it will take a provision of €509 million in the fourth quarter this year to cover the
fine, saying it intends to appeal the decision by the EU's antitrust authorities.

"We believe that the  fine which relates to a business that has been divested in 2001 is disproportionate and unjustified," the company said in a  statement.

The two cartels, one involving TVs and the other  computer monitors, operated worldwide between 1996 and 2006, during which company executives discussed how to fix prices and share markets at "green meetings", so-called because the events often ended with a round of golf.
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The companies were well aware they were breaking the law, the Commission said. "For instance, in a document found during the Commission's inspections, a warning goes as follows: 'Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission'," the EU executive noted.
He said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for 50 to
70% of the price of a screen.

Cathode ray tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes.

The biggest  fine prior to the cathode-ray tube  cartel was €1.38 billion imposed on participants in a car glass cartel in 2008.

The Commission's sanctions followed a total  fine of €128.74 million levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode-ray  tubes.

And Chunghwa Picture  Tubes, Samsung Electronics, LG Display and three other LCD companies were penalised a total €648 million two years ago for taking part in a  cartel.

The European Commission has fined seven international groups of companies a total of EUR1.47B for participating in either one or both of two distinct cartels in the sector of cathode ray  tubes. For almost ten years, between 1996 and 2006, these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output. One cartel concerned color picture  tubes used for televisions and the other one colour display  tubes used in computer monitors. The cartels operated worldwide. The infringements found by the Commission therefore cover the entire European Economic Area. Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips (PHG) and Samsung SDI (SSNLF) participated in both cartels, while Panasonic (PC), Toshiba (TOSBF), MTPD and Technicolor (TCH) participated only in the  cartel for television tubes. Chunghwa received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for the two cartels, as it was the first to reveal their existence to the Commission.

TD
Other companies received reductions of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the
Commission's leniency program.

HD       Brussels fines electronics cartel €1.5bn

European regulators have issued  fines of €1.47bn to seven electronics groups after finding evidence of price-rigging that lasted nearly a decade.

Companies including Philips; Samsung SDI, an arm of the Korean conglomerate; and Panasonic conspired to fix the prices of cathode ray  tubes, used in older televisions and  computer screens, the European Commission said on Wednesday. It said that by restricting output and allocating customers among themselves from 1996 to 2006, the companies pushed up the prices of display screens for European consumers.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: "These . . . are
'textbook cartels' - they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden
to companies doing business in Europe."
The tubes concerned accounted for up to 70 per cent of the price of a screen, he said.
The aggregate penalty is the most severe ever imposed by the commission in a single decision. It
comes after large fines were levied in both Europe and the US against a number of flat-panel makers for
similar price-fixing  activity from 2001 to 2006. Flat-screen technology replaced more bulky cathode ray
tubes in TVs and monitors around 2000.

Chungwha Picture Tube, of Taiwan, was spared a  fine because it alerted regulators to the existence of the cartels. However,  fines are payable by all the other companies involved, including LG Electronics, Technicolor and MTPD, which is now owned by Panasonic. Philips faces the most severe penalty,
at €450m.

Philips said it would appeal the ruling. Frans van Houten, chief executive, issued a statement calling the fine "disproportionate and unjustified", noting that the company had spun off its cathode ray tube unit into a joint venture with LG in 2001.
The other companies involved could not immediately be reached for comment.

The commission said the two cartels - one for  tubes used in televisions, and the other for  tubes used in computer screens - were among the most organised it had investigated, noting that the companies monitored each others' compliance with capacity restrictions through plant visits.

The price-fixing  policy was decided at "top management level meetings, dubbed 'green(s) meetings' by the alleged cartelists themselves because they were often followed by a golf game", the commission said.

More junior staff held more meetings as often as once a week to determine prices, production and market share.

Philips, LG Electronics and Samsung SDI were hit with a record €1.47bn  fine from Europe's top competition enforcer on Wednesday after participating in "textbook cartels" for almost a decade.

Seven electronics groups in total were punished for two distinct conspiracies to rig prices and the supply of cathode ray  tubes, an obsolete technology once used in televisions and  computer monitors.

TD
European Commission investigators found senior managers at self-styled "greens meetings" plotted to carve up worldwide markets and overcharge consumers before often playing golf at exclusive clubs in Singapore, Korea and Japan.
More junior staff then developed the details of the arrangements at sometimes weekly "glass meetings"
- named after the material covering the tubes - where key information was shared and prices set,
sometimes for individual  television and computer manufacturers.

The combined €1.5bn penalty for the two cartels is the biggest  fine imposed by the European               Commission in a single decision and exceeds the €1.4bn levied on a  cartel on glass for car windows.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition chief, said the two conspiracies featured the "worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour" that caused "serious harm" to  television and computer makers. The
price-fixing,  market-sharing and customer allocation became almost routine business practice between
1996 and 2006.

While the collusion began at the peak of the market for cathode  tubes, it became a way to mitigate the drop-off in sales as customers moved to slim display screens using plasma or liquid crystal.

In one document seized by investigators, a  cartel member describes setting a goal to "control supply and maintain a proper price to survive". Another asks conspirators to keep the arrangements "secret" so the European Commission does not find out. "Please dispose the following document after reading it," it said.

Mr Almunia joked that the glass  cartel was not created with "the objective of being transparent". He said the high fine reflected the long duration of the cartels and the breadth of co-ordination.
Chunghwa of Taiwan won immunity for alerting authorities to the wrongdoing. LG Electronics, Philips
and Samsung SDI, an arm of the Korean conglomerate, participated in both cartels. Panasonic, Toshiba,
MTPD (now a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor only colluded on  television parts.

Philips faces the biggest penalty of €450m. It said it would appeal the "disproportionate and unjustified" fine, noting that the company had spun off its cathode ray tube unit into a joint venture with LG in 2001. Panasonic and Toshiba are also considering mounting legal challenges.

The commission decision comes after large  fines were levied in Europe and the US against a number of flat-panel makers for similar price-fixing  activity from 2001 to 2006. Flat-screen technology replaced more bulky cathode ray tubes in TVs and monitors from about 2000.

BRUSSELS, Dec. 5 -- The European Union on Wednesday imposed a total of 1.47 billion euros (about 160 billion yen) in cartel fines on six companies, including Toshiba Corp. and Panasonic Corp., claiming they fixed prices for television and computer monitor cathode ray  tubes.

The European Commission ruled that a total of seven consumer appliance makers in Asia and Europe artificially set prices for cathode ray  tubes globally, breaching EU competition law, and imposed fines on six of them.

TD
Panasonic questioned the commission's findings, saying in a statement, "After fully examining the content of the  European Commission's decision, we will consider how to deal with this with an eye to filing a lawsuit with a court of the EU."

The European Commission said that top-level executives of the seven companies were involved in the anticompetitive behavior.

BRUSSELS, Dec. 5 -- The European Union on Wednesday imposed record  cartel fines of 1.47 billion euros (about 160 billion yen) on six companies, including Toshiba Corp. and Panasonic Corp.,
claiming they fixed prices globally for  television and computer monitor cathode ray  tubes over 10 years.
The European Commission ruled that a total of seven consumer appliance makers in Asia and

A Taiwan company escaped being  fined as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the European Union. The other companies  fined include Samsung SDI and LG Electronics of South Korea.

The European Commission said in a statement that the companies' actions demonstrated "all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."
Top executives of the companies were involved in the anticompetitive behavior, it said. Panasonic was fined 157.47 million euros, with Toshiba punished with a 28.04 million euro  fine.
Both the Japanese companies questioned the commission's findings. Panasonic said in a statement, "After fully examining the content of the  European Commission's decision, we will consider how to deal with this with an eye to filing a lawsuit with a court of the EU."

Toshiba said it has been asserting that there was no breach of EU competition law with regard to its cathode ray tube business and it is "regrettable" that its argument was rejected.

TV and computer monitor screens have been replaced with liquid crystal and plasma displays, and production of cathode ray  tubes has almost ended.

TD
TOKYO - The Liberal Democratic Party is on course to win a majority in the Dec. 16 general election, which would see it return to power after three years, despite its lack of commitment to phasing out nuclear power in the wake of last year's Fukushima disaster, a Kyodo News survey showed Wednesday.

The main opposition party, headed by Shinzo Abe, and its ally the New Komeito party could together secure around 300 seats in the 480-seat House of Representatives, according to the telephone survey conducted over two days through Wednesday covering 123,700 eligible voters randomly selected across the country.

EU finesToshiba, Panasonic, 4 others for cathode ray tube  cartel

BRUSSELS - The European Union on Wednesday imposed record  cartel fines of 1.47 billion euros (about 160 billion yen) on six companies, including Toshiba Corp. and Panasonic Corp., claiming they fixed prices globally for  television and computer monitor cathode ray  tubes over 10 years.
The European Commission ruled that a total of seven consumer appliance makers in Asia and
Europe artificially set prices, divided up the market and adjusted production of cathode ray  tubes from
1996 to 2006 in breach of EU competition law, fining six of the seven companies.

Hashimoto says to refrain from "tweeting" during campaign

OSAKA - Japan Restoration Party acting leader Toru Hashimoto indicated Wednesday he will refrain from posting messages on Twitter during an official general election campaign period due to the
election law banning the use of the Internet for campaigning, reversing remarks made last week that he would continue to tweet.

"As there are restrictions on documents under the Public Offices Election Law, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications interprets visual content on the Net as being documents, I will take that into consideration even though it sounds foolish," said the Osaka mayor who has around
900,000 followers on his Twitter account.

BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The  European Commission imposed the biggest antitrust penalty in its history on Wednesday, fining six firms including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic a total of 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) for running two cartels for nearly a decade.

The Commission said executives from the European and Asian companies met until six years ago to fix prices and divide up markets for  TV and computer monitor cathode-ray  tubes, technology now mostly made obsolete by flat screens.

Between 1996 and 2006 they met in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and in Asia for "green meetings", so-called because they often ended in a round of golf.
"These cartels for cathode-ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The EU antitrust regulator imposed the biggest penalties on Philips for its role in the price  fixing  and carving up of markets. The Dutch-based firm was  fined 313.4 million euros and faces a further penalty through a joint venture.

However, Chief Executive Frans van Houten said the group would challenge what he called the disproportionate and unjustified penalty.

LG Electronics of South Korea must pay 295.6 million euros plus its share of a joint venture penalty, followed by Panasonic Corp which was  fined 157.5 million.

The Japanese firm said it might also make a legal challenge. "Panasonic believes the EU decision is factually and legally erroneous ... and will carefully review the decision and consider our options for appeal to the European courts," it said.
The Commission also finedSamsung SDI 150.8 million euros, Toshiba Corp. 28 million euros, and
French company Technicolor 38.6 million euros.
A joint venture between Philips and LG Electronics was penalised 391.9 million euros while two
Panasonic joint ventures were also sanctioned.

Almunia said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode-ray  tubes accounted for
50 to 70 percent of the price of a screen.

Cathode-ray tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes.

Philips sold off the business which committed the infringement in 2001 but said it would make a provision of 509 million euros in the fourth quarter for the  fine.

ING analyst Fabian Smeets told ANP-Reuters that the sanction was significant, but had been expected. Philips' shares were down 0.82 percent to 19.93 euros at late afternoon, erasing earlier gains after
news of the  fines.

Technicolor said the  fine, which will be booked as an exceptional item in its second-half accounts, would not affect its 2012 earnings and free cash flow targets.

Until now, the Commission's biggest antitrust penalty had been a 1.38 billion euro  fine imposed on participants in a car glass  cartel in 2008.

The Commission's sanctions followed a total fine of 128.74 million euros levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode-ray tubes.

Chunghwa Picture  Tubes, Samsung Electronics, LG Display and three other LCD companies were penalised a total 648 million euros two years ago for taking part in a  cartel.

European Union anti-trust authorities announced Wednesday a record  fine for running a cartel, ordering seven companies including LG Electronics and Philips to pay nearly 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for jacking up the prices for TVs and  computer screens for a decade.
"It's the biggest  fine for a cartel decision" by the EU executive, said Competition Commissioner Joaquin

A European Commission spokesman confirmed that the penalty was the biggest since a

The companies involved include household names such as LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung, in both cartels, plus Panasonic, Toshiba, and Technicolor (formerly Thomson) in the  TV end.
The Taiwanese company Chunghwa was granted complete immunity and not  fined as it disclosed the
cartel to regulators.
The companies colluded, the Commission concluded, to fix 50-70 percent of the price of these screens. "The European Commission has fined seven international groups of companies a total of
1,470,515,000 for participating in either one or both of two distinct cartels in the sector of cathode ray

"For almost 10 years, between 1996 and 2006, these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output," the Commission said.

Almunia added: "These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."
The case goes back to a November 2007 raid.
The executives and managers of the companies held meetings in a number of countries across Asia and
Europe and often sealed their decisions on golf courses, said the Commission.
It added that the investigation showed the companies knew that what they were doing was illegal.

"In a document found during the Commission's inspections, a warning goes as follows: 'Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European         Commission'," said a Commission statement.

The industry has already moved away from cathode ray  tubes to make TV and computer, having embraced liquid crystal (LCD) or light emitting diode (LED) technology.

The European Commission on Wednesday hit seven top  TV and computer screen makers, including LG Electronics and Philips, with a record  fine of 1.5 billion euros for running decade-long price-fixing cartels.
"It's the biggest  fine for a cartel decision," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

TD
The previous largest such penalty was a 1.38-billion-euro 2008  fine for an auto glass  cartel, a
Commission spokesman said.
The Commission said there were two cartels operating worldwide -- one for  television and another for
computer screens, based on conventional Cathode Ray Tube technology of the time.

The companies involved included household names such as LG Electronics and Samsung of South Korea, and Chunghwa of Taiwan alongside Philips of the Netherlands in both cartels, while Japan's Panasonic and Toshiba, and Technicolor, formerly Thomson, were involved in  TV screens.
Taiwan giant Chunghwa however was granted complete immunity and not  fined as it disclosed the  cartel
to regulators. Other companies got lesser  fines for cooperating in the investigation, the Commission said.

The companies colluded in the supply and pricing of CRTs which accounted for between 50 and 70 percent of the price of the screens.

"The European Commission has fined seven international groups of companies a total of (1.47 billion euros) ... for participating in either one or both of two distinct cartels in the sector of cathode ray  tubes," a statement said.

"For almost 10 years, between 1996 and 2006, these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output," it said.

The two cartels were among the most organised that the Commission had investigated, it said, carrying out the "most harmful anti-competitive practices including price  fixing,  market sharing, customer allocation, capacity and output coordination and exchanges of commercial sensitive information."
The investigation also showed that the companies were well aware they were breaking the law.

"In a document found during the Commission's inspections, a warning goes as follows: 'Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European         Commission'," the statement said.

The Commission noted too how top management level meetings were dubbed "green(s) meetings" because they were often followed by a golf game.
Almunia said the case was "textbook," illustrating all the worst features of anti-competitive practices. "These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

BRUSSELS (AP) - For years, some top managers at electronics multinationals would hold secretive meetings in Europe and Asia to fix the global market on the most expensive part of  television and computer monitors.

Then, said the European Union's antitrust chief, it was off to the golf course, where the executives would complete the "green(s) meetings" at which they set up a massive scam that affected millions of consumers.

TD
On Wednesday, EU antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he got back at them, slapping the biggest ever cartel fine -- over (EURO)1.47 billion ($1.96 billion) -- on seven companies for allegedly rigging the international market of  television and computer monitor tubes.

The EU's Commission ruled that, for a decade ending in 2006, the companies -- including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic -- artificially set prices, shared markets and restricted their output.

Almunia said the companies' actions "feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Tubes were the essential part of  television screens and computer monitors before they were replaced by LCD and plasma flatscreens. The cathode ray  tubes accounted for up to 70 percent of the cost of a screen, the Commission said.
Almunia added that the  tubes' cost gave "an indication of the serious harm" the companies had caused.
`'There are victims: millions and millions of citizens."

Philips and LG Electronics, which acted jointly and separately, were  fined a combined (EURO)999 million ($1.3 billion) with Panasonic punished with a (EURO)157 million ($205 million)  fine, adding to more if combined fines and affiliates were included.
Despite its cooperation with the Commission probe, Philips said in a statement it planned to appeal the
fine since it considered it `'disproportionate and unjust."

"We regret that we are linked to this kind of behavior," said Philips CEO Frans van Houten, as the company spoke of `'alleged infringements of competition rules."
LG Electronics said it would only react after studying the decision.

Other companies  fined were Samsung SDI, Technicolor, MTPD and Toshiba. Chunghwa of Taiwan escaped fines as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the EU.
`'It is the biggest  fine for a cartel, ever," Almunia said. The fine exceeded the previous record of the 2008
fine of (EURO)1.38 billion ($1.8 billion) in a car glass cartel.

Almunia said the  tubes cartel operated worldwide and that the companies involved fully realized they acted illegally.

After top management set the strategy at Green(s) meetings, lower-level company officials discussed the practical applications of the price-fixing  scheme during so-called `'Glass meetings," referring to the core material of the  tubes.

`'The participants during this period seemed very happy about the outcome," Almunia said, citing one document that read: `'Because of the success of the `glass meeting' everybody has been enjoying business this year." Not the consumer, he said.

The cartel started when the tube market was still booming but lasted even when sales dropped with the advent of flatscreens. The  cartel made sure the companies kept making profits even as demand for tube screens waned.

Almunia said the companies sought to keep prices as high as possible before new technologies came to the market. One document seized by the Commission gave the conspiring companies clear instructions: "Producers need to avoid price competition through controlling their production capacity."

A separate document had a warning: "Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission." Another said: "Please dispose the following document after reading it."

`'Instead of competing with each other to innovate and provide the best product at the best price, they chose to conspire to artificially maintain returns in a declining technology market," Almunia said. `'This is why we fight cartels."

He said the television and computer cartels were among the most sophisticated the EU had ever dealt with. He said they not only fixed prices, but also shared markets, coordinated capacity, output and customer allocation. In the  computer monitor cartel, they even audited compliance.

The Commission started its probe with an antitrust raid on the companies in November 2007. Almunia said U.S. authorities were currently investigating the case as well.

The European regulator has  fined seven global electronics firms a record $1.92 billion for  fixing
prices of TV and monitor cathode-ray  tubes for nearly a decade.

Brussels-based European Commission (EC) imposed its largest-ever penalty on Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI, Panasonic, Toshiba and French company Technicolor (formerly Thomson).

TD
Taiwan's Chunghwa Picture Tubes, which blew the whistle on the cartels in  TV and computer monitors was let off without being fined, while other companies received reductions of their fines for cooperating in the investigation.

The EC said that for almost ten years, between 1996 and 2006, these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output.

The cartel also monitored the implementation, including auditing compliance with the capacity restrictions by plant visits in the case of the  computer monitor tubes cartel.
One cartel concerned colour picture  tubes used for televisions and the other for colour display  tubes
used in computer monitors.

Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI were involved in both cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD (currently a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor participated only in the  cartel for television tubes.
The EC said the two CRT cartels are among the most organised cartels that it has investigated. Top management of these companies held meetings, dubbed "green(s) meetings" in a golf course
and designed the plan for the two cartels.
Preparation and implementation were carried out through lower level meetings, often referred to as
"glass meetings", on a quarterly, monthly, sometimes even weekly basis.

Meetings were held in various locations in Asia, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong, and in Amsterdam, Budapest, Glasgow, Paris, Rome in Europe.

The meetings usually started with a review of demand, production, sales and capacity in the main sales areas, including Europe, then prices were discussed, including for individual customers, i.e.  TV and computer manufacturers, said the EC.
''These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

He said the violations affected consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for 50 to 70 per cent of the price of a screen.

also fined a total of 94 million.

Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI and three other firms were fined a record 1.47 billion euros by EU
antitrust regulators for  fixing  prices of TV and monitor cathode-ray tubes for nearly a decade.

The European Commission slapped the biggest penalty, of 313.4 million euros, on Dutch-based Philips on Wednesday. LG Electronics came in second with a 295.6 million euro  fine.

TD
The EU competition authority  finedPanasonic Corp 157.5 million euros, Samsung SDI 150.8 million euros, Toshiba Corp. 28 million euros, and French company Technicolor 38.6 million euros. Two Panasonic joint ventures were also  fined. Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes blew the whistle on the cartels in  TV and computer monitors and escaped a  fine.

The two cartels, one involving TVs and the other  computer monitors, operated worldwide between 1996 and 2006, during which company executives discussed how to fix prices and share markets at "green meetings", so-called because the events often ended with a round of golf. "These cartels for cathode ray tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. He said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for 50 to 70 percent of the price of a screen. Cathode ray  tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display and organic
light-emitting diodes. The biggest  fine prior to the cathode- ray tube  cartel was 1.38 billion euros
imposed on participants in a car glass  cartel in 2008. The Commission's sanctions followed a total  fine of
128.74 million euros levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode-ray  tubes.

Dow Jones reported that Philips Electronics NV, Samsung SDI Co., Ltd. and Panasonic Corporation are among a group of seven companies  fined EUR1.47 billion ($1.92 billion) by European regulators on Wednesday for operating a two-decade-long  cartel in TV and computer monitor tubes. The European Commission said LG Electronics Inc., Philips Electronics NV and Samsung SDI participated in both cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba Corp, MTPD, a Panasonic subsidiary and Technicolor, formerly Thomson participated only in the cartel for television tubes. Whistle-blower Chunghwa from Taiwan has received full immunity from fines as it was the first company to reveal the cartels' existence. Other companies received reductions of their  fines for cooperating in the probe. The Commission said the two cartels were among the most organized cartels that it had investigated.

The European Commission has fined seven international companies a total of € 1.470.515. 000 for participating in two cartels in the sector of cathode ray tubes ("CRT").The cartels concerned colour picture tubes used for televisions and colour display tubes used in computer monitors. In particular, Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI participated in both cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD (currently a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor (formerly Thomson) participated only in the cartel for television tubes. Between 1996 and 2006, these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves, restricted their output and exchanged commercial sensitive information.

As Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia stated: "These cartels for cathode ray tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe. Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 to 70% of the
price of a screen. This gives an indication of the serious harm this illegal behaviour has caused both to television and computer screen producers in the EEA, and ultimately the harm it caused to the European consumers over the years".

Chunghwa received full immunity from  fines as it was the first to reveal their existence of cartels to the Commission and the other companies received reductions of their  fines for cooperating in the investigation.

The cartels operated worldwide and the companies were well aware they were breaking the law. They used to arrange meetings in order to discuss the demand, production, sales and capacity in the main sales areas, as well as the prices thus, trying to address the decline of the CRT market regardless damaging consumers.

The European Commission (EC) has fined several firms including Samsung, Panasonic, Philips and LG
€1.47bn for fixing  the prices of cathode ray tubes (CRTs).

The EC levied the  fines against most of the biggest names in the CRT business for participating in one or two cartels between 1996 and 2006.

TD
The EC's €1.47bn  fine was handed down after it said the firms had "fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output" of CRT units, with the commission claiming that the cartels were "among the most organised cartels" it has investigated.

With Taiwanese hardware manufacturer Chunghwa blowing the whistle and escaping the  fine, it was left to the others to carry the can, though other firms involved got partial reductions. LG Electronics and Philips came out the worst, both getting hit with two  fines with LG getting one for €295m and Philips
€313m, while the two received a separate joint  fine of €391m.

Samsung and Panasonic got hit with €150m and €157m respectively, while two other Panasonic joint ventures were hit with €86m and €7m  fines. Toshiba and Technicolor received the smallest  fines, €38m and €28m respectively.
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," said
Joaquín Almunia, the Commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 to 70 [percent] of the price of a screen. This gives an indication of the serious harm this illegal behaviour has caused both to  television and computer screen producers in the EEA
[European Economic Area], and ultimately the harm it caused to the European consumers over the years."

The EC finally managed to bring to book a number of CRT manufacturers for price  fixing  more than five years after the offences, by which time CRTs have been largely superceded.

LONDON (CNNMoney) -- Six companies who fixed the markets for  television and computer screen
tubes over a 10-year period have been hit with a record  fine of 1.47 billion euros.

The European Commission said the companies were fully aware that their attempts to fix prices, share markets and coordinate production of cathode ray  tubes between 1996 and 2006 were illegal.

TD
Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI, Panasonic, Technicolor (formerly Thomson of France), Toshiba and Taiwan's Chungwha were all guilty of operating "textbook cartels," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"They feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," Almunia said.
Dutch-based Philips was hit with the biggest individual  fine of 313.4 million euros, while South Korea's
LG Electronics received a penalty of 295.6 million. Philips and LG were also jointly liable for a  fine worth
392 million euros.
Chungwa escaped punishment because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

Cathode-ray tubes have largely been replaced by liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma technology and light-emitting diodes (LED). But they used to account for up to 70% of the price of a screen.

The commission said the  cartel was trying to limit the impact of the decline in the industry at the expense of consumers.
It also published details showing the sophistication of the  cartel's operations.

Top managers from the firms would set the high-level framework at "green meetings" -- so called because they were often followed by a game of golf -- while detailed implementation would be agreed upon by junior executives who sometimes met as often as every week in Asia and Europe.

Plant visits would be carried out to ensure compliance with agreed limits on capacity, and some papers discovered during the anti-trust investigation carried the instructions: "Please dispose of the following document after reading it."

The previous record for a European anti-trust  fine was 1.38 billion euros, imposed by the  European       Commission on a car glass cartel in 2008.

BRUSSELS - The European Union on Wednesday imposed its biggest ever cartel fine of almost
€1.47 billion ($1.96 billion) on seven companies for  fixing  the market of television and computer
monitor tubes.

The EU's Commission ruled that, for a decade ending in 2006, the companies - including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic - artificially set prices, shared markets and restricted their output at the expense of the consumer.

TD
EU antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that the companies' actions "feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Tubes were the essential part of television screens and computer monitors before they were replaced by flatscreens. The cathode ray tubes accounted for up to 70 per cent of the cost of a screen, the Commission said.

Alumina added that the  tubes' cost gave "an indication of the serious harm" the companies had caused.

Philips and LG Electronics, which acted jointly and separately, were fined a combined €999 million ($1.3 billion) with Panasonic punished with a €157 million ($205 million) fine, adding to more if combined fines and affiliates were included.

Other companies  fined were Samsung SDI, Technicolor, MTPD and Toshiba. Chunghwa of Taiwan escaped fines as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the EU.
"It is the biggest  fine for a cartel, ever," Almunia said. The  fine exceeded the previous record of the
2008 fine of €1.38 billion ($1.8 billion) in a car glass  cartel.

Almunia said the  tubes cartel operated worldwide with the companies involved fully realizing they acted illegally.

One document seized by the Commission had a warning "Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission".
Another documents said "Please dispose the following document after reading it".

EU anti-trust regulators have  fined six major electronics firms a record total penalty of 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion). The companies were deemed to have fixed prices for  TV and monitor tubes for nearly a decade.

The largest  fine, totaling 313 million euros ($409 million), was slapped on Dutch electronics firm Philips, the European Union's executive Commission said Wednesday, ahead of a 295-million-euro penalty imposed on LG Electronics, and 157 million for Panasonic.

The other electronics giants involved in the international price  fixing  were Samsung, Toshiba and
Technicolor.

According to EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, the firms fixed global prices for so-called cathode ray tubes. These tubes used to be key components of  television screens and computer monitors until flatscreens have started to replace them in recent years.
The six companies formed altogether two cartels, one involving  TV sets and the other  computer
monitors, and had been operating on a global scale between 1996 and 2006.

"These cartels feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," Almunia said in a statement, adding that the violations were especially harmful to consumers as the  tubes accounted for up to 70 percent of screen prices.

Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes finally blew the whistle on the cartels and escaped being punished, the  EU Commission said.
Before Wednesday's ruling, the biggest fine imposed for anti-trust violations by the EU amounted to
1.38 billion euros slapped on a car glass cartel in 2008.

BRUSSELS--Global electronics giants Philips Electronics NV (PHIA.AE), Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. (006400.SE) and Panasonic Corp. (PC) were among seven companies fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by European regulators Wednesday for operating price-fixing  cartels in TV and computer parts.

The firms were found guilty of involvement in one or two separate cartels set up to fix the market for cathode ray tubes, the main component in color  television and computer screens but now largely defunct as a result of the advent of plasma and LCD screens.

The fine is the highest ever that the  European Commission has handed down for forming cartels. The cartels began in 1996 and ended 10 years later. The EU and other antitrust regulators have been investigating the issue for the past three years.

"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," said Joaquin Almunia, the European Union's antitrust chief.

Regulators said the firms conspired in a gamut of harmful practices, from price  fixing  to coordinating capacity and output of their products. At their peak, cathode ray  tubes accounted for up to 70% of the price of a TV or computer screen.

Dutch electronics firm Philips received the highest fine, EUR313 million, for participating in its own right in both the  TV- and computer-monitor tube cartel, and EUR392 million shared with LG Electronics for a joint venture. LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE) must pay EUR296 million for collusion in its own right, and Samsung SDI EUR151 million. The two South Korean firms were also found
guilty of joining both cartels.

Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said in a statement he regretted "any association with this type of behavior."
"Our ethical standards. are very clear and must be strictly adhered to," he said.

Nevertheless, the  fine, which relates to a business divested in 2001, was "disproportionate and unjustified," he said.

Panasonic said the  European Commission's decision was "factually and legally erroneous," and it would "carefully review the decision and consider our options for appeal to the European courts."

LG Electronics said it would provide a statement once the company has reviewed the  European       Commission's decision in detail.


Page 62 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A spokesman for Samsung SDI said it would reserve comment until confirming details of the decision with European regulators.
Panasonic, Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), MTPD--a Panasonic subsidiary--and Technicolor
(TCH.FR)--formerly Thomson--participated in the  cartel for television tubes. Panasonic and Toshiba
were fined EUR157 million and EUR28 million respectively. MTPD will pay part of a EUR95 million
fine, shared with Panasonic and Toshiba. Spokespeople from Panasonic and Toshiba weren't
immediately available for comment. Technicolor said in a statement on its website that Thomson sold
its cathode ray tube business in 2005.

Because it revealed the  cartel's existence, whistleblower Chunghwa of Taiwan received full immunity from a fine that otherwise would have been EUR17 million. Philips and Samsung received reductions of their fines for cooperating in the probe.

The commission said the two cartels were among the "most organized" it had investigated, and said the firms had been well aware that they were breaking the law.

Mr. Almunia said senior executives referred to their gatherings in Europe and Asia as "green meetings," because they were regularly followed by a golf game. The deals cut during those encounters were then implemented during more regular, lower-level "glass meetings", which Mr. Almunia described as the "engine room of the  cartel," held in a string of locations ranging from Paris to Hong Kong.

In one document uncovered during the probe, one  cartel member boasted that "because of the success of the glass meeting, everybody has been enjoying business this year." Another urged other members to "keep it a secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers and  European Commission."

Demand for cathode  tubes was booming at the start of the  cartel, while in 2003, when the technology was replaced by LCD,  cartel members were trying to manage the decline in the market, Mr. Almunia told reporters, adding that the firms may even have "artificially slowed" the transition to plasma.

In setting the  fines, the commission said it took into account the companies' sales as well as the geographic scope, severity and duration of the  cartel.

Other regulators around the globe, including in the U.S., are also still investigating the cartels and have yet to make their decisions.

BRUSSELS--Global electronics giants Philips Electronics NV (), Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. (006400.SE) and Panasonic Corp. (PC) were among seven companies fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by European regulators Wednesday for operating price-fixing  cartels in TV and computer parts.

TD
The firms were found guilty of involvement in one or two separate cartels set up to fix the market for cathode ray tubes, the main component in color  television and computer screens but now largely defunct as a result of the advent of plasma and LCD screens.

The fine is the highest ever that the  European Commission has handed down for forming cartels. The cartels began in 1996 and ended 10 years later. The EU and other antitrust regulators have been investigating the issue for the past three years.

"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are "textbook cartels': They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," said Joaquin Almunia, the European Union's antitrust chief.

Regulators said the firms conspired in a gamut of harmful practices, from price  fixing  to coordinating capacity and output of their products. At their peak, cathode ray  tubes accounted for up to 70% of the price of a TV or computer screen.

Dutch electronics firm Philips received the highest  fine, EUR313 million, for participating in its own right in both the  TV- and computer-monitor tube  cartel, and EUR392 million shared with LG Electronics for a joint venture. LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE) must pay EUR296 million for collusion in its own right,
and Samsung SDI EUR151 million. The two South Korean firms were also found guilty of joining both cartels.

Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said in a statement he regretted "any association with this type of behavior."
"Our ethical standards. are very clear and must be strictly adhered to," he said.

Nevertheless, the  fine, which relates to a business divested in 2001, was "disproportionate and unjustified," he said.

Panasonic said the  European Commission's decision was "factually and legally erroneous," and it would "carefully review the decision and consider our options for appeal to the European courts."

LG Electronics said it would provide a statement once the company has reviewed the  European            Commission's decision in detail.

A spokesman for Samsung SDI said it would reserve comment until confirming details of the decision with European regulators.

A group of the world’s leading electronics manufacturers have been fined almost €1.5 billion (£1.21 billion) for rigging the market for components used in televisions and computer monitors.

LG, Samsung, Philips, Panasonic and Toshiba were among seven companies hit with penalties of up to €314 million each by Europe’s top antitrust watchdog for operating a decade-long  cartel that distorted markets and harmed consumers.

TD
Collectively the penalty is the biggest the  European Commission has imposed in a cartel case.

The enforcement action could leave the electronics giants facing the threat of follow-on legal action by groups of consumers who were overcharged as a result of the collusion.

The Commission said there were two cartels, one relating to the sale of colour picture  tubes used in televisions and the other to  computer monitors, which together were among the most organised the competition regulator has ever investigated.

“For almost ten years, the cartelists carried out the most harmful anti-competitive practices including price fixing,  market sharing, customer allocation, capacity and output co-ordination and exchanges of commercially sensitive information," the Commission said.
Executives from the companies conspired to rig the markets at clandestine meetings nicknamed
“green meetings" because they were often followed by a round of golf, the regulator said.

The exact implementation of the anti-competitive schemes were left to their lieutenants to work out at other meetings in cities such as Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Paris and Rome.
The cartels operated worldwide, the Commission said.

The companies were aware they were breaking the law, as revealed in one document uncovered by the investigation that warned: “Everybody is requested to keep it secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or the  European Commission."

Another document discovered by the Commission came with an instruction to “Please dispose the following document after reading it".

The biggest  fines were against Philips and LG, which were involved in both cartels. They received penalties of €313.4 million and €295.6 million respectively.
Samsung, which was also involved in both cartels, was  fined €150.8 million.

Panasonic and Toshiba, which only participated in the  television tubes cartel, were hit with penalties of €157.5 million and €28 million respectively.
Other companies received smaller  fines, bringing the grand total to €1,470,515.

Page 75 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Chunghwa, a Taiwanese manufacturer, received immunity because it blew the whistle on the price
fixing.  It otherwise would have received  fines of close to €17 million, the Commission said.
The Commission’s investigation began with a series of raids in November 2007.

Joaquin Almunia, Europe’s Competition Commissioner, said: “These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are textbook cartels. They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe.

“Cathode ray tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 to 70 per cent of the price of a screen. This gives an indication of the serious harm this illegal behaviour has caused both to  television and computer screen producers in the EEA, and ultimately the harm it caused to the European consumers over the years."

THE HAGUE, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- Dutch electronics company Philips will appeal against a
313-million-euro (410 million U.S. dollars)  fine they received from the  European Commission, the
company announced on Wednesday.

In total, the Commission  fined seven companies such as Philips, LG Electronics and Samsung a record 1.47 billion euros on Wednesday for  fixing  prices of TV cathode-ray tubes in two cartels for a period of almost ten years.

TD
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels.' They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Philips said the  fine was "disproportional and injust." "We regret to be associated with this kind of behavior," spokesperson Joost Akkermans told Xinhua.

BRUSSELS, Dec. 5 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's LG Electronics and Samsung SDI are among the companies fined a record total of 1.47 billion euros (US$1.9 billion) by the European Union antitrust regulator over price-rigging of  television cathode ray tubes, the authorities said Wednesday.

The watchdog imposed the biggest penalty on Dutch-based Philips with 313.4 million euros.

The firms illegally "fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output" from 1996 until 2006 in the markets for  television and computer cathode ray tubes, the commission said in a statement.
The tubes accounted for 50-70 percent of the price of screens.

Brussels, Dec. 5 (Jiji Press)--The  European Commission said Wednesday that it has finedPanasonic Corp. <6752>, Toshiba Corp. <6502> and four other major electronics makers for fixing  prices on television and computer monitor tubes.

The fines on the companies totaled 1.47 billion euros, a record for any  cartel case handled by the executive arm of the European Union.

TD
The fines include 157 million euros on Panasonic and 28 million euros on Toshiba, both Japanese manufacturers.
The four others are South Korean makers LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung SDI Co. and Royal
Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and France's Technicolor.

In addition, Panasonic, Toshiba and MT Picture Display Co. were together  fined 95 million euros. MT Picture was once a joint venture between Panasonic and Toshiba before Panasonic took full control of it.
Taiwan's Chunghwa Picture Tube Ltd. was also involved in the price-fixing  but exempted from a
fine because it was the first to notify the commission of the cartels.

The commission said the firms fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output between 1996 and 2006.

SEOUL--South Korean consumer-electronics maker LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE) said Thursday it will appeal the European Commission's decision to  fine the company for its alleged participation in price-fixing  cartels in television and computer parts.

TD
LG Electronics was among seven companies that were fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by European regulators Wednesday for operating price-fixing  cartels for cathode ray  tubes, the main component in color TV and computer screens before the advent of plasma and liquid crystal display screens.

The South Korean company said in a press release the  European Commission had fined it a total 492 million euros for allegedly infringing European competition law relating to the sale of the parts starting in the late 1990s and lasting until 2006.
It added it disagrees with the  fine, which comprises a 296 million euro penalty on LG alone and a further
392 million euro fine that the South Korean company must share with Philips Electronics NV for a 50-50
joint venture the two companies set up in 2001 called LG Philips Displays.

"Other leading competition authorities, including the Korean Fair Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Canadian Competition Bureau have investigated the same facts and concluded that LG Electronics should not be held liable for the conduct of LG Philips Displays," John Kwon, executive vice president of LG Electronics, said in the release.

He added the company can't understand why the  European Commission has taken a wholly different approach compared with other authorities.

The European Commission also fined South Korean display maker Samsung SDI Co. (006400.SE). A spokesman for the company said Thursday Samsung SDI has yet to decide on whether to appeal the European Commission's decision.

THE European Union has imposed its biggest ever cartel fine of €1.5bn (£1.2bn) on seven companies caught rigging the market for the cathode–ray tubes used to make television and computer
monitors.

Between 1996 and 2006, the companies – including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic – were found to have artifi–cially fixed prices, shared markets and restricted their output at the expense of the consumer.

TD
"It is the biggest  fine for a cartel, ever," said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner and vice–president of the European Commission.

Mr Almunia described the case as featuring "all the worst kinds of anti–competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden" under EU law.
Philips and LG Electronics, which acted jointly and separately, were  fined a combined €999m, while
Panasonic was punished with a €157m  fine.

Samsung SDI, Technicolor, MTPD and Toshiba were also  fined, but Chunghwa of Taiwan escaped fines, as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the authorities. The total penalties for the  cartel exceeded the previous record  fine of €1.38bn levied in a car glass market–fixing  case, four years ago. Commission investigators found that the  cartel operated worldwide, with all the companies involved fully aware that they were acting illegally.

One document seized by officials during a raid carried a warning that revealed the deliberate wrongdoing. "Everybody is requested to keep it a secret, as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or European Commission," said the document.

Top management–level meetings were dubbed "green meetings" by the  cartel companies because they were often followed by a golf game.

Preparation and implementation of the  cartel was carried out at lower–level meetings, often referred to as "glass meetings", on a quarterly, monthly or sometimes even weekly basis.
A statement from Philips said the company intended to appeal against the decision and insisted it had
"fully co–operated" with the investigation.

LP
The European Commission imposed a record fine on Samsung, Panasonic, Philips, LG Electronics, Toshiba and Technicolor worth 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) for running two cartels for nearly a decade. According to the  European Commission, executives from the above mentioned companies met until six years ago to fix prices and divide up markets for  TV and computer monitor cathode-ray  tubes. "These cartels for cathode-ray  tubes are `textbook cartels`: they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe", EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. The Dutch-based firm Philips received the biggest penalty. It was fined 313.4 million euros and faces a further penalty through a joint venture due to its role in the price fixing  and dividing up the markets.

TD
The South Korean firm LG Electronics was  fined 295.6 million euros and must pay its share of a joint venture penalty, while the Japanese firm Panasonic was  fined 157.5 million euros. Meanwhile the South Korean firm Samsung SDI was  fined 150.8 million euros, the Japanese firm Toshiba Corp. was  fined 28 million euros while the French company Technicolor was  fined 38.6 million euros. Joaquin Almunia also said that these violations were mainly harmful for consumers, as cathode-ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens, accounting for 50%-70% of the price of a screen. This technology however is out of date for flat screens that now use more advanced display technologies like the liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes. Although the  fine is significant, it was expected. The Commission`s biggest antitrust penalty until now was of 1.38 billion euros imposed on participants in a car glass  cartel in 2008.

Brussels acts over cathode tube market
LG, Samsung SDI and Philips involved

TD
Philips, LG Electronics and Samsung SDI were hit with a record €1.47bn  fine from Europe's top competition enforcer yesterday after participating in "textbook cartels" for almost a decade.
Seven electronics groups were punished for two conspiracies to rig prices and supply of cathode ray
tubes.

European Commission investigators found that managers at "greens meetings" plotted to carve up markets and overcharge consumers often before playing golf at clubs in Singapore, Korea and Japan. One included the Palm Garden golf club in Malaysia.

Staff then developed the details of the arrangements at sometimes weekly "glass meetings" - named after the material covering the  tubes - where information was shared and prices set, sometimes for individual TV and computer manufacturers.

The combined €1.5bn penalty for the two cartels is the biggest  fine imposed by the European               Commission in a single decision and exceeds the €1.4bn levied on a  cartel on glass for car windows.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition chief, said the two conspiracies featured the "worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour" that caused "serious harm" to  TV and computer makers.
The price-fixing,  market-sharing and customer allocation became almost routine between 1996 and
2006.

While the collusion began at the peak of the market for cathode  tubes, it became a way to mitigate the drop-off in sales as customers moved to slim display screens using plasma or liquid crystal.

In one document seized by investigators, a  cartel member describes setting a goal to "control supply and maintain a proper price to survive". Another asks for the arrangements to be kept "secret". "Please dispose the following document after reading it," it said.
Mr Almunia said the high  fine reflected the long duration of the cartels and the breadth of co-ordination. Chunghwa of Taiwan won immunity for alerting authorities to the wrongdoing. LG Electronics, Philips
and Samsung SDI, an arm of the Korean conglomerate, participated in both cartels. Panasonic,
Toshiba, MTPD (now a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor only colluded on  TV parts.
Philips faces the biggest penalty of €450m. It said it would appeal.

News | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Executives from some of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers met in Europe and Asia to illegally fix the price of televisions and computers for a decade, the  European Commission (EC) ruled yesterday.

TD
Handing out £1.1bn  fines to Philips, Panasonic, Samsung and four other firms, Brussels ruled that between 1996 and 2006 they held back supply of cathode ray  tubes, then the key component in television sets and computer monitors.

Because the  tubes made up between 50 and 70 per cent of the retail price, consumers paid an "over price" for TVs and computers. The scam was "among the most organised cartels that the Commission has investigated", the EC said.

The cartelists' "anti-competitive practices" included price  fixing,  market sharing, customer allocation and exchanging commercially-sensitive information.
Philips said it would challenge what it called a disproportionate and unjustified penalty.

Executives from some of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers met in Europe and Asia to illegally fix the price of televisions and computers for a decade, the  European Commission (EC) ruled yesterday.

TD
Handing out huge  fines to Philips, Panasonic, Samsung and four other firms, Brussels ruled that between 1996 and 2006 they held back supply of cathode ray  tubes, then the key component in  TV sets and computer monitors.

Because the  tubes made up between 50 and 70 per cent of the retail price, consumers consequently paid an "over price" for TVs and computers. The scam was "among the most organised cartels that the Commission has investigated", the EC said.

The cartelists' "anti-competitive practices" included price  fixing,  market sharing, customer allocation and exchanging commercially-sensitive information.

Staff were told to destroy incriminating documents. Executives would agree the frauds at "green" meetings - so-called because afterwards they would play golf.

"For almost 10 years… these companies fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves and restricted their output," said the EC, which  fined the seven a total of €1.4bn (£1.1bn).

Some of the best-known names in electronics - Philips, Samsung SDI, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD, Technicolor and Chunghwa Picture  Tubes - ran different cartels for  television tubes and computer tubes.
Philips said it would challenge what it called a disproportionate and unjustified penalty. Panasonic and
Toshiba are also considering legal challenges. Samsung reserved its comment.

HD       E.U.’s heftiest  price-fixing fine levied on picture-tube cartel; 7 technology groups  in Europe and
Asia are penalized €1.5 billion

The conspirators called them ‘‘greens meetings,’’ because they took place on golf courses.
Senior managers at some of the world’s largest electronics companies often used those meetings,
mostly in Asia, to fix the price of picture and display  tubes for televisions and  computer screens, the top
European antitrust regulator said Wednesday.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, said he would levy  fines totaling almost €1.5
billion, or $1.96 billion, on seven companies involved in the two cartels, which operated for a decade until
2006. Combined, the  fines amount to the largest single penalty for price  fixing  ever imposed by the
commission.

The action follows a spate of similar cases in the glass and display sectors, where bulky cathode ray tubes have been supplanted by technologies like liquid crystal display and plasma that allow manufacturers to build far more compact monitors and screens.

Mr. Almunia imposed the strongest penalties on Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and LG Electronics of South Korea.

Mr. Almunia said at a news conference that the  cartel activity began in the late 1990s, when the market was still strong for cathode ray  tubes, and lasted until 2006 even as that market declined, allowing the conspirators to continue generating strong returns for a technology that was rapidly becoming outmoded.

‘‘The companies were trying to manage through collusion the decline in the market for these kinds of tubes,’’ Mr. Almunia said. ‘‘The undue profits that the companies derived from the collusion may even have artificially slowed down the transition to the more modern products like LCD and plasma displays.’’

Excerpts of minutes from meetings held by the  cartel members obtained during the investigation showed the efforts they made to stem the tide of the newer products, according to commission officials.

‘‘Producers need to avoid price competition through controlling their production capacity (of flat types in particular),’’ one excerpt read. Another noted that ‘‘mutual cooperation is required to deal with an expected economic downturn’’ in the second half of 2002.

In addition to the ‘‘greens meetings,’’ there were ‘‘glass meetings’’ for lower-level managers, the name probably related to the glass structure of the cathode ray  tubes, officials said. They were held in Asia and in European cities including Glasgow, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and Budapest, commission officials said.

The cartels ‘‘feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe,’’ Mr. Almunia said. There had been ‘‘serious harm’’ to producers in Europe and to consumers, he said, since the cathode ray  tubes had accounted for up to 70 percent of the price of screens.

The commission’s antitrust division can  fine offenders up to 10 percent of their annual worldwide sales, and the fine on Wednesday exceeded the previous record of almost €1.4 billion, which was imposed in
2008, for a car-glass  cartel.

But unlike regulators in the United States, the commission has no criminal enforcement powers and cannot prosecute or seek to jail participants for anti-competitive offenses. Many lawyers say that remains a shortcoming of the European system.

‘‘There is a deterrent effect as these  fines get higher, but there are always going to be some companies with wayward commercial personnel and some companies where some people say, ‘Let’s take the risk as might be worth it in the long run,’’’ said Caroline Hobson, a competition law partner at CMS Cameron McKenna in London. ‘‘An even greater enforcement power is the power to jail offenders because that really makes people wake up.’’
She said she did not represent any of the companies involved in the case.

The sanctions announced Wednesday were the latest imposed by the commission on activity in the sector. It levied a fine of €128.7 million last year against four producers of the glass that is used in cathode ray tubes, and in 2010 fined members of a cartel that fixed prices on flat-panel displays based on LCD technology €649 million. One of the companies involved in that case, Chunghwa from Taiwan, reported the picture  tubes case to the commission. As a result, Chunghwa received full immunity from fines.

On Wednesday, the commission  fined Philips the largest amount, €313.4 million. LG Electronics was fined €295.6 million. Philips and LG also were also part of a joint venture that received an additional  fine of €391.9 million for which both companies were liable.

In a statement, Philips said it would appeal the  fines to the General Court of the European Union, the bloc’s second-highest tribunal. Philips described the  fine relating to its involvement in the joint venture as
‘‘disproportionate and unjustified.’’ Philips said it had divested that business in 2001.
LG did not respond to an e-mail request for comment.
The commission also finedPanasonic €157.5 million, Samsung €150.8 million, Toshiba €28 million and
Technicolor €38.6 million.

The commission said the cartels operated for a decade, beginning around 1996, and had engaged in the most organized market manipulation it had ever investigated. The conspiracies included price  fixing, market sharing, customer allocation and exchanges of sensitive commercial information.
During his news conference, Mr. Almunia read from one of the documents obtained by the commission
to show that  cartel members were aware they were breaking the law. ‘‘Everybody is requested to keep it
a secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or to the  European Commission,’’ the
document said.

Royal Philips Electronics and LG Electronics are among companies  fined a record €1.47bn by EU anti-trust regulators over price-fixing  agreements of now-obsolete cathode-ray  tubes used in televisions and computer monitors.
Philips was fined €313.4m while LG faces a €295.6m penalty, said the  European Commission
yesterday.

TD
Philips and LG also share a  fine of €391.9m for a unit they jointly owned.
Panasonic was fined €157.5m and shares an €86.7m punishment with Toshiba and MTPD, a
Panasonic unit. Panasonic and MTPD also share a €7.9m  fine.

Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner, explained in a statement: "Cathode-ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for
50 to 70% of the price of a screen."

Sales of cathode-ray  tubes fell after customers switched to slimmer liquid- crystal and plasma display sets. Philips and Technicolor, previously Thomson SA, received objections in the EU probe in 2009. Antitrust watchdogs in the EU, Japan, and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns they colluded to fix prices.

Joost Akkermans, spokes- man for Philips, said the  fine was "disproportionate and unjustified" and related to a unit it divested in 2001. Philips will appeal the EU decision, he said.

Samsung SDI Co Ltd, was also told to pay €150.8m. Toshiba was separately  fined €28m and Technicolor SA was  fined €38.6m. Chunghwa Picture  Tubes Ltd was not punished as it was the first to inform regulators of the  cartel.

Top management meetings between the companies to fix prices were often followed by a golf game, the EU said in statement. The firms fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between them and restricted their own output in two worldwide cartels between 1996 and 2006.

Samsung SDI, Philips and Technicolor received reductions to their  fines for co-operating with the probe, the EU said.

HD           Cartel Fixed Prices for Displays

They met on golf courses across Europe and Asia. Executives from Philips Electronics NV, Panasonic Corp. and five other global electronics companies hatched plans on the links to manipulate prices of television and computer tubes in cartels described by European regulators as among the most organized they had investigated.

A decade of market manipulation in a now-outdated technology -- cathode-ray  tubes for televisions and desktop computers -- drew  fines totaling 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion).

TD
The fines, the highest ever handed down in a case by the  European Commission, were the culmination of a three-year probe made in cooperation with other regulators. The market manipulation began in 1996 and ended 10 years later, the European Union said. The EU's previous biggest  fine in a cartel case was 1.38 billion euros, levied in 2008 regarding automobile glass.

The EU said regulators around the globe, including in the U.S., still are investigating the display cartels. The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on the EU action but confirmed the U.S.
investigation is still open.

Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said he regretted "any association" with such behavior. He said the fine, which related to a business sold in 2001, was "disproportionate and unjustified."

Panasonic said the commission's decision was "factually and legally erroneous" and the company would consider its options for appeal to European courts.

The European Commission, which is the EU's enforcement arm, said the  TV- and computer-tube cartels conspired to fix prices and coordinated capacity and production of their products. At their peak, cathode-ray tubes accounted for up to 70% of the price of a  TV set.

"These cartels for cathode-ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels,'" said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief. "They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior."

Mr. Almunia said senior executives in the companies referred to their gatherings in Europe and Asia as "green meetings," because they were regularly followed by rounds of golf. The commission was unable to provide more detail on the golf courses but said most of the play took place in Asia, including in Japan and Indonesia.

The deals cut during those encounters were then implemented during more regular, "glass meetings," which Mr. Almunia described as the "engine room of the  cartel," held in cities such as Paris and Hong Kong.

A cartel member boasted that "because of the success of the glass meeting, everybody has been enjoying business this year," according to a document uncovered in the investigation. Another document urged other members to "keep it a secret, as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers and European Commission."
Mr. Almunia said there was "a sophisticated system of monitoring each  cartel participants' behavior."

Page 98 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Demand for cathode-ray  tubes was booming at the start of the  cartel. In 2003, when the technology was replaced by liquid-crystal displays,  cartel members tried to manage the decline, Mr. Almunia told reporters. He said the companies may have "artificially slowed" the transition to plasma displays.
In 2010, the EU  fined six makers of LCD screens 649 million euros for allegedly operating their own
cartel over five years.

Netherlands-based Philips received the highest  fine in the latest case, 313 million euros, for participating in cartels for  TV and computer-monitor tubes. It was ordered to split a 392 million euro fine with LG Electronics Inc. for a joint venture. LG also was ordered to pay 296 million euros for collusion in its own right. Samsung SDI Co. was ordered to pay 151 million euros. The two South Korean companies were found to have participated in both cartels.
LG said it disagrees with the calculation of the  fine and intends to appeal. A spokesman for Samsung
SDI said it hasn't decided whether to appeal.

The commission found that Toshiba Corp., Panasonic and its MTPD subsidiary, and Technicolor SA, formerly Thomson, participated in the  cartel for TV tubes. Panasonic and Toshiba, both of Japan,
were fined 157 million euros and 28 million euros, respectively. MTPD was ordered to pay part of a 95 million euro fine, shared with Panasonic and Toshiba.

France's Technicolor said Thomson sold its cathode-ray tube business in 2005 and the company would record a provision for the  fine. Toshiba didn't immediately comment.

Because it revealed the  cartel's existence, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Picture  Tubes Ltd. received immunity from a  fine that otherwise would have been 17 million, the commission said. Philips and Samsung received reductions in their  fines for cooperating in the investigation. Chunghwa Picture Tubes declined to comment.
"This decision is not the end of the matter," said Caroline Hobson, an antitrust partner for
London-based law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, who wasn't involved in the case. "Customers of the
companies involved will be looking closely at the decision and may result in a number of sizable
damages actions."

The commission said it set the  fines by taking into account the companies' sales and geographic scope, and the severity and duration of the  cartel.

Tokyo, Dec. 6 (Jiji Press)--Panasonic Corp. and Toshiba Corp. announced their readiness Thursday to challenge the European Union's decision to  fine the Japanese electronics makers for  fixing  prices of cathode-ray  tubes for television sets.

Panasonic said in a statement that there is a question in the EU's finding and the application of its antitrust law. The company will consider its response by keeping in mind an option to bring this case to a European court, it said.

TD
Toshiba said in a separate statement that it has not violated the law and plans to file a petition with a court in Europe.

The European Commission, the executive organ of the EU, on Wednesday announced its decision to impose Panasonic, Toshiba and companies from Europe and South Korea a total of 1.47 billion euros in fines for fixing  CRT prices between 1996 and 2006 in violation of the antitrust law.

The amount of  fine came to 157 million euros for Panasonic, 28 million euros for Toshiba and 95 million euros for a Panasonic subsidiary that was initially set up as a joint venture between the two Japanese firms.

The European Commission has slapped six companies, including LG Electronics and Samsung SDI, with fines of over two trillion won for allegedly  fixing  prices of TV and computer monitor cathode-ray tubes. The fine is nearly two billion U.S. dollars.

The EU antitrust regulator said Wednesday that the six companies illegally controlled cathode-ray tubes markets between 1996 and 2006 and fixed prices and divided up customers for  TV and computer monitor cathode-ray  tubes.

TD
The commission slapped the biggest  fine of 313-million euros on Philips for its role in the price  fixing and carving up of markets. LG Electronics was  fined roughly 296-million euros and Samsung SDI around 151-million euros.

LG Electronics and Samsung SDI said Thursday that they will appeal heavy  cartel fines imposed by the European Union antitrust regulators for alleged price-rigging on now-obsolete cathode ray tubes (CRT).

TD
Early Thursday (KST), the  European Commission (EC) levied a record-breaking 1.47 billion euro ($1.92 billion) fine on six companies including Samsung and LG, and Toshiba of Japan for colluding to fix prices in two global cartels between 1996 and 2006.

LG Electronics must pay a 295 million euro  fine in addition to a 195 million euro  fine levied on the firm over claims that LG Philips Display (LPD), a CRT unit it once jointly owned, was also involved in the cartel. Samsung SDI must pay 81.4 million euro.

``These cartels for CRTs are textbook cartels. They feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe,’’ said competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, adding the price-fixing  scheme harmed European consumers.
In a statement following the EC’s announcement, LG said it will take the case to court before the
February 2013 deadline in an appeal, although the schedule has yet to be decided.
The company pointed out that the EC decision, which ordered it to pay a share of the
now-dissolved joint venture between LG and Philips penalty, doesn’t make any sense as LG
Electronics had divested itself of CRT activities by transferring them to LPD in July 2001.

``LPD had been operated as a totally independent company. It’s true that LG Electronics had previously owned a 50 percent stake in that joint venture. But LG Electronics has no legal responsibility for the penalty. LPD was not consolidated in LG Electronics’ accounts,’’ said spokesman Yoon Won-il. LPD went bankrupt in 2006.

``We have no responsibility to pay any penalties for alleged price-fixing  cartels concerning our CRT activities before the establishment of LPD because the reason is simple _ under EU competition law, companies have no legal responsibility to pay anything if the investigation is conducted five years after such activities ceased,’’ said Yoon.
The EU started its investigation of the six companies for price-fixing  in 2007.

According to LG, the world’s second-biggest  TV producer, anti-trust watchdogs in Korea, Japan, Canada, the United States and the Czech Republic cleared the company of being involved in a price-fixing cartel and decided not to impose  fines.

Samsung SDI said that it will also protest the EU decision. ``SDI will appeal and implement further legal measures if needed,’’ said spokesman Seo Hae-su.

zz Philips, LG among firms penalised e1.47bn for price  fixing

ROYAL Philips Electronics and LG Electronics are among companies that have been  fined a record e1.47 billion (R16.8bn) by EU antitrust regulators over price-fixing  agreements for now-obsolete cathode ray tubes used in television and computer monitors.

TD
Philips had been  fined e313.4 million while LG faced a e295.6m penalty, the European Commission said in a statement yesterday. The companies also shared a fine of e391.9m for a unit they jointly owned.
Panasonic was fined e157.5m and shared an e86.7m punishment with Toshiba and MTPD, a
Panasonic unit.

Philips spokesman Joost Akkermans said the  fine was "disproportionate and unjustified" and related to a unit it divested in 2001. Philips would appeal the EU decision, he said.

"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 percent to 70 percent of the price of a screen," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Sales of cathode ray  tubes used in television and computer monitors declined after customers switched to liquid-crystal and plasma display sets.

Philips and Technicolor, previously known as Thomson, received objections in the EU probe in 2009. Antitrust watchdogs in the EU, Japan and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns they had colluded to fix prices.

Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics, was also told to pay e150.8m. Toshiba was separately fined e28m and Technicolor was  fined e38.6m.

Samsung SDI, Philips and Technicolor received reductions to their  fines for co-operating with the investigation.
Chunghwa Picture Tubes was not punished because it was the first to inform regulators of the  cartel. Top management meetings between the companies to fix prices were often followed by a game of
golf, the EU said in the statement. The firms fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers
between them and restricted their own output in two worldwide cartels between 1996 and 2006.

"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," Almunia said.

He said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for between 50 percent and 70 percent of the price of a screen.

Cathode ray tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display, plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes.

The biggest  fine prior to the cathode ray  tubes cartel was e1.38bn imposed on participants in a motor vehicle glass cartel in 2008.

The commission's sanctions followed a total  fine of e128.74m levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode ray  tubes.

Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Samsung Electronics, LG Display and three other liquid crystal display producers were fined a total e648m two years ago for taking part in a  cartel.

HD     'Textbook' CRT 'Cartels'  Slapped with Largest EU Antitrust Fines

The European Commission slapped seven producers of  TV and computer monitor tubes collectively with a 1.47 billion-euro ($1.9 billion)  fine for engaging in two decades of price-fixing,  it said Wednesday (http://xrl.us/bn4yhy). These were "textbook cartels" featuring "all the worst kinds" of anticompetitive behavior, said Competition Commissioner Joaqu&iacuten Almunia. Philips said it will appeal, while other makers didn't comment or couldn't be reached. A European consumer group said the case shows the need for class-action lawsuits.

TD
There were two distinct cartels, among the most organized the EC has investigated, it said. From
1996-2006, the companies set prices, shared markets, allocated customers among themselves and
restricted output, it said. One  cartel related to CRTs used for TVs, the other to CRTs for  computer
monitors. The collusive relationship operated worldwide, it said. The cartels have also been probed in
Korea and Japan, and the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating, Almunia said.

Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI took part in both cartels Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD (a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor (formerly Thomson) only in the one for TV tubes, the EC said. Chunghwa, the first to disclose the cartels' existence to the EC, received full immunity. Fines for others were reduced according to their level of cooperation, it said.
When the collusion began, demand for CRTs was booming, Almunia said at a press briefing. But from
2003, when CRTS were being increasingly replaced by flat-panel screens, the cartels' actions meant
consumers were paying more since CRTs account for 50-70 percent of a screen price, he said. The
companies were trying to address the decline of the CRT market collusively, he said. One document said
"producers need to avoid price competition through controlling their production capacity."  Cartel policies
were sometimes set by top managers during "green(s) meetings" on golf courses, and meetings were held
in Asia and Europe, he said. The antitrust probe showed that the companies knew they were breaking the
law. One document, which Almunia read out, said "everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would
be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission."

The collusion made victims not only of companies that bought the CRTs but also of consumers, Almunia said. Private damage actions are permitted, but individuals may not have the same opportunities to file them as larger players, he said. The EC would like to see private enforcement complementing its action, he said.

Philips was fined 313 million euros individually and another 392 million euros jointly with LG Electronics for antitrust violations by the now-defunct 50-50 joint venture, LG.Philips Displays, Philips said Wednesday. Philips divested its CRT business by transferring it to LG.Philips in 2001, it said. "We regret any association with this type of behavior," said CEO Frans van Houten. But the  fine, related to a business that was divested in 2001, "is disproportionate and unjustified," he said. The company will appeal, it said.

The record fine "is only half a solution," European Consumers' Organisation Director General Monique Goyens. Almunia is expected to say in coming weeks whether a collective redress measure will be introduced, she said. "Not one euro cent will be seen by the most important parties to this -- the victims themselves," she said. The  TV cartel "needs to be final proof" that a system for collective private damages claims is long overdue, she said. -- Dugie Standeford

TD
Brussels, 05/12/2012 (Agence Europe) - On 5 December, the  European Commission levied record fines of €1.47 billion - the highest yet - on seven international electronics companies for their decade-long involvement in one or two global cartels in cathode ray  tubes for colour televisions and  computer monitors.

From 1996 to 2006, Chunghwa, Samsung SDI, Philips, LG Electronics, Technicolor (ex-Thomson), Panasonic, Toshiba and MTPD (now a subsidiary of Panasonic) agreed on prices and the distribution of markets and customers and restrictions on their manufacture of cathode ray  tubes for televisions. The first four companies listed were involved in both cartels.

Top management level meetings, dubbed “green(s) meetings” by the cartelists themselves because they were often followed by a golf game, designed the orientations for the two cartels. Preparation and implementation were carried out through lower level meetings, often referred to as “glass meetings”, on a quarterly, monthly, sometimes even weekly basis in various locations in Asia and Europe. The cartels operated worldwide and enabled the companies to set and maintain high prices and protect the cathode ray tube TV market by slowing the transition to flat and LCD screens.

In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the companies' sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope, its implementation and its duration, fining the first cartel a total of €1.14 billion (TV tubes) and €3.28 billion in total for the second cartel (computer monitor tubes). Chunghwa was given full immunity for informing the Commission about the cartel, but Philips has to pay a total of €313 million for its involvement in both cartels, and a further fine of €392 million to be paid in combination with LG Electronics. Philips was granted a 30% reduction, and Samsung a 40% reduction of its €151 million  fine for their cooperation under the Commission's leniency programme. Technicolor was granted a 10% reduction on its €39 million  fine because of its inability to pay the  fine due to its poor financial health. The  cartel is also under investigation in South Korea, Japan and the United States. (FG/transl.fl)

Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI and three other firms were  fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by EU antitrust regulators for  fixing  prices of TV and monitor cathode-ray  tubes for nearly a decade.
The European Commission slapped the biggest penalty, of 313.4 million euros, on Dutch-based
Philips on Wednesday. LG Electronics came in second with a 295.6 million euro  fine.

The EU competition authority  finedPanasonic Corp 157.5 million euros, Samsung SDI 150.8 million euros, Toshiba Corp 28 million euros, and French firm Technicolor 38.6 million euros.

Two Panasonic joint ventures were also fined. Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture  Tubes blew the whistle on the cartels in  TV and computer monitors and escaped a  fine.

The two cartels operated worldwide between 1996 and 2006, during which company executives discussed how to fix prices and share markets at "green meetings", so-called because the events often ended with a round of golf.
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

He said the violations were harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for 50-70 per cent of the price of a screen.

HD     EU imposes  $1.9 billion cartel fine on screen producers including Philips,  LG, Panasonic

BRUSSELS (AP) - For years, some top managers at electronics multinationals would hold secretive meetings in Europe and Asia to fix the global market on the most expensive part of  television and computer monitors.

Then, said the European Union's antitrust chief, it was off to the golf course, where the executives would complete the "green(s) meetings" at which they set up a massive scam that affected millions of consumers.

TD
On Wednesday, EU antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he got back at them, slapping the biggest ever cartel fine -- over (EURO)1.47 billion ($1.96 billion) -- on seven companies for allegedly rigging the international market of  television and computer monitor tubes.

The EU's Commission ruled that, for a decade ending in 2006, the companies -- including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic -- artificially set prices, shared markets and restricted their output.

Almunia said the companies' actions "feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Tubes were the essential part of  television screens and computer monitors before they were replaced by LCD and plasma flatscreens. The cathode ray  tubes accounted for up to 70 percent of the cost of a screen, the Commission said.
Almunia added that the  tubes' cost gave "an indication of the serious harm" the companies had caused.
`'There are victims: millions and millions of citizens."

Philips and LG Electronics, which acted jointly and separately, were  fined a combined (EURO)999 million ($1.3 billion) with Panasonic punished with a (EURO)157 million ($205 million)  fine, adding to more if combined fines and affiliates were included.
Despite its cooperation with the Commission probe, Philips said in a statement it planned to appeal the
fine since it considered it `'disproportionate and unjust."

"We regret that we are linked to this kind of behavior," said Philips CEO Frans van Houten, as the company spoke of `'alleged infringements of competition rules."

LG Electronics said it is currently reviewing the  European Commission's decision with the intention to appeal the decision.

The South Korean  TV maker argued that it should not be held liable for the conduct of LG Philips Display, a joint venture between LG and Royal Philips Electronics NV.
LG also disagreed with the way the Commission calculated the amount of  fine.



Page 112 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It appears that the  European Commission has calculated the  fine imposed on LG Electronics partly on the basis of  TV sets and PC monitors sold by LG Electronics in Europe rather than just cathode ray tubes," LG said in a statement.

Other companies  fined were Samsung SDI, Technicolor, MTPD and Toshiba. Chunghwa of Taiwan escaped fines as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the EU.
`'It is the biggest  fine for a cartel, ever," Almunia said. The fine exceeded the previous record of the 2008
fine of (EURO)1.38 billion ($1.8 billion) in a car glass cartel.

Almunia said the  tubes cartel operated worldwide and that the companies involved fully realized they acted illegally.

After top management set the strategy at Green(s) meetings, lower-level company officials discussed the practical applications of the price-fixing  scheme during so-called `'Glass meetings," referring to the core material of the  tubes.

`'The participants during this period seemed very happy about the outcome," Almunia said, citing one document that read: `'Because of the success of the `glass meeting' everybody has been enjoying business this year." Not the consumer, he said.

The cartel started when the tube market was still booming but lasted even when sales dropped with the advent of flatscreens. The  cartel made sure the companies kept making profits even as demand for tube screens waned.

Almunia said the companies sought to keep prices as high as possible before new technologies came to the market. One document seized by the Commission gave the conspiring companies clear instructions: "Producers need to avoid price competition through controlling their production capacity."

A separate document had a warning: "Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission." Another said: "Please dispose the following document after reading it."

`'Instead of competing with each other to innovate and provide the best product at the best price, they chose to conspire to artificially maintain returns in a declining technology market," Almunia said. `'This is why we fight cartels."

He said the television and computer cartels were among the most sophisticated the EU had ever dealt with. He said they not only fixed prices, but also shared markets, coordinated capacity, output and customer allocation. In the  computer monitor cartel, they even audited compliance.

The Commission started its probe with an antitrust raid on the companies in November 2007. Almunia said U.S. authorities were currently investigating the case as well.

HD      LG Elec. mulls appealing  EU penalty

South Korea's LG Electronics said Thursday it plans to appeal the  European Commission's 491.6 million euro fine for its alleged price-rigging of cathode ray  tubes (CRTs).

The company said it will closely review the decision and appeal it to a European court, adding that the European regulator imposed the penalty by simply including CRT sales in Europe in its penalty calculation without proving how the alleged  cartel affected the European  TV and monitor market.

TD
Earlier, the commission  fined a group of seven international companies, including LG Electronics, Philips Electronics, Panasonic and Samsung, a total of 1.47 billion euros for price  fixing  of CRT in two global cartels between 1996 and 2006.

The commission slapped a 295.6 million euro  fine on LG Electronics and an additional  fine of 392 million euros to be shared between Philips and LG for LG Philips LCD, a unit once jointly owned with the Dutch company.

LG Electronics said LG Philips LCD was an independent unity and it does not hold responsible for it. LG Electronics transferred all of its CRT business to the joint venture when it was set up in July 2001. In
2006, LG Philips LCD went bankrupt.

HD          Europe Strikes Tech Cartels With Fine of $1.96 Billion

BRUSSELS -- For a decade, senior managers at some of the world's largest electronics companies met at golf courses, mostly in Asia, for what they called ''greens meetings.''

Besides golf, the business at hand was a price-fixing  scheme that affected millions of consumers, the top European antitrust regulator said on Wednesday.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, imposed  fines totaling almost 1.5 billion euros, or $1.96 billion, on seven companies involved in two cartels that fixed the price of picture and display tubes for televisions and  computer screens.

Combined, the  fines amount to the largest single penalty for price  fixing  ever imposed by the commission, which said the cartels had engaged in the most organized market manipulation it had ever investigated. In addition to price  fixing,  the cartels' conspiracies included market sharing, customer allocation and exchanges of important commercial information.

The action follows a spate of similar cases in the glass and display sectors, where bulky cathode ray tubes have been supplanted by technologies like liquid-crystal display and plasma that allow manufacturers to build far more compact monitors and screens.
But starting in the late 1990s, when the market was still strong for cathode ray  tubes, and lasting until
2006, the conspirators' scheme allowed them to continue generating strong returns for a technology
that was rapidly becoming outmoded.

''The companies were trying to manage through collusion the decline in the market for these kinds of tubes,'' Mr. Almunia said at a news conference. ''The undue profits that the companies derived from the collusion may even have artificially slowed down the transition to the more modern products like LCD and plasma displays.''

Excerpts from minutes from meetings held by the  cartel members obtained during the investigation showed the efforts they made to fix the market for the older technologies, according to commission officials.

''Producers need to avoid price competition through controlling their production capacity (of flat types in particular),'' one excerpt read. Another noted that ''mutual cooperation is required to deal with an expected economic downturn'' in the second half of 2002.

In addition to the ''greens meetings,'' there were ''glass meetings'' for lower-level managers. The name probably related to the glass structure of the cathode ray  tubes, officials said. They were held in Asia and in European cities including Glasgow, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and Budapest, commission officials said.

The cartels ''feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe,'' Mr. Almunia said. Producers in Europe and consumers suffered
Page 116 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
serious harm, he said, because the cathode ray  tubes accounted for as much as 70 percent of the price of screens.

During his news conference, Mr. Almunia read from one of the documents obtained by the commission to show that  cartel members were aware they were breaking the law. ''Everybody is requested to keep it a secret,'' the document read, ''as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or to the European Commission.''

The commission's antitrust division can  fine offenders as much as 10 percent of their annual worldwide sales, and the  fine on Wednesday exceeded the previous record of almost 1.4 billion euros, which was imposed upon an auto-glass  cartel in 2008.

But unlike regulators in the United States, the commission has no criminal enforcement powers and cannot prosecute or seek to jail participants for anticompetitive offenses. Many lawyers say this lack remains a shortcoming of the European system.

''There is a deterrent effect as these  fines get higher, but there are always going to be some companies with wayward commercial personnel and some companies where some people say, 'Let's take the risk as might be worth it in the long run,' '' said Caroline Hobson, a competition law partner at CMS Cameron McKenna in London. ''An even greater enforcement power is the power to jail offenders, because that really makes people wake up.''
She said she did not represent any of the companies involved in the case.

Mr. Almunia imposed the harshest penalties on Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and LG Electronics of South Korea. Philips was  fined 313.4 million euros and LG Electronics 295.6 million euros. Philips and LG also were also part of a joint venture that received an additional  fine of 391.9 million euros for which both companies were liable.

The commission also finedPanasonic 157.5 million euros, Samsung 150.8 million euros, Toshiba 28 million euros and Technicolor 38.6 million euros.

In a statement, Philips said it would appeal the  fines to the General Court of the European Union, the bloc's second-highest tribunal. Philips described the  fine relating to its involvement in the joint venture as ''disproportionate and unjustified.'' Philips said it had divested that business in 2001.
LG did not respond to an e-mail request for comment.

The sanctions announced on Wednesday were the latest handed down by the commission over activity in the sector. It levied a fine of 128.7 million euros last year against four producers of the glass that is used in cathode ray tubes, and it imposed a 649 million euro  fine in 2010 against members of a  cartel that fixed prices on flat-panel displays based on LCD technology. One of the companies involved in
that case, Chunghwa from Taiwan, reported the picture  tubes case to the commission. As a result, Chunghwa received full immunity from  fines.

zz Philips, LG among firms penalised e1.47bn for price  fixing

ROYAL Philips Electronics and LG Electronics are among companies that have been  fined a record e1.47 billion (R16.8bn) by EU antitrust regulators over price-fixing  agreements for now-obsolete cathode ray tubes used in television and computer monitors.

TD
Philips had been  fined e313.4 million while LG faced a e295.6m penalty, the  European Commission said in a statement yesterday. The companies also shared a  fine of e391.9m for a unit they jointly owned.
Panasonic was fined e157.5m and shared an e86.7m punishment with Toshiba and MTPD, a
Panasonic unit.

Philips spokesman Joost Akkermans said the  fine was "disproportionate and unjustified" and related to a unit it divested in 2001. Philips would appeal the EU decision, he said.

"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 percent to 70 percent of the price of a screen," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Sales of cathode ray  tubes used in television and computer monitors declined after customers switched to liquid-crystal and plasma display sets.

Philips and Technicolor, previously known as Thomson, received objections in the EU probe in 2009. Antitrust watchdogs in the EU, Japan and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns they had colluded to fix prices.

Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics, was also told to pay e150.8m. Toshiba was separately fined e28m and Technicolor was  fined e38.6m.

Samsung SDI, Philips and Technicolor received reductions to their  fines for co-operating with the investigation.
Chunghwa Picture  Tubes was not punished because it was the first to inform regulators of the  cartel. Top management meetings between the companies to fix prices were often followed by a game of
golf, the EU said in the statement. The firms fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers
between them and restricted their own output in two worldwide cartels between 1996 and 2006.
"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of
anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," Almunia
said.

He said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for between 50 percent and 70 percent of the price of a screen.
Page 120 of 177 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Cathode ray tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display, plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes.

The biggest fine prior to the cathode ray  tubes cartel was e1.38bn imposed on participants in a motor vehicle glass cartel in 2008.

The commission's sanctions followed a total  fine of e128.74m levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode ray  tubes.

Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Samsung Electronics, LG Display and three other liquid crystal display producers were fined a total e648m two years ago for taking part in a  cartel.

TOKYO--Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) said Thursday that it intends to appeal the European
Commission's decision to  fine the company for  fixing  the prices of television tubes.

TD
The Japanese company is among seven companies fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by
European regulators Wednesday for operating price-fixing  cartels for cathode ray  tubes.
Our investigation showed we didn't take action that violated competition law in Europe and we intend
to fight by bringing the latest case to the European Union's General Court of Justice," Toshiba said in a
statement.
Toshiba said the European CommissionfinedToshiba itself a total EUR28 million (Y3.0 billion). Separately, it said the  European Commission imposed a EUR87 million  fine on Toshiba's former
joint venture with Panasonic Corp. (6752.TO), to be shared between the two companies.
Toshiba also said it hasn't change its earnings outlook for this fiscal year ending March. Write to Hiroyuki Kachi at Hiroyuki.Kachi@dowjones.com

A CARTEL of international companies was fined €1.5 billion (GBP1.2bn) yesterday for  fixing  the market in television and computer monitor tubes.
The price of a key part in the manufacture of televisions and computers was rigged for a decade by a
cartel of huge companies, it has been revealed.

TD
Seven companies, including Philips, LG and Panasonic, were  fined by the European Commission after an investigation into anti-competitive practices. Top executives met secretly to fix the price of cathode ray tubes at "green" meetings - which were rounded off by a game of golf.

At lower-level but equally secretive "glass" meetings around the world, executives from the electronics manufacturers conspired to keep the price of cathode ray  tubes unnaturally high - thereby inflating the cost of televisions and computers to millions of consumers.

Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy JoaquÃn Almunia said: "Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 to 70 per cent of the price of a screen.

"This gives an indication of the serious harm this illegal behaviour has caused both to  television and computer screen producers, and ultimately the harm it caused to the European consumers over the years."

Mr Almunia said: "There are victims: millions and millions of citizens. These cartels for cathode ray tubes are 'textbook cartels' - they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Other companies  fined were Samsung SDI, Technicolour, MTPD and Toshiba. Chunghwa of Taiwan escaped fines as it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the EU.
"It is the biggest  fine for a cartel, ever," Mr Almunia said.

He said the price-fixing cartel operated worldwide with the companies involved being fully aware they were acting illegally.

One document seized by the commission warned executives: "Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission." Another said: "Please dispose the following document after reading it."

"Instead of competing with each other to innovate and provide the best product at the best price, they chose to conspire to artificially maintain returns," Mr Almunia said. "This is why we fight cartels."

Philips said in a statement it planned to appeal the  fine since it considered it "disproportionate and unjust".

"We regret that we are linked to this kind of behaviour," said chief executive Frans van Houten. LG Electronics said it would only react after studying the decision.

In a statement, the EC said: "The cartels are among the most organised that the commission has investigated."

They called them "green meetings" — secret huddles of some of the world's top electronics executives at which they carved up the cathode ray  tubes market and then hit the golf course.

The clandestine meetings, involving executives from LG, Philips, Samsung and Panasonic, laid the foundations for one of the most egregious cartels that European antitrust investigators have come across, it was alleged yesterday.

TD
Seven electronics manufacturers were fined a record €1.5 billion by the European Commission for rigging the market for cathode ray tubes used in televisions and computer monitors. The manufacturers operated two cartels for almost a decade and were knowingly breaking the law, Europe's top competition regulator alleged.

Investigators from the Commission uncovered documents in which the conspirators apparently brazenly discussed the need to keep their discussions secret.

"Everybody is requested to keep as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or the European Commission," one warned. Another stated: "Please dispose the following document after reading it."

The enforcement action — the biggest by the  European Commission in a cartel case — could open the electronics giants to legal action by consumers who were overcharged as a result of the alleged collusion.

Philips described its penalty as "disproportionate and unjustified", because its tube production unit was divested in 2001, and said that it would appeal against the Commission's decision. Panasonic said that the decision was "factually and legally erroneous" and also said that it would consider an appeal.

The Commission's investigation into the alleged cartels began with a series of raids in November 2007. Cathode ray tubes were an important component in the making of  television and computer screens, accounting for up to 70 per cent of the price, the regulator said.

It believes that screen manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers were overcharged for almost a decade as a result of the tube producers conspiring to distort the market. The Commission said: "For almost ten years, the cartelists carried out the most harmful anti-competitive practices including
price-fixing,  market-sharing, customer allocation, capacity and output co-ordination and exchanges of commercially sensitive information."

The cartels operated worldwide, dictated by executives who drew up the plans at the "green meetings". The implementation of the schemes were left to their lieutenants to work out at other meetings in cities such as Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Paris and Rome, the Commission alleges.

The biggest  fines were against Philips and LG, which were involved in both cartels. They received penalties of €313.4 million and €295.6 million, respectively. Samsung, also involved in both cartels,

was fined €150.8 million. Panasonic and Toshiba, which participated only in the  television tubes        cartel, were hit with penalties of €157.5 million and €28 million, respectively. Smaller companies were also fined, bringing the total to €1.47 billion.

Chunghwa, a Taiwanese manufacturer, received immunity because it blew the whistle on the price-fixing.

HD          EU Fines 7 Firms for Display Cartels

They met on golf courses across Europe and Asia. Executives from Philips Electronics NV, Panasonic Corp., Samsung SDI Co. and four other global electronics companies hatched plans on the links to manipulate prices of  television and computer tubes in cartels described by European Union regulators as among the most organized they had investigated.

A decade of market manipulation in a now-outdated technology -- cathode-ray  tubes for televisions and home computers -- drew  fines from the EU totaling 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion).

TD
The fines, the highest ever handed down in a case by the  European Commission, were the culmination of a three-year probe made in cooperation with other regulators. The market manipulation began in 1996 and ended 10 years later, EU regulators said. The EU's previous biggest total  fine in a cartel case was 1.38 billion euros, levied in 2008 regarding automobile glass.

The EU said regulators around the globe, including in the U.S., still are investigating the cartels, part of a probe that has been under way for three years.
"This decision is not the end of the matter," said Caroline Hobson, an antitrust partner for
London-based law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, who wasn't involved in the case. "Customers of the
companies involved will be looking closely at the decision and may result in a number of sizable
damages actions."

The European Commission, which is the EU's enforcement arm, said the  TV- and computer-tube cartels were among the "most organized" it had investigated and that the companies had been aware that they were breaking the law. Regulators said the firms conspired in such practices as price  fixing and coordinating capacity and production of their products. At their peak, cathode-ray  tubes accounted for up to 70% of the price of a  TV set.

"These cartels for cathode-ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels,'" said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief. "They feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behavior that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Mr. Almunia said senior executives referred to their gatherings in Europe and Asia as "green meetings," because they were regularly followed by rounds of golf. The commission was unable to provide more detail on the golf courses but said most of play took place in Asia, in such countries as Japan, Indonesia and Hong Kong.

The deals cut during those encounters were then implemented during more regular, "glass meetings," which Mr. Almunia described as the "engine room of the  cartel," held in such locations as Paris and Hong Kong.
Mr. Almunia said there was "a sophisticated system of monitoring each  cartel participants' behavior." Demand for cathode-ray  tubes was booming at the start of the  cartel. In 2003, when the technology
was replaced by liquid-crystal displays,  cartel members tried to manage the decline, Mr. Almunia told
reporters. He said the companies may have "artificially slowed" the transition to plasma displays.

Netherlands-based Philips received the highest  fine, 313 million euros, for participating in cartels for
TV and computer-monitor tubes. It was ordered to split a 392 million euro fine with LG Electronics Inc.
for a joint venture. LG also was ordered to pay 296 million euros for collusion in its own right. Samsung
SDI was ordered to pay 151 million euros. The two South Korean companies were found to have
participated in both cartels.
Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said he regretted "any association" with such behavior. LG Electronics and Samsung SDI reserved comment until the decision could be reviewed further.
The commission found that Toshiba Corp., Panasonic and its MTPD subsidiary, and Technicolor SA, formerly Thomson, participated in the  cartel for TV tubes. Panasonic and Toshiba, both of Japan,
were fined 157 million euros and 28 million euros, respectively. MTPD was ordered to pay part of a 95 million euro fine, shared with Panasonic and Toshiba.

Panasonic said the commission's decision was "factually and legally erroneous" and that the company would consider its options for appeal to European courts.

France's Technicolor said Thomson sold its cathode-ray tube business in 2005 and that the company would record a provision for the  fine in the second half of this year.
Toshiba didn't respond to a request for comment.

Because it revealed the  cartel's existence, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Picture  Tubes Ltd. received full immunity from a  fine that otherwise would have been 17 million euros, the commission said. Philips and Samsung received reductions in their  fines for cooperating in the investigation.

They met on golf courses across Europe and Asia.

A decade of market manipulation in a now-outdated technology—cathode-ray  tubes for televisions and desktop computers—drew  fines totaling €1.47 billion ($1.92 billion).

The EU said regulators around the globe, including in the U.S., still are investigating the display cartels. The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on the EU action but confirmed the U.S. investigation is still open. The Justice Department has brought a handful of cases involving alleged price-fixing  in picture tubes but nothing on the scale of Europe's action Wednesday.

Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said he regretted "any association" with such behavior. "Our ethical standards are very clear and must be strictly adhered to." He said the  fine, which related to a business sold in 2001, was "disproportionate and unjustified."

In 2010, the EU  fined six makers of LCD screens €649 million for allegedly operating their own  cartel
over five years.

Netherlands-based Philips received the highest  fine in the latest case, €313 million, for participating in cartels for TV and computer-monitor tubes. It was ordered to split a €392 million  fine with LG Electronics Inc. for a joint venture. LG also was ordered to pay €296 million for collusion in its own right. Samsung SDI Co. was ordered to pay €151 million. The two South Korean companies were found to have participated in both cartels.

LG Electronics said it disagrees with the calculation of the  fine and intends to appeal. A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company hasn't decided whether to appeal.

The following is the first summary of major stories moved by Yonhap News Agency on Thursday.
----------------- (2nd LD) S. Korea's economic growth hits over 3-year low in Q3

TD
SEOUL -- The South Korean economy grew at the slowest pace in more than three years in the third quarter on faltering facility investment, the central bank said Thursday, raising chances that the
full-year growth will likely miss the bank's 2.4 percent estimate.

South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic performance, grew a revised 0.1 percent in the July-September period from three months earlier, down from a previous estimate of 0.2 percent, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK).
----------------- LG to appeal EU  cartel fine

SEOUL -- South Korean consumer electronics giant LG Electronics Inc. said Thursday it plans to appeal the European Commission's cartel fine for its alleged price-rigging of now-obsolete cathode ray tubes (CRT).

On Wednesday, the European regulator  finedLG Electronics and five other companies, including Philips and Panasonic, a total of 1.47 billion euros, saying their executives colluded to fix prices in two global cartels between 1996 and 2006.
----------------- (2nd LD) 'Arirang' makes UNESCO's intangible heritage list

SEOUL -- Korea's traditional folk song "Arirang" was added to UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list on Thursday.

The Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage decided to inscribe the song on the heritage list during its seventh meeting Wednesday, Paris time, at UNESCO headquarters, the U.N. cultural agency said.
----------------- (LEAD) Koreans abroad begin presidential balloting

WASHINGTON -- South Koreans in the United States began casting their ballots Wednesday in the presidential election in their homeland.

It is the first time that South Koreans abroad have taken part in presidential polls, thanks to a revised election law that took effect in 2009
----------------- S. Korea, U.S. in two-track efforts on N. Korea's rocket scheme

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government on Wednesday stressed a continued diplomatic push aimed at preempting North Korea's plan to fire a long-range rocket, but it also signaled further sanctions on the communist nation in case of a launch.

"We don't want to, obviously, talk about actions before there's been a launch. What we're hoping to do is dissuade North Korea from carrying out this launch," said Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the State Department.

SEOUL -- Ruling Saenuri Party's presidential candidate Park Geun-hye aims to solidify her lead while Moon Jae-in, her opposition rival, seeks an upset with 13 days remaining before voters pick the country's next chief executive, political pundits said Thursday.

Nationwide polls released by media companies that reflected the first  TV debate by leading contenders, showed Park ahead by 3.3-7.6 percentage points over her Democratic United Party (DUP) rival, with most surveys taken after the official start of campaigning on Nov. 27, showing the Saenuri candidate maintaining or expanding her lead vis-a-vis Moon.

zz Philips, LG among firms penalised e1.47bn for price  fixing

ROYAL Philips Electronics and LG Electronics are among companies that have been  fined a record e1.47 billion (R16.8bn) by EU antitrust regulators over price-fixing  agreements for now-obsolete cathode ray tubes used in television and computer monitors.

TD
Philips had been  fined e313.4 million while LG faced a e295.6m penalty, the European Commission said in a statement yesterday. The companies also shared a fine of e391.9m for a unit they jointly owned.
Panasonic was fined e157.5m and shared an e86.7m punishment with Toshiba and MTPD, a
Panasonic unit.

Philips spokesman Joost Akkermans said the  fine was "disproportionate and unjustified" and related to a unit it divested in 2001. Philips would appeal the EU decision, he said.

"Cathode ray  tubes were a very important component in the making of  television and computer screens. They accounted for 50 percent to 70 percent of the price of a screen," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Sales of cathode ray  tubes used in television and computer monitors declined after customers switched to liquid-crystal and plasma display sets.

Philips and Technicolor, previously known as Thomson, received objections in the EU probe in 2009. Antitrust watchdogs in the EU, Japan and South Korea raided companies in 2007 over concerns
they had colluded to fix prices.

Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics, was also told to pay e150.8m. Toshiba was separately fined e28m and Technicolor was  fined e38.6m.

Samsung SDI, Philips and Technicolor received reductions to their  fines for co-operating with the investigation.
Chunghwa Picture Tubes was not punished because it was the first to inform regulators of the  cartel. Top management meetings between the companies to fix prices were often followed by a game of
golf, the EU said in the statement. The firms fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers
between them and restricted their own output in two worldwide cartels between 1996 and 2006.

"These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are 'textbook cartels': they feature all the worst kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe," Almunia said.

He said the violations were especially harmful for consumers, as cathode ray  tubes accounted for between 50 percent and 70 percent of the price of a screen.

Cathode ray tubes have largely been replaced by more advanced display technologies such as liquid-crystal display, plasma display and organic light-emitting diodes.

The biggest  fine prior to the cathode ray  tubes cartel was e1.38bn imposed on participants in a motor vehicle glass cartel in 2008.

The commission's sanctions followed a total  fine of e128.74m levied last year against four producers of the glass used in cathode ray  tubes.

Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Samsung Electronics, LG Display and three other liquid crystal display producers were fined a total e648m two years ago for taking part in a  cartel.

SEOUL--South Korean consumer-electronics maker LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE) said Thursday it will appeal the European Commission's decision to  fine the company for its alleged participation in price-fixing  cartels in television and computer parts.

LG Electronics was among seven companies that were fined a record 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion) by European regulators Wednesday for operating price-fixing  cartels for cathode ray  tubes, the main component in color TV and computer screens before the advent of plasma and liquid crystal display screens.

TD
The South Korean company said in a press release the  European Commission had fined it a total 492 million euros for allegedly infringing European competition law relating to the sale of the parts starting in the late 1990s and lasting until 2006.

It added it disagrees with the  fine, which comprises a 296 million euro penalty on LG alone and a further 392 million euro  fine that the South Korean company must share with Philips Electronics NV for a 50-50 joint venture the two companies set up in 2001 called LG Philips Displays.

"Other leading competition authorities, including the Korean Fair Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Canadian Competition Bureau have investigated the same facts and concluded that LG Electronics should not be held liable for the conduct of LG Philips Displays," John Kwon, executive vice president of LG Electronics, said in the release.

He added the company can't understand why the  European Commission has taken a wholly different approach compared with other authorities.

The European Commission also fined South Korean display maker Samsung SDI Co. (006400.SE). A spokesman for the company said Thursday Samsung SDI has yet to decide on whether to appeal the European Commission's decision.

Six electronics makers including LG Electronics, Samsung SDI, and Philips of the Netherlands have been hit with a total of 1.47 billion euros (US$1.92 billion) by EU antitrust regulators for  fixing  prices of TV and monitor cathode-ray  tubes for a decade.

Major international media outlets including Bloomberg reported on December 5 that Panasonic and Toshiba of Japan and Technicolor of France in addition to the three firms have been  fined for their price fixing  practices.

TD
By company, Philips was  fined most with 313.4 million euros, followed by LG Electronics (295.6 million euros), and Samsung SDI (150.8 million euros).

Given LG-Philips Display, the joint venture between LG Electronics and Philips, was also  fined with a 391.9-million-euro penalty, the total amount of  fines the two Korean companies must pay would snowball to 640 million euros, assuming LG and LG-Philips Display split the payment.

LG Electronics who has been  fined hundreds billion won for price  fixing  by the European Commission
shows intention to appeal. Samsung SDI also says it will appeal as soon as it receives written notice.
The European Commission has finedLG Electronics, Samsung Electronics and six foreign companies
a total of 1,470 million euro (approximately 2,080 billion won) for participating in price  fixing  in the sector
of cathode ray  tubes (CRT) used for  TV displays and computer monitors for the period of the late 1990s
through 2006.

TD
The total fines that LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics are supposed to pay to the  European        Commission amount to about 900 billion won. LG Electronics has been imposed a fine of 491,567,000 euro (about 697.5 billion won) for infringing the European competition law. The European Commission contends that LG Electronics has joint responsibility for the wrongdoings of LG Philips Displays, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Philips founded in 2001. Samsung SDI should pay 150,800,000
euro (about 214 billion won) to the Commission. The heaviest amount of  fines has been imposed on
Philips, amounting to 603,530,000 euro (about 859.2 billion won).

Industry experts say that the amount of  fines is excessive but possibilities of collective action are slim. That’s because each company stands at a different position as some companies have received full or partial immunity from  fines under the Commission’s leniency program.

HD     COMPETITION : RECORD FINE FOR CATHODE RAY TUBE CARTEL WC     433 words

It is a new record: the European Commissionfined, on 5 December, seven companies that have taken part in two distinct cartels in the cathode ray tube sector, one relating to  TV sets and the other to computers. It imposed a total  fine of €1.47 billion for breaking the Community's competition rules for a period of ten years, from 1996 to 2006. In 2008, four producers of glass were obliged to pay a €1.38 billion fineFurther information is available at  www.europolitics.info > Search = 325972.

TD
The companies that have been  fined are: LG Electronics, Philips, Samsung, Panasonic, MTPD (a subsidiary of Panasonic), Toshiba and Technicolor. They fixed prices, shared markets, allocated customers between themselves, coordinated output capacity and exchanged commercially sensitive information. They worked out the nature of their concerted action during green meetings', so called because they took place around a game of golf. Preparation and implementation were then carried out through lower-level meetings, often referred to as glass meetings', on a quarterly, monthly or even weekly basis in various locations in Asia (Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, etc) and Europe (Amsterdam, Budapest, Glasgow, Paris or Rome).

"The members [of the  cartel] have the  fine that they deserve. This is an example of the worst anti-competitive practice designed to increase profits by sharing clients in a closed market to the detriment of  computer and television manufacturers and European consumers instead of promoting innovation. The amounts of the fines match the seriousness of the infringement," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Philips and LG Electronics, which were involved in both cartels, will have to pay the lion's share of the fine: €313.4 million for Phillips and €295.6 million for LG Electronics and €391.9 million extra for the two together.
Taiwanese company Chunghwa, which also took part in both cartels, benefited from full immunity from
the fines because it revealed the existence of the cartels. Other companies have had their  fines reduced
because they cooperated in the investigation as per the Commission's leniency programme. One of them,
which was not named, had its  fine reduced because of financial difficulties.

A cathode ray tube (CRT) is an evacuated glass envelope containing an electron gun and a fluorescent screen. Two distinct types of CRTs are relevant for the cartels sanctioned in today's decisions: colour display tubes (CDT) used in computer monitors and colour picture  tubes (CPT) used for colour televisions. The CRTs have been gradually replaced by alternatives, such as LCD and plasma displays.

EU imposes penalty on electronics firms who fixed global cathode ray tube prices then went to play golf together

The European commission has imposed the largest  cartel fine in its history, imposing a €1.47bn (£1.2bn) penalty on seven firms including Philips, Samsung SDI and Panasonic for  fixing  the price of the now outmoded cathode ray  tubes used in televisions and  computer monitors.

TD
For almost a decade between 1996 and 2006 the firms met in Paris, Rome, Glasgow and Asia for "green meetings", so called because they would often end in a round of golf. The companies fixed prices, shared markets, restricted output and allocated customers between themselves, on a worldwide basis.

Chunghwa, LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung SDI participated in both the  television and computer screen cartels, while Panasonic, Toshiba, MTPD (currently a Panasonic subsidiary) and Technicolor (formerly Thomson) were members of only the  TV syndicate.

Chunghwa, which blew the whistle, escaped a  fine while others were given reductions in their penalties in exchange for co-operation.

Cathode rays are all but obsolete, with flat screens now the norm for televisions and computers, but at their peak, the commission said, the  tubes represented between 50% and 70% of the price of a screen.

The competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said: "These cartels for cathode ray  tubes are textbook cartels: they feature all the worst kinds of anticompetitive behaviour that are strictly forbidden to companies doing business in Europe."

Electronics maker to pay 492 million euros for 10 years of price-fixing  on CRTs

LG Electronics was slapped with its largest-ever fine of 491.56 million euros (697.5 billion won) on Wednesday by the  European Commission for fixing  the prices from 1996 until 2006 of now-obsolete cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) used in TVs and computer monitors.

TD
LG is among six electronics producers  fined a combined 1.47 billion euros. This exceeds the previous record of 1.38 billion euros imposed by the EU in 2008 on glass makers who supply car windows.

Philips was fined 313.4 million euros, while LG faces a 295.6 million euro penalty. The two companies also share an additional  fine of 391.9 million euros for LG Philips Displays, a unit they jointly established in July 2001 that went bankrupt in 2006. Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics, was also told to pay 150.8 million euros.
Panasonic was fined 157.5 million euros and shares an 86.7 million euro punishment with Toshiba and
MTPD, a Panasonic unit. Panasonic and MTPD also share a 7.9 million-euro  fine.

“These tubes accounted for 50 to 70 percent of the price of a screen,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters. “This gives an indication of the serious harm that these cartels have caused over a decade, both to the manufacturers of TVs and computers and ultimately to final consumers who had to pay a higher price than they should have.”

In response, LG said yesterday it has decided to file an administrative litigation against the commission. “We have concluded after legal review that we are not an object of the penalty,” said LG in a statement. “We will take legal steps,” it added, without elaborating. The deadline for an appeal is next February.

The size of the  fine was unfair as it was based on the company’s entire output of  TV and PC monitors instead of just focusing on CRTs, LG claims.

“LG Electronics objects to this approach as there is no evidence that sales [of other products] were affected by the alleged infringement investigated by the commission,” it said.

LG also said LG Philips Displays is a “completely independent business entity” and it is has “no legal joint responsibility for the company.” Even for the alleged price  fixing  before establishing LG Philips Display, the charge is no longer valid since five years have already passed. This is the maximum window during which the commission can levy  fines for acts of collusion under EU law. LG handed over all its
CRT-related businesses to LG Philips Display when the latter was established.

LG said Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, as well as antitrust bodies in such countries as the United States, Japan, Canada and the Czech Republic, have recognized LG’s argument and nullified their decision to slap fines.

“For LG, the  fine appears to be excessive, way more than the approximately 290 billion won in provisions it set aside,” Kim Ji-san, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. “Still, it’s a one-time event so I think the
share-price drop will be short-lived.”

LG Electronics and Samsung SDI announced Thursday that they will appeal the European Commission’s 450 million euro (630 billion won)  fine that was imposed for an alleged cartel in computer and television parts.

The two Korean firms are determined to appeal the case with the European court after thoroughly reviewing all necessary legal aspects.

TD
The European antitrust watchdog decided Wednesday to charge LG 300 million euro (420 billion won) and Samsung 150 million euro (210 billion won), along with five other firms that are suspected of price-fixing  cathode ray tubes between 1996 and 2006.
Cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, were used as the crucial components for color  TV screens and
computer screens, before plasma and liquid crystal display screens were introduced to the market.

LG was especially upset with the  European Commission’s decision, claiming that the European regulator imposed a  fine for a similar cause in 2001.

Earlier in 2001, LG had been  fined by the European antitrust watchdog for price-fixing  by LG Philips Displays, a cathode ray tube maker firm co-founded by LG and Philips. Since then, LG has claimed that LG Philips Displays is an independent firm with no ties to LG.

In a press release, LG said that other national authorities, including the Korean Fair Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Canadian Competition Bureau, have investigated the same case and concluded that LG Electronics should not be held liable for LG Philips Displays’ violation.
LG also complained that the method that the European regulators used to calculate LG’s total CRT
sales was simplistic and inaccurate, resulting in an excessive penalty.

In 2007, Samsung SDI and Toshiba, too, went through investigations by the  European                   Commission for price-fixing  charges. Philips and Technicolor had been investigated by the European Commission for price-fixing  in 2009 as well.

Starbucks nears deal

TD
AMERICAN coffee chain Starbucks is understood to be close to a deal with HM Revenue and Customs that could see it pay between $7.5m and $15m in corporation tax this year.

The payment would more than double tax receipts from the company, which has paid only $12.7m to the Treasury since its UK launch in 1998. – INM

TV cartel pays $1.6b

EXECUTIVES from some of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers met in Europe and Asia to illegally fix the price of televisions and computers for a decade, the  European Commission ruled yesterday.

Handing out huge  fines to Philips, Panasonic, Samsung and four other firms, Brussels ruled that between 1996 and 2006 they held back supply of cathode ray  tubes, then the key component in  TV sets and computer monitors.

Because the  tubes made up between 50% and 70% of the retail price, consumers consequently paid an “over price” for TVs and computers. The scam was “among the most organised cartels that the commission has investigated”, the EC said.
The EC fined the seven a total of $1.6 billion. – INM HSBC nets $2.6b
HSBC has agreed to the sale of its 15.6% stake in Chinese insurance giant Ping An for $9.4 billion.

It is the latest and largest move by its chief executive Stuart Gulliver to focus HSBC on its most profitable businesses and withdraw from non-core activities.

HSBC will book a profit of $2.6 billion on the sale to Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group, which is controlled by the country's richest man, Dhanin Chearavanont.

For 10 years, they rigged the market for cathode ray  tubes

THEY called them ``green meetings'' -- secret huddles of some of the world's top electronics executives at which they carved up the cathode ray  tubes market, then hit the golf course.

TD
The clandestine meetings, involving executives from LG, Philips, Samsung and Panasonic, laid the foundations for one of the most egregious cartels that European antitrust investigators had come across, it was alleged yesterday.
Seven electronics manufacturers were  fined a record E1.5 billion ($1.9bn) by the European
Commission for rigging the market for cathode ray  tubes used in televisions and computer monitors.

The manufacturers operated two cartels for almost a decade and were knowingly breaking the law, Europe's top competition regulator alleged.

Investigators from the commission uncovered documents in which the conspirators apparently brazenly discussed the need to keep their discussions secret. ``Everybody is requested to keep as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or the  European Commission,'' one warned. Another stated: ``Please dispose the following document after reading it.''

The enforcement action -- the biggest by the commission in a  cartel case -- could open the electronics giants to legal action by consumers who were overcharged as a result of the alleged collusion.

Philips described its penalty as ``disproportionate and unjustified'' because its tube production unit was divested in 2001, and said it would appeal against the decision.
Panasonic said the decision was ``factually and legally erroneous'' and it would consider an appeal. The commission's investigation into the alleged cartels began with a series of raids in November
2007. Cathode ray  tubes were an important component in the making of  television and computer
screens, accounting for up to 70 per cent of the price, the regulator said.

It believes that screen manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers were overcharged for almost a decade as a result of the tube producers conspiring to distort the market. The commission said: ``For almost 10 years, the cartelists carried out the most harmful anti-competitive practices including
price-fixing,  market-sharing, customer allocation, capacity and output co-ordination and exchanges of commercially sensitive information.''

The cartels operated worldwide, dictated by executives who drew up the plans at the ``green meetings''.

The implementation of the schemes was left to their lieutenants to work out at other meetings in cities such as Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Paris and Rome, the commission alleges.

The biggest  fines were against Philips and LG, which were involved in both cartels. They received penalties of E313.4 million and E295.6m, respectively.
Samsung, also involved in both cartels, was  fined E150.8m.

Panasonic and Toshiba, which participated only in the television tubes cartel, were hit with penalties of E157.5m and E28m, respectively. Smaller companies were also fined, bringing the total to
E1.47bn.
Taiwanese manufacturer Chunghwa received immunity because it blew the whistle on the price-fixing.

HD          Dutch consumers group to seek damages from Philips

AMSTERDAM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The Dutch Consumers' Association is to look at how it can claim damages against electronics firms including Philips that were  fined this week for uncompetitive practices by the  European Commission.

The European Commission imposed the biggest antitrust penalty in its history on Wednesday, fining six firms including Philips, LG Electronics and Panasonic Corp a total of 1.47 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for running two cartels for nearly a decade.

TD
The Commission said executives from the Asian and European companies met until six years ago to fix prices and divide up markets for  TV and computer monitor cathode-ray  tubes, technology now mostly made obsolete by flat screens.

Consumentenbond, the Dutch Consumers' Association, said on Friday it was waiting for an amendment to the law so it can recover damages on behalf of consumers, and was looking at how it can pursue claims against Philips and the other companies.

The EU antitrust regulator imposed the biggest penalties on Philips for its role in the price  fixing  and carving up of markets: the Dutch electronics, healthcare and lighting company was  fined 313 million euros and faces a further penalty through a joint venture.

Frans van Houten, Philips chief executive, said the group would challenge what he called a disproportionate and unjustified penalty.

HD      Commission Smashes TV And Monitor  Cartels To Ensure No Repeats! BY       David Flint

€1.47 billionEarlier this week, the  European Commission ("the Commission") imposed a record fine of on the members of two cartels relating to the production of cathode ray  tubes for TV and computer monitors. The  cartel members include some very well-known household names - including Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung and Panasonic.

The cartels operated on a worldwide basis between 1996 and 2006 and involved seven international groups of companies. The Commission Vice President described them as "textbook cartels" in that they involved the most serious forms of anti-competitive conduct – this included price  fixing,  market sharing, customer allocation, capacity and output coordination and exchanging commercially sensitive information.

TD
They were extremely organised. The members held top level management meetings where the objectives were designed and agreed. These were even dubbed "green meetings" as they were often followed by a round of golf! The more practical matters of preparation and implementation were carried out at lower level management meetings which were held on a quarterly, monthly or even weekly basis. Discussions focused on sales areas and individual customers. In terms of the  computer monitors cartel, plant visits were carried out to audit compliance with capacity restrictions.

The members also took active steps to conceal the cartels. In the course of its on site inspections (ie dawn raids) the Commission found documents which warned "Everybody is requested to keep it as secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission". Other documents instructed the members to "dispose of the following document after reading it". The Commission inspectors would clearly have been very pleased that some members did not heed this advice!

This is clearly one of the most serious cartels uncovered by the Commission to date and is an excellent example of how not to conduct business from a competition point of view. Despite their high degree of organisation and coordination, these textbook cartels were undone by a whistleblower under the Commission's leniency regime. This party, Chunghwa, received full immunity from  fines by virtue of it being first to reveal the existence of the cartels to the Commission. This shows that no matter how sophisticated the  cartel, full immunity will at some point represent an attractive option for one member and it only takes one whistleblower to uncover the  cartel.

Immediate specialist help is imperative when dealing with the competition authorities to ensure that your interests are fully protected. We also offer full competition law training, compliance and audit services to help you educate your staff and comply with the rules. Compliance training is regarded favourably by the competition authorities and its cost is significantly less than any potential penalty!

HD      Global Electronics Brands Fined €1.47 Billion For Anti-Competitive Cartels

Following a five-year-long investigation, the  European Commission (Commission) has fined Samsung, Philips, LG Electronics, Technicolor, Panasonic and Toshiba a total of €1.47 billion for price fixing, market sharing, customer allocation and output restrictions between 1996 and 2006. The fine is the biggest ever imposed in the EU to date. It relates to the companies‟ sales of cathode ray tubes, which are used in televisions and  computer monitors. The whistleblower, Chunghwa, was granted 100% immunity from  fines, as it was the first to provide evidence to the Commission.
Textbook Cartels

TD
The Commission today described the cartels as textbook,‟ due to the highly organised nature of the agreements, their long duration and the wide variety of anti-competitive behaviour they covered. The Commission found that the companies: fixed prices; shared markets; allocated customers between themselves; coordinated capacity and output; exchanged commercially sensitive information, including prices charged to individual customers; and monitored the implementation of the  cartel, including auditing compliance with the capacity restrictions by visiting each other‟s factories.

According to the Commission, they are some of the most organised cartels it has ever investigated, with meetings taking place at top management level, as well as at lower levels (sometimes meeting weekly) at each company. The investigation also identified evidence that the companies were well aware that they were breaking the law; for example, one document stated that "Everybody is requested to keep it a
secret as it would be serious damage if it is open to customers or  European Commission," and other documents contained instructions that they should be destroyed after reading.
Leniency Reductions

In addition to Chunghwa, which was granted 100% immunity from  fines, Samsung, Philips and Technicolor were granted  fine reductions under the Commission‟s leniency policy of 40%, 30% and 10% respectively. The level of reduction was based on the timing and quality of the information provided to the Commission.
Comment

The TV and computer monitor industry has been the focus of a number of investigations in recent years. In 2011, the Commission settled an investigation into price  fixing  in the market for cathode ray tube
glass, an input into cathode ray  tubes. The U.S. Department of Justice has also investigated the cathode ray tubes market, and several class action lawsuits have been brought in the United States. LCD display makers have also been the subject of recent investigations in both Europe and the United States.

The €1.47 billion  fine in this case is the largest fine ever imposed by the European Commission. This marks a return to the eye-wateringly large fines which were a hallmark of previous Competition Commissioner Kroes.  Fines to date under current Competition Commissioner Almunia have been more modest. Almunia has also granted  fine reductions to an increasing number of companies because of
their inability to pay‟ larger  fines. One of the companies (unnamed)  fined today also had its  fine reduced for this reason. A number of the companies have indicated they will appeal today‟s decision.
