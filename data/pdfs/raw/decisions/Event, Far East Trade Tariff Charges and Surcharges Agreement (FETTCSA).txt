COURT appeals against  European Commission rulings on the Far Eastern Freight Conference and the former Trans-Atlantic Agreement will move forward next month when the Luxembourg Court of First Instance hears oral evidence.

The FEFC case, involving the legality of intermodal freight rates, will be heard on June 7. The following day, the TAA's appeal against the 1994 decision on the agreement's capacity management programme and collective inland rate-making will start.

The TAA will also challenge the Brussels verdict that the agreement was not a conference. Later that same day, oral evidence will be given concerning whether the European Commission was entitled to lift the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement's immunity from fines.
Grand Alliance working on Atlantic port schedules

THE Grand Alliance and Americana Ships expect to finalise port calls for their new schedule of transatlantic services by the end of this month.

No contracts with terminals have been signed yet and but the group's terminal committee is working towards an end-May deadline. The Grand Alliance and Americana announced last month plans to
co-operate on the Atlantic from July 4. Five dedicated loops deploying a total of 31 ships should be fully in place by the fourth quarter.
New ships for OOCL

ORIENT Overseas Container Line's two latest post-panamax ships, the OOCLAngeles and OOCL, were named late last month. The two 5,500 teu ships were ordered under a long-term charter agreement with the German-based company Nordcapital and were built by Samsung Heavy Industries at the Koje shipyard.
TACA New Jersey office closes

THE Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement's New Jersey office closes at the end of this month, with the conference's Crawley office then assuming responsibility for both eastbound and westbound trades. Harold 'Lucky'the executive director based in the US, plus Don Watts, are retiring. Meanwhile, the secretariat that runs Taca is to take over the running of the United States South  Europe Conference from July 1. The conference is currently managed from Genoa and has two members, P&Oand Maersk Sealand.
Bunker surcharges lowered
SEVERAL conferences are reducing their bunker surcharges following a decline in oil prices.

The Europe/Mediterranean Trade Agreement has told shippers that the levy will be reduced to Dm 45 per teu from Dm 75 on southbound sailings from Scandinavia and the continent to the eastern Mediterranean and from Dm40 ($21) to Dm 23 per teu northbound, with effect from May 15.

BRUSSELS, May 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission may on Tuesday impose fines against a group of shipping companies involved in trade between Europe and the Far East, a spokesman said on Monday.

The Commission, the antitrust authority for the 15-nation  European Union, will rule on a long-standing investigation into the  Europe Far East Trade and Tariff Surcharges Agreement, known as Fettsca, an agreement between the Far Eastern Freight Conference and independents to apply common surcharges.

TD
"We will make an antitrust ruling on Tuesday involving a  cartel, and there could be  fines," the spokesman said, declining to give further details.

The Commission has in recent years accused  shipping conferences, notably the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA), of acting to stifle competition and has levied heavy  fines on companies concerned. ((Brussels newsroom, +322 287 6830, fax +322 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

HD     Brussels fines shippers for price-fixing on Asia routes

BRUSSELS, May 16 (AFP) - The European Commission slapped fines totalling around seven million euros Tuesday on 15 international shipping companies accused of illegal  price-fixing on routes between Europe and east Asia.

The firms, including Britain's P and O Nedlloyd, Hapag Lloyd of Germany, Denmark's Maersk Sealand and Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM) of France, were found guilty of agreeing not to offer clients reductions in taxes and surcharges on the rates for cargo shipments between  Europe and east Asia, a commission spokesman said.

TD
The 15 companies, which control more than 80 percent of  shipping traffic between northern  Europe and east Asia, had all been signatories to a Far East Trade Tariff Charges an Surcharges Agreement which functioned from June 1991 until it was broken up at the EU's demand in 1994.
The heaviest  fine, 1.24 million  euros, was levied against P and O Nedlloyd Container Line.

Other companies hit with lesser penalties included Malaysian International  Shipping corporation, Oriental Overseas Container Line, Cho Yang  Shipping Co, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui OSK Lines, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Hanjin  Shipping Co, Neptune Orient Lines, DSR-Senator Lines GmbH, Evergreen Marine and Yangming Marine Transport.

The EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said the  fines "show that the  commission intends to act firmly when shipping companies which are members of an association and independent companies make illegal agreements."
In April, the  European Commission renewed for five years the possibility for companies to set up
"consortium agreements" but only when they do not hold a monopoly position.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Tuesday it has  fined fifteen  liner shipping companies a total of EUR7 million for collectively agreeing not to offer discounts from their published tariffs.

The fines are relatively "modest," the Commission said in a statement, because "an agreement not to discount is less damaging that a price-fixing cartel."

TD
It also reflects the fact that the agreement was only in place for three years and was abandoned in
1994 due to the  Commission investigation into the agreement.
The companies were members of the now-defunct Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges
Agreement.

They include Hapag-Lloyd AG (G.HPL) of Germany, Denmark's Maersk Sealand and P&O Nedlloyd of the U.K., which were  fined EUR368,000, EUR836,000 and EUR1.2 million. The P&O Nedlloyd  fine is larger because it reflects the fact that it was before the merger of P&O and Nedlloyd.

BRUSSELS, May 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it had  fined 15 liner         shipping companies a total of just under seven million euros ($6.34 million) for agreeing not to offer discounts from their published tariffs.

The companies involved were members of the now-defunct Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (FETTCSA), and include Germany's Hapag-Lloyd AG , Denmark's A.P. Moeller and Britain's P&O Nedlloyd .

TD
The Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, said the fines were modest because an agreement not to discount is less damaging to competition than a price-fixing cartel.

"Shipping lines operating within  liner conferences benefit from an exceptionally generous exemption from the normal  European competition rules," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

"It is important that a conference is faced by effective competition from independent  shipping lines operating outside the conference. The FETTCSA case shows that the Commission will act firmly where conference and non-conference  shipping lines conspire togther as a cartel."

FETTCSA was formed in June 1991, but abandoned in 1994 after the  Commission said it was investigating its activities.

It was made up of members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference and its primary competitors. Its members were essentially the same as the parties to the  Europe Asia Trades Agreement, the Commission said.
FETTCSA members had a combined market share of more than 80 percent between northern  Europe
and the Far East.
The fines imposed were as follows: CMA CGM SA - 134,000  euros Hapag-Lloyd Container Linie GmbH -
368,000 euros Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd - 620,000 euros A.P. Moeller Maersk Sealand - 836,000
euros Malaysian International Shipping Corp - 134,000 euros Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd - 620,000  euros
Neptune Orient Lines Lines - 368,000 euros Nippon Yusen Kaisha - 620,000 euros Oriental Overseas
Container Line Ltd - 134,000 euros P&O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd - 1,240,000 euros Cho Yang
Shipping Co Ltd - 134,000 euros DSR-Senator Lines GmbH - 368,000  euros Evergreen Marine Corp
(Taiwan) Ltd - 368,000 euros Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd - 620,000  euros Yangming Marine Transport Corp
- 368,000 euro

The Commission said the level of  fine imposed on P&O Nedlloyd reflected the fact that the infringements took place before the merger of P&O and Nedlloyd. ((Michael Mann, Brussels newsroom, +322 287 6830, fax +322 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

RAGING STORMS SHUT ARGENTINE PORTS, DELAY GRAIN.

BUENOS AIRES - Heavy winds and rains whipped up water levels and waves Tuesday in Argentina's chief ports, shutting two and triggering delays in grain shipments, officials said. A four-day tempest dumping up to 7.8 inches (200 mm) of water on Argentina's central-east Pampas growing region has closed the ports of Necochea and La Plata in the thick of the harvest season, said Marcelo Borgoglio of shipping agent NABSA's operations wing. "In those ports the principal problem is the wind and the high waves," Borgoglio said. In Argentina's largest port complex Rosario and in Buenos Aires, the rains caused delays, he said.
So far 12.9 inches (330 mm) of water have fallen in May, nearly topping the historic high of 13.1 inches
(336.5 mm) for the entire month that was set in 1985.

EGYPT SURVEYS SHIP SUNK WITH NITRIC ACID CARGO.
CAIRO - Egyptian navy divers are surveying the wreckage of a Syrian ship which sank off its
Mediterranean coast after its leaking cargo of nitric acid ate through the hull, an official said on Tuesday.

Environment Ministry spokesman Magdi Allam said divers were videoing the Dalia S, which sank 10 days ago about six km (four miles) from the port city of Alexandria. He said the ministry would later decide whether to salvage what remains of the cargo.

"The situation is under control," Allam said. "Only 18 of the 350 barrels containing acid have been eroded and leaked.

"Fortunately, the direction of the wind and sea currents was not towards the coast but towards the open sea. There is a good chance the acid will be diluted," he added.

spokesman said Wednesday. "Out of the 522 vessels queried, 190 of them were boarded, while 19 of
them were diverted," said the spokesman. "Diverted" vessels refers to those found to be carrying illegal
Iraqi oil. The diverted vessels are sent to one of the Persian Gulf countries where the cargo and the
vessel are auctioned off with the proceeds going into a UN account. The spokesman added that two other
vessels have been detained since May 8 but no further details were available on these.

HD        Hammered: For All Their Glamour, Sotheby's and Christie's Ply a Punishing Trade --- Costs Add
Up When They Include Caviar, Crystal;  An Inquiry  as a Backdrop --- The Shagmobile Stands Out

The great auctions of the 1990s produced a cavalcade of staggering prices and fanfare: Rudolf Nureyev's ballet shoes selling for thousands of dollars; the Ganz family's sale setting the record for an estate auction; Henry Ford II's art collection, which had its own hardbound catalog and a monthlong world-wide tour before fetching $48.6 million.

The only problem: Those and some other headline-grabbing sales were barely profitable, and in some cases money-losing, for the two houses at the center of the action: Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and Christie's International. In Christie's Nureyev auction, one buyer backed away from $2 million in purchases, turning the sale from a profit to a loss.

TD
While federal prosecutors have been poking around in nearly every corner of the auction business, there has been scant attention paid to what may be its dirtiest little secret: It is, by and large, a lousy business. Despite wealthy clients, pricey and prestigious products and high  commission structures, the two major houses struggle year after year to make money, with net income that routinely comes in at less than 3% of sales.

That's true even in strong art markets like the current one. While yearly earnings have been up and down, Sotheby's profits overall have dropped nearly 20% since 1996, even as the volume of art sales it handles has grown 40%. In the first quarter, its loss widened to $29.1 million from $9.5 million a year earlier. Sotheby's puts most of the blame on costs associated with its fledgling Web business, inspired by the success of eBay Inc. Christie's, privately held since 1998, won't comment on its financial condition. In its last decade as a public company, earnings grew an average of 2% a year.

It's increasingly clear that financial pressures were at the root of the events under investigation in the Justice Department's  price-fixing inquiry. People close to the companies point to a single sale in 1994: Christie's auction of artworks owned by dime-store magnate Meshalum Riklis. That sale yielded well under half of the approximately $16 million Christie's had guaranteed Mr. Riklis, triggering an intensive internal review of the company's strategy. Former Christie's Chief Executive Christopher Davidge has told prosecutors that around this time, he was asked to talk to Sotheby's about changing the commission structure, according to people familiar with his account.

In 1995, "we were making no money, I'm sorry to say," says Peter Sutton, who was then senior director of Old Master paintings at Christie's and is now a writer in West Hartford, Conn.

But the problem extends well beyond the time period that is the subject of the government probe. Both houses have been plagued for decades by the same woes: extravagant expenses and a revenue stream that is deeply dependent on uncontrollable forces -- the "three D's" of death, debt and divorce that send great collections to the block. The rivalry between Christie's and Sotheby's, with one house sometimes doing deals at a loss simply to win business from the other, hasn't helped. Nor, at least so far, have efforts to diversify, from Christie's 1993 purchase of a huge Asian art dealership to Sotheby's Internet venture.


Page 13 of 41 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It is a tough business," concedes William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's president and chief executive. The high costs involved are "something you are challenging and questioning all the time."

Both houses place high hopes on the big spring sales that began last week, with auctions expected to yield about $250 million at each. But with the stock market jittery, turning the numbers into profits won't be easy, especially given the ever-rising costs of catering to an affluent and often persnickety clientele.

For the latest season, both houses have sent featured paintings on multicity tours and displayed them at a series of lavish gatherings for collectors. At one Sotheby's brunch, guests ladled caviar on their scrambled eggs from a tin the size of a soup bowl.

For its own series of collector receptions this spring, Christie's chose a Manhattan townhouse once owned by John D. Rockefeller. At a recent gathering there, amid the burble of a marble fountain, giant calla lilies stood sentry around dining tables aglow with crystal and white anemones while Impressionist expert Franck Giraud whispered the hard sell on a Picasso portrait: "Magnificent . . . . The flowers seem lit from within, from the heart. She is like . . . a Madonna."

The Picasso was one of seven paintings in the room expected to sell for a total of $75 million. Christie's put up $30 million of its own capital as a guarantee to the sellers of three of the paintings. Of that sum, people close to the deal say, Christie's beat out Sotheby's by guaranteeing the seller of the Picasso about $25 million, though only nine Picassos in the world have ever broken that figure at auction.

"Everything adds up -- staffing, premises, marketing,  shipping," says Kathleen Guzman, former president of Christie's East Inc., the company's lower-priced auction operation, and now head of the fine-art division at eBay. "Plus, there's the overwhelming cost associated with the level of customer service required."
The greater the glitz, it seems, the greater the risk. The art-rich estate of the late jeweler Victor Ganz
and his wife Sally that Christie's sold in 1997 was the highest-grossing estate auction ever, raising more
than $206 million in just two hours, including a Picasso that sold for $48.4 million. But a series of
complex financial deals with the couple's heirs, insurers and major Christie's investors meant that
Christie's barely eked out a profit, according to people involved in the sale. Christie's declines to
comment on the particulars of the sale but says that overall, the house was pleased with the outcome.
To win the Ganz business from Sotheby's, which had long sold art for the family, Christie's cut deals
with each of the couple's four children that included sizable cash advances, according to people close to
the auction. Christie's Great Estates division also bought the Ganzes' Upper East Side apartment for
$3.5 million (and marked it up to $3.7 million), people in the real-estate industry say.

To whip up enthusiasm, Christie's saluted the Ganz "eye" for art in a daylong symposium at which the Ganz children were invited to speak; and it ate the cost of printing a $100 coffee-table book on the couple's collection, with essays by leading critics and curators. Christie's recreated the Ganz living room, down to deep red paint on the walls and the placement of the artworks, at an Upper East Side
townhouse where collectors and dealers were fed truffles and jumbo shrimp, among other delicacies, at presale gatherings.

But, nervous about the possibility of a market downturn, Christie's had assigned much of the upside gains on the sale to a group of private investors who had helped fund the guarantees to the family. So while the auction house's art experts toasted "to the profit sharing" at a champagnedrenched private party after the sale, for Christie's, there was little left.

On the surface, the business model makes some sense. After all, individual works routinely sell for millions of dollars, and total commissions run as much as 40% of the sales price -- up to 20% on top of the final bid from the buyer and 20% from the seller. And right now, the spring sales season is looking rich: The two auctioneers have already handled $400 million in sales between them. Sotheby's -- which unlike Christie's hasn't negotiated an amnesty in the Justice Department probe -- has turned in a
better-than-expected season, with prices around or above those promised to sellers.

But the truth is that most money raised at auction goes to the seller, and that the auctioneer's total take, on average, is more like 13.5%, and that's before administrative expenses. Favored clients generally don't pay full freight, and more expensive merchandise earns lower commissions.

Says Bernard Arnault, chairman of French luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton: The two auction houses "make money on the top [artworks], but they lose money everywhere else." Mr. Arnault, who made a spurned bid for Sotheby's, recently bought the third-largest auction house, London-based Phillips. He says he plans to overhaul Phillips's business model, selling only
high-end goods at live auctions and everything else over the Web. Under the traditional model, he says, "many of the departments are a losing proposition."

In fact, for all the talk about gouging customers that has stemmed from the Justice Department probe, it is often Christie's and Sotheby's that find themselves squeezed by high-maintenance clients.

For the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate -- encompassing thousands of items in four different homes on the East Coast -- Sotheby's tied up hundreds of employees to move, ship, appraise, research, catalog, guard, photograph and otherwise organize the items, though it won the right to sell only
one-tenth of the property. (The rest stayed in the family, went to the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, or was given to charity.) Then Sotheby's deployed its troops to take presale bids and manage the lines of people winding round the company's York Avenue building during the nearly weeklong marathon. In the end, the sale succeeded wildly, thanks almost solely to the Kennedy name, since it contained few prize pieces of art or antiques. Mr. Ruprecht, the Sotheby's chief executive, says the Onassis sale was "highly remunerative."

Savvy dealers, sellers and estate lawyers are increasingly demanding bigger portions of upside gains from sales. Sellers of major collections now often demand that most of the upfront costs of a major sale be absorbed by the auction house, to be reimbursed only if the proceeds surpass a preset amount. Such was the case with Christie's sale last year of the estate of Marilyn Monroe, according to people familiar with the situation.

And as the business has become more international, serving the well-heeled has resulted in a global patchwork of offices -- often in high-rent luxury buildings. Christie's has 119 offices in 41 countries, including a huge townhouse on Paris's Right Bank, a cavernous former parking garage in New York's Rockefeller Center and nearly an entire block in London's tony Mayfair section.

Earlier this year, Christie's relocated its Los Angeles warehouse to retail space in Beverly Hills because of clients' complaints about the long drive to its warehouse in an industrial district near Los Angeles International Airport. Sotheby's also has a huge newly expanded building on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a pet project of recently departed chairman A. Alfred Taubman that will ultimately cost an estimated $151 million.
Both companies have had their good years, and both have also managed to increase revenue over
time. And both have tried to boost profits using guarantees and diversifying into other businesses. While
some of those efforts, such as Sotheby's financial-services and luxury real-estate divisions, have done
relatively well over time, others have yielded mixed results.

Christie's recently shut down its Asian art dealership and dropped plans for a separate Internet auction site. Sotheby's is still waiting for its $60 million bet on the Internet to pay off: The company's sites offer various collectibles, with most estimates ranging between $100 and $100,000, as well as selected
high-end art and antiques. One recent standout was the Shagmobile from the movie "Austin PowersThe
Spy Who Shagged Me," which sold for about $54,000.

Still, the business faces the same kinds of problems today that it did in the mid-1990s, when officials of the two companies began a series of meetings that prosecutors believe resulted in an agreement to fix commissions. When Sir Anthony Tennant, former chief of Guinness PLC, joined Christie's as chairman in 1993, the art market was flat and the company was starting to hemorrhage money.

Sir Anthony, who believed the auction house could be run much as any other business, came in with an ambitious five-year profitability plan -- one that failed to take into account the vagaries of the three D's. It swiftly sank. Then came the collection on which Sir Anthony pinned his hopes for profitability. Mr. Riklis, a friend of Sir Anthony's from his years in the beverage business, was going through a divorce from Hollywood starlet Pia Zadora and the bankruptcy of his chain of dime stores. He opted to sell his art collection, which included a treasured Monet.

The stakes were high: Mr. Davidge, then chief executive of Christie's, wanted to establish an in-house bank to compete with Sotheby's financial-services division. Sir Anthony wanted to offer his friend a generous deal. So Christie's cut Mr. Riklis a guarantee check in advance of the sales for about $16 million. When the auctions flopped, Sir Anthony was humiliated and Mr. Davidge furious. The bank idea was dead, and Christie's needed to look for a profit influx elsewhere.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Davidge has told people familiar with the investigation, Sir Anthony instructed him to meet with Sotheby's Chief Executive Diana D. Brooks to hammer out a new  commission structure. Sir Anthony has declined requests for comment. People close to Sir Anthony say that he neither was involved in the meetings nor ordered them to take place.

Those meetings resulted in identical new commissions, instituted first by Christie's and five weeks later by Sotheby's, that generally raised sellers' commissions and largely did away with the practice of selling prized property for no  commission at all. Because the moves were nearly simultaneous, neither house

Page 15 of 41 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
lost trade to the other. Mr. Taubman and Mrs. Brooks maintain that the discussions with Christie's weren't about commissions, according to people close to them.

The outlook seemed to improve initially. In March 1996, Sotheby's reported that fourth-quarter net had zoomed 55% from a year earlier, and things got better as the decade progressed. But the pressures returned. The Bass family, which had been slowly increasing its stake in Sotheby's, began unloading the shares. Meanwhile, eBay's success-both as an auctioneer and as a hot Internet stockprompted both houses to begin pouring millions into online ventures. Profits began to suffer. Christie's, with an eye to making longer-term investments without pressure for short-term performance, went private.

Now, mounting civil litigation related to the antitrust probe is adding to costs, and the art boom is beginning to show its age. The spring season is half over. The Picasso portrait that Christie's had guaranteed and was touting at the former Rockefeller digs did sell last week -- to an anonymous bidder via telephone, with no competition from among the hundreds of dealers and collectors in the sale room
-- for $26 million, plus the auction house's  commission.

The lack of activity in the silent sale room prompted rumors that the painting hadn't sold at all. Christie's insists that it did find a home. But it was a close call.

BRUSSELS, May 17 --

The European Commission will impose fines on 15 shipping companies from Europe and Asia for agreeing not to offer discounts, commission officials said Wednesday.

TD
The commission, the executive body of the 15-member  European Union (EU), will  fine the 15 a total of 7 million euros ($6.3 million), the officials said.

The companies, which were members of the now-defunct Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (FETTCSA), which operated between 1991 and 1994, include three Japanese companies and companies from South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
The Japanese companies -- Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and Nippon Yusen
K.K. -- were each  fined 620,000 euros ($558,000).
Malaysian International  Shipping Corp. was fined 134,000 euros, Singapore's Neptune Orient Lines
Ltd. 368,000  euros, and Hong Kong's Oriental Overseas Container Line Ltd. 134,000  euros.

South Korea's Cho Yang Shipping Co. was fined 134,000 euros, Hanjin Shipping Co. 620,000 euros, while Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yangming Marine Transport Corp. were each  fined
368,000 euros.

The fine is modest because an agreement not to discount is less damaging than a  price-fixing cartel, the officials said.

"Shipping lines operating within  liner conferences benefit from an exceptionally generous exemption from the normal  European competition rules," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.
"The FETTCSA case shows that the commission will act firmly where conference and non-conference
shipping lines conspire together as a cartel," he said.

According to the  commission, which serves as the EU's antitrust watchdog, the companies in the FETTCSA discussed possible ways of aligning their commercial practices concerning charges and surcharges.
The discussions led to an agreement not to discount from published tariffs, in violation of EU rules, the
commission said.

COMMISSION IMPOSES SEVEN MILLION  EURO IN FINES TO FIFTEEN EUROPEAN AND ASIAN SHIPPING COMPANIES FOR UNLAWFUL AGREEMENT ON LINES BETWEEN EUROPE AND FAR EAST.

Brussels, 17/05/2000 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has decided to impose EUR 7 million in fines on fifteen European and Asian liner shipping companies belonging to the Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (FETTCSA), for having reached an agreement on charges and surcharges on freight transport prices between  Europe and the Far East. Taking into account the size of the companies, the length of the procedure launched in 1992, the fact that the agreement was dissolved in
1994 and that it was not an agreement on prices, the  Commission imposed fines that it considered relatively moderate:

Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd (Korea): 620,000; 15) Yangming Marine Transport Corp. (Taiwan): 368,000.

The FETTCSA groups the ten members of the maritime Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC) and their five main competitors. The fifteen alone control 80% of  liner shipping between northern Europe and the Far East. For the most part, they are the same companies which were party to the agreement Europe Asia Trades Agreement (EATA), banned by the  Commission in 1999.

The FETTCSA set in place in 1991 and dismantled in 1994 related to charges additional to the basic ocean freight. The Commission felt this was not a "technical agreement" as the companies claimed but violation of the European rules on agreements. The agreement within the maritime conference FEFC could benefit from derogation to the ban on agreements, in the context of competition rules applicable to maritime transport. On the other hand, extending the agreement between FEFC members to their competitor was unlawful, concluded the  European competition services.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti declared: "Shipping lines operating within  liner conferences benefit from an exceptionally generous exemption from the normal European competition rules. It is important that a conference be faced by effective competition from independent shipping lines

THE European Commission imposed fines on 15 liner shipping companies this week totalling just under 7 million euro for agreeing not to offer discounts on their published tariffs. The firms involved were members of the now defunct Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreeement, which was abandoned in 1994, and include Germany's Hapag-Lloyd, Denmark's A.P.

member states had already opened up the sector to a much greater degree than required under the Union's 1996 electricity liberalisation directive, but added that the changes had produced 15 individual liberalised markets rather than one truly  European market.

THE Commission said this week that it was investigating whether power giant Electricité de France's contracts with French power company Compagnie Nationale du Rhone broke EU competition rules. Officials said the links between the firms could

contravene the Union's directive liberalising part of the EU's electricity market. The  Commission also warned that France could face more trouble over the way it has implemented the directive.

PLANS by Bertelsmann to buy a 50% stake in Internet bookseller bokus.co from Kooperativa Forbundet have been approved by the  Commission. Bokus, which will be renamed BOL Nordic, sells books over the Internet in Nordic countries, offering publications in Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Norwegian as well as Engli

GERMAN utilities Viag and Veba have offered new concessions in a bid to win regulatory approval for their planned merger, a  Commission spokesman revealed this week, although she did not give any details. The proposals were discussed at a meeting in Brussels between Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and German Economics Minister Werner Mueller earlier this week which focused on another offer made by the firms to sell their stakes in east German power giant VEAG.
THE Commission has

granted the  European Broadcasting Union's handling of television rights for sports events under the Eurovision system an exemption from normal EU competition rules until 2005. Under the  Eurovision system, EBU members jointly acquire broadcasting rights for programmes and exchange them between themselves. For sports events, the union sets rules to govern contractual access for third parties. The Commission said that while the joint acquisition and sharing of rights restricted competition, the system benefite
d smaller countries, allowing them to show more and better programmes.

HD        Brussels Monti lays down law to 'cartel'  lines. WC       446 words

SOME of the biggest names in  liner shipping have been sternly admonished by Mario Monti,  Europe's competition commissioner, in an important antitrust decision.

TD
Brussels will "act firmly" when conference and non-conference carriers "conspire together as a  cartel", Mr Monti warned when imposing  fines on 15 shipping lines.
Ocean carriers penalised for belonging to the former Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges
Agreement expressed surprise yesterday at the level of  fines set by the European Commission.

However, opinion was divided as to whether the ruling and the  fines, totalling nearly E7m ($6.3m), would be appealed.
The lines and their lawyers are still waiting to receive the full judgment on the Far East Trade Tariff
Charges and Surcharges Agreement.

The European Shippers' Council, which lodged a complaint against the agreement in 1994, described the decision as "a wake-up call" to the  shipping industry and urged carriers to discontinue the practice of imposing blanket surcharges on customers.

The commission announced late on Tuesday that  fines would range from E1.24m on P&Oand E836,000 on Maersk Sealand, down to E134,000 on the, smaller lines found guilty of competition infringements.

The initial reaction from one prominent carrier was to accept the decision as no legal principle was involved, rather than spend time and money challenging the verdict through the courts.

Other lines, though, are thought to be considering an appeal against  fines considered as high in view of the fact that the agreement was dissolved six years ago after Brussels issued a statement of objections.

The commission, however, described the fines as "modest", reflecting the fact that "an agreement not to discount is less damaging than price fixing".

The 15 lines agreed in the early 1990s not to offer discounts from published tariffs for ancillary items such as the currency adjustment factor, bunker adjustment factor and terminal handling charges.

Those involved included members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference at the time, plus the five leading independents in the  Europe/Asia trades.

Commenting on the ruling, Mr Monti explained that  shipping lines belonging to a  liner conference already benefit from exceptionally generous exemption from the normal competition rules.

However, Philip Ruttley, a partner with the law firm Rowe &and a maritime law expert, questioned why the decision had been delivered so long after the event and why  fines had been levied when carriers had complied with the  commission's statement of objections and disbanded the agreement.

Fines were waived against the same lines that set up the former  Europe Asia Trades Agreement.

HD   COMPETITION/SHIPPING - COMMISSION STINGS SHIPPING LINE CARTEL WITH FINES OF NEARLY EURO 7 MILLION.
WC   890 words

The European Commission on 16 May fined fifteen  liner shipping companies for agreeing not to offer discounts from their published tariffs - which it considered, effectively, as an anti-competitive  cartel. The companies, which were members of the now-defunct Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (FETTCSA), include such heavyweights as Hapag-Lloyd of Germany, Denmark's Maersk Sealand and P&O Nedlloyd of Britain. The  fines total just under Euro 7 million, a modest amount based on the agreements not to discount being less damaging than a price-fixing cartel, the Commission concluded.

TD
Mario Monti, Commissioner for Competition, said "shipping lines operating within  liner conferences benefit from an exceptionally generous exemption from the normal European competition rules. It is important that a conference is faced by effective competition from independent shipping lines operating outside the conference. The ETTCSA case shows that the Commission will act firmly where conference and
non-conference shipping lines conspire together as a cartel". In its decision, the  Commission said that it found that the agreement of the former FETTCSA firms not to offer discounts was an infringement of Article
81(1) of the EU Treaty, governing restrictive business practices, that it did not fall within the block exemption for  liner conferences. Moreover, an individual exemption under Article 81(3) was not possible.

Fines.

The Commission calculated the  fines on the basis of its published guidelines on fining. A horizontal price agreement between competitors with high market share should normally be considered a "very serious" infringement attracting  fines of at least  Euro 20 million for each company, the  Commission estimated. In this case, however, it was appropriate to consider the infringement as "serious" and to set a basic level of fine (for the largest company) at the lowest end of the normal scale of  Euro 1 million to 20 million for "serious" fines. This is because an agreement not to discount is less serious than fixing actual prices, the Commission has no evidence as to the effects of the infringement on actual price levels, and any harmful effects of the infringement are likely in any event to have been short-lived. The EU executive also took into account the fact that the FETTCSA agreement was abandoned after the companies received a statement of objections in 1994, that no more meetings took place after the Commission's Competition
Directorate-General sent the companies a warning letter in 1992. The Commission also received some co-operation from the firms which does justify a reduction in  fines under the Commission's notice on the non-imposition or reduction of  fines in cartel cases. Consistent with previous fining decisions, the Commission divided the companies into four groupings in accordance to their size, the companies within each grouping attracting the same level of  fines.

-The Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (FETTCSA) came into force on 4 June
1991 but was abandoned in 1994 following  Commission action. The FETTCSA related to charges
additional to the basic ocean freight. Charges and surcharges can represent a significant proportion of the
total transport cost to shippers.

FETTCSA is made up of members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC)  liner shipping conference and the FEFC's principal competitors. FETTCSA members were also essentially the same as those who were party to the  Europe Asia Trades Agreement (EATA) which was prohibited by Commission decision in 1999. The members of FETTCSA had a combined market share of over 80% between Northern  Europe and the Far East. The decision is addressed to the former members of the FETTCSA which are amongst the largest  shipping lines in the world (CMA CGM of France, Hapag-Lloyd of Germany, K Line of Japan, Maersk Sealand of Denmark, MISC of Malaysia, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines of Japan, Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore, NYK of Japan, OOCL of Hong Kong, P&O Nedlloyd of the United Kingdom, Independent lines Cho Yang of Korea, DSR-Senator of Germany, Evergreen of Taiwan, Hanjin of Korea and Yangming of Taiwan).

Under the FETTCSA, the companies discussed possible ways of aligning their commercial practices concerning charges and surcharges, the  Commission concluded. The companies' discussions led to an agreement not to discount from published tariffs for charges and surcharges. That agreement infringed the cartel prohibition contained in Article 81(1) of the EU Treaty. In its decision, the  Commission rejects the companies contention that the FETTCSA was merely a "technical agreement" which is permitted under the competition rules applicable to  shipping services. -.

Why?is the question some of the world's largest liner shipping companies and their lawyers are asking following last week'sruling by the European Commission on the FarTrade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement.

Why did Brussels take six years to come to a final decision?were lines  fined so much when the commission admitted any harmful effects of the infringement were likely to have been shortlived?were they fined at all when virtually the same group of carriers escaped financial penalties for belonging to the Europe Asia Trades Agreement, even though Brussels outlawed the pact last year. And why were the fines so oddly apportioned, with, for example, Evergreen's half that of Hanjin  Shipping and Maersk Sealand's  fine seemingly out of line with the others?

TD
A lot of questions which perhaps the full judgment may clarify. If not, the inner thoughts of  Europe's competition regulators could remain a mystery since the lines may decide not to appeal the ruling or the fines because of the time and money involved. After all, the Far Eastern Freight Conference appeal against a complaint that dates back more than a decade is only now coming to court with a hearing in early June, just before yet another long-running lawsuit involving the defunct Trans-Atlantic Agreement.

Cargo interests, understandably, are delighted with the  commission's decision to  fine the 15 conference and non-conference container lines that agreed not to discount from their published charges for items such the bunker adjustment factor and currency adjustment factor.

The European Shippers' Council, which brought the original complaint, urged  shipping lines to discontinue the practice of imposing blanket surcharges on their customers.

They did, though, hold out some sort of olive branch, inviting the lines to join in discussions about establishing alternative best practice arrangements to cover sudden or extraordinary cost increases - a sensible proposal. The way in which these levies are calculated should be much clearer.

Looking back at the Fettcsa affair, the lines involved - a dozen members at that time of the Far Eastern Freight Conference and five independents - were clearly foolish to enter into an agreement between conference and non-conference lines.

As Europe's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, rightly points out,  liner conference members already enjoy an exceptionally generous exemption from EU antitrust rules.
To try and push the boundaries out this way was ill-advised.

But the  commission does not seem to have found any evidence about how the agreement may have affected price levels, and indeed concedes there were almost certainly no long-term ill effects.

Brussels said an agreement not to discount prices was less damaging than  price fixing,  and accordingly set what it described as modest  fines.
They are at the lower end of the scale within the "serious infringement" category as defined in the
commission's new guidelines on the size of  fines.

Certainly, the sums may look small compared with the amount levied on Taca members, but they still range from e134,000 ($131,000) to e1.24m.

Page 30 of 41 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Let's look at the circumstances. Fettcsa was disbanded within a month of the  commission issuing a statement of objections in 1994, some three years after the agreement came into force. The  commission also acknowledged that no more meetings of agreement members took place after Brussels sent a warning letter in 1992. Furthermore, regulators said they received some cooperation from parties when investigating the case.

So why, especially when the  liner shipping industry is still waiting for a set of guidelines promised nearly two years ago,  fine the companies at all?clarification can be given through the decision without having to inflict financial penalties. The industry clearly got the message nearly a decade ago that cartels of this
kind were unlawful, and the world of  liner shipping has moved forward since then.

But perhaps most importantly, some sort of timetable should be established so that companies receiving a statement of objections to certain industry practices do not have to wait for the best part of 10 years before judgment and sentencing. Even the law courts don't take that long to come to a decision. In this case, the shipping lines had no idea the case was still open until word surfaced a few weeks ago. Greater transparency about the whole process is urgently needed.

THE 15 shipping lines fined a total of E7m ($6.4m) for their membership of the former Far East Trade Tariff Charges and Surcharges Agreement (Fettcsa) in the early 1990s are in two minds about whether to appeal the ruling.

TD
The European Commission announced its decision in mid-May more than six years after issuing a statement of objections, but the full judgment had not been received by the weekend.

Not until the carriers involved and their lawyers have had a chance to study the legal arguments can any final decision be taken about whether there are grounds for appeal.

But a straw poll of lines revealed mixed views. Mindful of the length of time the Far Eastern Freight Conference and Trans-Atlantic Agreement cases have taken to reach court, and the huge amount of management time and legal expenses involved, some lines are clearly reluctant to take the matter any further.
Others, though, feel they cannot afford to just pay up what amounts to a sizeable sum, despite the
commission's description of the  fines as modest.

The case dates back to 1991 when members at that time of the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC) joined forces with five independent carriers in the  Europe/Asia trades to form an agreement designed to establish a common mechanism for setting ancillary charges and surcharges such as the bunker adjustment factor, the currency adjustment factor and terminal handling charges - items that fell outside the basic tariff for intermodal rates.
These lines together had a market share of over 80% on the container trades between northern  Europe
and Asia.
The agreement was never formally notified to Brussels, although a copy was sent to the  commission. The European Shippers' Council lodged a formal complaint against Fettcsa in 1994, and in April that
same year the commission issued a statement of objections.

The lines responded to that statement in September 1994 but had already decided by then to dissolve the agreement.

Indeed, as the commission noted in a press release issued immediately after its decision earlier this month to impose fines, no more meetings of Fettcsa members took place after the competition directorate had sent a warning letter in 1992.

The carriers caught up in this dispute then assumed the matter was closed, as nothing more was heard from the commission until earlier this year when word surfaced that the imposition of  fines was being considered.

These were duly announced two weeks ago, and ranged in size from E134,000 for CMAMalaysia International  Shipping Corp, Orient Overseas Container Line, and Cho Yang  Shipping; to E368,000 for Hapag-Lloyd, Neptune Orient Lines, DSR-Senator, Evergreen and Yangming Marine; E620,000 for Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui OSKNippon Yusen Kaisha and Hanjin  Shipping; E836,000 for Maersk
Page 32 of 41 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sealand; and E1,240,000 for P&Owith the latter reflecting the fact that P&Oand Nedlloyd Lines operated separately in this trade at the time.
The commission based the fines on newly published guidelines, with the infringement falling within the
"serious"midway between what are regarded as minor infringements, and very serious breaches.
Recommended fines for the serious category usually range between E1m and E20m.

The commission said that a horizontal agreement between competitors with high market share would normally be considered "very serious", attracting  fines of at least E20m for each company.
In the case of Fettcsa members,  fines were set at the lower end of the "serious" category.

In a statement, the  commission said the decision to only impose "modest"  fines reflected the fact that the 15 lines pledged not to offer discounts from their published tariffs for ancillary services, regarded as less damaging than a  price-fixing cartel.

The commission also said it had no evidence as to the effects of the infringement on actual price levels, and that "any harmful effects of the infringement are likely in any event to have been short-lived".

The commission also took into account the fact that Fettcsa members abandoned the agreement after receiving the statement of objections, and that some co-operation from the parties was received, albeit limited. The fact that the proceedings had been so lengthy was also taken into account.

The fines were calculated by dividing the companies into four groups according to their size, but the numbers have caused surprise. Evergreen, for example, is one of the biggest container  shipping lines in the world on a par with P&Oand yet has been  fined much less than several smaller carriers.

When the 15 carriers found guilty of antitrust breaches originally set up the agreement, they thought what they were doing was lawful as Fettcsa appeared to fall within the definition of a technical agreement
under Article 2 of Regulation 4056/86 that lays down the rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 to maritime transport.

Technical agreements allow, for example, for "the organisation and execution of successive or supplementary maritime transport operations and the establishment or application of inclusive rates and conditions for such operations" and for "the establishment of uniform rules concerning the structure and the conditions governing the application of transport tariffs".

The original purpose of the agreement between conference and non-conference lines was to produce a common mechanism for calculating and setting charges and surcharges other than for ocean and inland freight, but the fact that the parties apparently agreed not to offer discounts from their published tariffs went beyond the definition of a technical agreement and was the reason for the financial penalties.

Announcing the decision to impose fines, Europe's competition commissioner Mario Monti said that shipping lines operating within liner conferences benefit from an exceptionally generous exemption from the normal European competition rules.

"It is important that a conference is faced by effective competition from independent  shipping lines operating outside the conference,"Monti warned.
"The Fettcsa case shows that the commission will act firmly where conference and non-conference
shipping lines conspire together as a cartel".

What surprised those caught up in the Fettcsa case is that the  commission last year outlawed the former Europe Asia Trades Agreement, a capacity management pact between virtually the same group of FEFC members and independent carriers, but did not levy any  fines.

No secretariat or representative body for the former Fettcsa members exists any more. However Lovell White Durrant is expected to sound out those threatened with  fines about whether or not to appeal either individually or collectively once the judgment has been studied.The 15 lines facing  fines from the European Commission have yet to decide if they will appeal against the ruling.

Freight rates still are allowed to rise

After pushing a few years ago for the Fair Trade Competition Board to counteract the setting of unfair freight rates by overseas shipowners, Thai shippers have heard nothing about the board exercising its authority to deal with irrational successive freight increases.

Recently, the Asia Westbound Rate Agreement announced a rate rise of $350 per 20ft equivalent unit for goods shipped from Asia to northern  Europe, effective on Aug 1. It claims an imbalance between inward and outward shipments on certain routes due to increasing volumes from Asia to  Europe, resulting in opportunity costs incurred. But the following should be noted:-The pricing strategies of shipowners are set in terms of agreement or arrangement using a price adjustment merry-go-round from country to country and from region to region. Freight rates tend to stay up rather than go down, except on routes where there is fierce competition.

- The number of ships owned by shipowners increases each year, as do orders for new ships, implying a growing marine transport industry even during economic downturns. Fluctuating demand it is not a case of supply and demand, but usually redistribution, where overall freight supply should be managed in accordance with the different demands of ports region-wide.

- Despite the existence of freight arrangements/agreements, the global marine transport industry has left individual shipowners facing unbalanced configurations of demand and supply rather than co-operating to fill gaps. This might be a tactic to demand freight rises.

- As long as there is no mechanism to deal with this unfair practice, it is possible that countries whose shipping industries are strong enough could make use of this arrangement to take advantage of other countries.

Shippers must bear rising rates caused by such things as higher bunker oil costs. We call on the Fair Trade Competition Board to deal with unfair freight rises by shipowners through their untouchable (cartel) agreements. Under general competition laws, collaboration to justify freight rates over demand and supply structures across the region is permitted if this benefits shippers. But an arrangement (or  cartel) to raise freight rates without reason should be curbed.
How can Thai shippers survive and remain competitive, particularly during time of crisis? Can the Fair
Trade Competition Board look into this matter?

Remember a film based on the Watergate scandal? All the President's Men is about the infamous wiretapping by the ruling Republicans under Richard M. Nixon's presidency.

All the president's men, agents hired by the Committee for the Re-election of the President, were caught red-handed while breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate apartment-office complex in Washington in June 1972. They were later convicted of burglary and political espionage.

Senate hearings were held to probe allegations that the White House officials had tried to cover up their involvement in the break-in. The Supreme Court ordered Nixon to surrender recorded tapes sought by the special Watergate prosecutor for use in criminal proceedings. Three of these recordings documented Nixon's personal order to cover up the Watergate scandal. It was the relentless Robert Woodward and
Carl Bernstein, Washington Post journalists, whose reports partly contributed to the downfall of the president. Nixon chose to resign in August 1974 on the point of being impeached by the Congress, as had already been recommended by the house judiciary committee.

In Thailand, a determined whistle-blower who made allegations against politicians is the target of an illegal telephone tap. It was he who brought the case to the police and unveiled to the public how government officials abuse their power and intrude on the privacy of Thai citizens. The ruling Democrats immediately came out to accuse unidentified parties of plotting to sabotage their party's reputation. Mr Clean, the prime minister, softly said that his government had no policy to eavesdrop on people.

Was that a bomb Chuan dropped at the feet of someone else? A phone tap happened a few years back under another administration. According to a recent plea bargain, a former chief of national intelligence made a public apology to Ekkamol Khiriwat, former secretary-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission. All the damaging allegations he made against the latter were based on telephone eavesdrops admittedly authorised by the former.

Had this type of scandal been exposed in Japan or the US, we would have seen politicians (with a grain of conscience) resign en masse. The first to go would be the prime minister. The jigsaw is very easy to piece together. The Telephone Organisation, as the name suggests, is a state enterprise under the supervision of the Democrat minister of communications. The target of the espionage has been a pain in the neck of the disgraced Democrat interior minister. Placing a tap at the telephone exchange, an illegal act, could not have been possible without unlawful authorisation from a powerful source, and without the help of a TOT inside job. I am afraid that a TOT fall guy whom the record shows made several trips to the bugging site, might serve as an easy scapegoat for all the prime minister's men.

Even though the former national intelligence chief did not go to jail, and Nixon was pardoned by his successor Gerald Ford, these two episodes have one thing in common: Our citizenry shall never enjoy full liberty while Big Brother watches us despite the guarantee of Article 37 in the constitution.

If the next prime minister of Thailand happens to be a business wizard who got rich so quickly from his hi-tech communications monopoly, let the Thai people beware. Your "interactive" cable TV and mobile phone services, not to mention other hi-tech gear to be introduced later, could be perfect conduits through which Big Brother can bug you.

THE former Trans-Atlantic Agreement was not a legally recognised freight conference but a means of subverting outside competition by offering traditionally independent carriers flexible membership terms, the European Commission said in court yesterday.

Instead of creating stability on the North Atlantic as the members claimed, the TAA sought the "outright elimination of competition", Richard Lyal of the commision's legal service told the  European Court of First Instance.

The 15 shipping lines that formed the TAA in 1992 are appealing against a  commission decision that the agreement was not a conference because it distinguished between types of members, and had a two-tier tariff. Brussels also said the TAA's multimodal tariff and capacity management agreement infringed Regulation 4056/86 which sets out how  Europe's competition rules should be applied to maritime transport.

The TAA was amended several times in the early 1990s under guidance of the  commission and subsequently replaced by the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement whose members have already been fined, and with more penalties threatened if the court rules that Brussels was entitled to lift the lines' immunity from  fines.

Members of the TAA are not thought to face  fines, but the case before the court should help to clarify the interpretation of Regulation 4056 that is being disputed in several lawsuits.

Challenging the assertion of both Brussels and  European shippers that the regulation does not extend conference lines'  price fixing  anti-trust immunity to inland haulage, John Pheasant of the law firm Lovells read to the court several letters from major  European companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, written in the 1980s in support of both the conference system and door-to-door freight rates.

He also cited a submission from a dozen  European governments and Japan to the US House of Representatives maritime sub-committee in 1981 confirming widespread and "unequivocal" backing for intermodal rate-making by conferences.
The timing of these expressions of support is important, Mr Pheasant said, as in 1986 the  European
Council of Ministers adopted Regulation 4056.

To suggest that the regulation did not cover an activity for which there was both commercial and political support, without telling anyone, "is simply not possible in democratic  Europe", Mr Pheasant said on behalf of the TAA lines.

However, Mark Clough, representing the Freight Transport Association and the  European Council of Transport Users, questioned the level of support for the  liner conference system among shippers by pointing out that ICI had been one of the most vociferous opponents of the TAA as freight rates doubled in the early 1990s.

He also raised the issue of whether the open-ended block exemption for  liner conferences under
Regulation 4056 should remain.

However, Mr Lyal said the  commission was not seeking to change the regulation, but ensure it was applied in a manner consistent with the law.

Mr Pheasant reminded the court of market conditions that prevailed in the years prior to the formation of the TAA, with founder members seeking to end volatile prices and restore stability.

He refuted allegations that the carriers themselves were responsible for the situation by investing unwisely and injecting too much surplus capacity on to the North Atlantic.

But Mr Lyal claimed the lines were trying to free themselves from market disciplines and did not want to be penalised in any way for wrong business decisions or inefficient operations.

By attempting to extend the scope of the anti-trust exemption, carriers were trying to transfer on to shippers their entrepreneurial risks, something they can only do if they have market power, Mr Lyal asserted.

Denis Waelbroeck, representing the European Community Shipowners' Associations and and Japanese Shipowners' Association, questioned what the commission was hoping to achieve in this case, bearing in mind that freight rates had halved in recent years and that profit margins were so low.

Bankrupting carriers would lead to industry concentratron, with the inevitable outcome of reduced services and higher prices, he warned.

The commission decided against the TAA in 1994, but the court of appeal is only now reaching the oral stage after a delay while a dispute before the English High Court covering some of the same issues was concluded. However, that case involving the former Sunag conference was settled out of court.

The TAA case overlaps to some extent with the Far Eastern Freight Conference case on multimodal freight rates that was heard on Wednesday.

HD      Liner Shipping Resolution in sight as conferences challenge  Brussels. WC    1,612 words

OCEAN carriers that set intermodal freight rates collectively in  Europe through the conference system are now in sight of a legal ruling on whether this practice, that dates back to the 19th century, is lawful.

TD
They will also hear if those  shipping lines that continued to quote prices for inland haulage, after the
European Commission accused them of infringing EU competition law, risk being  fined.

The issue that has divided the  liner shipping industry for more than a decade finally reached court last week when judges sitting in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg heard three separate but
inter-related appeal cases brought by the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC), the Trans-Atlantic
Agreement (TAA), and the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA).

The oral pleadings follow decisions by the  European Commission, all of which are being challenged in the courts by member lines who are seeking legal clarification of the regulations that set out the scope of antitrust exemption for  liner conferences.

The judges did not indicate when they will deliver their verdicts, but these may not be the end of the dispute since either side could still appeal to the higher Court of Justice.

The purpose of  shipping conferences, of which there are several hundred in nearly every trade lane, is to ensure market stability for customers by requiring lines to guarantee sailings and sufficient capacity, regardless of market conditions at any one time. In exchange for providing this level of service, member lines are allowed to set ocean rates together in order to prevent predatory short-term pricing during weak market conditions. Such cartels are designed to benefit shippers when cargo volumes are strong by adhering to the published tariff rather than taking advantage of space shortages to lift prices.

But support for this system has been declining among many customers in recent years, with shippers preferring to negotiate directly with the carrier of their choice rather than having to work through a centralised conference.

Differences first surfaced in the late 1980s when the German shippers lodged a complaint against the Far Eastern Freight Conference in April 1989, alleging that the conference was not entitled to fix prices for the inland leg of a door-to-door move, only the ocean leg.

This is the case that finally reached court last week when oral pleadings against the Brussels decision of December 1994, which found the FEFC in breach of Article 5 of Regulation 1017/68, was heard by three judges.

The length of time the case, number T-86/96, has taken to reach this stage reflected the fact the carriers on the North Atlantic formed the Trans-Atlantic Agreement in 1992, a far more controversial pact that has absorbed much time of the  commission's competition directorate over the past eight years. The commission ruled in 1994 that the TAA's  price fixing  and capacity management programme infringed Article 85(3) of the EC Treaty. The TAA was not covered by the block exemption for liner conferences under Regulation 4056/86 which sets out how  Europe's competition rules apply to shipping, since it was not a liner conference, the  commission argued. This was because the tariff contained two rate levels to cater for the different types of member lines, and because inland rates were not covered by the block exemption either.

An appeal for the annulment of the decision was lodged in December1994, with the Court of First Instance granting a suspension of the  commission's decision three months later pending a final decision from the court.

Oral pleadings in this case, number T-395/94, were also heard last week immediately after the FEFC hearing, with other factors again holding up the legal proceedings. By the time the  commission had decided the TAA was in breach of EU competition rules, 15 transatlantic carriers had formed the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement, a revised version of the TAA, which was notified to  Europe's competition authorities in July 1994. This agreement proved to be even more provocative than its
unpopular predecessor, and has been revised on numerous occasions in a bid to gain official acceptance. The latest amended version is still being studied by the competition directorate.

The commission ruled two years ago that Taca had abused its dominant position and  fined member lines a record E273m ($260m). Both that decision and the  fines are being appealed, but are unlikely to reach court for some time.

What Taca was challenging last week, through case T-18/97, was the right of the  commission to lift the carriers' immunity from  fines for inland rate-setting.

The fines already imposed by Brussels do not cover any penalty for pricing inland haulage collectively. But former EU competition commissioner Karel van Miert was so incensed by what he regarded as a flagrant flouting of the law by Taca members, which continued to price inland haulage collectively, that the commission ruled in November 1996 that  fines could still be imposed, even though the agreement had been notified to the authorities for approval.

This removal of their anti-trust immunity was also contested in court last week, and is probably the most important of the three cases.

For although carriers say they need a legal ruling on whether door-to-door rate-setting is lawful, conferences serving Europe have already withdrawn their multimodal tariff and many senior executives privately doubt if carriers will ever want to restore collective inland transport freight rates, whatever was said in court last week.

But the possibility that carriers could be  fined even more for continuing with their intermodal tariff after Brussels told them to stop is a far more serious prospect, and one on which the lines urgently want a court ruling.

Much of the legal argument centred around which regulation should have been applied when determining whether or not the Taca lines were protected from the threat of  fines because of the fact they had filed the agreement with the  commission.

The commission applied Regulation 1017/68 which covers rail, road and inland waterways, and which has no specific provision for immunity from fines if companies are found guilty of operating an illegal cartel, whereas lawyers representing the shipping lines argue that Regulation 4056/86, covering the application of EU competition rules to maritime transport, was the correct regulation to use.

Since the carriers do not provide inland haulage separately from ocean transport, Regulation 1017/68 was the wrong set of rules to apply, lawyers said.

Senior executives from Atlantic Container Line, Maersk Sealand, P&O Nedlloyd and Hapag-Lloyd were in court to hear the three cases, along with representatives from the  European Shippers' Council.

Opening the pleadings, the FEFC's lawyer, Philip Ruttley of Rowe & Maw, described the case as the most important in  liner shipping to date. Accusing the  commission of applying the wrong regulation, he said Brussels had as a result imposed an unworkable regime on the industry. He went on to argue that the commission was also mistaken when it applied the same definition of maritime transport, as accepted in Regulation 4055, which covers freedom to provide maritime services, with Regulation 4056 covering competition rules. Instead, the  commission should apply the same interpretation as in Regulation 4057, as accepted in an anti-dumping case against Hyundai Merchant Marine some years ago.
Any other definition "would do violence to the legal architecture" of  Europe, Mr Ruttley told the court.

But Richard Lyal of the  commission's legal service challenged Mr Ruttley's pleading, arguing that there was no need to extend Regulation 4056 to inland haulage since Regulation 1017 was already in place.

He also dismissed claims that inland rate-making was indispensable as far as maintaining market stability was concerned.

Some of the debate in the three cases concerned whether lines in the two conferences had maintained reserve capacity to cater for market peaks, one of the mainstays of the conference system, or in fact had excess capacity in the trades resulting from their own poor investment decisions.

The TAA case revisited the discussion about how the phrase "common or uniform" should be interpreted, a critical issue for Atlantic carriers who had introduced a two-tier tariff to allow for the fact that participants included traditional conference carriers working alongside carriers that usually operated on an independent basis.

John Pheasant of the law firm Lovells, speaking for the Atlantic carriers, went over the background behind the formation of the TAA in 1992, with a price war in the 1980s devastating the trade and influential European exporters writing in to support stable conditions that would ensure service continuity.
Many shippers also extolled the benefits of multimodal pricing in the 1980s, as did most major  European
governments just prior to the adoption of Regulation 4056.

In such an environment it was inconceivable that the  European Council would limit the regulation to ocean transport without telling anyone, Mr Pheasant asserted.
That "is simply not possible in democratic  Europe", he said.

Mark Clough of Ashurst Morris Crisp, representing the Freight Transport Association and the  European Council of Transport Users, intervened in support of the defendants in the FEFC and TAA cases, while Denis Waelbroeck of the Brussels Bar represented the  European Community Shipowners' Associations and the Japanese Shipowners' Association when he intervened on behalf of the applicants.Richard Lyal of the commission's legal service challenged Mr Ruttley's pleading that any other definition "would do violence to the legal architecture" of  Europe, arguing that there was no need to extend Regulation 4056 to inland haulage since Regulation 1017 was already in place.
