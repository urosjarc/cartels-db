P&O AND Stena, which this month unveiled plans to merge their cross-Channel operations, are among a group of five  ferry operators expected to be  fined by the European Commission this week for allegedly operating a price  cartel in 1992.

The commission is due to impose the penalties, based on findings by its competition department, at its weekly meeting on Wednesday. In addition to P&O and Stena-Sealink, the case involves Brittany Ferries, Sea France and North Sea Ferries. P&O has rejected the allegations.

TD
According to commission sources, the five companies agreed in 1992 to impose a surcharge on
cross-channel freight shipments to compensate for the effects of sterling's devaluation. The surcharge
was to cover the higher costs faced by the companies after the pound's exit from the exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992 and its decline in value against other European currencies.

However, according to commission sources, after about two months the companies began offering rebates to offset the surcharge. The commission launched its lengthy investigation after a complaint from the Freight Transport Association. The association later said that full competition had been restored to the routes.

Although the size of the  fines will not be decided until just before the commission meets, the sources said they would be "more than symbolic". Nevertheless, given that it is alleged the cartel lasted only lasted a short time, the penalties are unlikely to be in the same league as the hefty fines imposed in recent high-profile  cartel cases.

Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert last year imposed  fines totalling nearly #400m. In an attempt to encourage companies to co-operate with EU investigations, he has offered to reduce penalties for whistle-blowers.

The commission's decision to pursue the  ferry case, even though the alleged  cartel lasted just a short time, is another sign of this crackdown. However, critics argue that EU investigators should be concentrating on bigger anti-trust cases.

The commission has the power to  fine companies up to 10% of their turnover for breaking EU rules outlawing agreements that restrict competition.

A ferry operating cartel between five companies in the waters around the British Isles is expected to be fined by the European Commission on October 30. The size of the  fines on Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Stena-Sealink, Brittany Ferries, Sea France and North Sea Ferries has not yet been decided, but is not expected to be harsh, considering the restrictive agreement was just for a short space
of time in 1992. It is, however, within the Commission 's power to impose  fines of up to 10% of a company's annual turnover. P&O of the UK and Sweden's Stena Line have only recently agreed to join forces on three routes in the English Channel in an offensive against the powerful Channel Tunnel. P&O will hold 60% of the merged  ferry unit P&O Stena Line and Stena will have 40%.

THE European Commission is expected to set  fines this week on five  ferry companies operating out of the UK accused of operating a price  cartel in 1992.
The five companies involved are P&O, Stena and its then pooling partner, SNAT, Brittany Ferries and
North Sea Ferries.

TD
EU anti-trust investigators found that the five companies colluded in setting freight surcharges to compensate for the devaluation of Sterling after Britain left the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992.

The inquiry followed a complaint about the surcharge of about 9% from freight shippers. Two months after the surcharge was imposed the  ferry companies started to offer rebates to offset its impact.

The EU has been taking a tough line on  price fixing  in recent times. But sources in Brussels said that because the surcharge lasted only a short time the level of  fines was not likely to be punitive.
But the commission, which can impose  fines rising to 10% of turnover, warned that while the  fines
imposed will not be enormous, they will be more than just symbolic.

Sources said the commission had to consider the depth of the infringement against EU competition rules as well as the period of time covered.
None of the companies was prepared to comment. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1996.

TWO companies running  ferry services from Ireland will be  fined today by the  European                  Commission for operating a price,  cartel across the British channel in 1992.
Stena Line and Brittany will learn the level of the  fines to be imposed following a meeting of European
Commissioners.

TD
EU anti-trust investigators found five companies - including P & O, Sea France and North Sea Ferries
- had agreed to impose a surcharge on cross-channel freight shipments in 1992 to compensate for
the effects of the devaluation of the British pound.
Commission sources said yesterday that the largest  fine would be imposed on P & O.

Although the Commission can impose  fines of up to 10% of turnover, the level of penalties depends on a number of factors.

In this case, the "cartel" did, not operate for a long period and sources indicated last night that this would be taken into consideration.
However, the sources warned that the level of  fines would not merely be "symbolic".

The EU investigation was launched following complaints from freight companies about the surcharges. It is understood the  ferry companies disputed the allegations.

A spokesman for Brittany Ferries said last night it had not yet been informed of the  fines. However, he said that, if the company was  fined, it would appeal the  fine.

Stena Line, which was then known as Stena-Sealink, said it could not comment until the Commission issued its decision this morning.

Earlier this month, P & O and Stena Line of Sweden unveiled a plan to merge their Channel  ferry businesses and vowed to fight competition from the Channel tunnel. The two companies, whose profits from the Dover-Calais corridor have been radically cut because of a fierce price war with Eurotunnel, said a priority would be to reduce costs.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (AFP) - The  European Commission has decided to impose nearly half a million dollars in fines on five ferry companies it said engaged in  price-fixing on freight operations in 1992, a spokesman said Wednesay.

The companies are P and O of Britain, Stena Sealink of Sweden, the Anglo-Dutch firm Northsea Ferries, and Sea France and Brittany Ferries.

Respectively, they were  fined 308,000 dollars, 77,000, 19,000 and 46,000 for each of the two French firms, the spokesman said.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (AFP) - The European Commission has slapped 645,000 ecus (840 million dollars)
in fines on five ferry companies for operating a price cartel on cross-channel freight operations in 1992.

The companies -- P and O of Britain, Stena Sealink of Sweden, the Anglo-Dutch firm Northsea Ferries, and Sea France and Brittany Ferries of France -- were found to have agreed on the level of a special surcharge on freight rates to account for the devaluation of the pound after its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992.

TD
The surcharge, equivalent to a five-percent increase in freight rates, was introduced in October and remained in place until the end of the year.

Because of the limited application of the surcharges the commission opted for only moderate  fines. It has the power to demand up to a tenth of a company's annual turnover.

P and O and Stena Sealink were  fined respectively 400,000 ecus (520,000 dollars) and 100,000 ecus (130,000 dollars), as they were judged to have been the instigators of the action, which the others then followed.

The fines were not expected to be substantial, however, as the alleged  cartel did not last long.
One source said they would total less than one million European currency units ($1.26 million). The Wall Street Journal said on Monday EU anti-trust investigators had found that the companies
agreed to impose a surcharge on cross-channel freight shipments in 1992 to compensate for the
effects of the devaluation of the British pound.

The Commission launched an inquiry following a complaint from freight companies about the surcharge.
The Commission can impose  fines rising to 10 percent of turnover. (c) Reuters Limited 1996

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuter) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European              Commission on Wednesday:

Spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said the European Union and the United States would begin a two-day meeting intended to set the stage for an eventual open skies agreement. She said the European Union, despite Portugal's absence, would speak as one. She also said the United Kingdom, although not a signatory to the original mandate, had been very helpful in establishing the EU common position.

TD
Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said the Commission, during its weekly meeting, had adopted the 7th report on structural funds but that discussions on economic and social cohesion would be postponed to next week's meeting.
Vale de Almeida said the Commission had decided to set a  fine of 625,000 Ecus on five  ferry
companies operating out of the UK accused of operating a price  cartel in 1992.
He also said the Commission had taken measures to restructure DG XVIII due to the expiry of the
European Coal and Steel Community in 2002.

Vale de Almeida said the Commission had taken no new decision on the situation in Zaire since the last briefing and General Affairs Council.

In response to a question, spokesman Patrick Child said no decision had been taken on the legitimacy of French proposals to include a payment from France Telecom's pension fund to reduce its public deficit in order to qualify for Economic and Monetary Union.
Child said a small minority of countries on a European statistics advisory committee had argued against
France being allowed this tactic, but a final decision was likely to be made before November 6.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuter) - The  European Commission decided on Wednesday to  fine five ferry companies a total of 645,000 Ecus ($816,800) for operating a price  cartel on cross-channel freight shipments in 1992.
The European Union executive named the five companies as Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation
Co (P&O), Stena-Sealink, Brittany Ferries, Sea France and North Sea Ferries.

TD
Britain's P&O was given the biggest  fine of 400,000 Ecus followed by rival Stena-Sealink which must pay 100,000 Ecus.
These two firms were "the main instigators of the practice", initiating and organising the joint action, the
Commission said.

Saying they had played only a minor role, it  fined Brittany Ferries and Sea France 60,000 Ecus each and North Sea Ferries 25,000.

The Commission, which sees cartels as the most serious restriction of competition, said it imposed the fines because the companies in 1992 agreed to impose a surcharge on cross-channel freight shipments to compensate for the devaluation of the British pound in September 1992.

The levies were introduced in November that year at identical rates and with the same method of calculation. It said the infringement of EU rules lasted until the end of 1992.

"In spite of the very limited success and the short application of this surcharge, the Commission considered that the companies effectively developed a concerted practice (contrary to EU rules)," the Commission said.

The cartel was only partly successful because of the reluctance of clients and it lasted only for a short time, which explained the "moderate penalties," the Commission said.

The fines were in proportion to the firms' responsibility and to their turnover in the market concerned, it said.

The surcharges were introduced between Britain and France for P&O, Stena-Sealink, Sea France and Brittany Ferries and between Britain and Belgium as well as the Netherlands for P&O and North Sea Ferries.
The Commission has the power to  fine firms running cartels up to 10 percent of their turnover.
In an attempt to clamp down on cartels, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has pushed up
fines.

In 1994, the Commission took action against cartels in steel beams, carton board and cement, with the total fines of 484.4 million Ecus amounting to more than in any previous year. ($1=.7897 Ecu)

LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuter) - Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co (P&O) said on Wednesday that the European Commission's decision to  fine it more than any other  ferry company for operating a price cartel on cross-channel freight shipments reflected the size of its freight business.

"We would like to put the record straight by stating quite clearly the reason P&O has been  fined more than any other  ferry company is purely based on no other reason than it is in proportion to the amount of freight revenue that each  ferry company generates," said a P&O spokesman.

TD
"Obviously we have the lion's shares of the freight business, hence our being  fined more than anyone else," he added.
The European Commission announced earlier that it was fining five  ferry companies a total of
645,000 Ecus ($816,800) for operating a price  cartel on cross-Channel freight shipments in 1992.

Britain's P&O was given the biggest  fine of 400,000 Ecus followed by rival Stena-Sealink, which must pay 100,000 Ecus.

P&O and four other cross-Channel  ferry operators were fined a total of more than #500,000 by the
European Commission yesterday for operating a price-fixing accord.

The Commission levied the largest  fine of #320,000 on P&O, as the instigator of a  cartel that it found had colluded in November 1992 to soften the impact of the pound's devaluation by imposing a surcharge on freight.

TD
The arrangement, which operated for only two months, was deemed to breach article 85 of the Treaty of Rome, which covers the single market. Stena-Sealink, which was held to be a co-instigator, was ordered to pay #80,000. The three other companies, Sea France, Brittany Ferries and North Sea Ferries played only a minor role and were  fined #48,000, #48,000 and #20,000, respectively.

Karel Van Miert, the Competition Commissioner, said: "The simultaneous application of the surcharges was only partly successful because of the reluctance of the clients to the measure, and was of short duration. That is why the Commission decided to impose moderate penalties on the  ferry companies, while establishing higher  fines for P&O and Stena-Sealink as they initiated and organised the concertation by taking the contacts and developing the calculation scheme for the tariff increase."

Separately, P&O reported better news on its short-sea Channel crossings, with 2.67m passengers travelling on the Dover to Calais route, the one most severely hit by the opening of the Channel Tunnel, in the three months to September, 6.8% down on the same period last year. This compared with a
12.1% fall between the three months to June and the equivalent period in 1995.

The number of tourist vehicles carried fell 9.5% in the third quarter (11.2% dip in the second quarter). The drop in freight traffic eased to 3.6% (6.9%).

HD    COMPETITION - COMMISSION FINES FIVE FERRY COMPANIES FOR 1992 PRICE CARTEL. WC   432 words

Five ferry companies were fined a total of ECU 645,000 by the  European Commission on October 30 for operating a price-rigging cartel on cross-Channel freight shipments in 1992. The five companies, P&O of the UK, the Swedish-owned Stena-Sealink, Sea France and Brittany Ferries of France and UK-Dutch North Sea Ferries were found to have acted in contravention of Article 85 of the EU Treaty, which outlaws restrictive business practices, and  fined according to the extent of involvement in the  cartel, and market share.

TD
The two biggest cross-Channel  ferry operators P&O and Stena-Sealink, which the Commission considered to be the "main instigators of the practice", were given the biggest  fines of ECU 400,000 and ECU 100,000 respectively. Having played only a minor role, Sea France and Brittany Ferries were told to pay ECU
60,000 each and North Sea Ferries ECU 25,000.  Fines were imposed by the Commission because the companies agreed to impose a surcharge on cross-Channel freight shipments to compensate for the sharp depreciation of the Pound Sterling against other EU currencies when it left the European Monetary System exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. The surcharges were introduced in November of the same year at identical rates and with the same method of calculation, between the UK and France for P&O,
Stena-Sealink, Sea France and Brittany Ferries and between the UK and Belgium as well as the
Netherlands for P&O and Stena-Sealink. The Commission believes they lasted until the end of the year.

In spite of the only partial success of the  cartel because of opposition from customers, and its very limited duration, the Commission said the companies had still acted in clear infringement of EU competition rules. But it described the  fines, for these reasons, as "moderate". In theory, the Commission has the power to impose penalties of up to 10% of a company's annual turnover. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is also well known to consider  price-fixing cartels as the most serious infringement of competition rules.

The higher penalties visited on P&O and Stena-Sealink was justified by the Commission on the grounds that they took the contracts and worked out the formula for calculating the tariff increase, while the other three ferry lines simply "followed their competitors". The Commission nonetheless acknowledged that all five companies continued to "coordinate themselves afterwards in order to assess their clients' reactions".

fine of ECU 400,000, followed by rival Stena-Sealink which must pay ECU 100,000.

Brussels said it had imposed the  fines because the companies in 1992 agreed to impose a surcharge on cross-Channel freight shipments to compensate for the devaluation of the British pound in September of that year. The levies were introduced in November at identical rates and with the same method of calculation.

TD
The cartel was only partly successful because of the reluctance of clients and it lasted only for a short time, which explained the "moderate penalties", the Commission said. Reuter, Brussels.

P&O WAS yesterday  fined #320,000 by the European Commission for its part in cross-Channel  ferry price fixing.  As predicted in the Guardian last week, the fine was levied against P&O, Stena-Sealink, Sea France, Brittany Ferries and North Sea Ferries, which started a two-month price  cartel in 1992 to overcome lost revenue when the pound was devalued.

The cross-Channel ferry operator P&O suffered a double blow yesterday as the  European                 Commission fined it for operating an illegal  price-fixing cartel and new figures showed that it was continuing to lose passengers and freight customers to Eurotunnel.

P&O was one of five  ferry companies fined a total of 645,000 ecus (#508,000) by Brussels for illegally levying a surcharge on freight customers in 1992 to offset the effects of a devaluation in sterling.

TD
The fines, though small, were nevertheless an embarrassment to P&O, which received the heaviest penalty, being ordered to pay 400,000 ecus. The other  ferry operators fined were Stena-Sealink, Britanny Ferries, Sea France and North Sea Ferries.

Meanwhile latest figures showed that P&O's passenger numbers on the Dover-Calais route fell by just under 200,000 to 2.67 million during the key summer tourist period of July to September.

The number of tourist vehicles carried was down by just under 10 per cent to 1.15 million while there was a 3.6 per cent decline in the volume of freight handled by P&O to 295,000 units.

In the first nine months of this year passenger numbers are running at 6.765 million - nearly 900,000 down on the same period in 1995.

P&O said, however, that the rate at which it was losing business to the Channel Tunnel was slowing down. In the third quarter passenger numbers were down 7 per cent year on year compared with a 12 per cent decline in the second quarter.
Investors were unsettled by the trading news. P&O's deferred shares dropped by 12.5p to 607p. Earlier this month P&O also announced that it was merging its cross-Channel  ferry business with that
of Stena Line in a move expected to produce #75m of cost savings.
P&O has also merged its container business with Nedlloyd and acquired 100 per cent ownership of
North Sea Ferries by buying out Nedlloyd's 50 per cent interest for #25m.

According to reports yesterday the Malaysian shipping conglomerate, KPB, is interested in buying P&O Tankships, the group's 18-strong fleet of carriers. The ships operate in the short-sea routes around the United Kingdom and Europe, carrying refined products.

TWO ferry companies which run services out of Ireland have been  fined more than #120,000 by the
European Commission for operating a  cartel across the English Channel in 1992.

The two companies - Stena Line and Brittany Ferries - have been  fined almost #78,000 and #47,000 respectively Stena Line, then known as Stena Sealink - was singled out as one of the main culprits in initiating the  cartel.

TD
The other chief "culprit" was, P & O which the Commission has  fined #310,000.
The fines relate to a period late in 1992 when P&O, Stena Sealink Brittany Ferries, Sea France and
North Sea Ferries agreed to impose a surcharge on English Channel freight shipments.

"To compensate for the effects of the devaluation of the British pound in September 1992, these companies agreed, in October, to similarly raise their tariffs," the Commission said in its findings reported yesterday.

The surcharge was introduced in November 1992, at identical rates and with the same method of calculation between Britain and France, for P & O, Stena Sealink, Sea France and British Ferries.
It was also introduced between Britain and Belgium, as well as the Netherlands, by P & O and North
Sea Ferries.

The Commission said it considered the infringements lasted until the end of 1992. It said the introduction of the tariffs was only partly successful because the  ferry companies' clients resisted the move. It also lasted a short time.

The Commission said that, for this reason, it had decided to impose moderate penalties on the companies, while establishing higher  fines to P & O and Stcna. The Commission ruled that Sea France, Brittany Ferries and North Sea Ferries had followed P & O's and Stena's lead. It said the five companies continued, however, "to co ordinate themselves afterwards in order to assess their clients' reaction".

A spokesman for Brittany Ferries said last night that the company was very unhappy with the Commission's findings and was "consulting with its legal advisers to decide on the appropriate response".
Stena Link said it would wait until it got the full decision before commenting.
Sea France was  fined #46,600 - the same as Brittany Ferries - while North Sea Ferries was lined
#19.500.

FINES OF ECU 645,000 TO FIVE  FERRY COMPANIES WHICH HAD TAKEN PART IN A  CARTEL ON FREIGHT PRICES IN 1992.

Brussels, 30/10/1996 (Agence Europe) - The spokesman has announced that the  European Commission has decided to impose  fines on five ferry companies - P&O (United Kingdom), Stena-Link (Sweden), Brittany Ferries (France), Sea France (France) and North Sea Ferries (Netherlands and United Kingdom) which had reached a mutual agreement in 1992 to impose a common monetary surcharge on their freight operations.

TD
Despite the very partial success and the short duration of application of this tax, the Commission
considered that these companies had taken part in a concerted practice contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty.
It therefore decided to impose a  fine on these companies in proportion to their responsibility and to their
turnover on the market concerned. P&O and Stena Sealink have been  fined ECU 400,000 and 100,000
respectively in fines because they were the main instigators of the practice. As Sea France and Brittany
Ferries only played a minor role, they will have to pay a  fine of ECU 60,000, while North Sea Ferries will
have a fine of ECU 25,000 to pay.

-- PROTON PLAN TO DOUBLE LOTUS CAR PRODUCTION

The Malaysian car maker, Proton, plans to boost Lotus car production immediately after taking control of the luxury car and engineering group.

The deal involving a 64 million pounds stg package, includes 13 million pounds stg in the form of a loan to cover immediate working capital to keep the business afloat. Proton's plans including doubling the production of the Lotus Elise sports car at Hethel in Norfolk from five to 10 a day as well as developing an assembly facility in Malaysia.
-- PRU DEFENDS PENSION COMPENSATION RECORD

After coming top of a Personal Investment Authority list of companies with the poorest records of dealing with the pensions mis-selling matter, the Prudential, Britain's biggest insurer, has defended its record and insisted that it is not dragging its feet. The PIA documents showed that the Pru had identified more than
41,000 priority cases, but has so far only contacted 10 of them. A Prudential spokesman said the figures do not reflect the work that they have put in, sending out 663,000 questionnaires with only 307,000 replies.
-- BAA CHARTS THE WAY TO 'OPEN SKIES'

In an attempt to pave the way to an "open skies" deal between Britain and America, BAA, the airport operator has made provisional plans to accommodate more American airlines wanting to use Heathrow. The plans, which should see another 20 to 30 daily takeoff and landing slots offered to meet the initial demand from airlines, and the resumption of talks between the British And American governments over a new transatlantic pact have raised hopes that the way will be cleared for official approval of the British Airways and American Airlines alliance.

The Bank of England has warned banks and investment firms about the dangers of making lending decisions rashly and of overpaying their top performers. The concerns of the Bank together with the Securities and Investments Board are outlined in a report, 'The Financial Stability Review' which is a joint venture between the two.
-- 'FEEL-BETTER' FACTOR MATERIALISES IN TIME FOR ELECTION

A report from Business Strategies, the economic consultancy that has close links with the Treasury and the CBI, out today, shows that consumer optimism is running at its highest level of the 1990s and could
be even higher by the time of the general election. Although the report acknowledges that consumers are feeling "pretty good" over the whole country, it stops short of the long sought after "feel good" factor.

Page 34 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Commission yesterday fined P&O and four other cross-Channel  ferry operators more than 500,000 pounds for operating a price-fixing accord. The largest  fine of 320,000 pounds was imposed on P&O as the instigator of the cartel. The Commission found that they had colluded in November 1992 to soften the blow of the pound's devaluation by imposing a surcharge on freight.
THE GUARDIAN
-- DAVID LLOYD LEAVES WHITBREAD

David Lloyd has parted company with Whitbread just 14 months after Whitbread bought Lloyd's leisure business for 200 million pounds stg and he agreed to help run it. A rift had been growing between Lloyd who coaches the British Davis Cup tennis team and Whitbread's chief executive Peter Jarvis over the running of the business.
-- MORE PRESSURE ON GAS AS PRICE WAR ERUPTS

Calortex, a joint venture between Calor and Texaco, and United Gas have started a price war in the gas industry putting renewed pressure on British Gas, although it is believed that the company is reconciled to losing considerable market share and not expected to join in the price war in the near future. Calortex
said it would offer savings or around 70 pounds stg on the average 300 pounds stg household bill and United Gas are planning on fixing gas prices until 2001. The move coincides with British Gas chairman Richard Giordano stepping up his campaign for a radical reappraisal of the regulatory system.
-- LABOUR TO KEEP 3 PER CENT POWER LEVY TO DRIVE GROWTH OF GREEN ENERGY

The Shadow minister for energy, John Battle, said yesterday that Labour will retain a 3 per cent levy on electricity bills after 1998 to stimulate the market for green energy, with the aim of achieving 10 per cent of total production by 2010. Speaking at a conference organised by the Parliamentary and Sustainable
Energy Group he said that legislation and regulations would be changed so that energy efficiency and the social obligations of electricity suppliers were recognised.
THE INDEPENDENT
-- BASE RATE RISE SENDS THE POUND SOARING

The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke introduced a surprise increase in base rates yesterday up a quarter of a percentage point to 6 per cent. Following the decision the pound went soaring on the foreign exchanges to its highest level for two and half years. But shares and gilts fell sharply. Clarke predicted that the economy would grow by more than three per cent next year and insists we take on risks with inflation. Some analysts believe that the rise could put a halt to the tentative recovery in manufacturing.
-- BLOODIED SAINSBURY PLEDGES COMEBACK

Sainsbury reported a 14 per cent drop in half-year profits to 387 million pounds stg yesterday, with the petrol price war, lower margins, increased customer service costs and the costs of its Reward loyalty card being blamed. David Sainsbury, the chairman, said that the recent rise in market share from 12.3 to 12.5 per cent showed that the supermarket was beginning to claw back the ground lost to rival Tesco.
-- PENSION VICTIMS WAIT ON REGULATOR

The Personal Investment Authority, who are responsible for a speedy review into the pensions mis-selling scandal, has still not contacted almost 70,000 "orphan clients". The PIA has so far sent out 8,000 questionnaires to the orphan clients who are former policy holders of independent financial advisers who have gone bust since 1988 or were refused admission into the regulator when it was formed in 1990, and expects to send out a further 60,000 by the end of the year.

STOCKHOLM, Oct 31 (Reuter) - Swedish  ferry operator Stena Line on Thursday blamed interrupted freight services and the English Channel price war for deeper losses in the first nine months of 1996 but said the tide would turn in 1997.
Stena Line posted a loss after financial items of 251 million crowns ($38 million) for the nine months to
September 30 compared with a profit of 272 million crowns in the corresponding period a year ago.

TD
The company repeated earlier forecasts that it would post a loss of around 450 million crowns for the full year 1996 against 201 million crowns profit in 1995.

But chief executive Bo Lerenius said the worst was now over, with freight services on the Irish Sea running normally and a newly announced merger with Britain's P&O aiming to hit back against fierce competition from Eurotunnel on the Channel crossing.
"We have bottomed out," Lerenius told Reuters. "We will improve substantially next year."

Asked if the company would return to profit, Lerenius said: "I am not willing to comment on that yet publicly".

Stena Line said its losses in 1996 were partly due to comprehensive tonnage reallocations resulting from delays in ship deliveries and associated running-in problems.
However volumes increased during the third quarter on the Holyhead-Dun Laoghaire run.
"The two HSS 1500 ferries delivered to date are operating successfully and without interruptions in the
Irish Sea," the company said in a statement.
But the more widely publicised problem faced by Stena Line was its battle to defend its position on the
English Channel in the face of fierce competition from the Anglo-French Eurotunnel that opened in late
1994.
About 25 percent of Stena Line's turnover comes from the Dover-Calais route across the Channel. Although passenger numbers on the Channel rose 12 percent to 8.9 million in the nine months and
cars by 14 percent to 1.7 million, prices have been cut to compete against tunnel which slashed car
tariffs by half in June.

Stena Line's sales slipped 6.5 percent in the nine months to 7.07 billion crowns although exchange rate movements were blamed for a seven percent fall in sales.
The result was as expected by the market and the Stena share moved little, slipping 0.40 crowns to
28.60 crowns by 1110 GMT.

But Lerenius said the merger of Stena Line and P&O's cross-Channel  ferry business from early next year, unveiled earlier this month, would help Stena maintain, if not boost, market share.

The merger vehicle, P&O Stena Line, owned 60 percent by P&O and 40 percent by Stena, will cut costs and improve services and scheduling but still needs official approval to proceed.
Page 36 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Once we have this behind us it will help," Lerenius said.

"The severe price competition in the English Channel continues. The joint venture will improve the result in the first year (1997), but even more so in 1998."

Earlier this week Stena was among a group of five Channel  ferry operators fined by the European    Commission.

The commission fined the operators a total of 645,000 Ecus ($816,800) for breaching EU competition rules by operating a price  cartel on cross-Channel freight shipments in 1992 to compensate for the effective devaluation of the British pound. ($1= 6.55)

From Nigel Tutt, Brussels

FIVE  ferry lines have been fined a total of Ecu645,000 ($816,455) by the  European Commission for operating an illegal price-fixing cartel in 1992 on freight services between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

TD
The fines were calculated on each company's alleged responsibility and 1992 freight turnover.

They included Ecu400,000 against P&O and Ecu100,000 on Stena-Sealink, which the commission's investigation found to be "the main instigators" of the  cartel.

SeaFrance was told to pay Ecu60,000, Brittany Ferries Ecu60,000 and North Sea Ferries Ecu25,000. These three were said to have played a minor role.

The companies are deciding whether to appeal. Brittany Ferries said: "We are most unhappy with this decision. With our legal advisers, we are considering an appropriate response."

Industry sources and analysts said the reprimand was fairly mild in anti-trust terms. They suggested it could be quickly forgotten, now that the UK government has changed its rules to allow co-operation between ferry companies. A merger of P&O and Stena Line  ferry interests has been submitted for approval, and a pact with Brittany Ferries is under discussion.

A statement in Brussels said of the 1992 collusion: "In spite of the very limited success and the short application of this surcharge, the commission considered the companies effectively devel-oped a concerted practice contrary to article 85 of the treaty."

The lines agreed in October 1992 to raise their tariffs in a similar way to compensate for the effects of devaluation of the pound, when Britain left the EU's exchange rate mechanism. The surcharge began in November.

HD        STENA COUNTS COST OF TUNNEL FARES CONFLICT. BY         By Julian Bray

THE true impact of the price war fought between the Channel tunnel and  ferry companies emerged yesterday as Stena Line forecast it expected to lose SKr450m ($68m) this year.

The prediction came as Stena said it had suffered a SKr523m decline in results for the first nine months of the year, down to a loss of SKr251m compared with a profit of SKr272m in the same period a year earlier.

TD
The results underline the pressure on Stena and arch-rival P&O to cut costs and streamline their services in the face of Eurotunnel's decision to halve prices this summer.
In October, the two  ferry companies said they had clinched a framework deal to form a joint company
P&O Stena to operate on the key Channel routes.

They hope to have the new joint operation approved by regulators and running in time for next summer's peak season.

Stena Line chief executive Bo Lerenius said he felt results would improve strongly next year, but would not be drawn on whether the  ferry firm expected to return to profit.

"I think there will be a big improvement in profits next year from the present result," he said. Asked whether Stena would move back into the black, he added: "I am not willing to comment on that yet publicly."
Stena blamed the slump in results on the Channel price war and partly on the late delivery of its two
HSS 1500 fast ferries for its Irish Sea route.

"Operational disruptions and the competitive situation in the English Channel have led to the group's profit after net financial items for the third quarter being cut by more than half," Mr Lerenius said.

He said losses were also caused by "comprehensive tonnage reallocations resulting from delays in ship deliveries and associated running-in problems". Group revenues fell to SKr7.07bn from SKr7.57bn despite passenger numbers rising by 8% to 13m, largely due to exchange rate effects.

Much of the rise in volumes was driven by increased capacity on the key Dover-Calais route after the break-up of Stena's pool agreement with French  ferry operator SNAT at the start of the year.

Overall passenger numbers on  ferry routes around the UK rose by 12% to 8.9m, while Scandinavian passengers fell by 1% to 4.1m.

Despite the delays in delivery of the new fast ferries, passenger numbers on the Irish Sea route between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire rose by 8% in the third quarter.

Mr Lerenius admitted the poor results had eroded the group's financial strength. "The loss for the period coupled with a high investment level has brought about a deterioration in the group's financial position."

P&O said on Monday that passenger numbers on its ferries fell 6.8% in the third quarter, although the fall was less sharp than over the previous three months.

Earlier this week, P&O and Stena were  fined in a landmark ruling by the  European Commission for operating an illegal  price-fixing cartel in the aftermath of the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism four years ago.

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke surprised the City by raising base rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday to
6%, leaving the financial markets expecting further increases in the run-up to the election. Nearly 4,000
company directors - four times as many as thought - have been associated with more than 10 failed
companies, said business information group CCN. The UK's first biotechnology "business angels" fund,
launched on Tuesday, aims to inject up to #50m into university and hospital science. The fund is backed
by Chris Evans, the biotechnology entrepreneur behind three quoted companies. The number of full-time
employees in the UK is unlikely to rise despite a forecast 1.5m new jobs over the next 10 years, according
to a government-funded study. Former Labour chancellor Lord Healey said a single European currency
would be "a disaster economically and politically" and would cause riots in the streets.

TD
The CWU postal workers' union will hold urgent talks with the Post Office after a ballot on industrial action showed support for strikes in the run-up to Christmas. The Confederation of British Industry rejected Labour suggestions that economic "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliers should be represented in company boardrooms. UK supermarkets are selling food produced in developing countries by farmers working for unacceptably low wages in dangerous conditions, according to charity Christian Aid. It claims to have found "punishing" work conditions, pesticide poisoning, low wages and discrimination.
COMPANIES

Karrimor, the UK mountain sports equipment concern, is to receive a #7m capital injection from 21 Invest, the investment company of Italy's Benetton and Bonomi families, which will gain control of the group. Shares in Watson &Philip, the convenience store and food distribution group, tumbled 45 1/2 p to 420 1/2 p after it warned that investment in new delivery systems had failed to generate sufficient sales, resulting in profits this year at "the lower end of market expectations". The #2.8bn flotation of Alliance &Leicester, the UK's fourth largest building society, is likely to produce windfall pay-outs of more than #1,000 each for
2.4m savers and borrowers. Meanwhile, a Somerset pensioner is forming a members' action group to protest that the decision to pay all members a "flat rate" of 250 shares each is unfair to those with large sums and long-standing membership. UniChem said it was confident of beating the "conservative" estimate of savings of #20m a year if its #641m bid for Lloyds Chemists, the high street retailer, was successful. Northern Electric, the electricity supplier for the north-east of England, faced its second hostile bid in two years as CalEnergy, a US independent power producer, launched a #766m offer. CalEnergy also scooped 12.88m Northern shares - nearly 13% - at its offer price of 630p a share, in a dawn raid. Analysts said Northern may have a tougher time fighting off this bid than the one by Trafalgar House two years ago. Dieter Bock, chief executive of the Lonrho conglomerate, exercised an option to sell his 18.3% stake in the group to Anglo American, South Africa's biggest company, for #257m. At the same time he resigned as chief executive to become non-executive deputy chairman. Bock ousted Lonrho founder Tiny Rowland from the board last year after almost three years of battles about the group's direction. Cider producer Matthew Clark, which had seen its share price halved in six weeks, received a cautious
response to plans for regaining sales lost to "alcopops". But a 17 1/2 p rise in its share price to 317 1/2 p was overshadowed by the death of chairman Michael Cottrell. Malaysian car manufacturer Proton took majority control of Lotus Cars, with an 80% stake shared by Proton and its chairman, Tan Sri Yahaya Ahmad. The deal values the UK sports car and engineering concern at about #64m. Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli, who bought Lotus from General Motors of the US three years ago for about $50m (
#32m), will continue to hold the remainder. Water companies that have cut back on investment face pressure from Ofwat, the industry regulator, to curb price rises next year. Ofwat director-general Ian Byatt

said he welcomed efficiency savings but warned companies against running risks of "failing to comply with quality and environmental obligations because of delays in expenditure". Zeneca, the UK's third biggest pharmaceuticals company, was confirmed as one of the fastest growing businesses in its sector as it reported nine-month sales up 14% to #4.1bn. Supermarket group J. Sainsbury brought forward board changes in an effort to stem criticism of its management. The announcement that Dino Adriano is to replace Tom Vyner as chief executive of the supermarkets business in March, instead of the end of 1997 as planned, came as the company reported a 14% fall in interim pre-tax profits to #393m. Ferry company P&O was  fined #320,000 by the  European Commission for operating a cross-Channel price-fixing cartel. Smaller  fines were levied on Stena-Sealink, Sea France, Brittany Ferries and North Sea Ferries. P&O's cross-Channel  ferry business continued to contract during the third quarter in the face of competition from the Channel tunnel, but the rate of decline slowed, the company said.

Body Shop, the environmentally-led cosmetics manufacturer and retailer, is to revamp its products and store formats to attract higher-spending customers. The #282m acquisition of British Bus, the UK's largest privately-owned bus company, by motor, bus and finance group Cowie was referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. Shares in Wace Group, the printing company, slid from 134 1/2 p to 69 1/2 p on Thursday - compared with a 12-month high of 284p in the spring - after it issued its second profits warning in six months and announced the sale or closure of several printing plants.
MARKETS

Olive oil futures are among new products being considered by the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange for its newly acquired commodities section. London Metal Exchange chairman Raj Bagri detailed reforms he wants to implement following the Sumitomo copper affair; these include greater transparency, which may involve disclosing information about the ownership of stocks and market positions. The dollar hit a 3 1/2 - year high against the yen on Tuesday, reaching Y 114.92 during Tokyo trading, falling back to Y 114.35 in New York. It opened in Tokyo on Wednesday Y 114.43. US bond
prices surged after the release of figures indicating that tight labour markets were putting little upward pressure on wages.

"AS they initiated and organised the concertation" - the exact words of the announcement by the European Commission - P&O and Stena-Sealink will pay the lion's share of the  fine of Ecu645,000 ($815,000) imposed on five  ferry operators on the Channel.

The share-out is Ecu500,000 for the future  ferry partners, with P&O looking at Ecu400,000 and Stena Ecu100,000. As the others, still in the official wording, merely "followed their competitors" Brittany Ferries and Sea France are due Ecu60,000 apiece and North Sea Ferries coming up behind with Ecu25,000.

TD
To give a full picture, the Commission was penalising the biggest boys as much as the baddest boys, or in its own words it "decided to  fine them proportionally to their responsibility and to their turnover on the market concerned".

For those who might have missed the full horror of this key event, the five are being chastised "for having agreed in 1992 to impose a surcharge on cross-Channel freight shipments".

It is too easy to knock the European Union, but that is no reason not to. On trade with Cuba it can tie itself up in knots of indecision, but on straight cucumbers its powers are mighty to behold.
In 1996 we have carriers using ships facing one using a tunnel, but in competitive conditions which even
A level economics students in the UK would call questionable. And not a cheep out of Brussels.

Yet back in 1992 some of the former tried out their own version of the currency adjustment factor long beloved of liner conferences, for a whole two months. And, after much and lengthy deliberation, Brussels speaks.

It is not damning with faint praise to accept that the carriers did truly transgress the European Union Treaty. None of the accused has denied the charge. But while these beleaguered ferrymen are not crying foul, they would be surely forgiven for crying folly.

There are loads of incidents of  price fixing  the length and breadth of the Union which somehow do not come under eyes of the Rue de la Loi, Bruxelles. They usually involve fixers who, if not under government ownership, are certainly under government protection.

But this habit of swallowing a horse while straining at a gnat is not necessarily the chief cause for concern over future Channel market practices that may emerge.

A bigger bureaucratic block may well come in the definition of the means of carriage, the using of ships or a tunnel referred to above. On this, Commission-watchers of competition policy may have a bit of advice for the maritime world.

Say that one carrier employs a means of transport different from that of all the other carriers in the same market. Under European Union rules, even if it has half the traffic in both freight and passengers in the said market, its pricing policies need not be treated in the same way as those of the other carriers.

So, had the Channel been open for business at the time of the transgression, and had the operator decided similarly to set up a surcharge to cover foreign exchange losses, it need not have been agreeing with anybody - except the operator of another tunnel.

This sounds like a joke. It is not.

One final comment on the relative newsworthiness of the  ferry fines must be made. Sure the sums were small and digestible and, sure the offence was fairly technical rather than a fundamental one.

But how many readers know that while formal fining occurs five to 10 times a year - across all sectors of all countries in the European Union economy - 1996 has been rather quiet for Brussels impositions.
So quiet, in fact, that the  fine for P&O/Stena and friends is the only one for this year. What is going on? (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1996.

TD
Europe on the Internet. The UK Representation of the  European Commission launched its site on the World Wide Web this week. It includes The Week in Europe, which is available from Thursday each week, details of publications and events, how to contact your Member of the European Parliament, local
contacts for information about the European Union, and links to other European Web pages. Visit the page at http://www.cec.org.uk

Single market: effective, but could do even better. The positive results of the single market have been achieved in spite of delays in adopting and implementing important areas of legislation, a report concludes this week. Based on an exhaustive two-year survey, the Commission's Communication indicates that the single market was responsible for creating up to 900,000 extra jobs and lowering inflation by 1-1.5%. These and other benefits would have been even greater, however, if Member States had been more diligent in applying and enforcing the single market measures already agreed, the study says. Drawing on analysis of the survey., the Commission makes a series of policy recommendations for action at national and Community level, to develop the full potential of the single market. These include, in addition to improved enforcement, the reduction of excessive regulation at national level, and further efforts to complete the 1985 agenda in a few key areas, such as taxation, company law, and border controls on persons. EU policy in other related areas, including competition, information and environmental protection, may also require attention. Finally, the Commission calls for a new commitment to make a success of the single market, both at the highest political level, from the European Council in Dublin, as well as from national authorities, European institutions and economic operators.
Growth-oriented taxation.

Member States' tax policies could contribute more fully to the EU's goals of promoting growth and employment if they were coordinated more closely, the Commission suggests in a report approved last week. A tax policy group could improve coordination and identify key initiatives, ensuring that parallel progress was being made in different areas of taxation. The report proposes four priority objectives on which better coordination of tax policies within the Union should be based: limiting fiscal erosion; improving the functioning of the single market; promoting employment; and respecting the environment.
The benefits of a comprehensive approach to taxation policy were recognised by the European Council at
Florence in June.
Confidence Pact for Employment.

The Confidence Pact for Employment, launched by Commission President Jacques Santer in January, has begun to gather momentum, according to an interim report issued last week. Fragile but promising signs of movement are evident, the report says in its review of progress in the Pact's aim of mobilising all the relevant actors in the effort to get people back to work. Great interest has been prompted by the idea of regional pacts, and progress has been made in the job market through sectoral agreements at European level, for example. This process needs to be taken further, however, focusing particularly on four areas: the macroeconomic framework, the single market, employment systems and structural
policies. The report calls on all those involved, from national and regional authorities to private companies and trade unions, to play their part in an integrated approach to employment set out by the Pact. The

Commission hopes that December's European Council at Dublin will take concrete steps to bolster practical support for such measures.

Implementing environmental law. Proposals to improve the implementation of EU environmental law are outlined in a Communication adopted by the Commission last week. More effective implementation is not just a question of taking Member States to court, the report says; more innovative methods are needed, too. These could include developing guidelines to assist Member States in their environmental inspections, and ensuring that Member States have practical procedures to deal with complaints from the public. In line with the subsidiarily principle, the Commission will also examine ways of making sure that representative organisations are guaranteed basic access to the national jurisdictions responsible for the implementation of EU environmental law. At any one time, the Commission has more than 600 environmental infringement cases outstanding against Member States; suspected breaches of environmental law accounted for more than 20% of total infringements last year.
Air transport market takes off.

Consumers now benefit from cheaper fares and a wider choice of routes for air travel as a result of the liberalisation of aviation in Europe, according to a Commission study released last week. The number of routes rose from 490 to 520 between 1993 and 1996, and fares fell on many of the main routes (those served by three of more operators), according to the report into the impact of the third and final stage of liberalisation (1993-96). The proportion of passengers travelling on scheduled flights with tickets at reduced prices increased from 60.5% to 70.9% during the ten years to 1995, and 20 new airlines have opened for business since 1993. Commissioner Neil Kinnock stressed that liberalisation is not an end in itself, and that opening up the market makes sense only if the highest safety standards are maintained and increased competition leads to better services at lower costs. He drew attention to the four areas the report highlights as needing further work: the monitoring of air fares; the lifting of capacity restrictions; the reduction of air transport costs; and improved market access. The Commission's approach to creating a
single market in European air travel, launched in 1987, was phased in three stages to avoid the disruption experienced in the USA's "big bang" liberalisation. After the final stage in April 1997, any EU airline will be able to fly between two points anywhere in the Union.
Structural Funds review.

The Commission adopted the seventh annual report on the Structural Funds this week, covering activities during 1995. For the first time the report includes details on the environment as a factor in regional development and as an area for structural assistance. The Structural Funds represent the largest Community financial transfers in the environment field, totalling an estimated 9.445bn between 1994 and
1999, in the form of investment in environmental protection, training, studies, and incentives for assessing the impact of Structural Funds assistance. Commitment appropriations for the Structural Funds totalled
21.938bn in 1995, which was the year during which the new Member States of Austria, Finland and Sweden were integrated into the structural policies, and the second year of implementing the new programming period 1994-99.
Agriculture Council.

Ministers yesterday agreed measures to provide an additional 500m ECU in aid to fanners adversely affected by the BSE crisis and to reduce beef surpluses. The agreement, which allocates 13.1% of the extra aid to the UK, also includes curbs on the number of male cattle and suckler cows eligible for EU aid and incentives for traditional grass-fed herds.
Trans-European telecom networks.

Support of 18.1 m ECU in Community funding has been approved for 11 telecommunications projects, as part of the trans-European networks. The projects, such as city information highways, telemedicine, distance education and training, and telework and electronic commerce, involve 63 partners in 14 Member States, including four projects with partner organisations in the UK. Community funding is intended to reduce the financial risk of the projects selected, which concentrate on applications and services that correspond to the needs of citizens and smaller companies - the main bottleneck in the telecoms sector.
General Affairs Council.

The Council this week approved the Regulation defending EU companies against the effects of the US Helms-Burton Act on Cuba. Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan described agreement as a historic breakthrough in the development of the EU's capacity to protect its legitimate interests. It would also increase the chances of resolving the EU-US dispute amicably after the US elections, he said. The text of the Regulation is subject to legal and linguistic finalisation. Representatives of the EU and the Republic of Korea signed the first Framework Agreement between the two parties. The agreement covers economic and trade cooperation, political dialogue, and joint action to prevent drug trafficking and money

laundering. The Council also discussed preparations for the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting, which will take place in Singapore in December. Brittan said that the unified position reached by the Council shows that the EU is capable of overcoming internal differences, and that this leadership is good for Europe and for the world. The Council gave full political backing to the Commission's mandate to negotiate an Information Technology Agreement, and welcomed the Commission's proposal for a revised EU offer for a WTO deal on telecoms.
Kaleidoscope of culture.

Ten UK-led cultural projects will share 425,000 ECU in EL' support under the Kaleidoscope programme, the Commission announced this week. The Kaleidoscope programme supports events and cultural projects carried out by networks or partner organisations in at least three Member States, and large- scale European cooperation projects. For 1996, 124 projects will receive a total of 5.58m ECU in EU funding.
Aid approved for Cuba.

The Commission has approved an 8m ECU humanitarian aid package for Cuba. The programme consists of emergency food aid, medicines and medical equipment, which will be supplied in particular to
vulnerable groups of people whose health and nutritional status are suffering a serious decline. The coordinated aid programme will be undertaken by 11 European non-governmental organisations, in partnership with the European Community Humanitarian Office. In a separate decision, the Commission has granted 600,000 ECU in emergency aid for victims of Hurricane Lili, which seriously affected eight out of 14 provinces in Cuba.

Ferry companies fined.

The Commission yesterday announced  fines of 645,000 ECU on five cross-Channel  ferry companies for operating a cartel in imposing a surcharge on cross-Channel freight shipments. The main instigators, P&O and Stena-Sealink, are being fined 400,000 ECU and 100,000 ECU respectively; Sea France and Brittany Ferries will have to pay a fine of 60,000 ECU each, and North Sea Ferries 25,000 ECU. The companies agreed in October 1992 to raise their tariffs on the same basis, to compensate for the effects
of the devaluation of the pound. This amounted to a concerted practice contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty.

HD         SHIPOWNERS URGED TO MAKE USE OF EU COMPETITION LAW. WC        296 words

DESPITE the recent decision by the  European Commission to fine several ferry companies for alleged price fixing,  shipowners have been told they can use European Union competition law to their advantage. Rather than being a straight jacket, competition law can in fact protect the small competitor or a new entrant in a market, the director of European Union and Competition Law, Vincent Power, told a recent IBC seminar.

The EC action against P&O Ferries and others for alleged  price fixing  was seen by many as another example of the  European Commission's unwelcome interference in commercial business.

TD
But Mr Power, a shipping lawyer and a partner with solicitors A&L Goodbody, Dublin, said the law can, for example, allow shipowners access into ports run by competitors. It also means that an owner cannot be forced to take unnecessary port services.
Mr Power cited several cases where, he said, the EC regulations led to fairer trading environments.

For instance, in 1993, Sea Containers successfully challenged Stena Sealink Ports when it was denied access to the Stena-owned UK port of Holyhead.

Sea Containers wanted to operate a fast  ferry service from Dublin in Ireland to the port of Holyhead which would have been in competition with car and freight  ferry services operated by Stena Sealink.

Sea Containers complained that Stena had abused its dominant position when it denied access to an "essential facility" and that Stena had not adequately separated its role as port operator from its role as ferry operator.

Mr Power said that much is heard of  fines being levied because of companies' transgressions but he urged owners to view the legislation more positively and consider how it can be used to advantage.

HD   COVER STORY - SMASHING THE COSY CARTELS. WC  3,025 words

Although the full force of competition has been blowing through most western economies for some years, Ireland has been a good deal slower in tackling the many cosy cartels and informal business alliances which have been forged down through the years. Now, however, a much stronger Competition Authority and a new director of competition enforcement have been given the task of smashing the cosy cartels, and anyone found guilty of anti-competitive practices could ultimately face a prison sentence, writes Kyran FitzGerald. A couple of years ago, the newly appointed Minister for Transport, Energy & Communications, Michael Lowry, had harsh things to say about the "cosy cartels" that he felt existed throughout the
semi-state sector.

In fact, the Irish economy as a whole is arguably still dotted with cartels and informal economic concert parties.

TD
In recent years, however, the climate has begun to change. The long-established practices of trade and professional bodies and of monopolistic utilities and semi-state bodies have been coming under siege.

The stranglehold of the large State-owned airline and utility companies is being gradually smashed while in the private sector, anti-competitive practices are coming under increased scrutiny.

There is, however, quite a way to go. When the Competition Act was passed into law in 1991, people were confident that a new era had arrived in Irish business. Unfortunately it has not worked out quite like that.

During the summer, however, after an extensive, sometimes acrimonious debate, a new Competition Amendment Act was passed and it conferred greatly enhanced powers on the often beleaguered Competition Authority.

Last week, a new enlarged four member authority took office in the knowledge that it now has real powers of enforcement. Alongside the new authority, there is a new Director of Competition Enforcement, Pat Massey, who shows every sign of being keen to make use of his new sharp set of regulatory teeth.
The sharpness of the teeth can be measured in terms of the punishments which the authority and the new
Director of Competition Enforcement can impose.

There is provision in the legislation for a  fine of up to 10% of total turnover in the year prior to conviction to be imposed on a firm found to be in breach of Competition Law.

A firm found to be in breach could also face a damages action taken by an aggrieved party, a firm or individual alleging damage as a result of the anti-competitive behaviour.

The pain may not stop there. A firm found to have broken the national competition law may also face an action under EU Competition Law which also provides for penalties of a similar amount.

Most controversially of all, there is provision for the imposition of a prison sentence of up to two years where a person is convicted of an indictable offence.

This provision appears to have embarrassed Enterprise & Employment Minister, Richard Bruton, who guided the Bill to its conclusion in the Summer.
He was at pains to point out that the prison sentence provision was in the legislation merely as a deterrent. In practice, prison sentences have rarely if ever been handed out for breaches of Competition Law in
Europe.

It is a different matter altogether in the United States where thousands of people have been jailed for breaches of anti-trust law, the American version of competition law. Recently, a group of dentists spent three days behind bars after they had been convicted of having conspired to fix the price of dentures. One extraction too many, it would seem.
Traditionally, events in Ireland have moved at a more gentle, sedate pace.

True, since the 1950s there has been a measure of control over anti-competitive practices. A body known as the Fair Trade Commission was in place though it was largely ineffective.

In 1978, the Mergers & Monopolies Act was passed. This provided that, in the case of sizeable mergers, permission from the authorities was required. This Act was strengthened again in 1987.

It was during the 1980s that the whole issue of competition began to move up the agenda. Across Europe, deregulation and the opening up of stagnant markets became fashionable.
In Brussels, the energetic new Competition Commissioner, Peter Sutherland began moves in the early
1980s which would ultimately lead to the deregulation of the air transport market across the EU.

A shakeup on the Dublin-London air route followed in 1986 with the arrival of Ryanair and an ensuing price war boosting passenger numbers by over 200,000 within less than twelve months.

The issue of competition began to appear on the domestic Irish political agenda. The emergence of the economically liberal Progressive Democrats and the subsequent involvement of the party in government from 1989 helped pave the way for the Competition Act 1991 which was shepherded through the Oireachtas by then party leader and Industry Minister, Des O'Malley.

O'Malley, a former practising solicitor, ironically enough, had particularly strong views about the need to open up the legal profession to greater competition.

The Competition Act was seen as something of a milestone. It was based on existing legislation in force in the United States and the European Community. Firms would be put under an onus to notify any commercial agreements with implications for the level of competition in the relevant market to the Authority.

Examples, here, include exclusive distribution agreements between manufacturers or suppliers and agents or retailers, market sharing and joint purchasing arrangements between competitors and non-compete clauses signed by the vendors of businesses.

The Competition Authority could rely on a huge body of law and a framework of principles, built up over at least three decades at European level.

One of the key powers of the Authority related to proposed acquisitions. Such deals could be referred to it for investigation and approval.
The Authority found itself investigating acquisitions in product areas ranging from petrol to whiskey and tea. It examined a wide range of distribution agreements and carried out a major investigation into the
newspaper industry at the request of the Minister.

During the five year period from October 1991 to October 1996, 1,347 separate agreements were notified to the Authority with a view to securing regulatory approval.

The organisation, however, has suffered from acute staff shortages. As a result, there have been serious delays in reaching a decision on some of the agreements notified.

To date, around 1,065 have been dealt with, leaving around 200 still on hand. In other cases, the agreements have lapsed and some of the firms involved have actually gone out of business.

The former Authority chairman, Patrick Lyons, complained constantly about the lack of manpower and other resources. Such delays, whatever the cause, have contributed greatly to business uncertainty. An ambitious law, imposing heavy demands, but with few resources allocated by central Government.

Some business people have felt that the 1991 Act's main effect was to promote bureaucracy, with the real beneficiaries being the large law firms.

Gerry Grogan, the managing director of John Player & Sons claimed that Competition Law enforcement was completely unsuited to an "embryonic State like Ireland".



Page 52 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others, however, took the view that the new body's powers were actually too limited. This was certainly the view of leading Competition lawyer, Vincent Power, a partner in the law firm, A&L Goodbody. In particular, the fact that the Authority was not given independent powers of enforcement and that reliance was placed on firms or individuals to take cases against companies alleged to be in breach of Competition Law was a particular weakness in the system. In reality, few people would be prepared to bring complaints against firms which were almost by definition in the dominant position in the commercial relationship.

"The 1991 Act was a good idea, but the legislation was pushed through the Oireachtas and a lot of good suggestions were ignored. The new Authority was a Rolls Royce without a decent engine," according to Power.

As a result, the number of actions initiated for breaches of Competition Law amounted to a handful. One rare example was a case taken by a firm called Curtain Tailors against Switzer & Company, Hickey & Co and Brian S. Nolan.

Curtain Tailors had started selling made up curtains direct to the consumer, undercutting the retailers. The firm sought an injunction against the defendants claiming that the defendants had warned various wholesalers that unless they stopped dealing with Curtain Tailors, they would stop doing business with them. It was claimed that this amounted to an attempt to prevent or restrict competition. The action was dropped, though with no award of costs against the plaintiff. "It was a very disappointing outcome," says Curtain Tailors` boss, John O'Connor, who is perhaps understandably not prepared to comment any further.

Plaintiffs like O'Connor faced enormous difficulties proving the existence of anti-competitive behaviour. Many were deterred out of fear of alienating a powerful customer. Some actions were taken only when the plaintiff firm had gone out of business.

The Competition Authority has, however, made its presence felt on a number of occasions, ruling that the Stock Exchange for example has had to drop the old practice of allowing fixed minimum commissions to be charged on dealings in government securities. This was held to amount to  price fixing.

The net book agreement was also held to be illegal opening the way to greater price competition among book sellers. The takeover agreement between Irish Distillers and Cooley Distilleries was also shot down by the Authority, much to the dismay of Cooley's shareholders.

Statoil's proposed takeover of Conoco's Irish operation was also rejected although the takeover was eventually given the go ahead, this summer, after a much revised deal was struck.

In a landmark decision, the Authority held that Independent Newspapers had abused its dominant position when it took a strategic minority stake in its competitor, Irish Press Newspapers. This ruling was not upheld by the Enterprise & Employment Minister, Richard Bruton.
This year, Unilever's proposed acquisition of Lyons Irish Holdings was referred to the authority by the
Enterprise Minister.

To the surprise of many, the deal was approved by the Authority and sanctioned by the Minister, despite the fact that Unilever would end up controlling 60% of the Irish tea market.

Critics pointed to the fact that the tea market was effectively controlled by two major players, Lyons and the Cork firm, Barrys. The tea companies enjoyed large operating margins. In the case of Lyons, margins amounted to 23% in 1995. Margins at Barrys were slightly higher.

The decision is strongly defended by the Lyons managing director, Pierce Butler, who also happens to be the current chairman of IBEC's Competition Committee.

Butler argues that the price of a standard pack of 80 tea bags in Ireland is around 35p less than the price for the equivalent pack in Britain. He also points to the fact that British companies have made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to promote rival brands in the Irish market. (The latest, in fact, being Unilever). Says Butler: "Good margins arise from being efficient."

Interestingly, one of the members of the Authority, Patrick Massey, opposed the majority decision. He is now the new director of Competition Enforcement.

In Massey's view, approval of the acquisition meant a lost opportunity for greater competition in the tea marketplace as Unilever, the world's largest tea company, would almost certainly have pushed hard to establish its Liptons brand in the market.
Instead, the brand was withdrawn following approval of the Lyons takeover.

Cries of inconsistency reached the rafters at the end of 1995 when the Enterprise Minister, Richard Bruton, decided to refer Statoil's proposed takeover of Conoco's Jet operation to the Competition Authority.

The deal as approved would have given Statoil a 27% market share, slightly higher than the 24% held by the market leader, Esso.

The Authority struck down the deal. The key issue was not market share, but the prospect of a reduction in competition following the takeover. The Conoco/Jet stations were charging around 12p a gallon less than competitors at the time of the proposed deal.
Eventually, the deal got the go ahead but only after Statoil agreed to sell some of its existing outlets. In the meantime, however, the then Enterprise & Employment Minister, Ruairi Quinn, in response to
mounting criticism concerning the effectiveness of the existing regime, introduced legislation amending the
Competition Act and following extensive debate, the Competition Amendment Act was signed into law, this
summer.

The legislation provides for large  fines and a prison sentence as well as extending enforcement powers to the new Authority whose staffing is being beefed up. The new Authority has been given a larger budget and has advertised for an in house lawyer and for five economists.

Ironically, Patrick Lyons, who constantly complained about the lack of resources available to the Authority, has not been reappointed as chairman. The decision to replace him with the Ulster academic Professor Patrick McNutt has not come as a great surprise. Relations between the outspoken Lyons and the Enterprise & Employment Minister have been, at best, distant.

The 1996 Act has come in for criticism. Some, particularly in the business world, claim that it is too draconian.

Says Pierce Butler:"I was flabbergasted when I discovered that there was going to be provision for prison sentences in the legislation. This idea has been simply taken straight out of the American legislation."

Butler does concede, however, that the Authority has up to now "lacked teeth" by virtue of its inability to take enforcement proceedings.
Tom Byrnes, the former chief executive of Telecom Eireann, another member of IBEC's Competition
Committee, believes that there is no need for competition regulations in the private sector.

"Ireland is a highly open economy. There are very few areas in the marketplace which are not subject to competition. There are very few places in which people can hide. The panoply of competition regulation is all bureaucracy. The authorities are using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut."

What is needed, in Byrnes' view, is a regulator to cover monopolistic utilities. "I have also suggested that there should be an ombudsman with the power to impose severe  fines and with a budget to employ outside experts where needed as opposed to a director of Competition Enforcement complete with permanent staff."

Vincent Power strongly disagrees with Byrnes' view that the Irish economy is a highly competitive place. In his view, Ireland, by dint of being a small society where people know each other and it is easy to concoct informal arrangements, has more than its share of cartels and informal anti-competitive agreements.
Byrnes believes the 1991 Act has been a lot more effective than people realise. Countless settlements
have been quietly agreed to the benefit of hundreds of client companies. Neither party has been keen to go
public on the matter, the defendant for obvious reasons, the plaintiff because in many cases, they do not
want their direct competitors to know.
Litigation under the 1991 Act is but a tip of a large and growing iceberg, in Power's view.
And the likelihood is that the pressure will now increase greatly. In part, this is due to the amending
Competition legislation now coming into force, in part due to ever growing pressure from Brussels.

Up until recently, it has been assumed that most Irish companies would be unaffected by EU Competition Law, except where they were in a position to bring complaints of anti-competitive behaviour against larger European trade rivals. This was because it was understood that the anticompetitive practise would have to affect trade between EU member states before European Law could kick in.
However, as in other spheres, the Commission has been steadily extending its range of influence.


Page 54 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Fines have been slapped on a number of Irish firms including Aer Lingus, CRH/Irish Cement and Tretorn, which manufactures tennis balls.

Other Irish firms such as Irish Ferries have successfully sued under EU Competition Law. Irish Ferries took action when it was refused access to the port of Roscoff in Britanny. The  European Commission held that Roscoff could be considered to be a "substantial part of the EC" for the purposes of European Competition Law.

In another ruling, the European Court  fined a group of European ferry companies when they introduced a currency surcharge on the ground that this amounted to price fixing,  while - proving that lack of size is no protection - Boosey & Hawks, a small British manufacturer of brass bands, was  fined for breaches of EU Competition Law.
Says Vincent Power:"Business people and regulators now ignore competition law at their peril."

The fact that the new Competition Authority will be able to take action on its own account has profound consequences for Irish business culture.
Further changes could come when a Competition Review Group chaired by senior counsel, Michael
Collins, completes its work, next year.

It is looking at the ban on below cost selling and will be studying the impact of the new legislation. Within business circles, there are also fears that a new tide of bureaucratic interference may be building up. Power believes that the Competition Authority will need to introduce a pre notification consultative procedure in an effort to reduce business uncertainty.

But there are also, he adds, huge opportunities both in Irish and European law now available to firms and individuals who may suspect that they are being shut out of markets or are the victims of abuse by the dominant player in that market.

"Take the case of a former employee of a firm which has been forced out of business by a rival abusing its dominant position. A complaint can be taken to Brussels at a cost which is a fraction of the potential financial saving if the case proves successful."

Since 1991, many would argue, the Competition giant has been only half awake. But the beast is now clambering to its feet and could soon be on the march.

PLANS for  ferry companies Stena and P&O European Ferries to merge their cross-Channel services have been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it was announced yesterday.

President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang said the joint venture between the two big rivals on the Dover-Calais route gave rise to competition concerns in respect of the market for Channel crossings.

TD
He made his referral after advice from the Office of Fair Trading and the MMC will have to make its report by March 6, 1997.
Faced with strong competition from a then thriving Channel Tunnel, the two companies were
given permission in September to enter into merger talks after Mr Lang lifted a 17-year-old ban on
commercial negotiations between them.

Early last month, it was announced that a new company, P&O Stena Line, was being set up with a total of 13 roll-on roll-off ferries and one high-speed craft on the Dover to Calais, Dover to Zeebrugge and Newhaven to Dieppe routes.

Two ageing ferries were to be removed and Dover departures cut from four or five an hour to two or three. It was also feared the reorganisation could mean loss of about 1,000 jobs in Kent.

Consumer groups warned that the merger would mean prices being pushed up, with the two "big boys" no longer having to compete with each other.

Ironically, the MMC referral comes at a time when both Stena and P&O have been bringing extra ships into operation to cope with the suspension of passenger services through the Channel Tunnel following the fire last week.

Last month P&O was fined #320,000 and Stena #80,000 after the  European Commission had found them guilty of price fixing  in November 1992 on freight services.
Swedish-owned Stena, formerly Stena Sealink, recently blamed cut-throat competition on the
Channel for its falling into the red.

Eurotunnel chiefs always maintained that there was over-capacity on the Channel routes and said the ferry companies were bound to rationalise services eventually.
