(Adds ArcelorMittal shares, lawyer comment) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators will this week  fine steel companies, including world leader ArcelorMittal , for operating a  cartel, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.

In October 2008, the  European Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, charged several companies with illegally fixing prices. The unidentified companies make wire rods used in prestressing  steel for constructing balconies and foundation piles.

"The prestressed  steel cartel (fining) decision will be on Wednesday," one person familiar with the process said.

ArcelorMittal said in February 2009 the  European Commission had investigated three of its units and two former units for possible anti-competitive behaviour.
ArcelorMittal declined to comment on Monday.
The company has said it will indemnify the current owners of Emesa and Galycas, which it sold in
2004, from any possible  fine. ArcelorMittal shares were up 2.5 percent by 1506 GMT, outperforming a
1.9 percent rise in the Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources index <.SXPP>.

The EU executive's so-called statement of objections or charge sheet listed around 40 companies, with many of them based in Italy, Spain and Austria, the second person said.

The Commission, which can  fine companies up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaching EU rules, is expected to reduce the penalties for crisis-hit companies.

Antitrust lawyers say the regulator needs to strike a balance between promoting competition and punishing offenders.

"If the endgame is all about increased competition, it would be perverse to levy a  fine of such magnitude that it would result in market exit and greater market consolidation," said Peter Alexiadis, a partner at Gibson Dunn.

"Having said that, would anyone be surprised if that argument were to be more often cited -- and better received -- at a time of serious economic recession?" he said.

Last week, the watchdog cut  fines by between 25 percent to 50 percent for five companies charged in a bathroom fittings  cartel because of their financial difficulties. (Editing by Luke Baker and David Cowell)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission will Wednesday fine steel makers for operating a cartel in prestressed steel, people familiar with the case said Tuesday.

The commission's cartel decision on the prestressed  steel cartel will involve 36 companies, found guilty of fixing steel prices over a period of 18 years, one person familiar with the  cartel told Dow Jones Newswires.

TD
Prestressed  steel, consisting of metal wires and strands made of wire rod, is mainly used in the construction industry. Together with various forms of concrete it can be used for balconies, foundation piles, underground engineering and bridge building.

Seven of the companies found guilty of  price fixing  are likely to have their fines reduced under the commission's leniency program, while three companies will qualify for lower fines due to their inability to pay full  fines because they are struggling in the current economic climate.

The market leader ArcelorMittal (MT), as well as Finnish  steel company Rautaruukki Oy (RTRKS.HE) and Austrian steel company Voestalpine AG (VOE.VI), have in the past said they were involved in the commission's cartel investigation.

(ADPnews) - Jun 29, 2010 - German steel companies ThyssenKrupp (ETR:TKA) and Salzgitter (ETR:SZG) are not affected by the EU cartel investigation against ArcelorMittal (AMS:MT), news agency dpa reported on Tuesday citing both German companies.

ArcelorMittal will be  fined by the EU Commission over price fixing  of concrete reinforcement  steel, dpa said, quoting insiders. The amount of the fine has already been agreed upon and the decision will be announced either in the aftermath of this Wednesday's meeting or next week. Apart from ArcelorMittal, around 40 other European sector companies are believed to be involved in the illegal activities.

TD
Thyssen sold its concrete-reinforcement-steel businesses in the 1990s to Arcelor, a spokesman of the
German company said. Salzgitter too, has no activities in that sector.

HD     EU fines steel producers for cartel

BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined steel producer ArcelorMittal euro315 million for secret deals to fix  steel prices for nearly two decades with 16 other  steel makers.

The European Commission says it fined all of the companies a total of euro518 million, bringing to euro1.49 billion the amount of  fines it has levied this year on businesses who formed cartels.

TD
It accuses the  steel producers of holding more than 550 meetings from 1984 to 2002 to fix prices across Europe and allocate customers for prestressing  steel, long curled steel wires used by builders to make foundations, balconies or bridges.

ArcelorMittal, the world's largest  steel maker, received the largest  fine based on the size of its operations and revenues -- but also won a reduction for cooperating with investigators. It says it will consider an appeal to the EU courts and stressed that it now educates workers to make sure all business activity meets legal and ethical standards.

Austria's voestalpine said it would appeal its euro22 million  fine, saying it "has made it abundantly plain to the EU commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel."

Spain-based Global  Steel Wire's unit Tycsa was  fined euro54 million while Emesa, Galycas and ArcelorMittal's Spanish unit were jointly  fined euro40.8 million and Italy's Ori Martin and Siderurgica Latina Martin must pay euro19.8 million.
DWK/Saarstahl ended the  cartel by telling EU regulators about it in 2002. It escaped any  fine.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said it was "amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product."

Regulators reduced  fines for three companies who supplied proof that the financial penalty could force them into financial collapse. They did not name the businesses but said 13 of the companies had pleaded for reductions because of the financial difficulties a heavy  fine would cause.

Almunia said the EU executive had "no sympathy for cartelists" and would  fine repeat offenders more -- and accept inability-to-pay claims "only when it is clear the  fine would send a company into bankruptcy."
Apart from ArcelorMittal, they also cut  fines for Italcables/Antonini, Nedri, Emesa and Galycas and
WDI/Pampus for cooperating with the antitrust probe.

EU antitrust  fines can go as high as 10 percent of yearly global turnover for each year a company broke the law.

(ADPnews) - Jun 30, 2010 - Austrian steel producer Voestalpine (WBAG:VOE) said today the European Commission imposed a cartel fine of EUR 22 million (USD 27m) on its subsidiary Austria Draht GmbH.
After  cartel action taken against a number of European prestressing  steel manufacturers, the
Commission imposed a total  fine of EUR 518 million on 17 companies. The highest amount of EUR
276 million will have to be paid by Luxembourg-based  steel producer ArcelorMittal (AMS:MT).

TD
Voestalpine said that at this stage it is not possible to make any comment on the reasons given for the fine. During all stages of the proceedings the company claimed that it has never been involved the steel cartel. Voestalpine further said it will appeal against the decision.

According to the  European Commission the cartel lasted for at least 18 years and spread across almost all EU member states.

HD        EU Fines Steel Makers 518 Million  Euros for Price-Fixing

Nairobi, Jun 30, 2010 (The Nation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The  European Commission fined 17 steel producers a total of 518 million euros (635 million dollars) on Wednesday for running a price-fixing cartel, with industry giant ArcelorMittal hit the hardest.

The European Union's competition watchdog said the companies ran a  cartel that lasted 18 years to fix the prices of prestressing  steel, the long, curled  steel wires used in construction to make foundations, balconies or bridges.

TD
The cartel operated in every member of the European Union except Britain, Ireland and Greece between 1984 and 2002, the commission said. It was also in Norway.

ArcelorMittal was handed a  fine of 276.5 million euros, which includes a 20-percent reduction for cooperating with the commission's investigation.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"This was almost as if they were acting in a planned economy, " he said, warning that the commission would have "no sympathy for cartelists" and that "recidivists" would face more  fines.
The cartel broke up in 2002 after German company DWK/Saarstahl revealed its existence under an EU
leniency programme which was introduced that year.
The company was spared a  fine for being the first to come clean.
In addition to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal and DWK/Saarstahl, the  cartel included companies from
Spain, Portugal, Austria, Italy and Scandinavia.
The cartel held more than 550 meetings since its first gathering in Zurich, the commission said.

"The companies involved usually met in the margin of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe," it said.

The 17 companies of fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information, it said.

"In addition, they monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts," it said.

"In addition, they monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts," said the commission, which started its probe with surprise inspections in September 2002 and June 2006 at the premises of suspected  cartel members.

The commission said any person or firm "affected by anti-competitive behaviour" could seek damages in national courts.

"Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission  fine," it said.

It was the fourth anti-cartel ruling by the commission since February, raising the total of  fines slapped on companies so far this year to 1.5 billion euros.

HD       European Commission fines ‘Club Europe’ cartel $627M WC      563 words

LP
The European Commission has fined 17 pre-stressed steel producers a total of $627 million for operating a cartel that lasted 18 years until 2002 and covered all the then 15 European Union member states except Britain, Ireland and Greece.

Following a lengthy inquiry, EC competition officials concluded that collaboration between the companies violated EU legislation banning cartels and restrictive business practices. With pre-stressed  steel a key component of construction, the EC was concerned about the  cartel's inflationary effect on a wide range
of economic sectors.

TD
The heaviest  fine—€276 million ($338.3 million)—was imposed on ArcelorMittal SA relating to operations in Belgium, France, Italy and Luxembourg.

"When it receives the full commission decision, the company will review the decision in detail and respond within the time limits provided," ArcelorMittal said Wednesday. "All options, including an appeal, will be considered." The steelmaker noted that the company and all its subsidiaries had cooperated fully with the commission throughout the investigation.
The second-largest  fine—€56 million ($68.6 million)—was imposed on WDI/Pampus, regarding its
German interests.

Other fines included €54 million ($66.2 million) on GlobalSteelWire/Tycsa for its actions in Spain; €40 million ($49 million) on Emesa/Galycas/ArcelorMittal (España) relating to operations in Luxembourg and Spain; €22 million ($27 million) on Voestalpine Austria Draht (Austria); €19 million ($23.3 million) on Ori Martin/Siderurgica Latina Martin (Italy); €12.5 million ($15.3 million) on Companhia Previdente/Socitrel (Portugal); €8 million ($9.8 million) on Fapricela (Portugal); €6 million ($7.4 million) on Nedri/HIT Groep (the Netherlands) and Redaelli (Italy); €4 million ($4.9 million) on Rautaruukki/Ovako (Finland and Sweden); €3 million ($3.7 million) on Emme Holding (Italy); €2 million ($2.5 million) on CB Trafilati Acciai (Italy) and Italcables/Antonini (Italy); and €843,000 ($1 million) on ITAS (Italy).

"It is surprising that a significant number of companies have deceived almost all the European construction market for so long and for a product (that is so) essential. It almost seems that they have acted in a planned economy," EU competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said.

"The commission will show no leniency to members of cartels, and repeat offenders will be punished more severely," he added. "We will consider claims of inability to pay, but only if it is proved that the  fine would lead the company into bankruptcy, which is rare even in the current difficult economic situation."

Germany's DWK/Saarstahl avoided  fines for having blown the whistle on the  cartel in 2002, which also covered non-EU member Norway.

The EC said the companies set quotas and individual prices, allocated customers and exchanged sensitive commercial information, controlling agreements on prices, customers and quotas through a system of national coordinators and bilateral contacts.
The first pan-European meetings of the  cartel were held in Zurich, Switzerland, and were dubbed "Club
Zurich"—a name originally used to describe the agreement but later renamed "Club Europe." In addition,

Page 23 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
there were two regional branches: one in Italy ("Club Italia") and another for Spain and Portugal ("Club
España").

Member companies usually discussed  cartel business on the sidelines of official business meetings in hotels, the EC said, noting that it had evidence of more than 550 such meetings.
Wednesday's  fines could be challenged at the European Court of Justice.

The cartel went on for at least 18 years (until 2002) and involved all countries which were EU members back then - with the exception of the UK, Ireland and Greece - as well as Norway.
The commission's ruling is a fourth one since the beginning of February. So far this year,  fines totalling
EUR 1.493 billion have been imposed.

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (CIA) ľ The  European Commission (EC) fined steel companies EUR 518 mln (CZK 13.34 bln) for dividing the construction industry-related market. According to the EC, this lasted 20 years. The highest sum shall be paid by ArcelorMittal (EUR 276.5 mln/CZK 7.12 bln).

According to the EC,  steel companies had until 2002 entered into  cartel agreements almost in the whole of the EU, thus violating the European competition laws banning such agreements. The  cartel ended after one of the companies had unveiled its existence in exchange for immunity from prosecution. The other companies include WDI/Pampus, GlobalSteelWire/Tycsa and Emesa that shall pay a sanction over EUR 40 mln (more than CZK 1 bln).

VIENNA (Dow Jones)--Austrian specialty steelmaker Voestalpine AG (VOE.VI) has been  fined EUR22 million by the European Commission in a cartel case but intends to appeal the ruling, it said Wednesday.

The European Commission's ruling relates to an investigation into whether 36  steel companies have been fixing prestressed steel prices over a period of 18 years.

TD
Voestalpine has previously said it was involved with the commission's  cartel investigation. In a statement Wednesday, Voestalpine maintained its innocence.
"During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission
that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel," Voestalpine said.
"The company therefore will take legal action against the decision," it said.

Voestalpine furthermore said it isn't possible to comment on the details of the ruling yet, since the commission has not yet provided information on its reasons for imposing the  fine.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: Analysts expect a modest defensive rally at the open Wednesday, helped by banking gains in Europe after lower-than-expected demand for a European Central Bank tender eased fears over euro-zone bank funding.

"It looks highly likely that the ECB will announce additional liquidity measures and the six-month facility looks like a good candidate for reintroduction, and that should contain a sharp rise in money market rates," said Steven Mansell at Citigroup Global Markets.

TD
Investors will focus on the ADP employment report, due at 1215 GMT, ahead of the key non-farm payrolls data Friday. Chicago PMI data are due at 1345 GMT.

At 1046 GMT, S&P 500 futures were up 6.7 points at 1042.00, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 9.63 points at 1773.13 and Dow industrial futures were up 66 points at 9849.
EUROPEAN MARKETS: European stocks are higher midday with the Euro Stoxx 50 index up 1.3% at
2588.59, extending gains, with banking stocks pushing higher after take-up at ECB's three-month tender
was less than estimated, easing concerns on the funding ability of euro-zone banks a tad. The Stoxx 600
banks index is up 2%, after the ECB allotted EUR131.933 billion at its three-month liquidity facility to 171
banks. On the macroeconomic front, June's flash CPI figures confirm that inflationary pressure in the
euro zone remains very muted, says ING Bank. However, concerns about economic and inflation
divergence in the euro zone, "seem fully justified, with deflation the clear and present threat in the
peripheral euro-zone countries," adds ING.

London's FTSE 100 is up 0.6% at 4945.07. AstraZeneca is the biggest gainer, up 9.4% after the company's Crestor patent victory, which analysts say removes uncertainty from the stock. BP is up 8.6% on a note from JPMorgan citing Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell as possible candidates to launch offers for the company.
Bunds and gilts are mixed. At 1035 GMT, September bunds were down 0.07 at 129.36, after the ECB
tender eased concerns on the funding ability of euro-zone banks, while September gilts were up 0.39 at
121.07.
At 1035 GMT, the dollar was up at Y88.60, the euro was higher at $1.23 and the pound was down at
$1.5044.

LOW ECB TENDER UPTAKE BRINGS RELIEF: The European Central Bank allots EUR131.9 billion of funds at a 91-day refinancing tender, at a fixed rate of 1%. The volume is significantly less than many had expected, helping to calm fears over the health of euro-zone banks.

EURO-ZONE INFLATION SLOWDOWN MAY SIGNAL TREND: Euro-zone consumer prices rose at a slower pace than expected in June, data show, suggesting that inflationary pressures may be easing as energy prices fall.
============================
INSIGHT & ANALYSIS FROM DOW JONES NEWSWIRES:

=FOREX FOCUS: New worries about the U.S. recovery may be slowing the euro's slide against the dollar. But the single currency will still accelerate its decline elsewhere--falling even faster against the pound, the Swiss franc, the yen and even the Swedish krona.

=HEARD ON THE STREET: Europe's utilities are feeling the political heat. Spain's surprise announcement this week of a wholesale review of energy policy puts in doubt planned tariff increases and the future of renewable energy subsidies. There's also near-term regulatory uncertainty in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. No wonder European utilities stocks have underperformed the market by around 20 % this year. The uncertainty is likely to linger for while yet.
=TAKING STOCK: We might be at the long-overdue point when people stop talking about the Global
Financial Crisis in the past tense, whatever happens to the Dow, the Nikkei and the FTSE this week.

ArcelorMittal will have to pay the highest share of the  fine, some 315mn euros, the company said in a release, adding that once it receives the commission's full decision, it will review it in detail and respond within the time limits, and that all options will be considered, including an appeal. According
to the group, the firm and its controlled companies have fully cooperated with the investigation.

In Latin America, ArcelorMittal - the world's largest steelmaker - has operations in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.

HD       ArcelorMittal hit by €276.5m cartel fine

ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest  steel producer, has been hit by a €276.5m ($339.7m)  fine for the part its companies played in one of the most wide-ranging and long-running cartels to come to light in Europe recently, covering a core part of the  steel market.

In total, 17  steel manufacturers were involved, and were given  fines totalling €518.5m on Wednesday - with ArcelorMittal's being the largest single penalty.

TD
The price-fixing occurred in the market for pre-stressing  steel, which forms the curled  steel wires used with concrete and to form the foundations of buildings and bridges.

It ran for 18 years, from 1984 to 2002, when officials from the  European Commission's competition department carried out a series of dawn raids. The  cartel's existence had been revealed by Germany's DWK/Saarstahl, which sought immunity under the Commission's leniency programme. As a result, it will pay no fine.

Cartel members held their initial meetings in Zurich - earning the  cartel a "Club Zurich" tag - but two separate regional branches subsequently developed in Italy ("Club Italy") and in Spain and Portugal ("Club España").

According to commission officials on Wednesday, there was evidence of more than 550 meetings between the  cartel participants, typically in hotels where official trade meetings were taking place.

The cartel affected all the European Union member states at the time, with the exception of the UK, Ireland and Greece. It also affected Norway. The participants fixed quotas and prices and allocated clients, as well as exchanging commercial information.

"It's amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product," said Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner on Wednesday.

ArcelorMittal saw its  fine increased because two of its subsidiaries - ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France - had already been  fined by Brussels because of their participation in two other steel industry-related cartels. However, ArcelorMittal also won a reduction for its co-operation with the probe.

The company's Spanish unit was helpful in providing information about "Club España" and the duration of the Spanish arrangements, winning a partial offsetting  fine reduction.

Three of the  cartel participants also received  fine reductions of 25, 50 and 75 per cent respectively because full penalties could have pushed them towards bankruptcy. They were not named.
The 16 groups paying  fines are:

ArcelorMittal (€276.5m); Emesa/Galycas/ArcelorMittal-España (€40.8m); GlobalSteelWire/Tycsa (€54.4m); Proderac (€482,250); Companhia Previdente/Socitrel (€12.6m); Fapricela (€8.87m); Nedri/HIT Groep (€6.93m); WDI/Pampus (€56m); voestalpine Austria Draht (€22m); Rautauukki/Ovako (€4.7m);

Italcables/Antonini (€2.39m); Redaelli (€6.34m); CB Trafilati Acciai (€2.6m); ITAS (€843,000); Ori

VIENNA, June 30 (Reuters) - Austrian  steel group Voestalpine said on Wednesday it would take legal action against a 22 million euro ($26.9 million)  fine imposed by European Union regulators and denied ever being part of a  price-fixing cartel.

Sources told Reuters on Monday that the  European Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, would fine several steel companies this week including world leader ArcelorMittal over an alleged  cartel. [ID:nLDE65R1SA]

"During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel," Voesalpine said in a statement.
"The company therefore will take legal action against the decision."

Shares in the Linz-based  steel group dipped on news of the  fine, trading down 0.4 percent at 22.80 euros by 0917 GMT and slightly underperforming the Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources index
<.SXPP>.

In October 2008, the Commission charged several companies with illegally fixing prices. The unidentified companies make wire rods used in prestressing  steel for constructing balconies and foundation piles.

ArcelorMittal said in February 2009 the  European Commission had investigated three of its units and two former units for possible anti-competitive behaviour. It declined to comment on Monday. ($1=.8172

TD
BRUSSELS, June 30 (Reuters) - The European Union executive  fined 17 producers of prestressing steel a total of 518 million euros ($634 million) on Wednesday for operating a  cartel covering most EU states over a period of 18 years.

The European Commission said the firms, including world number one  steel maker ArcelorMittal, operated the price-fixing and market-sharing cartel from 1984 to 2002 in all the countries that then formed the EU except Britain, Ireland and Greece.

The largest  fine -- 276 million euros -- was imposed on ArcelorMittal, a Commission statement said, adding that any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive behaviour could seek damages in member-state courts.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product. This was almost as if they were acting in a planned economy," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement.

"The Commission will have no sympathy for cartelists; recidivists will be  fined more and inability-to-pay claims will be accepted only when it is clear the  fine would send a company into bankruptcy, which is rare even in the current difficult times".

The Commission said that over the 18-year period, the companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

In addition, they monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts.

It said companies involved in the  cartel usually met in the margins of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe and the Commission had evidence of over 550 such meetings.

The statement said the first pan-European  cartel meetings took place in Zurich, and were referred to as "Club Zurich". Later the  cartel was dubbed "Club Europe" and had two regional branches -- in Italy, "Club Italia", and in Spain and Portugal, "Club Espana".

HD      European Commission fines 'Club Europe' steel cartel members

The European Commission has fined 17 pre-stressing steel producers a total of €518 million ($635 million) for operating a cartel that lasted 18 years until 2002 and covered all but three of the then 15
European Union member states - Britain, Ireland and Greece. Following a lengthy inquiry, EC competition officials have concluded that collaboration between these companies broke EU legislation banning cartels and restrictive business practices. With pre-stressing  steel a key component of construction materials, the EC is concerned about the cartel's inflationary effect on a wide range of economic sectors. ArcelorMittal was given the heaviest fine - €276 million - relating to operations in Luxembourg, France, Belgium and Italy. The next-largest fine - €56 million - was imposed on WDI/Pampus, regarding its German interests. GlobalSteelWire/Tycsa was  fined €54 million for its actions in Spain.

TD
Emesa/Galycas/ArcelorMittal (España) was  fined €40 million (relating to operations in Spain and Luxembourg); Voestalpine Austria Draht, €22 million (Austria); Ori Martin/Siderurgica Latina Martin, €19 million (Italy); and Companhia Previdente/Socitrel, €12.5 million (Portugal). Others  fined included Fapricela, €8 million (Portugal); Nedri/HIT Groep €6 million (the Netherlands); Redaelli €6 million (Italy); Rautaruukki/Ovako, €4 million (Finland and Sweden); Emme Holding €3 million (Italy); CB Trafilati Acciai,
€2 million (Italy); Italcables/Antonini €2 million (Italy); and ITAS, €843,000 (Italy). "It is surprising that a significant number of companies have deceived almost all the European construction market for so long and for a product [that is so] essential. It almost seems that they have acted in a planned economy," EU competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said. "The Commission will show no leniency to members of cartels and repeat offenders will be punished more severely. We will consider claims of inability to pay, but only if it is proved that the  fine would lead the company into bankruptcy, which is rare, even in the current difficult economic situation," he added. Germany's DWK/Saarstahl avoided fines having blown the whistle on the cartel in 2002, which also covered non-EU member Norway. The cartel involved companies
setting quotas and individual prices, allocating customers and exchanging sensitive commercial information; they controlled agreements on prices, customers and quotas through a system of national coordinators and bilateral contacts, breaking EU free competition treaty commitments, according to the EC. The first pan-European meetings of the  cartel were held in Zurich, Switzerland, and were dubbed "Club Zurich" - a name originally used to describe the agreement and later renamed "Club Europe". In addition, there were two regional branches: one in Italy - "Club Italia" - and Spain/Portugal - "Club España". Member companies usually discussed  cartel business on the sidelines of official business meetings in hotels; the EC says it has evidence of more than 550 such meetings. Today's  fines could be challenged at the European Court of Justice.

The European Commission has finedArcelorMittal Group €315 million for its part in a 18-year long
cartel in the prestressed steel sector that it said operated between1984 and 2002. ArcelorMittal is one of
17 European steel producers fined. In total the  fines amount to €518 million for all the companies
involved. The Commission investigation has been pending since 2002 and the alleged anticompetitive
practices that it has examined date back to a period over 25 years ago. "ArcelorMittal operates a strong
compliance program across all its subsidiaries to ensure that all business activity remains in accordance
with the highest legal and ethical standards," the company said in a statement. "When it receives the full
Commission decision, the Company will review the decision in detail and respond within the time limits
provided. All options including appeal will be considered.

ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries have cooperated fully with the Commission throughout the investigation," the company said.

The European Commission has finedVoestalpine and Rautaruukki, along with 15 other European producers of prestressing steel, for operating a  cartel over 18 years between 1984 and 2002. Voestalpine and Ruukki have been  fined €22 million and €4.7 million respectively. In total the  fines amount to €518 million for all the companies involved. "During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing steel cartel," Voestalpine said in a statement. "The company therefore will take legal action against the decision," it said. Voestalpine declined to give further comment until official notification of the fine has been made available. "Rautaruukki will examine the grounds for the Commission decision and evaluate and further action warranted," the company said in a statement.

VIENNA, June 30 (Reuters) - Austrian  steel group Voestalpine said on Wednesday it would take legal action against a 22 million euro ($26.9 million)  fine imposed by European Union regulators and denied ever being part of a  price-fixing cartel.

Sources told Reuters on Monday that the  European Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, would fine several steel companies this week including world leader ArcelorMittal over an alleged  cartel. [ID:nLDE65R1SA]

"During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel," Voesalpine said in a statement.
"The company therefore will take legal action against the decision."

Shares in the Linz-based  steel group dipped on news of the  fine, trading down 0.4 percent at 22.80 euros by 0917 GMT and slightly underperforming the Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources index
<.SXPP>.

In October 2008, the Commission charged several companies with illegally fixing prices. The unidentified companies make wire rods used in prestressing  steel for constructing balconies and foundation piles.

ArcelorMittal said in February 2009 the  European Commission had investigated three of its units and two former units for possible anti-competitive behaviour. It declined to comment on Monday. ($1=.8172

BRUSSELS, June 30 (Reuters) - The European Union executive  fined 17 producers of prestressing steel a total of 518 million euros ($634 million) on Wednesday for operating a  cartel covering most EU states over a period of 18 years.

The European Commission said the firms, including world number one  steel maker ArcelorMittal , operated the price-fixing and market-sharing cartel from 1984 to 2002 in all the countries that then formed the EU except Britain, Ireland and Greece.

The largest  fine -- 276 million euros -- was imposed on ArcelorMittal, a Commission statement said, adding that any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive behaviour could seek damages in member-state courts.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product. This was almost as if they were acting in a planned economy," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement.

"The Commission will have no sympathy for cartelists; recidivists will be  fined more and inability-to-pay claims will be accepted only when it is clear the  fine would send a company into bankruptcy, which is rare even in the current difficult times".

The Commission said that over the 18-year period, the companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

In addition, they monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts.

It said companies involved in the  cartel usually met in the margins of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe and the Commission had evidence of over 550 such meetings.

The statement said the first pan-European  cartel meetings took place in Zurich, and were referred to as "Club Zurich". Later the  cartel was dubbed "Club Europe" and had two regional branches -- in Italy, "Club Italia", and in Spain and Portugal, "Club Espana".

BRUSSELS—The  European Commission on Wednesday fined 17 steelmakers a total of €518.5 million ($632.4 million) for fixing prices and dividing up markets for prestressed  steel over two decades.

Among those  fined were ArcelorMittal, which must pay €276.5 million, and former subsidiaries Emesa and Galycas and ArcelorMittal's Spanish unit, which were  fined an additional €40.8 million; Voestalpine Austria, which must pay €22 million; and Rautaruukki Oyj, which together with Ovako was fined €4.7 million.

TD
ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker, said it believes it will be liable to pay about €315 million in fines.

ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France had their  fines increased by 60% because they had been fined twice for previous  steel cartels.
Saarstahl, although also previously fined over a steel cartel, received full immunity from  fines
because it blew the whistle on the cartel in 2002.

Prestressing  steel produces long, curled  steel wires that are used with concrete to construct foundations, balconies or bridges.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product," said the European Union's competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia.

The first  cartel meetings were held in Zurich and were known as "Club Zurich." Later it became "Club Europe," but there were also regional branches, "Club Italia" in Italy and "Club Espana" in Spain, the commission said.

The companies involved mainly met at the sidelines of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe from 1984 until 2002. The commission said it has evidence during the 18-year period of more than
550 cartel meetings, where the companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

Owing to disturbances in the construction market after the economic downturn, the commission accepted three inability-to-pay applications and granted reductions in  fines of 25%, 50% and 75% of the fine that would otherwise have been imposed on these three companies. It had received 13 such applications from the companies involved.

In a statement Wednesday, Voestalpine maintained its innocence. "During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel," Voestalpine said. "The company therefore will take legal action against the decision."

ArcelorMittal said it will review the commission's decision "in detail" and respond within the time limits provided. "ArcelorMittal operates a strong compliance program across all its subsidiaries to ensure that all business activity remains in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards," the world's largest steelmaker said.

HD        EU fines 17 steel producers 636 million dollars  for price fixing

BRUSSELS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission on Thursday fined 17 prestressing steel producers, including the world's largest one ArcelorMittal, a total of 518 million euros ( 636 million U.S. dollars) for operating a  cartel to fix prices.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product. This was almost as if they were acting in a planned economy," Joaquin Almunia, commission vice president in charge of competition, said in a statement.

TD
The commission investigation found that the 17 companies operated a  price-fixing and market-sharing cartel between January 1984 and September 2002 in all the countries that then formed the European Union (EU) except Britain, Ireland and Greece. It also affected Norway. The  cartel stopped in 2002.

During 18 years, the companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information. In addition, they monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national coordinators and bilateral contacts.

The first pan-European  cartel meetings were held in Zurich, Switzerland, hence the "Club Zurich" name it was initially referred to. Later it became "Club Europe."

The companies involved usually met in the margin of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe. The commission said it has evidence of over 550  cartel meetings.
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest  steel producer, had to pay more than half of the  fines.
"The commission will have no sympathy for cartelists. Recidivists will be  fined more," Almunia said. This is the fourth  cartel decision since the beginning of February bringing the total amount of antitrust
fines imposed so far in 2010 to 1,493 million euros (1,832 million U.S. dollars).

Prestressing  steel comprises long, curled  steel wires used with concrete in construction sites to make foundations, balconies or bridges.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 17 steel makers a total of
EUR518.5 million for fixing prices and sharing out markets for prestressed steel over two decades.

Among those  fined were ArcelorMittal (MT), which must pay EUR276.5 million; Voestalpine Austria (VOE.VI) which must pay EUR22 million; and Rautaruukki (RTRKS.HE), which together with Ovako was fined EUR4.7 million.

The first  cartel meetings were held in Zurich, Switzerland and were known as "Club Zurich." Later this became "Club Europe," but there were also regional branches, "Club Italia" in Italy and "Club Espana" in Spain, the commission said.

The companies involved mainly met at the sidelines of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe from 1984 until 2002. During the 18-year period, the commission has evidence of over 550  cartel meetings, where the companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information.

Due to disturbances in the construction market following the economic downtrun, the commission accepted three inability-to-pay applications and granted reductions in  fines of 25%, 50% and 75% of the fine that would otherwise have been imposed on these three companies. It had received 13 such applications from the companies involved.
In a statement Wednesday, Voestalpine maintained its innocence.

"During all stages of the proceeding, Voestalpine has made it abundantly plain to the  EU Commission that the company has never been involved in the prestressing  steel cartel," Voestalpine said. "The company therefore will take legal action against the decision," it said.

ArcelorMittal said it will review the Commission's decision "in detail" and respond within the time limits provided.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 17 steel makers a total of
EUR518.5 million for fixing prices and sharing out markets for prestressed steel over two decades.

Among those  fined were ArcelorMittal (MT), which must pay EUR276.5 million; Voestalpine Austria (VOE.VI) which must pay EUR22 million; and Rautaruukki (RTRKS.HE), which together with Ovako was fined EUR4.7 million.

ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France had their  fines increased by 60% because they had already been fined twice for previous steel cartels. Saarstahl, although also previously  fined over a steel cartel, received full immunity from fines because it blew the whistle on the  cartel in 2002.

Prestressing  steel produces long, curled  steel wires, which are used with concrete to construct foundations, balconies or bridges.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product," the European Union's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

EUROPEAN  steel mills lobbying against the proposed $US116 billion($A135 million) iron ore production joint venture between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have been  fined for price-fixing by the European Union's anti-trust regulator.

The European Commission fined 17 producers of prestressing  steel — including ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker — €518.5 million ($A739 million) for fixing prices of a type of  steel used in concrete work.

Brussels, 30/06/2010 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 30 June, the European Commission fined 17 producers of prestressing steel a total of € 518,470,750 for operating a cartel that lasted 18 years until
2002. In total, there are 36 steel producers involved, which use the long, curled steel wires (prestressed) with concrete in construction sites to make foundations, balconies or bridges. The cartel involved all the countries that then formed the EU except the United Kingdom, Ireland and Greece. It also affected Norway. The companies fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive
commercial information. They met up almost 550 times during the period of the  cartel as part of monitored price, client and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts.

TD
The cartel stopped in 2002, when DWK/Saarstahl revealed its existence under the EU Leniency Programme introduced that year, and the Commission carried out surprise inspections at the premises of the suspected members.

In order to calculate the  fines, the Commission took into account the sales volume generated by the companies in this market in 2001 (final year preceding the end of the agreement), the seriousness of the infringement (violation of Article 101 of the TFEU), as well as the geographical spread of the  cartel and its long duration (limiting certain fines because they would have gone over the legal 10% of company turnover). It also increased the fines of repeat offenders (up to 60% for ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France) but took into account the degree of participation in the  cartel or the level of collaboration between the companies during the enquiry, outside the leniency regime (Commission communication of 2002) or within this regime, depending on the degree of cooperation observed
(reduction of  fines for certain companies or total immunity for Saarstahl, which revealed the affair, despite the fact that this company had already been sanctioned for participating in a  cartel). In the end the Commission accepted three out of thirteen requests to recognise the impossibility of paying the  fines and it granted reductions of 25, 50 and 75% respectively of the amount of the  fines they would have normally had to pay.

The fines thus range from between €276,480,000 for ArcelorMittal to €3,249,000 for Emme Holding, out of a total of €518,470,750 for the 17 groups concerned. This is the fourth decision made on cartels since February, which brings the total amount of  fines imposed in 2010 to €1,493million. (F.G./transl.fl)

Seventeen suppliers of pre-stressing steel have been fined by the European Commission (EC) for operating an 18-year long price-fixing cartel between 1984 and 2002. Among the group, ArcelorMittal is set to receive the largest fine, Steel Business Briefing learns from the EC.

The cartel affected the majority of the states within the EU until 2002 (except the UK, Ireland and Greece). DWK/Saarsthal (DS) revealed the  cartel's existence to the EC in 2002, prompting the investigation from the EC. In return, the EC has not  fined DS.

TD
According to the official statement, the EC can prove that over 550 meetings were held in different parts of Europe by the companies involved in order to set prices and quotas for pre-stressing material, violating article 101 of the European Union treaty.

The ArcelorMittal group has received a  fine of more than €300 million ($369m) covering its subsidiaries in Italy, France, Belgium and Luxemburg, and two companies then controlled by ArcelorMittal Spain (for which the company is contractually required to indemnify the present owners). The company stressed that all the subsidiaries have fully cooperated with the Commission and will now "review the decision in detail".
Rautaruukki was jointly  fined, with Ovako, for the activities of its former subsidiary, Fundia, between
1997 and 2001. Rautaruukki sold Fundia to Ovako in 2005-2006. Rautaruukki is considering its position,
SBB learns from a company announcement.

The European Commission will fine 17 steel companies a total of EUR 518mn for violating EU  cartel regulations. Also Finnish steel producer Rautarukki has been  fined, but only EUR 4.7mn. The companies made deals that restricted competition from 1984 to 2004. According to EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia, it is amazing that such a significant number of companies could abuse the European construction market for such a long time. The biggest  fine, over EUR 276mn, was imposed on Indian Arcelor Mittal.

TD
According to Rautaruukki, the company was never in the centre of the investigation as the  cartel operated more in Southern Europe. Rautaruukki group's Swedish subsidiary Fundia participated in the cartel. Rautaruukki sold Fundia to Ovako in 2005.

NEW YORK -- Wall Street fell on Wednesday as mixed data stirred investors' concerns on economic growth outlook.
U.S. stocks opened lower as ADP Employer Services said that U.S. companies widened payrolls by
13,000 in June, far less than the expectations of 60,000.

The Institute for Supply Management said its Chicago purchasing managers index fell to 59.1 in June from 59.7 in May, slightly better than economists had forecast.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission Wednesday proposed a set of concrete measures, including suspending agriculture subsidies for member states that keep running excessive deficit, to reinforce fiscal discipline and economic governance within the European Union (EU).

"The Commission proposes a wider range of sanctions and incentives to strengthen the credibility of EU's fiscal framework. These should also be used preventively and would kick in at an earlier stage," the Commission said in a communication.

According to the proposal, for members of the euroarea, an interest-bearing deposit could be temporarily imposed to countries making insufficient progress with budgetary consolidation. (EC-Fiscal discipline)

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission on Thursday fined 17 prestressing steel producers, including the world's largest one ArcelorMittal, a total of 518 million euros ( 636 million U.S. dollars) for operating a cartel to fix prices.

"It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product. This was almost as if they were acting in a planned economy," Joaquin Almunia, commission vice president in charge of competition, said in a statement.

The commission investigation found that the 17 companies operated a  price-fixing and market-sharing cartel between January 1984 and September 2002 in all the countries that then formed the European Union (EU) except Britain, Ireland and Greece. It also affected Norway. The  cartel stopped in 2002.

On 30 June, the European Commission imposed fines totalling €518,470,750 on 17 producers of
high-tensile steel, used in the construction industry, for their participation in an illegal  cartel that operated
for 18 years throughout the European Union of the time, apart from the United Kingdom, Ireland and
Greece. The  cartel also concerned Norway.

TD
High-tensile steel is made up of crimped steel wires used with cement on building sites in foundations, balconies and bridges. For 18 years, the companies set individual quotas and prices, divided up clientele and exchanged sensitive commercial information. They controlled the arrangements through a system of national coordinators and bilateral contacts. "It is astonishing to see that a large number of companies deceived almost the entire European construction market for so long and for such an essential product. It is almost as it they had acted in a planned economy," declared Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. The group's first Europe-wide meetings were held in Zurich, Switzerland, explaining the name Club Zurich originally given to the  cartel, which was later changed to Club Europe. There were also two regional branches, one in Italy and the other in Spain/Portugal. The companies generally met in the wings of official commercial meetings. The Commission has proof of more than 550 such meetings being held.
LENIENCY

The cartel ended in 2002, when DWK-Saarstahl revealed its existence under the EU's leniency programme, introduced the same year, and when unannounced inspections by the Commission at the premises of suspected members, in September 2002, turned up evidence of this breach of EU law. The Commission is taking a firm stand towards the enterprises involved and "will show no leniency with  cartel members". "Repeat offenders will be penalised more severely and pleas of inability to pay will only be taken into account if it can be demonstrated that the fine would result in bankruptcy, which is rare, even in today's difficult situation." It increased by 60% the fines on ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France, which had already been  fined twice for participating in cartels in the  steel sector, on reinforcing steel mesh and steel beams. In contrast, it reduced  fines on Italcables-Antonini (50%), Nedri (25%), Emesa and Galycas (5%), ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries (20%) and WDI-Pampus (5%) for their cooperation under the leniency communication of 2002.The executive recognised the more limited participation of Proderac and Emme Holding and consequently reduced their  fines by 5%. Of the 13 requests for recognition of the inability to pay, the Commission accepted only three and therefore gave reductions of 25%, 50% and 75%, respectively, in the amount of the  fines normally due.

The total  fines imposed (in euro) are as follows (each group can include companies responsible for all or part of the amount; a total of 36 companies are concerned):
- ArcelorMittal (L, F, B, I): 276,480,000

Fines total €518m for 17 companies

TD
ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest  steel producer, has been fined €276.5m ($339m) for the part that its companies played in one of the most wide-ranging and long-running cartels to come to light in Europe.
In all, 17  steel manufacturers were involved, and were given  fines totalling €518.5m yesterday, with
ArcelorMittal's being the largest single penalty.

The price-fixing occurred in the market for prestressing  steel, which forms the curled  steel wires used with concrete and to form the foundations of buildings and bridges.

It ran for 18 years, from 1984 to 2002, when the  European Commission's competition department officials carried out dawn raids. The  cartel's existence was revealed by Germany's DWK/Saarstahl, which sought immunity under the Commission's leniency programme. As a result, it will pay no  fine.

Cartel members held their initial meetings in Zurich - earning the  cartel a "Club Zurich" tag - but two separate regional branches subsequently developed, "Club Italy" in Italy and "Club España" in Spain and Portugal.
According to Commission officials yesterday, there is evidence of more than 550 meetings between the
cartel participants, typically in hotels where official trade meetings were taking place.

The cartel affected all of the European Union member states at the time, with the exception of the UK, Ireland and Greece.

It also affected Norway. The participants fixed quotas and prices and allocated clients and exchanged commercial information.

"It's amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product," said Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner .

ArcelorMittal's  fine was increased because two of its subsidiaries, ArcelorMittal Fontaine and ArcelorMittal Wire France, had already been  fined by Brussels for their participation in two other  steel industry-related cartels. However, ArcelorMittal also won a reduction for its co-operation with the investigators.

Three of the  cartel participants also received  fine reductions of up to 75 per cent because full penalties could have pushed them towards bankruptcy. They were not named.

The European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 518 million on 17  steel companies for forming a
cartel over the last twenty years.

German firms Pampus and Saarstahl are among the accused but Saarstahl will avoid a  fine as it is the principal witness. Pampus will pay EUR 56 million. The Commission allowed a rebate of 5% to Pampus for co-operating in the investigation.

TD
Luxembourg-based giant ArcelorMittal will pay EUR 276.5 million. The  fine of two of its units was increased by 60% due to previous wrongdoings.

The result of the  European Commission's investigation into an 18-year long  cartel in the prestressed steel sector couldn't really have come at a worse time for the mills involved. Some 17 European  steel producers were last week hit with  fines totalling €518 million after the Commission examined evidence that dated back to more than 25 years ago. ArcelorMittal took the brunt of the  fines - €315 million, in fact. In condemning the mills' action Joaquín Almunia, Commission vice-president in charge of competition said: "It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product". Strong words indeed, and words that will weigh heavily on the steelmakers involved. Some of the bigger ones are active members of Eurofer, which filed a complaint to the Commission over the level of concentration in the seabourne iron ore market.

TD
Speaking on behalf of European steelmakers, Eurofer warned of possible anti-competitive practices by major iron ore suppliers and what it said were "strong indications of illicit co-ordination and pricing models".

HD       €518 Million  Cartel Fine Imposed on 17 Producers of Prestressing Steel

The European Commission ("Commission") has  fined 17 producers of prestressing  steel a total of
€518 million for operating a price-fixing and market-sharing cartel that lasted 18 years (from January
1984 to September 2002). The Commission decision concludes that the producers violated the EU's ban
on cartels and restrictive business practices.

Prestressing  steel comprises long, curled  steel wires used with concrete in construction sites to make foundations, balconies or bridges.

TD
The cartel ended in 2002 when DWK/Saarstahl revealed its existence under the EU Leniency Programme which had only been introduced that year. This resulted in DWK/Saarstahl being given complete immunity. Following this, the Commission carried out surprise inspections at the premises of the suspected members.

For 18 years, the companies illegally fixed individual quotas and prices, allocated clients and exchanged sensitive commercial information at over 550 separate cartel meetings (usually under cover of official trade meetings in hotels all over Europe). In addition, the cartel members monitored prices, clients and quota arrangements through a system of national co-ordinators and bilateral contacts. The first
pan-European cartel meetings were held in Zurich, Switzerland, under the "Club Zurich" name, later changing to "Club Europe".

The highest  fine was on the ArcelorMittal group of €276 million, which included a 20% leniency discount, but which also included an increase of 60% for two counts of previous  cartel involvement in the  steel sector.

Despite receiving 13 applications, the Commission accepted only three inability-to-pay applications and granted reductions of 25%, 50% and 75% respectively from the  fine that would otherwise have been imposed. The Commission's rejection of the majority of applications is in line with its current policy of scrutinising inability-to-pay applications rigorously on a case by case basis. Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia stated that "inability-to-pay claims will be accepted only when it is clear the  fine would send a company into bankruptcy, which is rare even in the current difficult times".

This is the fourth Commission  cartel decision since the beginning of February (including one re-adopted decision) bringing the total amount of antitrust  fines imposed in 2010 to € 1,493 million.
General Court reduces ICI's soda ash  fine but upholds finding of loyalty-inducing rebates

The General Court has largely rejected ICI's appeal against a re-adopted Commission infringement decision for abusive practices in the soda ash market, although the  fine has been reduced by 20% from
€10 to €8 million.

In 1990, the Commission found ICI to have abused its dominant position by applying loyalty-inducing rebates.  That infringement decision was however annulled by the European Courts for procedural reasons, with final judgment being handed down in April 2000.

In December 2000 (some 10 years after the original decision) the Commission re-adopted the decision and imposed the same  fines.  ICI again appealed the decision contesting the finding of abuse, and

Page 78 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
argued that the applicable limitation periods for imposing a  fine had expired and that the decision had not been re-adopted within a reasonable time frame.

In its judgment this week, the General Court upheld the Commission's finding of abuse (rejecting ICI's arguments) and allowed the Commission to rely on its original findings from 1990. The Court re-affirmed that a rebate system which is not linked purely to volumes purchased and which prevents customers
from obtaining supplies from competitors (as was found in this case) infringes Article 102 TFEU. This is the case even if the rebate system is non-discriminatory, of limited duration and introduced in response to customer requests.
Rejecting ICI's argument that the rebates only related to 8% of its total sales, the General Court held that
8% of total sales cannot be regarded as negligible. The Court also confirmed that, for the purposes of
establishing a breach of Article 102, it is sufficient to show that the abusive conduct tended to restrict
competition, or is capable of doing so. ICI's desire to maintain or increase production capacity was found
not to be an objective justification for its abusive action.

In terms of the limitation period, the General Court held that the basic five year period within which the Commission must impose a  fine is suspended whilst there are appeals before the European Courts. Due to the appeals in this case, the limitation period was suspended for over 8 years. On this basis the Commission had acted within time. Also, the General Court noted that the Commission had only taken 8 months to reissue the decision following the conclusion of its appeal to the ECJ and so had not acted unreasonably.
Notwithstanding the refusal of the General Court to annul the decision, the  fine was reduced from €10 to
€8 million. Amongst other things, the Commission was found to have erred in increasing the  fine for
recidivism by taking account of previous non-Article 102 infringements.

Solvay (another EU producer of soda ash), which is in a similar position to ICI having been  fined for similar practices in 1990, has lodged an appeal with the ECJ and it will be interesting to see whether ICI will follow suit in relation to the General Court's findings. Any such appeal would increase even further, the duration of this already very long running case, with the abusive conduct in this matter dating back to
1984

German holding company Pampus is looking to sell Swedish special steelmaker Ovako, market participants told MB. Pampus Industriebeteiligungen acquired a stake in Ovako and Ovako Svenska in conjunction with two Dutch companies - Hombergh Holdings and WP de Pundert Venture - at the end of
2006. Less than a year later, Pampus Stahlbeteiligungs acquired full control of Ovako. But the company, which is owned by the Pampus family and holds shares in a number of companies in the  steel industry, is now looking to sell in the Swedish special  steel long products maker, sources said. "Ovako is for sale for sure," said a source at a rival stainless and special steelmaking company who claimed his firm had been offered Ovako by Pampus. "There are a lot of nicely-dressed boys visiting the mills," one supplier told MB. "They are selling Ovako." Ovako directed all enquiries regarding the sale to Pampus, which remained unavailable for comment at the time of writing.

TD
But market participants were not surprised by the news. "Last year they made quite a substantial loss," said one, saying that the company had been unable to reduce costs in line with deflated demand because of Swedish regulations. "The Swedish law is very inflexible on labour," he said. Both Ovako and Pampus were cited in the recent European Commission investigation into a  price-fixing cartel in the European market for pre-stressed steel. Along with Finland's Rautaruukki, formerly a majority shareholder in the company, Ovako was fined €4.7 million ($5.9 million). Pampus and German special steelmaker WDI, which owns a majority share in Pampus Industriebeteiligungen, were  fined a collective €56 million. This was a reduced amount because they cooperated with the investigation, the EC said.

HD      EU/UK Competition Law Newsletter,  July 2010 - EU Cartel Fines; Ability to Pay Becomes Highly

On June 23, 2010, the  European Commission recognized that even its flagship policy (the fight against cartels) must take into account the financial crisis. In adopting a decision fining 17 bathroom equipment manufacturers a total of EUR 622 million for a 12-year  cartel covering six EU countries, the Commission took into account that five of the companies were financially in "very bad shape already," and accordingly reduced the levels of their  fines to "a level they should be able to pay." This approach is referred to in the Commission's 2006 guidelines on  fines, but only now has it become of real practical relevance.

TD
Of the 17 companies, 10 claimed they would be unable to pay, but the Commission found that only half of these claims were justified. This required a case-by-case analysis of financial statements and projections, profitability, solvency and liquidity, as well as the relations between the companies and their banks and shareholders, and "the social and economic context of each company" (which would appear to leave a wide discretion). The justification for reductions in  fines, where appropriate, is that pushing a company into bankruptcy would inevitably reduce competition.
A further illustration of the new importance of this ability-to-pay analysis was provided by the June 30,
2010, decision of the Commission in which it  fined 17 producers of prestressing  steel a total of more
than EUR 518 million. Three of the  fines were reduced by inability-to-pay arguments, albeit a further 10
companies had these applications denied. Also of importance in this decision was the finding that two
companies did not fulfill their obligations to cooperate as leniency applicants, and therefore did not
receive any reduction in their  fines.

European Commission Commitments Procedure Approved by European Court of Justice

In a judgment described by the Commission as "very important," on June 29, 2010, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the Commission's use of commitments to settle competition law investigations.

The case arose out of the Commission's 2006 decision to accept De Beers' (the world's largest rough diamond producer) offer of commitments to progressively phase out by 2009 purchases of rough diamonds from Alrosa (the world's second largest rough diamond producer). This ended an investigation of De Beers under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in the EU).

The essence of the ECJ's judgment is that the commitments procedure is voluntary and accordingly cannot be compared with a case in which the Commission imposes remedies on a party: "undertakings which offer commitments consciously accept that the concessions they make may go beyond what the Commission could itself impose on them in a decision adopted by it." It had not been shown that the commitments manifestly went beyond what was necessary to address the concerns expressed by the Commission.

The Commission will be relieved by this judgment, as it has been making very wide use of the commitments procedure to settle cases, and it has become an important tool in its armory.
UK Directors Face Further Compliance Challenges

On June 29, 2010, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published revised guidance on director disqualification orders in competition law cases, signaling its intent to use these sanctions to deter

Page 84 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
anticompetitive activity. In a statement, the OFT said, "[the] guidance should be taken as a clear message that we will actively seek disqualification of directors found to have engaged in anti-competitive behavior or who ought have known it was going on" (emphasis added). The intention is to increase the incentives on UK directors to take responsibility for competition law compliance by their companies.

The guidance sets out how and when the OFT and certain UK sectoral regulators will take action to disqualify directors where they uncover evidence a director was responsible for, or ought to have known of, competition law breaches at a company. The nature of the breach is relevant and action is "more likely . . . in cases involving more serious breaches" (which principally means cartels).

Under the UK Company Directors Disqualification Act, a director can be disqualified from acting as a director for up to 15 years if his company is involved in a breach of competition law and the court considers that he is unfit to be concerned in the management of a company as a result.

It can be noted that the OFT's specific powers to seek a disqualification order for infringements of competition law have never been used. The three individuals convicted in June 2008 of the UK  cartel offence for their involvement in the marine hose  cartel were disqualified from acting as directors under the general powers available to UK courts in relation to directors who have committed a criminal offence.

Although concerning anticorruption, it is further interesting to note that the new UK Bribery Act 2010 has also increased the compliance difficulties faced by directors of UK companies. That act (which has a wide extraterritorial scope) includes a strict liability offence with unlimited  fines for commercial organizations of failing to prevent bribery being committed. It is a defense for the company to show that it has put in place "adequate procedures" (which is undefined but will no doubt include competition law-type compliance programs) designed to prevent persons associated with the company from undertaking corrupt activities.

These developments provide further illustrations, as if they were needed, of the ever-increasing importance of compliance programs and training covering competition law and corruption issues in the UK.

HD     EU Steel Director  slams cartel market distortion

EU Steel has slammed steel industry cartel market distortion. Senior EU  Steel Director, Pedro Lisboa,
has strongly criticised the pre-stressed steel cartel fined last Wednesday by the European Commission.
“The construction industry has been brought to its knees by the collapse of financial markets. That much
we all knew. What the struggling construction sector didn’t know was the extent to which underhand  steel
companies had been distorting the market, effectively stealing from clients.”

Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of Competition, said, "It is amazing how such a significant number of companies abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product.”

TD
“We applaud Commissioner Almunia’s directness and congratulate the European Commission on a thorough investigation. Critics argue that the investigation took too long, but EU Steel accepts that the complexity and seriousness of this economic crime merits close and detailed scrutiny,” said Lisboa.

“The cartel involved 36 companies from 17 different business groups that have shown an extraordinary arrogance, believing that concealment at this level, at this scale, could go unnoticed for so long. €518 million in fines will go some way to deterring cartels in the future, but it does not return excessive costs to the construction industry.”

He added, "Buyers should re-think their purchase policy of pre-stressed  steel. There is a free and transparent market in Europe, and this deceit is not so quickly forgotten. Companies such as EU  Steel have operated with integrity and sincerity, providing Europe's  steel at fair and competitive prices. We encourage steel buyers to ensure that their pricing also include tenders from firms not impeached by the European Commission this week. When so much is at stake in today's market, buyers must look more earnestly for the best deal, and not simply continue trading with their traditional supplier, especially if that supplier has deceived them."

HD      Reduction of Fines - Economic recession - Not at the Commission - Cartel fines cross €1.4 billion at the end of June 2010

Originally published 6 July 2010
Keywords: EU competition law, cartels, ITP applications,

TD
The financial crisis has not too surprisingly increased the number of applications claiming inability to pay ("ITP") the  fines imposed by the European Commission ("Commission"). Firms reeling from the effects of the downturn in the market find it difficult to pay for breaches of EU competition law. Condemning cartels engaged in by some of the bathroom equipment manufacturers and prestressing  steel producers, the Commission adopted  fines but allowed some of the ITP applications by granting reductions in  fines. However the difficulty involved in satisfying the criteria for upholding such claims of ITP and the high
fines imposed are a reminder to companies that cutting corners is not an option even during a financial crisis.

The EU's Fining Guidelines of 2006 contain only a single paragraph relating to ITP applications. It states that such a relief would be granted only on the basis of objective evidence that would prove that imposition of the  fine would irretrievably jeopardise the economic viability of the undertaking after taking into account its specific social and economic context.

In the bathroom equipment manufacturers  cartel dated 23 June 2010 there were seventeen companies involved and ten ITP applications had been submitted. In view of their difficult financial situations the fines relating to three companies were reduced by 50% and  fines relating to two were reduced by 25%.
Seventeen producers were  fined in the prestressing  steel producers cartel decision dated 30 June 2010 and the Commission had received 13 ITP applications. The Commission granted reductions of 25%, 50% and 75% respectively to three companies.

Although the Commission has not published a revised guideline in relation to its fining policy, in the press release accompanying the decisions (the non-confidential version of which has not been published) it has attempted to provide some clarity as to the evidence that would be considered when assessing ITP applications. In addition to the social and economic context of individual companies involved it would inter alia include evidence relating to:
Financial statements for recent years;
Provisional current year statements and future projections;
Financial ratios that measure a company's solidity, profitability, solvency and liquidity; Relations with banks and shareholders;
Claims of significant loss of value of the company's assets were it to be liquidated as a result of the  fine.

In a recent speech, the European Commissioner for Competition Joaquín Almunia has assured that the Commission would not want to provoke a company's bankruptcy and that claims of ITP would be carefully assessed. He has also made it clear the substantial  fines are necessary to preserve the deterrence aspect of the  fines.

In France, on 19 January 2010, the Paris Court of Appeal reduced a €575 million  fine imposed by the French Competition Authority on  steel companies involved in cartel activities (some being also involved in the EU pre-stressing  steel case) to less than €72 million (approximately). One of the grounds for grant of reduction was that the Authority had failed to consider the major effect that the economic crisis had on the steel industry. In the UK too, the position regarding claims of ITP is under review, with a number of appeals pending before the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The appeals have been launched against the decision of the OFT in September 2009 levying  fines totalling £129.2 million for bid-rigging in the construction sector.

If there was any doubt that Commissioner Joaquín Almunia may be more lenient than his predecessor, it has been dispelled with  cartel fines crossing €1.4 billion at the half year mark when the total  fines imposed in 2009 was €1.6 billion. As to ITP applications at the time of an economic crisis it seems that the Commissioner might agree with the following statement of Neelie Kroes, Former Commissioner for Competition:

"If we were to encourage cartelists and others at this point we would be guaranteeing disaster... No-one wins – today's softness is tomorrow's nightmare."

HD      Competition Bill Introduced in Hong Kong

On July 2, 2010, after several years of drafting and public consultation, Hong Kong unveiled its draft competition bill. The bill, which will be introduced in the legislature on July 14, 2010, would prohibit anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, as well as any abuse of a "significant" market position that has the purpose or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in Hong Kong. The proposed legislation also creates a competition commission to investigate complaints and bring public enforcement proceedings, as well as a competition tribunal to adjudicate cases. As currently drafted, the bill does not include comprehensive merger procedures, though there is a merger rule that would apply only to licensees in the telecommunications industry. If enacted, the legislation would be implemented in 2012.
Federal Agencies Continue Focusing on Competition in Agriculture Markets

TD
On June 25, 2010, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Agriculture held their third joint public workshop on competition and regulation in the agriculture sector. This workshop focused on issues in the dairy industry. Earlier workshops concentrated on grain farming and hog production, and the poultry industry. Two additional workshops are scheduled for this year.

On June 18, 2010, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced proposed changes to the Packers and Stockyards Act, which regulates the livestock and poultry industries. Under the new regulations, which were published June 22, 2010, a meat producer would no longer be required to prove harm to competition when bringing a claim about anticompetitive conduct, and limitations would be placed on poultry growing arrangements, swine production contracts, and how meatpackers obtain cattle on the open market. Public comments on the proposed rules will be accepted through Aug. 23, 2010.

European Commission Reduces Cartel Fines Citing Economic Conditions

The European Commission has recently taken into account that current economic conditions may significantly limit a company's ability to pay a  cartel fine. On June 23, 2010, the commission reduced the fines of five companies that had participated in a bathroom equipment manufacturers  cartel to "a level they should be able to pay," after acknowledging that the companies were financially in "very bad shape already." On June 30, 2010, the commission reduced the  fines of three companies that participated in a prestressing steel producers cartel based on their inability-to-pay arguments. Additional information is available in our July 2010 EU/UK Competition Law Newsletter.

1) Cash flows presented for continuing operations.
2) Stainless  steel: CRU - German base price (2 mm cold rolled 304 sheet). SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
Underlying demand for standard grades continues to recover and this is expected to continue also after the holiday season. Demand for special grades is still lagging. However, commercial activity in the investment-driven customer segments continues and is expected to generate orders within the next 6-12 months.

Currently, the normal seasonality in demand that results from the ongoing holiday season in Europe is causing some distributors to be hesitant about placing orders. The declined nickel price is having a similar impact on buying behaviour. This has led to some destocking among distributors. Inventories in Europe are estimated to be close to normal level.

Lead times on mill-deliveries for standard grades are normal at 6-8 weeks. The slowdown of demand during the holiday season and annual maintenance breaks at the Group's mills will result in stainless delivery volumes for the third quarter to be 10-20% lower than in the second quarter (339 000 tonnes). Compared to the second quarter of 2010, Outokumpu's average base prices in the third quarter are expected to be fairly stable.

The underlying operational result*) in the third quarter is expected to be somewhat negative. At current metal prices, raw material-related losses of some tens of millions of euros are expected in the third quarter as a result of the recent decline in metal prices. Operative cash flow (before investments) in the third quarter is expected to turn positive subject to metal price development.

*) Underlying operational result= Operating profit without raw material-related inventory gains and losses and non-recurring items.
CEO Juha Rantanen:

"After several loss-making quarters it is gratifying to present Outokumpu's return to profits in the second quarter. A clear recovery in the standard grades business and improved prices have been the main factors, while business in capital investment-driven special grades is still lagging. As always, the third quarter is expected to be seasonally weak. We are confident that underlying demand continues to

Page 94 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
improve and we are making preparations to take full advantage of a recovery in demand after the holiday season.

Outokumpu made some major news announcements during the second quarter. The market recovery and our financial performance enabled us to embark on two important strategic investments. The expansion in ferrochrome production is not only about raw material self-sufficiency but also about growth. The investment in quarto plate production solidifies our leading position in the tailor-made plate business, strongly supporting our special grades strategy."

Stainless  steel markets in the second quarter

Stainless  steel markets continued to be healthy in the beginning of the second quarter of 2010. Negative economic reports had an adverse effect on market activity in May and demand for stainless  steel weakened as the nickel price started to decline. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, apparent consumption of stainless  steel flat products in the second quarter is estimated to have been almost unchanged in Europe and 10% higher globally. While in China, apparent consumption is estimated to have increased by 16%. Both in Europe and globally, production of stainless  steel is estimated to have


Page 98 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
been at almost the same level compared to the first quarter of 2010. In China, production of stainless
steel was up by 5%.

The average base price for 2mm cold rolled 304 stainless  steel sheet in Germany increased by 7% and was 1 317 EUR/tonne in the second quarter (I/2010: 1 235 EUR/tonne). The alloy surcharge increased by
55% and was 1 701 EUR/tonne (I/2010: 1 094 EUR/tonne). The average transaction price during the second quarter was 3 018 EUR/tonne (I/2010: 2 329 EUR/tonne). (CRU)

Among alloying elements, the price of nickel was on a rising trend at the beginning of the second quarter and reached a level of 27 000 USD/tonne in mid-April. It then began to decline and was some 18 000
USD/tonne at the beginning of June before rebounding to around 20 000 USD/tonne in late-June. The average nickel price during the second quarter was 22 476 USD/tonne (I/2010: 19 959 USD/tonne). Ferrochrome markets were close to balance in the second quarter. The quarterly contract price for ferrochrome in the second quarter was 1.36 USD/lb (I/2010: 1.01 USD/lb) and has preliminarily been settled at 1.30 USD/lb for the third quarter. The average price of molybdenum was 16.45 USD/lb in the second quarter (I/2010: 16.19 USD/lb) while the price of recycled  steel increased by 7% and averaged
346 USD/tonne (I/2010: 323 USD/tonne).
Return to profits in the second quarter

Group sales in the second quarter increased to EUR 1 110 million (I/2010: EUR 916 million). Deliveries of stainless steel increased marginally to 339 000 tonnes (I/2010: 333 000 tonnes). Capacity utilisation at Group operations was approximately 75% with Tornio Works running at a higher rate than the Group average during the second quarter.

After several loss-making quarters, the Group turned to profits with an operating profit in the second quarter totalling EUR 71 million (I/2010: EUR -22 million). This figure includes some EUR 55 million (I/2010: EUR 10 million) of raw-material related inventory gains which resulted primarily from higher nickel prices. Higher base prices and a higher ferrochrome price also had an effect and the underlying operational result in the second quarter turned positive at EUR 16 million (I/2010: EUR -32 million). Outokumpu's average base prices for flat products realised in the second quarter increased by some 60
EUR/tonne but were below base prices reported by CRU for German 304 sheet.
Return on capital employed in the second quarter was 7.2% (I/2010: -2.4%). Earnings per share totalled EUR 0.24 (I/2010: EUR -0.12).
Net cash generated from operating activities in continuing operations remained negative and amounted to EUR -314 million (I/2010: -86 million). In the second quarter, EUR 402 million of cash was tied up in working capital as a result of increased purchase of raw materials as well as higher metal prices. Inventories were increased in the second quarter in order to compensate for the lost production during the planned maintenance breaks in order to meet the expected increase in demand after the holiday period.

Outokumpu's gearing at the end of the second quarter was 67.6% (Mar 31, 2010: 53.5%), still below the Group's target level of <75%. Net-interest bearing debt increased by EUR 390 million to EUR 1 683 million (I/2010: EUR 1 293 million) in the second quarter. The dividend for 2009 totalling EUR 64 million was paid in the second quarter. In June, Outokumpu issued a EUR 250 million domestic five-year bond. The bond improved the structure of the Group's debt portfolio and will be used for general corporate purposes.
Capital expenditure totalled EUR 40 million (I/2010: EUR 28 million) in the second quarter.

Sales by General Stainless in the second quarter totalled EUR 962 million (I/2010: EUR 754 million), and deliveries increased to 309 000 tonnes (I/2010: 304 000 tonnes). General Stainless returned to profits with an operating profit of EUR 75 million (I/2010: EUR -2 million) and Tornio Works posted a profit of EUR 63 million (I/2010: EUR -7 million).

Sales by Specialty Stainless in the second quarter totalled EUR 469 million (I/2010: EUR 367 million) and deliveries totalled 119 000 tonnes (I/2010: 111 000 tonnes). Operating profit was positive at EUR 22 million (I/2010: EUR -21 million).

Other Operations posted an operating loss of EUR 15 million (I/2010: EUR 2 million) in the second quarter.
Finalised investment projects
Outokumpu has established a service centre in China, the world's fastest-growing market for stainless
steel. The new facility supports the Group strategy of expanding operations in Asia and serving end-user

Page 99 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and project customers with value-added special products. In the main, Outokumpu's offering to the Chinese market consists of special grades, especially duplex grades, employed in the most demanding applications in the energy, petrochemical, transportation and pulp and paper sectors. The new Kunshan service centre has an annual capacity of some 30 000 tonnes of stainless  steel and employs approximately 50 people and represents an investment by the Group of some EUR 20 million.

A new stainless  steel bar and rebar facility was opened in June in Sheffield, UK. The new plant broadens the Group's product range and can offer stainless  steel rebar in straight lengths or formed components as well as produce cold-drawn bar. Outokumpu can now serve its long products customers from a
fully-integrated production route in Sheffield. This investment totalled some EUR 10 million.
New investment decisions

In June, based on the results of the updated feasibility study, the decision was made to invest EUR 440 million in doubling ferrochrome production capacity at Tornio in Finland. The original decision on this investment was made in June 2008 but the financial crisis and uncertain market conditions resulted in it being put on hold in December 2008. Annual ferrochrome production in Tornio will be doubled to 530 000 tonnes enabling the Group to meet its internal needs and also supply the global market with more than
200 000 tonnes of ferrochrome annually. Implementation of the project will begin immediately and the additional production capacity is expected to be operational in 2013 and ramped up in 2015. The main capital expenditure cash outflows will take place in 2011 and 2012.

The decision to invest EUR 104 million in increasing quarto plate production capability and capacity in Degerfors in Sweden was also made in June. This investment strengthens Outokumpu's position as a world-leading producer of these thick, wide and individually rolled plates and will increase the Group's annual quarto plate production capacity to more than 200 000 tonnes. The majority of the new production capacity is scheduled to be available in 2014. Capital expenditure will be spread over five years with the majority of cash out-flows taking place in 2012 and 2013.
Domestic bond issued

In June, Outokumpu issued a EUR 250 million five-year domestic bond. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The bond is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki exchange.
Events after the review period

At the beginning of July, the Finnish Parliament voted on decisions-in-principle to build two new nuclear power plants in Finland. The voting was positive for Fennovoima, in which Outokumpu has a stake of some 10%. Once the new nuclear power plant is operational, Outokumpu will be able to obtain approximately one third of its current electricity needs at the cost of production from 2020 onwards.
INTERIM REVIEW BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS - JANUARY-JUNE 2010
Recovery in stainless  steel markets

Stainless  steel markets started to recover from the beginning of 2010 with demand especially for standard grades improving significantly compared to the beginning of 2009. In May, negative economic reports in Europe resulted in a softening market conditions for stainless  steel and the decline of the nickel price from its year-high levels led to some destocking by distributors. Compared to the first half of 2009, apparent consumption of stainless  steel during the first half of 2010 is estimated to be up by 53% in Europe and 35% globally. The average German base price for 2mm cold rolled 304 stainless  steel sheet was 1 276 EUR/tonne during the first six months of 2010 (I-II/2009: 1 021 EUR/tonne) and the average transaction price during the period was 2 674 EUR/tonne (I-II/2009: 1 784 EUR/tonne).

During the first half of 2010, the nickel price averaged 21 217 USD/tonne (I-II/2009: 11 696 USD/tonne) and the average contract price for ferrochrome was 1.19 USD/lb (I-II/2009: 0.74 USD/lb). The average price of molybdenum during the first six months of 2010 was 16.32 USD/lb (I-II/2009: 9.28 USD/lb) and the average price of recycled  steel was 335 USD/tonne (I-II/2009: 203 USD/tonne).
(CRU)
Profitability improved with higher delivery volumes

Group sales in the first half of 2010 increased by 56% to EUR 2 026 million (I-II/2009: EUR 1 296 million) as a result of both higher transaction prices and higher delivery volumes. Deliveries of stainless  steel increased by 30% to 672 000 tonnes (I-II/2009: 515 000 tonnes). Group production facilities were operating at 75% capacity utilisation in the first half of 2010.


Page 100 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Operating profit for the first half of 2010 totalled EUR 49 million (I-II/2009: EUR -343 million). This result includes some EUR 65 million of raw material-related gains (I-II/2009: EUR -110 million) with the underlying result being some EUR -16 million (I-II/2009: EUR -228 million). The main contributors to the improved result were higher base prices and higher delivery volumes. The operating profit in the first six months of 2010 did not include any non-recurring items. In the first half of 2009 the operating loss included EUR 5 million of redundancy provisions.

Net financial income and expenses in the first half of 2010 totalled EUR -10 million (I-II/2009: EUR -10 million). Net profit for the review period totalled EUR 23 million (I-II/2009: EUR -274 million) and earnings per share totalled EUR 0.13 (I-II/2009: EUR -1.52). Return on capital employed during the first six months of 2010 was 2.5% (I-II/2009: -18.8%).

Net cash generated from operating activities totalled EUR -401 million (I-II/2009: EUR 316 million) in the first six months of 2010. Some EUR 445 million (I-II/2009: release of EUR 640 million) was tied up in working capital as a result of higher metal prices and higher inventory levels. Net interest-bearing debt increased by EUR 757 million and totalled EUR 1 683 million at the end of June 2010 (Jun 30, 2009: EUR
926 million). Gearing increased to 67.6% (Jun 30, 2009: 37.1%) approaching the Group's target of a maximum of 75%. In June, Outokumpu issued a EUR 250 million five-year domestic bond, which was listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki exchange in July. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes.
Capital expenditure and investments

Capital expenditure in the first half of 2010 totalled EUR 68 million (I-II/2009: EUR 107 million) and covered the finalising of ongoing investment projects and maintenance. Capital expenditure by the Group in 2010 including the new investment projects announced in 2010 is expected to total approximately EUR
200 million.
Investment projects in China and the UK were completed in June. Now open, the Group's service centre
in Kunshan represents an investment of some EUR 20 million, employs approximately 50 people and has
an annual capacity of some 30 000 tonnes of stainless  steel. In Sheffield in the UK, a new stainless  steel
bar and rebar facility was opened. This investment totalled some EUR 10 million.

In June, based on the results of an updated feasibility study, the decision was made to invest EUR 440 million in doubling ferrochrome production capacity at Tornio in Finland. The original decision on this investment was made in June 2008, but the financial crisis and uncertain market conditions resulted in it being put on hold in December 2008. Annual ferrochrome production in Tornio will be doubled to 530 000 tonnes enabling the Group to meet its internal needs and also supply the global market with more than
200 000 tonnes of ferrochrome annually. Implementation of the project will begin immediately and the additional production capacity is expected to be operational in 2013 and ramped up in 2015. The main capital expenditure cash outflows will take place in 2011 and 2012.

The decision to invest EUR 104 million in increasing quarto plate production capability and capacity in Degerfors in Sweden was also made in June. This investment strengthens Outokumpu's position as a world-leading producer of these thick, wide and individually rolled plates and will increase the Group's annual quarto plate production capacity to more than 200 000 tonnes. The majority of the new production capacity is scheduled to be available in 2014. Capital expenditure will be spread over five years with the majority of cash out-flows taking place in 2012 and 2013.
Risks and uncertainties

Outokumpu operates in accordance with the risk management policy approved by its Board of Directors. This policy defines the objectives, approaches and areas of responsibility in risk management. Risks and uncertainties may, if they materialise, have a substantial impact on earnings and cash flows. Key risks are assessed and updated on a regular basis.

Important strategic and business risks include structural overcapacity in stainless  steel production, competition in stainless  steel markets, the Euro-centricity of the Group's operations and weakening of the market situation affecting utilisation of the Group's stainless  steel production capacity. To mitigate risks related to structural overcapacity and fierce competition in stainless  steel markets, Outokumpu aims to maintain the cost-efficiency of its operations, broaden the Group's product offering and increase sales to end-users by, for example, developing distribution channels. This strategy is supported by the Group Sales and Marketing function, which ensures that customers are served in an optimal way. To mitigate impact of Euro-centricity, Outokumpu is also aiming to grow outside Europe.
The recovery in stainless  steel markets continued during the review period.


Page 101 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Outokumpu monitors the situation continuously and will adjust its operations in response to possible changes in the market situation. If the market for stainless  steel remains weak for an extended period, this could have an impact on the Group's strategy implementation.

Operational risks arise as a consequence of inadequate or failed internal processes, employee actions, systematic or other events such as natural catastrophes, misconduct or crime. Operational risks also include different issues related to organisational efficiency. Key operational risks are a major fire or accident and insufficient ability to adjust production capacity.

Protection of the Group's personnel, assets, processes, information and reputation against a wide range of potential losses is an essential component in Outokumpu's operations. These types of risks are primarily mitigated through preventive actions and insurances. To reduce the risk of property damage and interruptions to the Group's businesses, Outokumpu conducts systematic fire and security auditing.

Key financial risk are related to variations in the nickel and electricity prices, exchange rates for the US dollar and Swedish krona, interest rates and the value of receivables as well as certain equities. The strengthening of the US dollar during the second quarter had a slight positive impact on earnings but also increased Group working capital. Outokumpu issued a EUR 250 million five-year bond in June, which improved the Group's debt capital structure.
People and the environment
The Group's continuing operations employed an average of 7 900 full-time personnel during
January-June 2010 (I-II/2009: 8 184). Summer-trainees expanded the number of full-time employees to
8 617 (June 30, 2009: 7 985) at the end of June. The lost-time injury rate (i.e. lost-time accidents per
million working hours) improved during the second quarter and was 5.0 for the first half of 2010 (I-II/2009:
5.6), but did not reach the Group's 2010 target of less than four.

Emissions to air and discharges to water remained within permitted limits and the breaches that occurred were temporary, were identified and caused only minimal environmental impact. Outokumpu is not a party in any significant juridical or administrative proceeding concerning environmental issues, nor is it aware of any realised environmental risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position.

Emissions trading activities have been conducted in accordance with obligations, agreed procedures and the Group's financial risk policy. Emissions under the EU Emission Trading Scheme during the first half of
2010 totalled approximately 389 000 tonnes (I-II/2009: 282 000 tonnes). The main reason for the low level of emissions in 2009 was the temporary closure of the Group's ferrochrome production facilities from April until the end of September. No external trading of emission allowances was carried out during the first six months of 2010.

Outokumpu's carbon dioxide allowances in Finland, Sweden and the UK proved adequate for the Group's planned production.

Outokumpu is participating in the construction of a wind farm in Tornio in Finland. Rajakiiri, a company specialising in wind power technology, has decided to invest in a 30 MW wind farm at Röyttä, close to the Tornio Works site.

Outokumpu will be allocated 20% of the electrical energy produced. This new wind power project will meet approximately 0.5% of Outokumpu's total energy needs.

The Life Cycle Inventory Study on Stainless  Steel Production in the EU shows that Outokumpu products have the smallest carbon footprint, 10-20% less than the EU average for stainless  steel producers. Outokumpu also published a new Energy and Low-carbon Programme.

In 2010, for the second time, Outokumpu was awarded "Sector Mover" status by Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) for having the largest proportional annual improvement in sustainability performance within the  steel industry compared to the previous year. Outokumpu also qualified for the OMX GES Sustainability Nordic index. Calculated by NASDAQ OMX in cooperation with GES Investment Services, this is a benchmark sustainability index which consists of 50 leading companies listed on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen, Helsinki, Stockholm and Oslo Bors exchanges.
Civil actions regarding the sold fabricated copper products business

In the autumn of 2004, the European Commission issued its judgment on Outokumpu's participation in a European price-fixing and market-sharing cartel involving sanitary copper tubes during 1988-2001 and imposed a fine of EUR 36 million on Outokumpu for participation in the  cartel. In 2004, Outokumpu appealed to the General Court (previously known as the Court of First Instance for Europe) regarding the

Page 102 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
level of the  fine. According to a Court decision issued in May 2010 the  fine remained unchanged. As Outokumpu paid the  fines in 2009, this decision will have no impact on Group profits or cash flow. Outokumpu exited the copper fabrication business by divesting the major part of the Group's business in
2005 and the remaining units in 2008.

In connection with the industrial tubes  cartel investigation, Outokumpu Oyj has since 2004 been in the process of addressing several civil complaints raised in the US against the company and its former fabricated copper products business in the US. The majority of those complaints have been concluded, but two civil actions are still pending in the US. The first of these is a class action brought in the federal court of Tennessee on behalf of certain indirect purchasers of industrial copper tubing. Outokumpu believes that this class action lacks merit and is attempting to reach a favourable resolution. The second pending civil complaint in the US, an individual action filed in 2006 in the federal district court in Memphis, Tennessee seeks an unstated amount of damages related to an alleged world-wide  price-fixing and market allocation  cartel. The court dismissed this complaint in 2007, and it is the appeal against that dismissal which is currently pending. In 2010, a third civil action was brought in the UK courts against Outokumpu Oyj (and two other defendant groups) by the same claimant group as that in the Memphis
suit. The claimants allege that they suffered loss across Europe as a result of the  cartel and are seeking to recovery from the three main defendant groups either jointly or jointly and severally. The claimants' initial claim for alleged losses (between the three defendant groups) is some GBP 20 million excluding interest. Outokumpu will be challenging the jurisdiction of the UK courts to hear this claim. In any event, Outokumpu believes that the allegations regarding damages caused by the  cartel are groundless and, if pursued, Outokumpu will defend itself in any proceedings.
No provisions have been booked in connection with these claims. Customs investigation of exports to Russia by Tornio Works
In March 2007, Finnish Customs authorities initiated a criminal investigation into the Group's Tornio Works' export practices to Russia. It was suspected that a forwarding agency based in south-eastern Finland had prepared defective and/or forged invoices regarding the export of stainless  steel to Russia. The preliminary investigation focused on possible complicity by Outokumpu Tornio Works in the preparation of defective and/or forged invoices by the forwarding agent.

In June 2009, the Finnish Customs completed its preliminary investigation and forwarded the matter for consideration of possible charges to the prosecuting authorities. The process of considering possible charges is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010.

Immediately after the Finnish Customs authorities began their investigations in 2007, Outokumpu initiated its own investigation into the trade practices connected with stainless  steel exports from Tornio to Russia. In June 2007, based on its own investigation, a leading Finnish law firm Roschier Attorneys Ltd.
concluded that it had not found evidence that any employees of Tornio Works or the Group would have committed any of the crimes alleged by the Finnish Customs.

Roschier has subsequently, at Outokumpu's request, examined the preliminary investigation material produced by the Finnish Customs and concluded that it contains no evidence that any Outokumpu employees would have committed either forgery or any accounting offences as alleged by the Finnish Customs.

Outokumpu's Auditor, KPMG Oy Ab, has also stated that suspicions related to the making of false financial statements are groundless.

Outokumpu has stated that neither the Group nor its personnel have committed any of the crimes alleged by the Finnish Customs.

18 000 000. These authorisations are valid for 12 months or until the next AGM, but no longer than May
31, 2011.
To date, the authorisations have not been used.
The 2010 Annual General Meeting also decided that Outokumpu would make a donation (a maximum of
EUR 1 million) to the Aalto University Foundation.

The AGM decided on the number of the Board members, including the Chairman and Vice Chairman, to be eight. The Outokumpu board members are: Evert Henkes, Ole Johansson (Chairman), Victoire de Margerie, Anna Nilsson-Ehle, Jussi Pesonen, Leena Saarinen, Anssi Soila (Vice Chairman) and Olli Vaartimo. The AGM also resolved to form a Shareholders' Nomination Committee to prepare proposals on the composition and remuneration of the Board of Directors for presentation to the next AGM.
Events after the review period

At the beginning of July, the Finnish Parliament voted on decisions-in-principle to build two new nuclear power plants in Finland. The voting was positive for Fennovoima, in which Outokumpu has a stake of some 10%. Once the new nuclear power plant is operational, Outokumpu will be able to obtain approximately one third of its current electricity needs at the cost of production from 2020 onwards.
SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK

Underlying demand for standard grades continues to recover and this is expected to continue also after the holiday season. Demand for special grades is still lagging. However, commercial activity in the investment-driven customer segments continues and is expected to generate orders within the next 6-12 months.

Currently, the normal seasonality in demand that results from the ongoing holiday season in Europe is causing some distributors to be hesitant about placing orders. The declined nickel price is having a similar impact on buying behaviour. This has led to some destocking among distributors. Inventories in Europe are estimated to be close to normal level.

Lead times on mill-deliveries for standard grades are normal at 6-8 weeks. The slowdown of demand during the holiday season and annual maintenance breaks at the Group's mills will result in stainless delivery volumes for the third quarter to be 10-20% lower than in the second quarter (339 000 tonnes).

Compared to the second quarter of 2010, Outokumpu's average base prices in the third quarter are expected to be fairly stable.

The underlying operational result*) in the third quarter is expected to be somewhat negative. At current metal prices, raw material-related losses of some tens of millions of euros are expected in the third quarter as a result of the recent decline in metal prices. Operative cash flow (before investments) in the third quarter is expected to turn positive subject to metal price development.

*) Underlying operational result= Operating profit without raw material-related inventory gains and losses and non-recurring items.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

This interim report is prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting). The same accounting policies and methods of computation have been followed in the interim financial statements as in the annual financial statements for 2009, except for changes in IFRS-standards, which are applicable from the beginning of 2010. Of these, the most significant are in the following standards:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
These changes have not had material impact on the interim financial statements.

All presented figures in this interim report have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual figures can deviate from the presented sum figure. Key figures have been calculated using exact figures.
Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Accounting estimates are employed in the financial statements to determine reported amounts, including the realisability of certain assets, the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, provisions, pension obligations, impairment of goodwill and other items. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from the estimates.

Page 113 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Outokumpu has a stock option programme for management. The stock options have been allocated as part of the Group's incentive programmes to key personnel of Outokumpu. The option programme has three parts 2003A, 2003B and 2003C. On June 30, 2010 a total of 650 881 Outokumpu Oyj shares had been subscribed for on the basis of 2003A stock option programme, a total of 1 016 813 Outokumpu Oyj shares on the basis of 2003B stock option programme and a total of 38 000 Outokumpu Oyj shares on the basis of 2003C stock option programme. On June 30, 2010, only stock options 2003C had remaining share subscription period and an aggregate maximum of 62 500 shares can be subscribed with the remaining 2003C stock options. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the option programme, the dividend adjusted share price for a stock option 2003C was EUR 10.09 on June 30, 2010. As a result of the remaining share options, Outokumpu Oyj's share capital may be increased by a maximum of EUR
106 250 and the number of shares by a maximum of 62 500 shares. This corresponds to 0.0% of the
Company's shares and voting rights.

Outokumpu has also two share-based incentive programmes for years 2006-2010 and 2009-2013 as part of the key employee incentive and commitment system of the Company. The second earnings period for
2006-2010 incentive programme was ended on December 31, 2009. The set targets for the earnings period were not met and thus no reward was paid to the participants.

Outokumpu Board approved on February 2, 2010 134 employees to be in the scope of the share incentive programme 2009-2013 second earnings period (2010-2012). The amount of reward will be determined and paid to the participants on the basis of the achievement of performance targets after the financial statements of the last year of earnings period have been prepared. If persons covered by both share-based incentive programmes were to receive the number of shares in accordance with the maximum reward, currently a total of 1 050 580 shares, their shareholding obtained via the programme would amount to 0.6% of the Company's shares and voting rights.

Detailed information on the option programme and of the share-based incentive programmes can be found in the annual report of Outokumpu fromhttp://ar.outokumpu.com/2009.
