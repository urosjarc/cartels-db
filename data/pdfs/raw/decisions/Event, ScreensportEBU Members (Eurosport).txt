BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission ruled Wednesday against a deal under which 17 European broadcasters give sports  programs to Eurosport, the satellite  television channel they run with British  Sky Broadcasting.

The ruling was in favor of Screensport, a U.K.-based satellite  sports  channel owned by book retailer WH Smith and Son Ltd. that charged Eurosport kept it from gaining fair access to European  sports programs.

TD
A venture of 17 members of the European Broadcasting Union and British  Sky Broadcasting, Eurosport has "preferential access to certain  sports  coverage produced by EBU members to the detriment of Screensport," the Commission said.
Through the EBU, broadcasters across the EC and other European nations share tape of news,
sports  and other events.
Jonathan Faull, an aide to EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, said EBU members
"should not extend that sharing scheme to one satellite channel operator."

Seventeen EBU members give  sports  shows to Eurosport, which began broadcasting in 1989, to the exclusion of other satellite channels.

"We say the agreement they concluded, bringing Eurosport within (the EBU), that agreement cannot stand," Faull said.

The Commission did not say how the EBU should distance itself from Eurosport, but Faull said it should be an "arms-length" arrangement.
The EC fixed no date by which the EBU-Eurosport agreement should comply with the European
Community's fair trade rules. But Faull said it should be "as soon as possible."

In London, BSB spokeswoman Fiona Waters said "it's too early for us to comment," on the Eurosport ruling.

Ms. Waters said Eurosport also buys  sports  programs from broadcasters outside the EBU, but could not say how much.

Francis Baron, chief executive at Screensport, which launched the complaint and has since been renamed The European  Sports Network, called the EC action "a total endorsement of our complaint."
"It will enable Screensport to compete in the marketplace for the first time on a fair basis," he said. Eurosport began broadcasting in February 1989. But the Screensport complaint dates back to
December 1987. Both broadcast via the Astra satellite, owned by a Luxembourg-based consortium
and neither has yet made any money.
Baron said Screensport had a loss of 3 million pounds, or $1.6 million, in the six months ending Nov.
30. Sources put Eurosport's 1990 losses at 20 million pounds, or $10.5 million.

Eurosport has a larger market than Screensport. It was given the Astra slot by  News International PLC, which owns half of Eurosport, that was used by its  Sky Television until it ran into financial trouble last year.

This gave Eurosport immediate access to between 16 and 17 million European homes. Eurosport has been entirely financed by  News International, with the EBU providing program rights.

LONDON, Feb 20, Reuter - The satellite  sports television channel Screensport welcomed in a statement the European Commission's decision to declare illegal the exclusive rights of rival channel Eurosport to transmit sporting events.

Screensport, majority owned by U.K. retailer W.H. Smith Group Plc, had made a complaint about the operation of Eurosport, a partially-owned unit of  News International Plc's British  Sky Broadcasting.

TD
Screensport said the ruling had immediate effect and it will enable Screensport and other satellite channels to compete on an equal basis for the rights to European  sporting events.

Commenting on the ruling, Francis Baron, chief executive of Screensport's European  sports  network, said, "The confirmation by the  European Commission of its earlier assessment of our complaint is a total endorsement of our position and of the principle of free competition in the  television market."
Eurosport is 50 pct owned by  News International and 50 pct by a consortium of European  television
broadcasters known as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

The European Commission ruling was directed against an agreement between the EBU,  News          International and Eurosport over the transmission of  sporting events.

BRUSSELS, Feb 20, Reuter - The  European Commission dealt a blow to media magnate Rupert Murdoch's television empire on Wednesday by outlawing his Eurosport satellite channel's exclusive rights to broadcast major  sports  events.

The European Community executive said a deal, securing exclusive supply of  sports  footage to Eurosport from a string of public  television companies in Europe, broke strict EC laws on free competition.

TD
"The effect of these agreements was to limit and distort free competition," it said in a statement.
"This decision (to outlaw exclusive rights) will ensure a level playing field between broadcasters of
sports  events in the European transnational satellite  television sector."
The action followed complaints by rival  sports  channel Screensport, majority owned by British retailer
W.H. Smith, that it was being shut out of the market.

Screensport said the ruling had immediate effect and would enable it and other satellite channels to compete equally.

"The confirmation by the  European Commission of its earlier assessment of our complaint is a total endorsement of our position and of the principle of free competition in the  television market," said Francis Baron, head of Screensport's European  sports  network.

Sports footage was being supplied to Eurosport by almost half of the stations in the European
Broadcasting Union (EBU), a grouping of Europe's public service channels.
Eurosport is 50 per cent owned by Murdoch's  News International Plc, through British  Sky
Broadcasting, and 50 per cent by the EBU.

The swipe at Murdoch's media empire, which embraces newspapers, TV and publishing companies across the globe, may not be the last EC step to open up the industry.
Commission anti-trust officials are probing the EBU, whose 39 member stations include the British
Broadcasting Corporation and France's Antenne 2, to see whether their alliance is also
anti-competitive.

The Commission said it was ready to approve the alliance late last year after guarantees by the stations that they would give private channels access to their programmes.

Several satellite channels attacked its plans, however, and the Commission has since been silent on the issue.

THE European Commission ruled yesterday that Eurosport, the satellite  television sports  channel linked to Mr Rupert Murdoch, infringed EC competition regulations by entering into an effective joint venture agreement with the Eurovision network to shut out rivals, write David Gardner and Alice Rawsthorn.

The agreement was between the Eurosport Consortium, Sky Television (which now operates as the BSkyB satellite  television service), Mr Murdoch's News International, and a group of members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

TD
The Commission judged that potential competitors were co-operating, thereby denying access to programmes from other satellite or cable services, strengthening the position of EBU members and the former Sky television service.

Eurosport was receiving preferential access to EBU-produced  sports  coverage, to the detriment of competitors such as Screensport, which brought the complaint and is a joint venture between WH Smith, the UK retailing group, and the cable channel ESPN.
The Commission's ruling clears the way for all satellite channels to compete for the right to screen
European sports  events.
Mr Francis Baron, managing director of WHSTV (WH Smith  Television), said the ruling would 'enable
Screensport to compete in the marketplace for the first time on a fair basis.'
Mr Murdoch's News International said earlier this year it intended to sell its 50 per cent holding in
Eurosport.

The European Commission has ruled that Eurosport, the satellite  sports television station jointly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International and a consortium of European public service broadcasters, including the BBC, is in breach of European competition laws.

The decision means that Eurosport will lose its exclusive access to  sporting events like the World Cup, the Olympics and European Athletics. Eurosport was set up on the basis that the 17 public service broadcasters involved all members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) made the rights to sports coverage they produced available on the basis that News International covered the costs of running the channel. Eurosport is broadcast as part of British Sky Broadcasting from the Astra satellite.

TD
Unless the Eurosport consortium successfully appeals against the decision, it is likely to spell the end for the channel which relies heavily on these exclusive rights. Mr Murdoch said recently that he wanted to sell his 50 per cent shareholding, but the ruling is considered to make his stake worthless.

The Commission has spent three years considering the case after a complaint from a rival satellite channel, Screensport, which is owned by WH Smith. Francis Baron, chief executive of WH Smith TV, called the decision "a total endorsement of our position".

The Commission said: "the effects of these agreements was to limit and distort free competition. They brought together two potential competitors for  sports  programmes so they co-operated instead of competing, while denying access to programmes for other satellite or cable services."

HD          EUROSPORT SAYS EC RULING ON TV RIGHTS NOT FATAL. BY           By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Feb 21, Reuter - Satellite  television channel Eurosport, a unit of  News International Plc, said it saw no reason to stop operating after the  European Commission stripped it of exclusive rights to broadcast  sports  events.

Eurosport spokesman Daniel Mortier said the group was "surprised and deeply disappointed" by the EC executive's decision to outlaw a deal giving it exclusive access to  sports  footage from a string of public television companies in Europe.

TD
"As far as we know there is no decision refraining us from working," Mortier told Reuters.

Eurosport is 50 pct owned by British  Sky Broadcasting (BSKYB), formed when Rupert Murdoch's  Sky TV merged with rival satellite service British Satellite Broadcasting. The other half is held by 17 public television companies.

Mortier said Eurosport had yet to decide whether to appeal against the EC ban but that there was no evidence it forced them to stop broadcasting.

Rival channel Screensport, controlled by retailer W.H. Smith Group Plc, had complained that Eurosport's deal was shutting it out of the lucrative  sports television market and welcomed the Commission's decision on Wednesday.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Italy's RAI and Ireland's RTE are among the public stations backing Eurosport since it started up two years ago.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which groups almost all Europe's public  television
channels, refused any comment on Eurosport's troubles.

The Commission's anti-trust department in Brussels is also probing the EBU to see if its agreements on joint purchasing of TV rights and other deals also break strict EC laws on free competition.

The EBU was close to receiving clearance from the Commission last year after promising to make programmes available to private  television stations but the Commission went silent after objections by private channels.

Mortier said the row with the EBU was closely tied to the problems with Eurosport because Eurosport was relayed through the EBU's Eurovision network, which broadcasts to some 475 million people in Europe.

A Commission official said the EBU probe raised "some of the same sort of questions" but that the subject was even more complex.
