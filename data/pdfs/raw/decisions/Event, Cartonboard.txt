BRUSSELS, July 1 (Reuter) - The European Commission is expected to rule later this month whether European carton board manufacturers have been operating a  cartel, industry officials said.

A Commission official confirmed that the Commission would be taking a decision soon on the issue, but declined to say whether it would be fining companies or who they might be.

TD
The Commission started an investigation into alleged price-fixing  practices in the sector about three years ago following a complaint filed by  carton board users, the industry sources said.
There are only 10 to 15 board markers in  Europe.

They are based in Scandinavian countries, Germany, Britain, Austria, France and Italy. Industry sources also refused to give the names of the companies involved in the investigation.

The board is sold to  carton makers, much more numerous, which in return supply another handfull of food firms, Mans Lejeune, secretary of The Hague-based  European Carton Makers Association said.

European board mills have a strong position but that was not an unusual situation, he said. Most of the mills were in the red because of the recession affecting the  paper industry.

However, he knew of a British  carton maker which had complained about board manufacturers' practices.
But he said, "In those circumstances (recession), it would be a bit peculiar if companies were to be
fined."

He said that  carton board prices were quite different from one  European Union country to the other due partly to last year devaluations. A  European price was highly desirable because of the strong competition between  carton makers, he added.

The Commission warned the industry in February against any concerted practices which distort competition.

In February the Commission  fined 16 steelmakers a record 104 million  European currency units for fixing  prices, sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information on the EU-wide market for steel beams.
Most of the steelmakers are challenging the Commission's decision before the  European Court of First
Instance.
It has also been investigating the cement industry.

VIENNA, July 12 (Reuter) - Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, the Austrian  packaging firm whose shares hit a record low earlier before recovering somewhat, could be  fined on Wednesday by the  European Commission for price fixing,  a company spokesman said.

The company has already set aside reserves to cover a possible  fine, which can amount to 10 percent of group turnover, he said. He could not say to what extent reserves had been set aside, however.

TD
"Mayr-Melnhof drew attention to this case and the possible maximum  fine in its issue prospectus in
April," said the official in charge of Mayr-Melnhof Karton public relations.
Group turnover in 1993 was 8.44 billion schillings, down from 9.39 billion in 1992.

Mayr-Melnhof shares went 10 percent limit down in Vienna, falling 62 schillings to 558, but recovered some of the lost ground to close down 34 at 586.
The shares were priced at 720 schillings on issue.

On Monday the company warned that higher prices for used  paper, one of its main raw materials, would hit its earnings outlook in the short term. -- Jonathan Lynn, Vienna Newsroom, 43-1-53112-254

BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuter) - The European Commission is set to fine 22 carton board manufacturers on Wednesday for operating a price fixing  cartel, Commission officials said.

The decision to impose the  fines was taken by Commissioners' chief aides on Monday, but the amount of the fines was still to be agreed by them later on Tuesday, they said.

TD
It will be the second time that the EU executive has imposed  fines for price fixing  this year and the officials said the case was the worst example of price-fixing  the EU executive had ever studied.
"This is the worst case the Commission has ever studied," one official said.

Under EU competition rules the  fines could total up to 10 per cent of the 2.3 billion Ecu turnover of the industry.

Austria's Mayr Melnhof Karton AG said on Tuesday it expected to be  fined. Officials said one of the outstanding questions to be settled revolved around whether Sweden's Stora STOR.ST should receive a 75 per cent refund of the  fine for good practice.

The Commission started the investigation into the price  fixing  about three years ago following a complaint from  carton board users.

Single telecoms regulator call.

TD
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, will call tonight for a single EU telecommunications regulator in a move set to intensify the debate on the future role of Brussels in a liberalised telecoms industry. Acknowledging 'ideological' objections to an increase in EU regulatory powers, Sir Iain claims that it is nonetheless 'difficult to see' how any other regime could ensure fair telecoms competition across the EU. The call comes at a critical stage in the EU telecoms liberalisation process. The Corfu heads of government summit last month agreed to an acceleration in the pace of telecommunications liberalisation, in particular by opening infrastructure to competition, instead of services alone as previously agreed. In his speech to the  European Policy Forum, Sir Iain says: 'a level playing field requires a pan-European regulatory regime, properly enforced by a well-balanced,
pan-European regulator.' Sir Iain's remarks reflect BT's ambitions to compete with established national operators - still mostly monopolies - on the mainland. A year ago it forged a $5.3bn (#3.39bn) alliance with MCI of the US to offer one-stop services to multinationals, the first challenge to existing  European operators in their own markets.

Europe-wide SE planned.

A group of leading  European stockbrokers, venture capitalists, investment bankers and stock exchange representatives have formed a new association to create a pan-European stock exchange for
fast-growing companies. The new group, the  European Association, has obtained funding from the European Commission for research into the likely number of potential listees on the new exchange. Participants are seeking to model the new exchange along the lines of Nasdaq, the US-based stock market, which has grown to be the world's second-largest in turnover by listing shares of small,
fast-growing companies. The  European Venture Capital Association is the prime sponsor for the project. Nasdaq has already said it supports the venture and would like to be a minority shareholder in a new exchange. However, the London Stock Exchange has ruled out participation in a UK-based specialist exchange for small company shares and has dismissed suggestions that a pan-European exchange would be effective but several other  European exchanges have embraced the concept.

Carton-board verdict due.

The European Commission is today expected to give its final verdict on allegations that  European         carton-board makers are operating an illegal  cartel. The three-year-old case could result in some of the biggest fines ever to be levied against a group of companies following a Commission investigation into alleged price-fixing.  In April 1991, the Commission raided 15 companies across the EU after the British Printing Industries Federation complained that manufacturers had co-ordinated price rises across  Europe. All the main EU producers were involved in the original inquiry including subsidiaries and sales agents for non-EU companies in Sweden, Austria and Canada. Today, after considering responses from the 15 companies, the commission is expected to conclude whether or not a  cartel-arrangement between the companies hindered competition.

N-site row intensifies.

Miners working on Germany's first proposed disposal site for long-term nuclear waste yesterday appealed for police protection, after demonstrators blocked access roads with makeshift huts, and dug tunnels to prevent the delivery of the first containers of highly-radioactive waste. Up to 1,000 anti-nuclear protesters have blocked the roads around Gorleben, in lower Saxony, where an interim storage facility has been
built near the planned long-term disposal site. Police have been instructed by the state authorities, who oppose the disposal scheme, not to intervene, but the federal government says interim storage can go ahead, pending proper investigation of the mining site.

French go-ahead for reactor.

The French government yesterday gave the go-ahead to a consortium of  European energy companies to restart the controversial Superphenix fast-breeder nuclear reactor for research purposes. The reactor, which is situated near Lyons, in eastern France, was shut down in July 1990 because of technical faults in its fuel cooling systems. The plant will now be used to study how to get rid of plutonium and other radioactive waste from France's 56 nuclear reactors. Environmental groups have opposed the restart of
the reactor, but the French government said in February that the reactor could be re-started at limited power, after the completion of safety work. Superphenix is operated by the Nersa consortium, which includes Electricite de France, Enel of Italy and SBK of Germany.

EU banks raise lending share.

European Union banks have increased their share of international lending against their North American and Japanese counterparts, according to the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. Outside Asia, EU banks were the world's largest lenders. The BIS said the share of international bank lending by EU banks had risen to 45.2% at the end of 1993 from 34.8% in 1985. The BIS report covers lending by BIS-area banks - comprising the Group of 10 industrial countries plus Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain - to non-BIS countries over the past eight years. German banks led the EU with
$109.6bn (#70bn) of claims on countries outside the area at the end of 1993, 37% of which were to
Eastern  Europe. The BIS also named Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a former Italian premier, as
vice-chairman, succeeding Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's new treasury minister.

THE European Commission is expected today to slap large  fines for operating a price-fixing cartel
on more than a dozen companies which manufacture cardboard in Britain and other EU countries.

Commission officials were meeting last night to decide the penalties. Sources said they could exceed the record #80 million in  fines imposed earlier this year on steel companies, including British Steel,
for running a cartel in beams.

TD
The cardboard case involves companies in Scandinavia and Austria, including Sweden's Stora and Austria's Mayr Melnhof, and their subsidiaries in Britain and other EU countries. Among the British firms involved are Workington Board Mills and Colthrup Board Mills.

The commission launched its inquiry three years ago with a series of raids on  paper and cardboard manufacturers. Commission sources say the companies met to set prices in Switzerland.

If the commission finds that companies have breached anti-trust rules forbidding agreements that restrict competition, it can impose  fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover.

The commission has grown bolder in setting large  fines in recent years and the competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, is seeking to reassert his authority following criticism of his handling of state subsidy cases involving steel makers.

OSLO, July 13 (Reuter) - Norway's Rena Kartonfabrik A/S said that it had set aside funds in case the company was among 22 carton board makers fined by the European Commission for price fixing.
"We have estimated that a possible  fine could be of the order of 0.5 to 1.0 million crowns," Rena
Kartonfabrikk managing director Morten Muus Falch told Reuters.

TD
He said the company was independent and among small  carton board manufacturers and so more vulnerable to large  fines. Commission officials have said they will announced  fines on 22 carton board manufacturers on Wednesday at 1500 GMT.

BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuter) - The European Commission has decided to fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus for operating a price  cartel, the EU's competition commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference.
"The fines are the biggest that we have imposed," Van Miert told a news conference.

TD
He said the four ringleaders in the price-fixing  cartel had been fined 9.0 percent of their turnover while the other 15 companies had been fined 7.5 percent of turnover. He did not immediately identify the four ringleaders.

The EU executive said in a statement the  cartel was "a flagrant violation" of EU competition rules which ban agreements and concerted practices which can distort trade between EU countries.

The Commission began an investigation into the price  fixing  about three years ago following a complaint from  carton board users. The Commission carried out surprise inspections at the companies involved in April 1992 before the probe began.

The Commission said in a statement  cartel meetings were usually held in luxury hotels in the Swiss city of Zurich where a Swiss fiduciary company Fides conducted an information exchange system by which the operation of the  cartel was monitored and policed.

Van Miert said it was the third case in which the Commission had imposed  fines on companies for operating a cartel this year and other cases were sure to follow.
The fine announced on the carton board manufacturers outstrips a 104 million Ecu  fine imposed on
16 steel makers in February for sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information on the
EU-wide market for steel beams.

HELSINKI, July 13 (Reuter) - Finnboard is not guilty of having taken part in any price fixing  cartel, managing director Jorma Sahlstedt said in an initial reaction to the decision by the European Commission to fine Finnboard 20 million Ecus.
"We do not consider ourselves guilty," he said.

TD
Sahlstedt, commenting on the first information available from Brussels, described the sum as "terrible" and that it was much bigger than expected. He said Finnboard would probably appeal the decision.
EU competition commissioner Karel Van Miert earlier said the European Commission had decided to
fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus for operating a price cartel.

Finnboard, the sales organisation of six Finnish board producers operating a total of eight mills, was one of the most heavily  fined.

Sahlstedt said there had been cooperation concerning statistics like in other industries. But, he said, the Finnish policy on prices and quantities had been completely free and based on supply and demand.--Helsinki newsroom 358-0-680 50 246

MADRID, July 13 (Reuter) - Spanish paper firm Sarrio SA said it disagreed with the 15.5 million Ecu sanction imposed on it by the European Commission for alleged cartel practices.
The EC has decided to  fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus.

TD
"Sarrio has demonstrated that it has always had a policy of individual negotiation with clients, that the evolution of its prices has always been in line with its production costs and the dynamic of demand and that it has never established prices imposed by a  cartel," a statement from Sarrio said.

Sarrio, which is 54.7 percent owned by Italian firm Saffa Spa, said it would examine all the options open to it, including legal defences.
Sarrio shares closed down nine pesetas at 550 on trade of 61,000 shares.

BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuter) - The European Commission has decided to fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus for operating a price  cartel, Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday.

The Commission started an investigation into the price  fixing  practices in the sector about three years ago following a complaint from  carton board users.

TD
Van Miert told a news conference four  carton board manufacturers had each been  fined more than 15 million Ecus following the investigation.
He said 19 companies in all had been  fined. The four heaviest  fines were levied on Sweden's
Iggesund, the  packaging unit of forestry products group MoDo AB (22.7 million Ecua, Austria's
Meyr-Melnhof (21 million Ecus), Finland's Finnboard (20 million Ecus) and France's Cascades (16.2
million Ecus).
"The fines are the biggest that we have imposed," Van Miert said.

He said the four "ringleaders" in the price-fixing  cartel had been fined nine percent of their turnover while the other 15 companies had been fined 7.5 percent of turnover. He did not immediately identify who he meant by ringleaders.

The Commission said in a statement the  cartel was "a flagrant violation" of EU competition rules which ban agreements and concerted practices which can distort trade between EU countries.

BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuter) - The European Commission on Wednesday imposed record  fines of
132 million Ecus on 19  carton board manufacturers for operating a price  cartel.
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the decision after a three-year inquiry showed the EU
executive was determined to crack down on rampant cartelisation in industry.

TD
"The present case reveals once again a disturbing level of sophisticated  cartel activity in a major industrial sector," he said in a statement.

The Commission began an investigation into the price  fixing  following a complaint from  carton board users that prices had risen intolerably high. The Commission carried out dawn raids at the companies involved before the probe began.

It said the investigation revealed a sophisticated price  fixing  system which involved cartel meetings held in luxury hotels in the Swiss city of Zurich where a Swiss fiduciary company Fides conducted an information exchange system by which the operation of the  cartel was monitored and policed.

"This is an extremely sophisticated and pernicious  cartel. I would say it's a high-tech  cartel," Van Miert told a news conference.

The four heaviest  fines were levied on Sweden's Iggesund, the  packaging unit of forestry products group MoDo AB (22.7 million Ecus/$28.2 million), Austria's Meyr-Melnhof (21 million Ecus/$26 million), Finland's Finnboard (20 million Ecus/$24.8 million) and France's Cascades (16.2 million Ecus/$20.1 million).
Van Miert declined to name the "ringleaders" in the price-fixing  cartel, which he said had been  fined
nine percent of their turnover while the other companies had been fined 7.5 percent of turnover.

Two companies, Sweden's Stora and a small Norwegian firm, Rena, had received a reduced  fine for cooperating in the inquiry, he said.

Around three million tonnes of  carton board is consumed in the EU every year in a market worth 2.5 billion Ecus, the Commission said. It is mainly used for  packaging food.
The companies have three months to pay the  fines or face paying interest, Van Miert said. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is expected today to impose huge and perhaps
record-rivaling fines against more than a dozen companies accused of operating a price-fixing cartel
in the carton-board industry, officials said.

Senior aides to the commissioners met Tuesday night to fix the size of the fines, with officials predicting that the amount could be similar to the record 104 million European currency units ($129.8 million) levied earlier this year against 16 steel companies for allegedly fixing  the price of steel beams.

TD
"I would think the  fines would be in that territory," said one official. "We're talking about very serious infractions."

Officials declined to name the companies involved in the alleged  cartel, pending the commission's final decision. But the Swedish company Stora AB acknowledged in 1991 that it was the subject of the commission investigation.

Finland, Sweden and Norway hold referendums on EU membership this autumn, so any commission action involving Scandinavian forest-product companies could enter the debates in those countries as their votes approach. In the past, anti-EU campaigners have cited EU competition actions in efforts to portray the commission as meddling, but business groups counter that the commission helps to ensure a level playing field through its competition powers.

The case stems from a April 1991 commission raid on the offices of 15 manufacturers of  carton-board, a material used in  packaging. The commission alleges that the  cartel operated from at least 1986 to
1991, officials said.

Brussels, 13/07/1994 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission has condemned the "cartel" of cardboard producers by imposing heavy fines totalling 132.15 million ecuson the 19 companies responsible. According to the Commission's conclusions, the clandestine  cartel set prices and organized the market for many years under the cover of the Groupe Produit  Carton association. The highest  fines were imposed on MoDo Iggesund, Sweden (22.75 million ecus); Mayr-Menhof, Austria (21 million); Finnboard, Finland (20 million); Cascades, France (16.2 million); Sarrio, Italy and Spain (15.5 million), and so on.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission said it fined a group of 19 carton-board manufacturers a record total of 132 million European currency units ($164.8 million) for operating a massive and "pernicious"  cartel that allegedly fixed prices at secret meetings held in luxury hotels in Zurich.

The fines dwarfed the previous record  fine of 104 million ECUs set just five months ago in a case involving 14 producers of steel beams.

TD
Six carton-board makers -- from Sweden, Austria, Finland, France and Italy -- received the heaviest fines, ranging from about 11 million ECUs to almost 23 million ECUs. Other companies received much smaller fines. The companies have the right to appeal the  fines to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

The alleged cartel was discovered in a series of surprise inspections in April 1991. According to the commission, it operated from 1986 to 1991, and involved twice-yearly coordinated price increases of 6% to 10%. The price increases were "planned and programmed in advance in the most explicit detail," the commission said, and the companies agreed among themselves which would be the first to "announce" the new higher price.

Carton board is a material used to produce folding boxes and other  packaging material. The  European
Union market is up to 2.5 billion ECUs a year, with annual consumption of more than three million tons.

"It was certainly the most sophisticated  cartel that I've seen," EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said at a news conference. He noted that some other notorious cartels in the past had involved sectors that were in trouble, but that the  carton-board market was booming during the period in question. "Because it was such a pernicious, high-tech  cartel, we were very justified to take these sanctions," he said.

Although the alleged  cartel went to great lengths to keep its activities secret, the commission says, notes kept by some of the companies provided valuable evidence. "They didn't trust each other so they kept records," said one official.

Under EU law, the commission can  fine companies up to 10% of their yearly sales in the sector involved for operating a  cartel. The commission said several companies that acted as "ringleaders" received the highest fines, at 9% of their sales, while some companies had their  fines reduced because they cooperated with the commission's investigation.

The commission said the following companies received the highest  fines: The Iggesund unit of MoDo of Sweden, at 22.75 million ECUs; Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, at 21 million ECUs; Finnboard of Finland, at 20 million ECUs; Cascades SA of France, at 16.2 million ECUs; Sarrio of Italy, at 15.5 million ECUs; and Stora of Sweden, at 11.25 million ECUs.

Also fined were Buchmann GmbH of Germany, at 2.2 million ECUs; Enso-Gutzeit of Finland, at 3.25 million ECUs;  Europa Carton of Germany, at 2.4 million ECUs; Fyskeby of Sweden, at one million

ECUs; Gruber & Weber GmbH of Germany, also at one million ECUs; BPB De Eeendracht of the Netherlands, at 1.75 million ECUs; KNP BT NV of the Netherlands, at three million ECUs; Laakmann of Germany, at 2.2 million ECUs; Papeteries de Lancey of France, at 1.5 million ECUs; Rena of Norway, at

HD        BRUSSELS FINES CARTON-BOARD PRICE-FIXERS A RECORD #104M. BY        By EMMA TUCKER.

The European Commission yesterday imposed record  fines on 19 carton-board producers which had allegedly formed what it described as  Europe's 'most pernicious' price-fixing  cartel.

Suppliers of  carton-board in western Europe face fines totalling ECU 132.15m (#104.27m) with the cartel's 'ringleaders' bearing the brunt. Iggesund, the packaging unit of the Swedish forestry products group MoDo, will pay the biggest single sum of ECU 22.75m. All 19 companies must pay the  fines within the next three months.

TD
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said 'the massive  cartel' flagrantly violated  European laws. The commission described how participants met in luxury Swiss hotels to agree price rises and concealed their activities by drawing up bogus minutes of their meetings.

Exercising strict discipline and making virtually no written notes, the companies were said to have carefully orchestrated price increases every six months. Having decided what the market could bear, one company would lift prices, followed on agreed dates by the others.

On each occasion, between 1987 and 1990, prices rose by 6-10%. The commission said that often the increases were forced through against 'determined customer resistance' and in spite of a fall in raw materials prices.

The companies involved are: Buchmann,  Europa Carton, Gruber and Weber, Laakmann and Moritz J Weig of Germany, Cascades and Papeteries de Lancey of France, Enso-Gutzeit and Finnboard of Finland, Fyskeby, MoDo and Stora of Sweden, BPB De Eendracht and KNP BT of the Netherlands, Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, Rena of Norway, Sarrio of Italy, SCA Holding of the UK, and Enso Espanola of Spain.

The cartel was uncovered in a series of unannounced inspections carried out simultaneously by the commission in April 1991 after complaints by British and French carton users' trade associations. In August, Stora, which had recently taken over the German producer of carton-board Feldmuhle - a ringleader of the  cartel - came clean with the commission.

The case is the third incident in which a  cartel has been fined by the European Commission this year for distorting competition in the single market.
In February, Brussels  fined 14 steel producers more than ECU 100m for price  fixing  and market
sharing.

Comcast's $2.2-billion (U.S.) bid for QVC Inc. has not only scuttled merger plans by CBS and QVC but it has signalled that both CBS and QVC are on the auction block.

Provincial governments have borrowed over half the money they need for spending this year, but overseas lenders increasingly want bonds in foreign currencies, thus forcing the provinces to hedge their risk against a fall in the Canadian dollar, a Wood Gundy study says. Page B1 The Canadian dollar rose nearly one-fifth of a cent to 72.4 cents (U.S.), and the U.S. dollar rose to 98.30 yen from 97.25 as both currencies benefited from a report this week that suggested U.S. inflation remains under control. Page B12 The U.S. dollar is going to get a new look, a move aimed at foiling high- tech counterfeiters. Page B12 Lumber futures climbed amid fears that labour talks at British Columbia sawmills are deteriorating.

COMPUTERS

Computer City is heading north with plans to open supercentres in Toronto and Vancouver this year, the latest "category-killer" to invade the Canadian retail market. Page B1 The Comdex computer show, which opened in Toronto, may have appeared like organized chaos, but at least one element stood out: gimmicks, from Zap Man robot to golfing umbrellas. Page B1
THE ECONOMY
U.S. consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in June, more evidence that inflation is under control. Page B12

The European Commission has fined 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million European Currency Units ($229.6-million) for operating a price  cartel, the largest penalty the European Union executive has imposed.

Competition commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference yesterday that four  carton board manufacturers had each been  fined more than 15 million ECUs following an investigation.

The four heaviest  fines were levied on Sweden's Iggesund, the  packaging unit of forest products group Mo och Domsjo AB (22.7 million ECUs), Austria's Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG (21 million ECUs), Finland's Finnboard group of companies (20 million ECUs) and France's Cascades SA (16.2 million ECUs). Cascades SA is indirectly controlled by Cascades Inc. of Kingsey Falls, Que.
"The fines are the biggest that we have imposed," Mr. Van Miert said.

The commission began an investigation into the price-fixing  about three years ago following a complaint from  carton board users. The commission carried out surprise inspections at the companies involved in April, 1992, before the probe began.

It said in a statement  cartel meetings were usually held in luxury hotels in Zurich, where a Swiss fiduciary company conducted an information exchange system by which the operation of the  cartel was monitored and policed.

Mr. Van Miert said four "ringleaders" in the price-fixing  cartel had been fined 9 per cent of their revenue while the other 15 companies had been fined 7.5 per cent of turnover. He did not immediately identify who he meant by ringleaders.

The EU executive said the  cartel was "a flagrant violation" of EU competition rules that ban agreements and concerted practices that can distort trade between EU countries.
In February, the commission  fined 16 steel makers a record 104 million ECUs for  fixing  prices,
sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information on the EU-wide market for steel beams.

STOCKHOLM, July 14 (Reuter) - Fyskeby Board AB, fully-owned by U.S. Riverwood International Corp said it may appeal a decision by the European Commission to impose fines on it and other carton board manufacturers for operating a price cartel.
Fyskeby, with 1993 sales of some 500 million crowns, was  fined one milion Ecus.

TD
Managing director Sune Petterson told Reuters Fyskeby is a small company and therefore a small player on the market. "We are a bit sceptical of the whole thing," he said, adding that it was "quite possible" that they would appeal.

HELSINKI, July 14 (Reuter) - Finnboard will appeal a 20 million Ecus  fine by the European
Commission for taking part in a price  cartel, managing director Jorma Sahlstedt said.

He said this would be made to the court of first instance in Luxembourg. "We believe we will have a good chance to win," Sahlstedt told Reuters.

He said on Wednesday, after the decision by the Commission was made public, that Finnboard would probably appeal.

Sahlstedt reiterated that Finnboard, a sales organisation of Finnish producers, had not taken part in any price fixing cartel. -- Helsinki newsroom 358-0-680 50 246

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Reuter) - A European Commission decision to impose record  fines of 132 million Ecus on 19  carton board manufacturers for operating a  cartel signals a it is becoming more assertive against cartels, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference.

"This case underlines the fact that only an enforcement body like the Commission with  European wide powers of investigation can uncover and sanction such huge and covert cartels," he said.

TD
Referring to other industries Van Miert said, "There will no doubt be other  fines before the end of the year.
Although he would not be drawn on specific cases, officials said the executive is probing an alleged
cartel in the cement industry.
In February, 16 steel firms were  fined over 100 million Ecus for price  fixing.

The EU Commission said the carton board cartel's major strategic decisions had been taken by a Presidents' working group comprising France's Cascades, Finland's Finnboard, Austria's Mayr-Melnhof, Italy's Sarrio, two Stora AB companies and Germany's Weig.
Stora AB and a Norwegian firm called Rena received a reduced  fine for cooperating.
Sweden's MoDo AB and Finnboard said they would appeal the decision. Austria's Mayr-Meinhof Karton
AG said it was considering an appeal.

LONDON, July 14 (Reuter) - BPB Industries Plc unit Kartonfabriek "De Eendracht" NV's share of the
105 million stg of  fines imposed on 19 cartonboard producers by the European Commission was
just 1.4 million stg, BPB said.
The fines were imposed by the EC on Wednesday for operation by the manufacturers of a price  cartel
across western Europe.

TD
Analysts said the  fine levied on BPB's Dutch unit was in direct relation to its small 1.3 percent share of the European market.
"In group terms the  fine is insignificant," London Wall Equities analyst Lawrence Amboldt said. De Eendracht said it intended to appeal the decision.

BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuter) - The European Commission on Wednesday imposed record fines of
132 million Ecus ($163.7 million) on 19 carton board manufacturers for operating a price cartel.

The four heaviest  fines were levied on Sweden's Iggesund, the  packaging unit of forestry products group MoDo AB (22.7 million Ecus/$28.2 million), Austria's Meyr-Melnhof (21 million Ecus/$26 million), Finland's Finnboard (20 million Ecus/$24.8 million) and France's Cascades (16.2 million Ecus/$20.1 million).

TD
The EU's Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the decision after a three-year inquiry showed the Commission was determined to continue a crackdown on rampant cartelisation in industry.

"The present case reveals once again a disturbing level of sophisticated  cartel activity in a major industrial sector," he said in a statement.

The EU executive began investigating the price  fixing  following a complaint from  carton board users that prices had risen intolerably high. The Commission carried out dawn raids at the companies involved before the probe began.

It said the investigation revealed a sophisticated price  fixing  system which involved cartel meetings in luxury hotels in the Swiss city of Zurich where a Swiss fiduciary company Fides conducted an information exchange system by which the operation of the  cartel was monitored and policed.

"This is an extremely sophisticated and pernicious  cartel. I would say it's a high-tech  cartel," Van Miert told a news conference.

He said four carton board manufacturers had each been  fined more than 15 million Ecus ($18.6 million).

He declined to name the "ringleaders" in the price-fixing  cartel, which he said had been  fined nine percent of their turnover while the other companies had been fined 7.5 percent of turnover.
Two companies, Sweden's Stora and a small Norwegian firm called Rena, had received a reduced  fine
for cooperating in the inquiry, he said.

Around three million tonnes of  carton board is consumed in the EU every year in a market worth 2.5 billion Ecus, the Commission said. It is mainly used for  packaging food.

HELSINKI, July 13 (Reuter) - Finnboard is not guilty of having taken part in any price fixing  cartel, managing director Jorma Sahlstedt said in an initial reaction to the decision by the European Commission to fine Finnboard 20 million Ecus.
"We do not consider ourselves guilty," he said.

TD
Sahlstedt, commenting on the first information available from Brussels, described the sum as "terrible" and that it was much bigger than expected. He said Finnboard would probably appeal the decision.
Sahlsted told Reuters he had heard that there would probably be a decision about  fines.
He said said there had been cooperation concerning statistics like in other industries. But, he said, the
Finnish policy on prices and quantities had been completely free and based on supply and demand.
Finnboard members in Finland were  fined 20 million Ecus, as follows: Kyro Oy, 3 million Ecus;
Metsa-Serla Oy, 7 million Ecus; Tampella Oy , 5 million Ecus; United  Paper Mills, part of Repola Oy , 5
million Ecus.
In addition, Enso-Gutzeit Oy (Finland), 3.25 million Ecus.

HELSINKI, July 14 (Reuter) - Fines imposed by the EU comission on Finnish  carton board producers for taking part in a price cartel are expected to have a negative but short-lived impact on share prices of forest companies, investment analysts said.

"The fines being so heavy it is very likely that the bad news will hit forest companies' shares...(but), any possible fall of the stocks would be minimal," said Jaakko Niemela, analyst at Opstock Securities.

TD
The negative impact on forest shares would be short-lived as the industry's 1994 net result would improve by billions of markka, analysts said.
"First and foremost, the bad news might hurt the image of the companies because the  cartel
accusations cast a shadow of doubt over pricing policies of the whole industry," Niemela said.
According to analysts, the  fines would hurt the general marketing efforts of forest companies. "Customers might get suspicious over the prices of paper products in general," another analyst said,
referring to ongoing price hikes of pulp and fine paper.

"With the exception of Repola, forest shares have not been in the focus of investors lately. The bad news might push the demand for forest shares even lower," the analyst said.

At 1145, the forest industry sub-index was 0.17 percent lower with Enso R down 20 penni at 40.8 markka (15,000 shares traded) and Metsa-Serla B down one markka at 208 (1,850).

"I am quite surprised...the heavy  fines did not have a direct effect on forest stocks despite the fact that the companies will lose a significant amount of money," a broker said.
On Wednesday, The European Commission decided to fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of
132 million Ecus for operating a price cartel. Finnboard, the sales organisation of six Finnish board
producers operating a total of eight mills, was one of the most heavily  fined with 20 million Ecus.
Finnboard members were  fined as follows: Kyro Oy, 3 million Ecus
Metsa-Serla Oy , 7 million Ecus
Tampella Oy , 5 million Ecus
United Paper Mills, part of Repola Oy , 5 million Ecus.
In addition, Enso-Gutzeit Oy was  fined 3.25 million Ecus.

HD         Metsa-Serla says fines do not change forecast. WC         411 words

HELSINKI, July 14 (Reuter) - A Metsa-Serla spokesman said  fines imposed by the European Commission for taking part in a price  cartel would not lead to any change of the company's result forecast for 1994.
"We don't have to change the forecast," said Pekka Kivela, Metsa-Serla's Vice President of Corporate
Communications.

TD
He described the decision by the Commission as "amazing" and said Metsa-Serla had not been part of any price-fixing carton cartel. Meta-Serla was  fined seven million Ecus.

Metsa-Serla said when it published its four-months results that it expected a result improvement for this year compared with 1993.

Last year it had a profit after financial items of 303 million markka and a four-month profit of 151 million markka, improving its results like most other Finnish forestry firms.

Metsa-Serla is a member of Finnboard, a sales organisation, which was  fined a total of 20 million Ecus. Finnboard managing director Jorma Sahlstedt told Reuters on Wednesday that it had not been part of any price-fixing cartel and that the decision would probably be appealed.
Separately, Finnish forestry firm Enso-Gutzeit, not a Finnboard member, was  fined 3.25 million Ecus. Vice President Kari Vainio told Reuters the company would make a complaint against the decision. But
he said it might take 2-3 years before a final decision on the case was made and that the  fines would
have to be paid this year.
He said he was "astonished" by the decision but added that the sum was quite limited. "We have not been a member (of any price-fixing cartel)," he said.
The Commission said on Wednesday that it had decided to  fine 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus for operating a price  cartel.

On the Helsinki Stock Exchange, the index for forestry shares traded 0.09 percent lower by 0930 GMT. At the same time the HEX general index was 0.09 percent higher at 1,760.1. Analysts said the  fines were expected to have a negative but short-lived impact on share prices.
"The bad news might hurt the image of the companies...," said Jaakko Niemela, analyst at brokerage
Opstock Securtities.

One dealer said he was surprised that the  fines had not had a more negative impact on the forestry shares.

AMSTERDAM, July 14 (Reuter) -  Paper group Koninklijke KNP BT NV said its three million ECU  fine
by the European Commission announced on Wednesday related to a firm it sold five years ago.

"The company was called KNP Vouwkarton, and we sold it in 1989 to Mayr-Melnhof Karton," a KNP BT spokesman told Reuters.

TD
He said that the group had no other subsidiaries which make  carton board, so was no longer involved in the business.
The European Commission on Wednesday fined 19 companies a total $163 million for operating a
cartel in carton board. --Nick Louth Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 570 8500

STOCKHOLM, July 14 (Reuter) - Swedish forestry products group MoDo AB said it would appeal a decision by the European Commission to impose fines on it and other  carton board manufacturers for operating a price cartel.

Asked if MoDo would appeal, president Bernt Lof told Reuters, "There is no question that we will go further. We do not believe we have participated in any  cartel."

TD
MoDo's packaging unit Iggesund was  fined 22.75 million Ecus/$28.2 million, one of the four heaviest fines levied on a total 19 manufactures. The commission imposed record  fines of a total 132 million Ecus on the 19 firms.
Swedish rival Stora ABwas also  fined, although the amount was less than MoDo's at 11.25 million
Ecus.

Stora said that following its own review in 1991 which revealed that "certain illegal contacts had been made with competitors", Stora had implemented an extensive educational programme intended to increase internal awareness of the EU's -- and Sweden's -- regulations on free competition.

Stora spokesman Sven Yngwe would not elaborate on the type or extent of illegal contacts saying only that it had to do with the market.
Yngwe said it was too early to say whether Stora would appeal the decision.
He said he did not see the  fines having any significant impact on the company's profits.

"In relation to Stora's turnover, this is a small sum," Yngwe said. Stora had sales of 50.44 billion crowns in 1993.

VIENNA, July 14 (Reuter) - Cardboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG said on Thursday it had set aside reserves that fully covered a 282 million schilling ($26 million)  fine levied on it by the European Commission.

The commission said on Wednesday it was fining 19 carton board manufacturers a total of 132 million Ecus ($164.6 million) for operating a price cartel.

TD
Mayr-Melnhof received the second biggest  fine, of 21 million Ecus ($26 million).
Mayr-Melnhof warned at the time of its flotation in April that it faced a  fine under the case.

The company said it considered the  fine unjustified and inappropriate, and was considering whether to appeal.

Creditanstalt preferred rose 21 schillings to 687 in a technical reaction to recent losses.

Carton board maker Mayr-Melnhofer ended five up at 597, off an earlier 600 high, shrugging off confirmation of a  fine from the European Commission for price-fixing  and of a cut in this year's cash-flow outlook because of higher used paper costs.

FINES IMPOSED ON STORA FOR BREACHING
EU'S FREE COMPETITION RULES
The European Commission has decided to impose  fines totalling ECU 132 million on, in all, 19 companies for illegal  cartel practices with competitors in the

cartonboard sector. The  fines imposed on the STORA Group amount to ECU 11.25
million.
In 1991, the Commission instigated a study to look into suspected  cartel practices in the  cartonboard sector. The study covered a number of forest industries companies, including STORA through its subsidiaries Stora Feldmuhle and Stora Billerud.
Following STORA's own review in 1991 which revealed that certain illegal contacts had made with competitors, STORA has implemented an extensive educational programme intended to increase internal awareness of the EU's and Sweden's regulations governing free competition.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE ON
KARTONFABRIEK "DE EENDRACHT" NV, NETHERLANDS

In June 1991, the European Commission commenced an industry-wide investigation of the producers of  cartonboard in western Europe in respect of alleged
infringement of  European Union competition laws. Kartonfabriek "De Eendracht" NV, Netherlands, a subsidiary within the BPB Group, was one of the minor companies included within this investigation.
The European Commission on 13 July 1994 imposed fines totalling Ecu 132.15 million (#105 million) on 19 companies, including a  fine of Ecu 1.75 million
(#1.4 million) on Kartonfabriek "De Eendracht" NV, for alleged market  sharing
and pricing infringements of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. Kartonfabriek
"De Eendracht" NV has from the outset vigorously rejected the allegations and intends to lodge an appeal with the Court of First Instance of the  European Communities.
Until the  European Court decides on this appeal, the matter remains sub judice and so no further statement can be made at this time.

MoDo is among 19 carton board manufacturers accused by the European Commission of operating a price cartel. A fine of ECU 22.75m, equivalent to around SKr 200m, has been imposed on the company.

MoDo's information director Christer Lewell said Modo had been denying the allegations all along, and that he expected the group to appeal against the commission's decision.

TD
Lewell said MoDo's 1994 profit forecast, issued in May this year, would not be affected by the  fine. MoDo's sales are high enough to enable the company to post a profit well above SKr 1bn after net financial items even after a  fine.

Although MoDo denies setting up a  cartel, the company says part of the  fine relating to its UK unit Iggesund Paper Board relates to a period when Iggesund did not own the company. Lewell declined to comment on whether this meant Modo was admitting to the formation of a  cartel or not.

From Wolfgang Munchau in Brussels.
THE European Commission has imposed the largest financial penalty in its history by fining 19
European cardboard producers 132.15m ecus (#101.8m) for running a price-fixing cartel.

TD
The Commission detailed the clandestine operation of the  cartel, whose representatives met secretly in luxury hotels in Zurich, where they decided on joint price increases. The scam was discovered after a raid on several of the companies in April 1991, after the Commission was tipped off by a complaint from a British customer.

A ringleader of the  cartel, according to the Commission, was Feldmuhle, a German  paper company which was subsequently taken over by Stora of Sweden. A large number of the companies are based in Scandinavia, where yesterday's decision could prove highly controversial, especially in view of forthcoming referenda on EU membership.

One British company was named directly: SCA Holding, of Maidstone, Kent, formerly Reed  Paper and Board (UK), which was  fined a relatively modest 2.2m ecus. The heaviest  fine, of 22.75m, went to MoDo (Iggesund), a Stockholm company.

The previous record fine of more than 100m ecus was imposed earlier this year on 14 steel producers.

HD        Carton-Board Makers Fined $164.8 Million  in EU Case

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission said it fined a group of 19 carton-board manufacturers a record total of 132 million European currency units ($164.8 million) for operating a massive and "pernicious"  cartel that allegedly fixed prices at secret meetings held in luxury hotels in Zurich.

The fines dwarfed the previous record  fine of 104 million ECUs set just five months ago in a case involving 14 producers of steel beams.

TD
Six carton-board makers -- from Sweden, Austria, Finland, France and Italy -- received the heaviest fines, ranging from about 11 million ECUs to almost 23 million ECUs. Other companies received much smaller fines. The companies have the right to appeal the  fines to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

The alleged cartel was discovered in a series of surprise inspections in April 1991. According to the commission, it operated from 1986 to 1991, and involved twice-yearly coordinated price increases of 6% to 10%. The price increases were "planned and programmed in advance in the most explicit detail," the commission said, and the companies agreed among themselves which would be the first to "announce" the new higher price.

Carton board is a material used to produce folding boxes and other  packaging material. The  European
Union market is up to 2.5 billion ECUs a year, with annual consumption of more than three million tons.

"It was certainly the most sophisticated  cartel that I've seen," EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said at a news conference. He noted that some other notorious cartels in the past had involved sectors that were in trouble, but that the  carton-board market was booming during the period in question. "Because it was such a pernicious, high-tech  cartel, we were very justified to take these sanctions," he said.

Although the alleged  cartel went to great lengths to keep its activities secret, the commission says, notes kept by some of the companies provided valuable evidence. "They didn't trust each other so they kept records," said one official.

Under EU law, the commission can  fine companies up to 10% of their yearly sales in the sector involved for operating a  cartel. The commission said several companies that acted as "ringleaders" received the highest fines, at 9% of their sales, while some companies had their  fines reduced because they cooperated with the commission's investigation.

The commission said the following companies received the highest  fines: The Iggesund unit of MoDo of Sweden, at 22.75 million ECUs; Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, at 21 million ECUs; Finnboard of Finland, at 20 million ECUs; Cascades SA of France, at 16.2 million ECUs; Sarrio of Italy, at 15.5 million ECUs; and Stora of Sweden, at 11.25 million ECUs.

Also fined were Buchmann GmbH of Germany, at 2.2 million ECUs; Enso-Gutzeit of Finland, at 3.25 million ECUs;  Europa Carton of Germany, at 2.4 million ECUs; Fyskeby of Sweden, at one million ECUs; Gruber & Weber GmbH of Germany, also at one million ECUs; BPB De Eeendracht of the

HD    FINES AGAINST CARTONBOARD CARTEL UNDERLINE COMMISSION'S WILL TO SUPPORT ANTITRUST RULES.
WC  1,025 words
PD   15 July 1994
SN   Agence Europe
SC   AGEU

CY   (c) 1994 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .

LP
Brussels, 14/07/1994 (Agence  Europe) - As announced in yesterday's EUROPE (see p.8), the  European Commission has condemned an extremely sophisticated  cartel in the cartonboard sector and has imposed substantial  fines totalling 132.15 Mecus on the 19 producers found guilty of infringement. In his comments on this decision, the Commissioner responsible for competition, Karel Van Miert, stressed the Commission's determination to implement, as in the case of the beam  cartel last February, a strict policy against any industry where such blatant antitrust violations are uncovered.

TD
Mr Van Miert, moreover, expressed surprise and concern about the fact that "after more than ten years of active pursuit of secret cartels and heavy  fines, the Commission is still discovering classic market sharings and price fixing  cartels in major industries". In his view, the present case confirms the interest of having
only one control authority like the Commission, with  European-wide powers of enquiry, which may discover and sanction such practices. Community inspectors were thus able to discover the detailed evidence which enabled the Commission to condemn a serious breach of competition rules, despite the sophisticated
efforts used by  cartonboard producers to cover up their activities. These results allowed the Commission to sanction what it considers as a "serious and flagrant" violation of Article 85 of the EC Treaty which bans agreements and practices likely to affect trade between the Member States and which prevents or distorts competition in the common market.
This illegal cartel is in fact the most "complete and pernicious" that Mr Van Miert has ever had to consider,
a "high tech cartel" as he calls it.  Cartonboard producers, who include international forestry groups as well
as small independent paper mills, had managed to establish a system, in 1986, by which they fixed prices
and organised the West European market by dividing it up between them. The formal collaboration
structure, established to this end, involved practically all the producers of  cartonboard in Western  Europe
who operated under cover of an ostensibly legitimate trade association called the PG (Product Group)
Paperboard.  A Swiss fiduciary company, FIDES, conducted the information exchange system by which the
operation of the  cartel was monitored and policed but also provided the  cartel secretariat in meetings.
Violation noted by the Commission began in 1986 as, it believes, even though the PG had tried to regulate
the market since 1981, it was only five years later, following structural reorganisation, that the  cartel began
to be really operational. The key to the success of the  cartel, says the Commission, was achieving a
balance between supply and demand which would enable the concerted price initiatives to go through. This
was done by agreeing a joint policy of so-called "price before tonnage" in 1987 to which all EC and EFTA
producers adhered but which represented, in practice, mutual recognition of respective market shares.
Pressure was put on firms suspected of deviating from the agreed prices and a consultation system in
times of recession was also developed by the main producers which, in order to avoid excessive
production, went as far as to impose temporary plannified production stops. As a result, the price of
cartonboard increased regularly between 1987 and 1990, in general twice a year with a 6-10% rise each
time in each Member State. In real terms, increases were 26% and net prices (after all discounts) increased
20% during this period. In addition, planned price increases were disguised thanks to full organisation
including the disturbing aspect noted by the Commission which consisted in establishing, in advance, a
price rise scenario initiated, in turn, by one of the members of the  cartel and setting out the order and dates
when the other members would follow. The Commission also noted that at least one of the guilty
companies went as far as to employ lawyers after a complaint had been filed, in order to organise a false
Commission inspection and make all elements of proof disappear.
Simultaneous surprise inspections in 16 different areas of the Community nevertheless allowed
Commission agents to seize a series of compromising documents, essentially private notes relating to

Page 53 of 71 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
meetings of the  cartel as well as a copy of a production control plan and price increase plan. In addition, the Swedish management of Stora, which had just acquired the German producer Feldmuelhle (one of the key links in the cartel) rapidly recognised that several companies of the group were involved in these dealings. With the cooperation of this company and, later, with that of the Norwegian firm Rena, the Commission was able to address the grievances within 23 companies, in December 1992. About one half did not deny the main facts reproached of them. The others maintained that PG meetings were only of a social nature. The Commission took these attitudes into account when determining the level of individual fines.

Fines can in theory range up to 10% of the total turnover of each company, although normally the calculation is made with reference to EC turnover in the relevant period. The Commission set them, in this case, in such a way as to take account of the gravity and duration of the infringement and to distinguish between the ringleaders and the ordinary members of the  cartel. A two-thirds reduction was given to Stora (11.25 million ecus) and Rena (0.20 million) and a one-third reduction to other companies which admitted to the facts at a subsequent stage of the investigation (Buchmann,  Europa Carton, Fiskeby, KNP, Papeteries De Lancey, Sarrio, Cascades, SCA Holding, Enso Espanola, Weig, Grubber and Weber, BPB de Eendracht and Laakmann). Other firms were  fined around 9% of their turnover in the Community: a total of 20 million ecus for the members of Finnboard (Kyro By, Metsa Serva Oy, Tampella Oy, United  Paper Mills), 21 million ecus for the Austrian firm Mayr-Melnhof and 22.75 million ecus for the Swedish company MoDo. All must immediately terminate the infringement and pay their  fines within three months from the date of the Commission's notification of the decision.

HD     AUSTRIA'S MAYR MELNHOF REJECTS PRICE FIXING ALLEGATIONS. WC    325 words

The Austrian cardboard packaging manufacturer Mayr Melnhof Karton AG argues that the AS 282m  fine imposed upon it by the European Commission for alleged violations of regulations banning cartel agreements is unfair. Rejecting accusations that the company participated in an illegal price cartel, deputy chairman Alfred Fogarassy denied that there were price-fixing  agreements in the cardboard packaging industry. However, a European Commission spokesman countered that some of the most incriminating documents concerning agreements on price increases were seized from a Mayr Melnhof subsidiary in Germany.

Fogarassy claimed that the  fine was unjustified and unnecessarily harsh. He added that the company would examine the possibility of an appeal against the ruling. Mayr Melnhof had neverthless set aside provisions of AS 1bn in respect of the  fine.

TD
The Commission has imposed  fines totalling ECU 132m (approximately AS 1.8bn) on a total of 23 cardboard manufacturers involved in the  cartel. Mayr Melnhof's  fine of ECU 21m (AS 282m) is the second largest after the ECU 22.7m penalty imposed on the Swedish Modo group.

Regarding Mayr Melnhof's current financial situation, Fogarassy revealed that the rapid increases in waste paper prices had taken the company by surprise. Price rises for cardboard will not come into effect until September, and will enable Mayr Melnhof to offset AS 300m of the AS 500m cost increase in the current year. The deputy chairman added that the company aimed to exceed Creditanstalt Bankverein's 1994
OVFA profit forecast of AS 140m (the bank recently downgraded its profit forecast for Mayr Melnhof from
AS 260m).

Creditanstalt's revised forecast has adversely affected the company's share price; yesterday, Mayr Melnhof shares traded at around AS 597. Creditanstalt's senior analyst Marko Musulin predicts that the shares will initially fluctuate at between AS 560 and AS 600, but will subsequently recover to the issue price of AS 720.

Cascades Inc. said yesterday it may appeal a $25-million fine the European Commission has slapped on its French subsidiary for its part in a cartonboard price-fixing  scandal. Cascades SA, the Paris-based unit, was among 19 big cartonboard producers found guilty and  fined a total of about
$200 million for price-fixing  in Europe from 1986 to 1991. ''We'll study the judgment with our French legal advisers - European law is different from Canadian. We've every intention of exercising our right of appeal,'' a spokesman said.

Lower than expected US retail growth figures, the reaction in US and  European bond markets and better news from Swiss pharmaceuticals were all influential as bourses rose for the second day in succession, writes Our Markets Staff.

FRANKFURT's experience was a measure of the day, the Dax index rising just 1.62 to 2,055.62 in official floor trading, as turnover eased from DM 5.4bn to DM 5.5bn, but spurting in the afternoon on the Ibis, screen-based system to end the day at 2,070.71.

TD
Bund futures led the way up, the September contract breaking through resistance at 93.50 to register a gain of 70 basis points near the end the day.
There was some response in senior blue chip prices, Allianz ending the afternoon at DM 2,470, up DM
50, and Daimler adding DM 11.20 at DM 737.20; but the big three chemicals, near their highs for the
day, were still subdued following Wednesday's sell-off.

Dealers said that there was more interest in second-rank blue chips. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, rose DM 14 on the session to DM 921 after relative weakness recently, and Continental, the tyremaker, put on DM 8 at DM 244.50.

ZURICH recovered its confidence in a rebound led by pharmaceuticals after first half figures from Sandoz. The SMI index rose 53.1 or 2.2% to 2,528.3, with the firmer dollar and the latest US economic data enhancing the mood.

Sandoz registered rose SwFr 11 to SwFr 659 after it reported first half sales growth of 2% in Swiss franc terms. While this was at the lower end of expectations, analysts noted that the market was relieved that the statement contained no negative surprises.

Ciba registered rose SwFr 11 to SwFr 732 as it forecast that 1994 group net profit would rise, in spite of the weak dollar.

Roche certificates recouped SwFr 100 to SwFr 5,500. The shares had fallen by 10% over the previous two sessions after Roche unveiled its own six month sales figures on Tuesday.
Nestle rose SwFr 42 to SwFr 1,112 but analysts said there was no specific news to account for the 3.9%
rise.

MILAN climbed 2%, content that preliminary indications of the government's economic plan were in line with expectations and boosted by short covering ahead of the end of the July account today. The Comit index rose 13.86 to 701.21.

Trading picked up, with stronger demand by funds and institutional investors prompting hopes of an imminent return by retail investors.

Ras led insurers higher, rising L1,650 or 6.8% to L25,650, on the view that the sector was oversold in preparation for the Ina privatisation and that it will benefit from a government reform of pensions.

Banks were also strong with Credito Italiano rising L100 or 4.9% to L2,130. BCI also put on L100 to L2,130: earlier this week, James Capel commented that the shares were cheap and that, in terms of earnings recovery potential, BCI looked interesting.

Telecoms continued to recover from recent losses with Sip up L125 to L4,360 and Stet L165 higher at L5,540. The sector's strength spilled over to Olivetti, L70 higher at L2,510, and Pirelli which added L45 to L2,685.

Falck, the steel group, picked up from a 5.5% fall to finish L100 lower at L5,002 on news that its chairman had been arrested in connection with investigations into alleged bribes paid to fraud squad officials. Rinascente, the retail group was L194 higher at L9,722 as its managing director was arrested as part of the same investigation. About 50 arrest warrants were said to have been issued for businessmen and fraud squad officers.
AMSTERDAM rose modestly with volatility still present ahead of today's expiry of options. The AEX
index gained 2.53 to 388.84.

Firm prices were was seen all round, although investor interest was tamed by the lack of corporate news. Elsevier impressed with a Fl 3.00 rise to Fl 157.40 while the chemical groups, Akzo and DSM, also featured, rising respectively by Fl 1.60 and Fl 1.40 to Fl 196.60 and Fl 131.80.

DSM was recommended by James Capel even although the second quarter results, due early next month, may not repeat their good first quarter performance, owing to restructuring charges. Nevertheless, Capel suggested that after losses in 1993, the company could report earnings per share of around Fl 20 by 1996.
MADRID offered a relatively moderate reaction to its own bond market gains, the general index closing
1.26 higher at 302.66 in turnover of Pta26.8bn after a rise of 123 basis points to 90.85 in the September
bund future.
Banesto offered some comfort to stale bulls of the rescued banking stock, recovering Pta80 to Pta980 as
BCH rose Pta50 to Pta2,625 and Santander Pta105 to Pta4,920.

However, Repsol refused to react further to crude oil prices after its gains on the Nigerian oil workers strike, losing Pta50 at Pta3,960; while Sarrio, the  paper group, fined by the European Commission for alleged cartel practices, lost Pta22 at Pta528.

TEL AVIV resumed its recovery from a 1994 low of 148.01 last week after a fall of 2.7% on Wednesday, the Mishtanim index recovering 6.59, or 3.9% to 174.76.
WARSAW tumbled on profit-taking after seven consecutive gains, the Wig index closing 655.8, or 5.9%
lower at 10,407.1 in turnover down 25% at 1,000bn zlotys.

Some brokers said that the market had advanced by more than 40% over the previous two weeks, that a correction was long overdue and that it was likely to deepen early next week. Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan

HELSINKI, July 15 (Reuter) - Oy Tampella Ab said it would not accept the European Commission's decision on cartel fines.

"Oy Tampella Ab considers the decision of the  EU Commission groundless...," the company said, adding that Tampella would act so that the decision would be appealed to the EU court.

Tampella was fined 6.7 million Ecus (42.5 million markka). Finnboard, a sales organisation, was
fined 20 million Ecus (127 million markka).
Tampella sold its  carton board industry to Enso-Gutzeit Oy in spring 1993.
Finnboard officials said earlier that the sales organisation had not been part of any price-fixing cartel
and that the decision would be appealed.

EUROPEAN competition commissioner Karel van Miert has stepped up the fight against price  fixing
cartels by promising to pursue more allegations of misconduct before the end of the year.

The pledge follows last week's imposition of record-breaking fines on 19 paper companies. The companies were fined Ecu132m for operating a price-fixing  cartel in the carton board sector between 1986 and 1990.

TD
Mr van Miert said more cartel cases were likely to follow.

European competition officials this week raided the Greek offices of a number of the country's ferry operators over alleged infringements of  European price laws.

The fine against the  paper companies was the highest imposed by the European Commission since it levied fines of Ecu104m on 16 steel companies in February.

European officials indicated that the commission has been investigating separate allegations of cartels in the cement and steel sectors for several years. The investigations are continuing.

The competition commissioner said he believed new cases may also arise and added: "I am sure these are still happening more than we presume."

He described the paper cartel as the `most sophisticated' case tackled by the commission. The commission's investigative powers are adequate and do not need beefing up, he added.

The packaging producer Rena Karton has not yet decided whether to appeal against the NKr 1.6m  fine imposed by the European Commission for illegal cartel operations. Rena Karton managing director Morten Muus-Falck admitted that the fine was higher than the company had expected.

Rena Karton is to confer with the other 22 cardboard producers which have been  fined and with the European cardboard makers' association SEPI before taking a decision. The 23 cardboard producers were fined a total of NKr 1.1bn for illegal price cooperation.

Metsae-Serla Oy, a Finnish forest products group, said it intends to appeal its share of the 20 million
European currency unit ($24.9 million) fine levied by the European Commission against
Finnboard for participating in a price-fixing  cartel.

Finnboard is a joint marketing venture for  carton board products of six Finnish  paper companies. Metsae-Serla's share of Finnboard's  fine amounts to seven million ECU, the company said.

"An appeal against the sentence will be made at the E.U.'s court of first instance as neither Finnboard nor Metsae-Serla have been engaged in alleged uniform price  fixing  with other (carton) board manufacturers," it said.
The fine won't have a "major influence" on Metsae-Serla's 1994 result, the company said. (AP-DJ

HD      European Union: Making The Market Work --- The Bench: EU Efforts  to Enforce A Level Playing Field Clash at Court of Justice  --- Rulings  of Luxembourg Body Turn Against  Commission And Even Single Market --- Better Checks and Balances

{Last in a series}

LUXEMBOURG -- As the agency charged with enforcing the  European Union's internal market, the  EU   Commission has seen a recent reversal of fortune at the rusty brown, modern building that houses the European Court of Justice.

TD
"I used to say that being the commission was nine-tenths of the law because it won just about every case," notes one court official, "but that's clearly not the situation anymore."

Despite its founding as a referee for cases where local practices conflict with EU laws, for decades the EU Court was a reliable ally in the executive branch's efforts to police the "common market." Many times when it came to insisting on a level playing field throughout the EU, the justices in Luxembourg were even ahead of the bureaucrats in Brussels.

But as recent setbacks show, the commission and the court don't always see eye-to-eye anymore. Putting its own spin on the new EU doctrine of emphasizing nations' rights over centralized power, in several cases the Court of Justice has seemingly ruled against the single market, declining to interfere with local rules that might restrict the flow of goods. Moreover, the coming of age of the judicial branch's aggressive new junior court, the Court of First Instance, has put commission procedures under much closer scrutiny, resulting in the embarrassing invalidation of commission  fines in several high-profile price-fixing  cases.

The commission still has its successes, including a recent victory over restrictive Italian public procurement rules and a string of rulings that backed the right of consumers to buy imported cars at lower prices than established dealers were offering. But the era is decidedly past when the court would automatically accept and uphold the commission's economic arguments. Some EU legal experts say
that's a good thing because it inserts a much-needed degree of checks and balances, helping to build public confidence in the EU legal system. The overworked EU Court of Justice until recently had no time to independently verify evidence presented by the commission. It was to correct this imbalance that the Court of First Instance was created five years ago. The CFI meticulously combs through evidence, particularly in competition cases, in search of inconsistencies -- often to the commission's chagrin.

"The Court of First Instance is a fact-finding body that makes very detailed scrutinies in a way the Court of Justice never did," says Anand Pathak, a lawyer in the Brussels office of the firm Jones Day Reavis & Pogue. "Gone are the days when the commission would always win."

That end-of-epoch reality was brought home to Brussels with a bang when the CFI in 1992 struck down a commission decision to  fine 14 chemical companies $27.5 million for running an alleged plastics  cartel. The court denied the decision's very existence, citing procedural irregularities including the failure of Commission President Jacques Delors to sign some documents. Last month, the Court of Justice toned down the CFI's conclusions by finding the decision did indeed exist, but it invalidated the  fines anyway

Page 63 of 71 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
due to "infringement of essential procedural requirements." Rulings by the CFI can be appealed to the
Court of Justice on issues of law but not fact.

More recently, the EU courts annulled hefty  fines against Italian glass producers and a group of woodpulp concerns, on grounds that the commission had failed to produce enough evidence of participation in a  cartel over the period it alleged. And this month, in what has become known as the "tennis ball case," the CFI slashed commission fines against British sporting-goods manufacturer Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd. to three million European currency units ($3.68 million) from five million ECUs. While the commission won most of its legal arguments in alleging that distribution restrictions imposed by Dunlop kept prices artificially high, the  fines were still pared 40% when the court found that the competition infringement lasted only from 1985 to 1990, rather than from 1977 to 1990 as alleged by the commission.

Similarly, the court last week reduced  fines on Parker Pen Ltd. of Britain to $400,000 from $700,000 in a case involving an exclusive export network to Germany. "It is apparent," the justices said, "that the commission did not take into account" that sales of products related to the competition infringement were relatively low in comparison to Parker's overall sales.

This string of rebuffs has not gone unnoticed at the commission, where some officials think the justices may be going too far in siding with companies accused of anticompetitive activities.

"There's a feeling around here that `the creeps are walking,'" says one commission official, using an old gangster movie expression to say that guilty parties are going unpunished. "It's really something that concerns us."
The recent  cartel rulings, say experts in EU law, have showcased the shortcomings of the commission's
30-year-old procedural rules and the insufficient size of its enforcement staff. But with anti-Brussels
sentiment running high in many quarters, the commission is reluctant to ask member states for changes
in its regulations. National governments might take the opportunity to weaken the commission's clout
rather than refine its procedures. "They're scared to death to approach the member states," says one
prominent competition lawyer. Similar fears of member-state tinkering led the commission last year to shy
away from seeking any amendments to the EU's three-year-old merger law -- despite a clear feeling in
Brussels that the law's jurisdictional thresholds should be lowered so that more mergers are covered.

"The commission's role in  cartel cases shows the worst of both worlds," says Barry Hawk, a lawyer in the Brussels office of the U.S. law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. "Compared to U.S. authorities, the commission has relatively weak enforcement powers in  cartel cases, especially with regard to discovery powers {the right to demand that evidence be turned over}. To make up for the deficiencies, they take procedural shortcuts, and they're getting reversed by the court on the procedural shortcuts."

Two highly publicized cases acted upon by the commission this year will be closely watched if, as expected, they also make their way to the Court of First Instance: Five months after levying 104 million ECUs in fines against a group of steel companies, the commission last week slapped  fines totaling a record 132 million ECUs against 19 carton-board manufacturers for what EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert termed a "pernicious" cartel.

But while the court's  cartel rulings have attracted the most headlines, a series of recent decisions on the internal market might have more lasting impact.

The most important decision came in November, when the EU Court of Justice upheld a French law that prohibits promotional resale at a loss -- commonly known as the offering of "loss leaders" in order to entice customers into a store to buy other items. The case involved two supermarkets near Strasbourg,
which complained that the French restrictions gave an unfair advantage to markets just over the border in Germany. The EU Court not only upheld the French law, it appeared to go out of its way to criticize companies that resort to EU law in efforts to overturn national restrictions such as Sunday trading laws. The court said in effect that national authorities have great leeway to enact trading restrictions provided that the rules are not specifically aimed at goods produced in another member state.

One commission official said the decision "changed a decade of jurisprudence" on EU law governing the free movement of goods. Indeed, the court seemed to acknowledge that it was departing from precedent, saying it was "necessary to re-examine and clarify" its case law in light of retailers' increasing tendency to "challenge any rules" which limit their commercial freedom.

"The court essentially sent a message that it doesn't want to know about these local socio-economic trading regulations anymore," says Laurence Gormley, a professor of EU law at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. "It's a clear signal that the court is invoking the spirit of Edinburgh," he says, a reference to the December 1992 EU summit in Scotland's capital that enshrined the principle of

Page 64 of 71 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"subsidiarity," or giving certain national laws precedence over EU rules, as a way of bringing the union closer to its citizens.

Earlier this year, the court affirmed what Prof. Gormley called its new "handsoff approach" by upholding Britain's ban on unauthorized sales of lottery tickets. The justices acknowledged that the offering of lottery tickets is indeed covered by EU rules on the provision of goods and services (the commission terms this part of the ruling a "half victory"), but that Britain had the right to issue restrictions based on grounds of public morality.

"The court is certainly a lot more careful in passing judgment on certain arguments made by member states," says a commission official involved in the single-market project. In cases involving the EU treaty's Article 30, which bans "quantitative restrictions on imports" between member states, he says the court is "clearly stepping back" from the assertive role it assumed in 1980s.

The court has done no favors either for recent commission efforts to pry open national electricity and natural-gas monopolies. In May 1993, the justices ruled that national postal authorities could challenge services provided by private couriers if the couriers upset the "economic equilibrium" of the state postal service. Although that decision was broadly in line with a so-called commission green  paper on postal services, the postal ruling was cited by the court earlier this year when it upheld a Dutch electricity distributor's monopoly selling arrangements. In language whose breadth alarmed some free-marketers, the court said a utility's restrictive sales provisions can be justified when "necessary to permit such an enterprise to fulfill its tasks in the public interest."

Some legal experts say the ruling could dampen the commission's prospects in court cases against gas or electricity import restrictions in five countries -- France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The commission has resorted to the courts because its efforts to liberalize those sectors through legislation have failed dismally in the EU Council of Ministers.

A former member of the EU Court of Justice, British Law Lord Gordon Slynn, says it would be wrong to interpret the recent results as reflecting an anti-commission sentiment on the part of the current crop of Luxembourg justices. Instead, he says, the advent of the Court of First Instance has simply allowed the jurists to do their jobs properly.

"The court was always prepared to be critical of the commission when the need arose, but the difference now is that the Court of First Instance has much more time to investigate," says Lord Slynn, who served on the Luxembourg court from 1981 to 1992.

Although rough treatment by the CFI has bruised some egos in Brussels, the commission acknowledges that the court -- as envisioned -- has helped speed decisions at the EU Court of Justice. The senior court's backlog now stands at 377 cases, compared with 700-plus cases just a few years ago.
"The Court of Justice is now in a much better position to respond to requests for clarification of  European
law from national courts," says one commission official. "That was a driving force behind the Court of
First Instance to begin with."

The junior court's clout is sure to increase in the years to come. Initially, EU governments allowed the CFI to have jurisdiction only in competition cases, coal and steel cases, and disputes between EU institutions and their employees. But after a protracted political battle, EU member states agreed last year to extend the new court's jurisdiction to state aid and antidumping cases, the latter taking effect only a few months ago. Some more-protectionist countries like France and Spain were concerned that the CFI would give
the commission a hard time in antidumping disputes. But the expansion of jurisdiction finally went through when it was coupled with a complicated change in EU voting rules that favored the union's protectionist wing.

"In the long run, it's good for the  European Union's image that the Court of First Instance is forcing the commission to be more careful, and that will carry over into the court's new areas of jurisdiction," says one longtime court observer.

"Already, competition law has become much more credible, in that if a  fine is upheld it means that there's pretty good evidence that a  cartel indeed exists," he says. "Sure, it's more difficult now for the commission, but to complain about that is like complaining that the presumption of innocence in criminal law makes proof of guilt more difficult. If everybody is locked up, it brings the law into disrepute."

Cascades Inc. of Kingsey Falls, Que., will appeal a $28-million  fine the European Commission slapped on its French subsidiary in a  packaging price-fixing  case last week. ''The appeal will be made by Cascades SA, our Paris-based holding company, and others are going the same route,'' said Alain Lemaire, executive vice-president. Cascades SA was one of 19  carton-board producers found guilty
by Europe's Competition Commissioner of price-fixing  from 1986 to 1991 and  fined a total of more than $230 million.

VIENNA, July 20 (Reuter) -  Carton-board marker Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG has cut its forecast net profit this year to 160 million schillings from 260 million in the prospectus issued at the time of its flotation in April, share analysts said.
The reduction was due to the recent rise in used  paper costs, the company told analysts at a briefing.

TD
The company has already warned that the rise in costs would hit its near-term earnings outlook, and last week Creditanstalt-Bankverein cut its forecast of profit calcuated by the methodology of the Austrian Association of Financial Analysts (OVFA) to 140 million schillings from 260 million.

The company cut its earnings forecast in the the used  paper sector to 50-70 million schillings from 100 million, but wanted to compensate for this by cost-savings of 20-40 million schillings, said Wolfgang Pinner, chief analyst at Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank AG.
Pinner told Reuters that the company expects used  paper prices to fall in the next half-year. Mayr-Melnhof also plans to complete one of two planned acquisitions in the near future, he said. Mayr-Melnhof said last week that the poorer earnings outlook was not due to a 21 million Ecu  fine
imposed by the European Commission for price fixing.
The company had already warned about the possible  fine and set aside adequate reserves to cover it.

Much of the European paper-producing industry has been financially and morally embarrassed by a European Commission investigation into allegations of an illegal price-fixing cartel. The commission has handed out fines to 19 companies amounting to over pounds 100m. The group concocted an elaborate scheme by which price increases for cartonboard (a material used in packaging consumer products)
were imposed uniformly across Europe. The cartel was made up of the biggest names in the European   
paper industry, including MoDo, Stora, SCA, KNP-BT and Mayr-Meinhof.

HD     Cartonboard makers given heavy fines

LP
In a decision announced on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) imposed heavy fines on 19 of Europe's largest  cartonboard manufacturers. This follows a three-year case in which the companies were accused of operating an illegal price  cartel. In April 1991, following a complaint by the British Printing Industries Federation (BPIF), the Commission raided 15 companies across  Europe. The Commission
found that these  cartonboard makers increased prices by 6-10% twice a year from 1987 to 1990 despite consumer resistance and falling costs of raw materials. During the same four years, the use of cartonboard in Western  Europe rose by some 20%. Investigators from the Commission discovered personal notes showing how much and by when price rises would take place in each  European Union (EU) member state. They found that an entire network of deception existed. The outcome of the case was that the companies received the heaviest  fines yet levied against a price-fixing cartel in Europe.

TD
The EC's competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said that the  cartel was pernicious and sophisticated. It operated by manipulating the balance between the supply and demand for cartonboard. This allowed the concerted price initiatives to occur, through a carefully constructed market -sharing arrangement. The Commission found that, "All of the companies knew that aggressive attempts to gain market share would undermine their carefully orchestrated price initiatives". The Commission also alleges that companies suspected of deviating from the plan were required to explain their actions; likewise, laggards were pressed into raising their prices to the required levels. Among those most heavily  fined were Cascades, Finnboard, Mayr -Melnhof, Feldmhle (now part of the Swedish group Stora), Thames Board (now part of the Swedish group Modo), Sarrio, Enso Gutzeit, Gruber & Weber, Laakman, BPB De Eendracht, and SCA Holdings. The  fines confirm that the Commission found the  cartel had hindered
competition. They apply to all of the main EU producers. In addition, however, the sales agents for non-EU companies in Sweden, Austria and Canada were also involved. The Commission's investigation was helped by Stora who, in 1991, had only just acquired Feldmhle. Stora's admission came in August 1991. It told the Commission that several companies in its group had been involved in a price-fixingcartel. A spokesperson for the BPIF said that it welcomed the outcome on behalf of the many carton makers who are BPIF members.

Comment: EU  carton makers use 3 million tonnes a year of board, one-third being imported from Finland, Sweden and Austria. The  carton makers usually find that their costs vary with raw material costs.
However, actual raw material prices (wood pulp and waste  paper) were low while the  cartel was operating to keep prices high.
