BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - EU regulators are set to  fine an animal-feed cartel next week for illegal price fixing  but will lower the penalties as the firms admitted to breaching EU rules, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The case will be the second under the  European          Commission's fast-track settlement procedure after nine memory-chip makers, including Samsung Electronics , admitted in May to taking part in a  cartel and were penalised.

Under this process, companies receive a 10 percent reduction in  fines in return for acknowledging the offence.

"The animal feed cartel decision is expected next Tuesday," one of the sources said, declining to be identified because of the confidential nature of the case.

The source said about six companies are involved in the cartel. The total  fine is expected to be lower than the 331 million euros ($416.9 million) for the chipmakers cartel.
The European Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, declined to comment on the case.

U.S. chemicals company FMC said in a regulatory filing in May it had set aside $21 million to cover the cost of resolving the issue after the Commission opened proceedings against the firm, its Dutch unit and its industrial chemicals unit Foret in January 2009.

Belgian chemicals and plastics company Tessenderlo and Finnish peer Kemira said in January they were contacted by the  European Commission as part of its investigation into a suspected  animal-feed cartel.
Kemira has since sold its animal feeds business to Norway's Yara .
One firm has opted out of the settlement procedure, one of the sources said, declining to provide details. The Commission launched its settlement procedure in July 2008 in a bid to speed up the
decision-making process and free up resources. The EU executive can  fine companies up to 10 percent
of their global turnover for breaking EU laws.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Tuesday fined six chemical companies a total of EUR176 million for operating a cartel of phosphates used in animal feed for over three decades.

Belgian chemical company Tessenderlo Chemie NV will pay EUR84 million, the biggest share of the fine. French company Timab Industries will pay EUR60 million, and FMC Corp. (FMC) along with several of its subsidiaries will pay EUR14.4 million.

TD
Five of the companies settled with the commission and thus had their  fines reduced by 10%. The commission also reduced Tessenderlo's  fine 50% because it cooperated with the investigation.

"While companies that cooperate with the commission, including under the settlement procedure, can count on immunity or a reduction of the  fine, there should be no doubt about our determination to unearth and punish  cartel members," said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief.
The commission, the European Union's executive arm, said the  cartel was operating from March
1969 until February 2004, though not all companies were involved for the entire time.

BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission Tuesday fined 13 animal feed                phosphates producers a total of 175.6 million euros (about 226.6 million U.S. dollars) for setting up a cartel which lasted for three decades to fix price on the market.

"After the pre-stressing steel case, I am again surprised that the main producers of a vital compound for animal feed abused a substantial part of the European  animal feed market for nearly 35 years," said Joaquin Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy.

TD
Among the 13 companies, Tessenderlo Chemie N.V. of Belgium got the largest  fine of 83.7 million euros (107.9 million dollars), while Kemira of Finland was immune for reporting the case to the Commission in 2003.
The cartel which existed from as early as March 1969 until February 2004 allocated market shares,
feed phosphates sales quotas and customers among themselves, the Commission said in a statement.

Animal feed phosphates are chemical compounds used in feed for animals such as cattle, pigs, poultry, fish and pets.

European competition watchdogs announced on Tuesday 175 million euros in  fines for 13 companies which ran an animal feed phosphates cartel for more than three decades.

Members in various combinations fixed the market for chemical compounds used in feed for animals, from as early as March 1969 until February 2004, the  European Commission said.

TD
"They allocated market shares, feed  phosphates sales quotas and customers among themselves, and coordinated prices and sales conditions when necessary," watchdogs said in a statement.

"After the pre-stressing steel case, I am again surprised that the main producers of a vital compound for animal feed abused a substantial part of the European  animal feed market for nearly 35 years," said EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, referring to a decision last month to  fine 17 steel producers a total of 518 million euros (635 million dollars).

Companies from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain were  fined after Finland's Kemira blew this whistle on the  cartel in 2003.

BRUSSELS, July 20 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators imposed a 176 million euro ($227.4 million)  fine on six companies for fixing  prices of animal feed, with Belgian group Tessenderlo owing almost half the penalty.

Tessenderlo was hit with a 84 million euro  fine. The company said it already had a provision of 97 million euros for fines.

U.S. chemicals company FMC was  fined 14 million euros, Spanish firms Ercros S.A and Ercros Industrial S.A. received a combined  fine of 15 million euros and Portugal's Quimitecnica and Jose de Mello SGPS S.A. were penalised a combined 3 million euros.

The European Commission, the EU's antitrust enforcer, had cut their orginal  fines by 10 percent under the EU's new settlement procedure, which rewards firms that admit to  fixing  market shares and prices.

France's Timab opted out of the Commission's fast-track settlement procedure and was  fined 60 million euros.

Animal feed phosphates are used in feed for cattle, pigs and fish.

Finnish peer Kemira , which has since sold its  animal feed business to Norway's Yara , received immunity for cooperating with the regulator.

Other offenders have had their  fines further reduced for varying degrees of cooperation, including a 50 percent cut for Tessenderlo. "After the pre-stressing steel case, I am again surprised that the main producers of a vital compound for  animal feed abused a substantial part of the European  animal feed market for nearly 35 years," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The feed case is the second to follow the Commission's settlement procedure. In May, nine memory-chip makers, including Samsung Electronics , admitted to taking part in a  cartel and were fined.

Tessenderlo shares were down 0.6 percent by 1508 GMT while the Stoxx 600 chemicals index <.SX4P> was 1.3 percent lower. ($1=.7739 Euro) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Timothy Heritage and Karen Foster)

HD     EU fines chemical  producers (EURO)176M ($228M) for fixing  prices of animal feed phosphates

BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union regulators on Tuesday fined 13 chemical producers (EURO)175.6 million ($227.52 million) for  fixing  the price of animal feed phosphates, nutrients added to food for cattle, pigs, poultry, fish and pets.

Tessenderlo Chemie NV of Belgium received the biggest  fine of (EURO)83.7 million and said it would set aside (EURO)97 million to pay the  fine and other costs over three years. It said it fully cooperated with EU officials and has reinforced its compliance with antitrust rules.

TD
France's Timab Industries SA and Compagnie Financiere de Participation Roullier, or CFPR, shared a (EURO)59.8 million penalty. Spain's Ercros SA was  fined (EURO)14.85 million. FMC, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was  fined (EURO)14.4 million for its Spanish, Dutch and U.S. branches. Portugal's Quimitecnica.com and Jose de Mello were  fined (EURO)2.79 million.

The European Commission said secret agreements to coordinate prices, allocate customers and market shares and set quotas across Europe ran from March 1969 until February 2004, when Finland's Kemira Oyj blew the whistle. Kemira has since sold off its  animal feed business.

The EU said it had reduced  fines for Tessenderlo, Quimitecnica.com and Jose de Mello for cooperating with antitrust regulators. It also gave another reduction to them and Ercros and FMC for striking a binding deal to settle the case and admit liabilities.

Timab and CFPR refused to settle -- which would allow them to appeal the  fine to the EU courts if they want.

Two companies had their  fines reduced by 70 percent because they claimed a huge penalty could drive them into bankruptcy. The EU's executive did not name them.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission Tuesday fined six chemical companies a total of EUR176 million for operating a cartel of phosphates used in animal feed for over three decades.

Belgian chemical company Tessenderlo Chemie NV will pay EUR84 million, the biggest share of the fine. French company Timab Industries will pay EUR60 million, and FMC Corp. (FMC) along with several of its subsidiaries will pay EUR14.4 million.

TD
Five of the companies settled with the commission and thus had their  fines reduced by 10%. The commission also reduced Tessenderlo's  fine 50% because it cooperated with the investigation.

"While companies that cooperate with the commission, including under the settlement procedure, can count on immunity or a reduction of the  fine, there should be no doubt about our determination to unearth and punish  cartel members," said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief.
The commission, the European Union's executive arm, said the  cartel was operating from March
1969 until February 2004, though not all companies were involved for the entire time.

Ireland sold the maximum intended 1.5 billion euros ($1.94 billion) of government bonds, garnering decent demand a day after Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its credit rating. Spain and Greece -- Ireland's fellow canaries in the euro-zone debt-crisis coal mine -- also had smooth bond auctions. However, Hungary's government sold less than planned of three-month Treasury bills, being forced to reduce targeted volumes after the yield demanded by investors rose on the heels of the breakdown of talks with the IMF and the EU.

HD        EU fines six groups  in animal feed cartel

Six companies involved in a  cartel that ran for more than three decades in the  animal feed industry have been fined more than €175m ($226m) by Europe's top competition watchdog.

However, five of the companies either blew a whistle on the price-fixing  arrangements or decided to settle with competition officials at the  European Commission, leaving only one company, France's Timab Industries, to reject the settlement terms.

TD
The case is the first "hybrid" result since the commission introduced its new and relatively rarely used procedure for settling  cartel investigations, and may be scrutinised closely by lawyers.

The watchdog first learnt about the  cartel, which involved manufacturers of animal feed phosphates, in 2003 when Finland's Kemira blew the whistle. Officials established that the cartel ran from as early as March 1969 until February 2004, although not all the companies were involved throughout that period.

The cartel involved the allocation of market shares and sales quotas, as well as co-ordination of sales conditions and prices when necessary.

Kemira was granted complete immunity from  fines because of its role in bringing the  cartel to light. Tessenderlo Chemie and Quimitecnica, together with related companies, also benefited from  fine reductions of 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively because of their co-operation and a further 10 per cent under the settlement procedures.
They will have to pay €85.7m and €2.8m respectively.

Ercros and FMC, together with their related companies, will get only the 10 per cent reduction under the settlement process, and will pay €14.8m and €14.4m.
Timab will get a 5 per cent reduction for co-operation, and was  fined €59.8m.

Two companies argued that economic conditions meant that they were unable to pay the  fines. The commission accepted these arguments in only one case and cut the  fine by 70 per cent. It did not identify the company.

Brussels, 20/07/2010 (Agence Europe) - On Tuesday 20 July, the European Commission decided to impose fines totalling €175.647 million on animal feed phosphates producers for operating a  cartel that lasted over three decades and covered a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA). All but one company settled the case with the Commission and therefore each received a 10% reduction of their  fine. Animal feed phosphates are chemical compounds used in feed for animals such as cattle, pigs, poultry, fish and pets.

TD
The Commission was informed for the first time in 2004 of the existence of the  cartel by Kemira, one of the participants that applied for leniency. The  cartel, which had existed since 1969, meant that its members shared the market covering most of the EU, and subsequently also a great part of the EEA territory, with price-fixing  of phosphates. To this end, they allocated market shares, feed  phosphates sales quotas and customers among themselves, and coordinated prices and sales conditions when necessary. Such coordination is by its very nature one of the most serious violations of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

The cartel arrangements, known as the “Club”, CEPA (Centre d'Etude des  Phosphates Alimentaires) or later Super CEPA, proved to be resilient and able to adapt to different industry and market conditions over the years. Throughout the whole period, the undertakings had frequent contacts and met regularly to coordinate through price monitoring and market sharing agreements at both European and country levels.
The French enterprises, Timab Industries S.A. and Compagnie financière et de participation Roullier
(CFPR), had the largest  fine imposed on them: €59.85 million. (L.C./transl.jl)

Finnish chemicals company Kemira has avoided  fines in the EU investigation concerning a feed  cartel. According to Kemira, the  EU Commission has decided that Kemira should not pay any  fine, as it was the first company to report these activities to the Commission. The decision will not have any financial impact on the company. Kemira has cooperated with the  EU Commission in the investigations that started at the end of 2003.

TWELVE firms supplying phosphates for animal feed were yesterday collectively  fined
£149million for operating a price-fixing  cartel.

The European Commission said the cartel operated for almost four decades and involved the businesses in Europe and the US sharing market information.

TD
EC vice-president Joaquin Almunia said she was surprised the main producers of a vital component in animal feed abused a substantial part of the European market for 35 years. Several of the companies admitted their participation in the  cartel and had penalties reduced, while an unnamed business decided not to settle.

The EC was first made aware of the  cartel seven years ago by Kemira, which has escaped penalties after applying for leniency. The EC said the  cartel operated from 1967 to 2004, although not all the firms were involved throughout the period. No penalties have been imposed on Finnish firms Yara Phosphates, Yara Suomi and Kemira.

The fines are shared by Belgium's Tessenderlo Chemi, Spain's Ercros, Ercros Industrial and FMC Foret, Portugal's Quimitecnica and Jose de Mello, the Dutch-based FMC Chemicals Netherlands, the FMC Corporation in the US and two French firms – Timab Industries and Compagnie Financiere et de Participation Roullier.

The European Commission dealt a heavy blow to 13 animal feed phosphates producers (belonging to six different groups), with its announcement, on 20 July, of fines of €175,647,000 for an illegal  cartel that lasted over 30 years and covered a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA).

All the companies except one settled the case with the Commission and consequently received a 10% reduction in their  fine. The executive applied a hybrid' scenario in this case, combining the settlement procedures and the standard procedure. Its leniency has its limits, however: "While companies that cooperate with the Commission, including under the settlement procedure, can count on immunity or a reduction of the  fine, there should be no doubt about our determination to unearth and punish  cartel members," noted Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

TD
In practical terms, the Commission adopted two decisions: the first is a streamlined settlement decision for the companies that agreed to settle and admitted their participation in the  cartel; the second is a standard decision for one company, which decided not to settle and for which the ordinary procedure was followed.

The Commission was informed about the cartel in 2004 by Kemira, one of the participants that applied for leniency. Its investigation showed that the cartel had existed from as early as March 1969 and continued until February 2004, although not all producers were involved for the entire period. The firms concerned divided up the market, customers and sales of  animal feed phosphates and coordinated their prices and sales conditions where necessary. Such coordination represents one of the most serious violations of Article 101 of the EU Treaty.

The settlement proceedings, based on Regulation (EC) 622/2008 of 30 June 2008, were initiated with all undertakings. After the Commission had informed the parties of the range of the  fines, one company, Timab Industries S.A./Compagnie Financière et de Participation Roullier, decided to discontinue the settlement proceedings, becoming the only party in the ordinary procedure. As foreseen in Point 32 of the Commission's settlement notice of 2 July 2008, the  fine for all addressees of the settlement decision is reduced by 10%.

Several animal feed phosphates producers have been ordered by the European Commission to pay fines amounting to $225 M for their alleged participation in a price-fixing  cartel from 1969 to 2004. Belgium's Tessenderlo received the largest  fine of $107 M. Kemira, which divested its  phosphates business to Yara in 2004, was exempted from the  fine for being the whistle blower.

A number of animal feed phosphate producers have been fined a total of EUR 175.65 M ($227 M) by
the European Commission for alleged cartel behaviour. The EC accused the firms of fixing  animal feed
phosphate prices in Western Europe starting as early as Mar 1969 until Feb 2004. Fined were
Tessenderlo Chemie (EUR 83.75 M), Ercros (EUR 14.85 M), Quimitecnica (EUR 1.75 M), Jose de Mello
(EUR 1.04 M) and FMC (EUR 14.4 M). Yara and Kemira were exempted from the fine because they
cooperated with the investigation, which began in 2004 when Kemira exposed the cartel in 2003.

HD        European Commission ("Commission") Concludes its First Hybrid Settlement  Case
BY       SJ Berwin's EU & Competition Team

On 20 July 2010 the Commission announced that it had  fined five animal feed phosphate producers a total of €175.6 million for price-fixing  and market sharing activities in the EU animal feed market. The cartel spanned three decades from 1969 to 2004 (although not all the companies participated for the full duration).  A sixth producer, Kemira Oyj, was granted 100% immunity under the Commission's leniency policy.

Four of the producers opted to use the Commission's  cartel settlement procedure and received a 10% reduction in fines in exchange for admitting their involvement in the  cartel and agreeing to streamlined procedures.  The final party, Timab Industries SA ("Timab"), however, chose to opt out of the settlement procedure resulting in a hybrid case. The Commission therefore had to adopt both a 'streamlined' settlement decision and a standard infringement decision.

TD
In opting not to settle with the Commission, Timab states that it could not accept the entirety of the Commission's objections and that its case was sufficiently different to that of the other parties as it was involved for a much shorter period of time, running from 1993 to 2004. It has announced that it is planning to appeal the decision.

Given the long duration of the  cartel, certain of the  fines had to be adjusted downwards as they exceeded the Commission's 10% worldwide turnover cap. The highest  fine was imposed on Tessenderlo Chemie N.V of €83.7 million. In addition to Kemira Oyj receiving complete immunity from fines, five of the companies received reductions of between 5% - 50% under the Commission's 2002
Leniency Notice, one of which was Timab, which received a 5% reduction for co-operation (resulting in a
fine of €59.8 million).

Two of the  cartel members also filed applications for reduced  fines due to financial hardship, although only one party was successful with their  fine being reduced by 70% under the Commission's recently revised 'inability to pay' policy.

In what is only its second  cartel settlement decision, the Commission has shown its willingness to use the settlement procedure flexibly by settling with only some of the parties to the  cartel.  The Commission's first (and only other)  cartel settlement case was in May 2010 in relation to its investigation into DRAM memory chips, in which all ten companies involved agreed to settle (see Community Week issue 472).

The settlement procedure was introduced in 2008 in order to expedite the Commission's administrative proceedings, however much of this procedural benefit can end up being lost in a hybrid case where both a streamlined and standard process need to be followed – particularly where the non-settling party appeals.  The Commission will no doubt be assessing whether, overall, hybrid cases are worthwhile and it will be interesting to see whether it is a policy the Commission actively pursues in the future.

After 6 years of legal proceedings, the case involving cartels on the  phosphates for animal feeds markets has been concluded. The  European Commission has fined 13 producers a total of EUR 175.6 M. Of the guilty parties, only Kemira and Yara's Finnish subsidiaries were exempt from  fines (because they assisted the Commission with its enquiries). In 2004, the Finnish group was the first to admit to illegal agreements on the phosphates market within the European Union. The case spans 35 years (from Mar 1969-Feb
2004) during which time the 13 companies agreed on market share, customers and pricing for
phosphates for animal feed. Because of the longevity of the  cartel, the European Commission was not
able to implement the full fines applicable because of legislation limiting fines to 10% of turnover. Thanks
to this rule, Belgian group Tessenderlo's  fine was reduced by 50%. A table gives details of the companies
involved and the  fines they received.

HD     EU fines phosphates cartel

The European Commission has fined several animal feed phosphates producers a total of €175.65m. ($226.6m.) for operating a price-fixing  cartel lasting over three decades, the executive branch of the EU announced.
Belgium’s Tessenderlo NV was given the largest  fine of €83.75m., while French groups Timab Industries
SA and Compagnie Financiere et de Participation Roullier (CFPR) shared a  fine of €59.85m.

TD
In response to the ruling, Tessenderlo said in a statement: “The investigation relates to events that go back many years. Since then, the existing antitrust compliance programme of the group has been reinforced.”

Ercros SA and Ercros Industrial SA of Spain were handed a joint  fine of €14.85m. and US group FMC Corp. and its Spanish and Dutch businesses were  fined €14.4m.

Finland’s Kemira Oyj escaped a  fine by alerting the Commission to the  cartel in 2003, with the Finnish subsidiaries of Yara also spared from a charge by cooperating.
Market “abused”

Animal feed phosphates, derived from  phosphate rock, are chemical compounds used in feed for cattle, pigs, poultry, fish and household pets.

“[I am] surprised that the main producers of a vital compound for  animal feed abused a substantial part of the European  animal feed market for nearly 35 years,” said Joaqu’n Almunia, Commission vice president for competition policy.

Almunia added: “While companies that cooperate with the Commission, including under the settlement procedure, can count on immunity or a reduction of the  fine, there should be no doubt about our determination to unearth and punish  cartel members.”

The Commission found that the  cartel known as the ‘Club’, CEPA and Super CEPA existed from as early as 1964 through to February 2004, though not all producers were involved for the entire period.

The cartel was said to operate in markets covering most of the EU, allocating market shares, feed phosphates sales quotas and customers among themselves, and coordinated prices and sales conditions.

There have been several Commission  fines handed to industrial minerals companies in recent years. In November 2009, Carbone Lorraine and SGL Group were  fined for operating a carbon and graphite  cartel (IM 18 November 2009: European graphite  cartel).

The glass industry has the distinction of receiving one of the largest  fines imposed to date, when the EC handed out a record $1.7bn. fine to four manufacturers in November 2008 Ð including French group Saint-Gobain, which was fined $1.1bn. for repeat offences (IM April 2010: EU clamps down on cartels).
Peru start-up
Mining giant, Vale SA has started its  phosphate mine in Peru and with it has entered the  phosphate
industry.


Page 32 of 63 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Located at Piura in the province of Sechura, northern Peru, the mine has a 3.9m. tpa  phosphate rock capacity. Total investment in the project, which began construction in 2007, has been estimated at
$566m.

The mine has a proven and probable reserve base of 247m. tonnes ore, or 1m. tonnes of concentrate, and a 27-year estimated mine life.

Profit before tax in April-June amounted to EUR 37.3 million (20.8), and net profit from continuing operations totalled EUR 27.3 million (15.5).
Earnings per share from continuing operations was EUR 0.17 (0.11). Financial Performance in January-June 2010
Kemira Group's revenue of continuing operations increased by 7% in January-June 2010 compared to the corresponding period in 2009, due to the increase in demand in most customer industries. January-June
2010 revenue was EUR 1,059.9 million (January-June 2009: EUR 986.0 million). Sales volumes increased by about 10%.

The growth was strongest in the Oil & Mining and Paper segments. The exchange rate effect increased revenue by about EUR 34 million. Sales prices decreased in some products as a result of a drop in raw material prices seen in 2009.

The share of associates' results was EUR 3.8 million (-5.0).

The January-June profit before tax was EUR 69.0 million (28.8). Net profit for the period from continuing operations totalled EUR 55.0 million (22.2). Net profit was EUR 586.0 million (35.6). This includes a
non-recurring income of EUR 529.2 million from the separation of Tikkurila, consisting of the difference between the market price of Tikkurila on March 26, 2010 and the shareholder's equity of Tikkurila on March 25, 2010 less the transfer tax related to Tikkurila's listing as well as listing costs.
Financial position and cash flow

Cash flow from operating activities in January-June 2010 amounted to EUR 34.7 million (87.7). Cash flow includes Tikkurila until March 25, 2010. Compared to last year, cash flow was adversely affected by the separation of Tikkurila in the first quarter, as well as the increase of net working capital connected to the growth of revenue. Cash flow after investments amounted to EUR 134.6 million (49.5). Cash flow from investing activities includes the loan repayment from Tikkurila as well a cash and cash equivalents transferred to Tikkurila, and the effect of the transfer tax related to Tikkurila's listing, in total EUR 119.3.
The cash flow effect of expansion, improvement and maintenance investments was EUR -31.2 million
(-36.1). No acquisitions were carried out during the period.
Acquisitions amounted to EUR 3.7 million last year relating to Tikkurila.

At the end of the period the Group's net debt stood at EUR 611.0 million (December 31, 2009: EUR 675.6 million). The decrease in net debt was mainly due to the separation of Tikkurila (effect approximately EUR
160 million). Currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net debt by approximately EUR 54 million and in addition, during the second quarter Kemira Oyj paid out EUR 41 million in dividend.
At the end of the period, interest-bearing liabilities stood at EUR 723.6 million (December 31, 2009:
950.2). Fixed-rate loans accounted for 76% of total interest-bearing loans (December 31, 2009: 70%). The
average interest rate on the Group's interest-bearing liabilities was 4.4% (5.7%). At the end of June, the
duration of the Group's interest-bearing loan portfolio was 18 months (December 31, 2009: 19 months).

The unused amount of the EUR 500 million revolving credit facility that falls due in 2012 was EUR 437 million at the end of the period. The total limit of the revolving credit facility has been reduced from EUR
750 million to EUR 500 million. Short-term liabilities maturing in the next 12 months amounted to EUR
126.5 million, with commercial papers issued on the Finnish markets representing EUR 4.9 million and
repayments of long-term loans representing EUR 110.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR
112.6 million on June 30, 2010.

Based on its current structure, it is expected that the Group will not encounter any significant refinancing needs in 2010, since the current loan arrangements cover its financing needs. The terms of the revolving credit facility and other major bilateral loan arrangements require that the Group's equity ratio must be more than 25%.

At the end of the period, the equity ratio stood at 50% (December 31, 2009: 45%), while gearing was 48% (December 31, 2009: 53%). Kemira's gearing target is 40-80%. Shareholders' equity decreased by

Page 38 of 63 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
approximately EUR 70 million due to the separation of Tikkurila. The net impact of currencies on shareholders' equity was approximately EUR 45 million.
In January-June the Group's net financial expenses were EUR 17.7 million (19.6).

Net financial expenses decreased from the corresponding period in 2009, mainly due to lower debt and lower market rate levels; at the same time they increased due to the exchange rate effects.
Capital expenditure

Gross capital expenditure in January-June, excluding acquisitions, amounted to EUR 34.7 million (36.1). Gross capital expenditure of continuing operations, excluding acquisitions, totalled EUR 32.5 million (27.9). Expansion investments represented around 24% of gross capital investments, improvement investments around 40%, and maintenance investments around 36%. The depreciation of continuing operations amounted to EUR 48.2 million (50.6). Cash flow from the sale of assets in continuing operations was EUR 12.4 million (1.5) in January-June.
Research and Development
In continuing operations, research and development expenditure in January-June was EUR 20.4 million
(19.9) i.e. 2.1% (2.1%) of all operating expenses.

In March Kemira and VTT announced the establishing of a large water research center in Finland. The total cost of the research, which will be performed at the centre, is estimated at EUR 120 million, including external funding. The investments are allocated over a period of 4 years, resulting in further investment activities in projects for piloting and proof of concept purposes.
The centre will employ approximately 200 persons annually.

At the beginning of the year, about one third of the projects forming the water research program have been kicked off and new strategic partners (customers and other technology suppliers) are joining the program. Kemira has tightened cooperation with the University of Alberta (Canada). University of Alberta has long researched effective extraction of oil from oil sands. The focus of the cooperation will be on water treatment in particular.

In June, Kemira and Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) announced joint a R&D cooperation, with the aim to enhance used water treatment and purification. The goal of the 2-year project is to design a more efficient water treatment process with lower energy consumption and waste volume. The cooperation is part of a membrane research effort.
Human Resources

The number of Kemira Group employees at the end of the period was 5,177 (June 30, 2009: 9,139). The number of personnel declined mostly due to the separation of Tikkurila.

The Paper segment's revenue in April-June 2010 rose by 12% to EUR 247.4 million (221.6). Strong pulp demand has kept the sales of pulp chemicals at a good level. Demand for packaging board has picked up in particular in Asia and Eastern Europe since the second half of last year, increasing chemical sales into these regions. The demand for paper used in magazines and newspapers and the number of printed advertising material has increased the demand for the products. In some products, sales prices declined as a result of a drop in raw material prices in 2009. The exchange rate effects had a EUR 16 million positive impact on revenue.

Operating profit excluding non-recurring items for April-June was EUR 18.3 million (8.0). The operating profit margin rose to 7.4% from 3.6 % last year.
Costs decreased by some EUR 12 million in April-June compared to the corresponding period in 2009. In January-June the Paper segment's revenue increased by 8% to EUR 481.4 million (446.6). The
currency exchange effect had a positive impact on revenue of approximately EUR 19 million. Operating
profit excluding non-recurring items was EUR 33.5 million (15.5). Operating profit as a share of revenue
was 7.0% (3.5%).

Costs in January-June were about EUR 30 million lower than in January-June 2009. Exchange rates had no significant effect on the result.
During this period Kemira announced the divestments of two non-water related Paper segment units. Kemira sold the sulphuric acid plant in Kokkola to Boliden Kokkola Oy. The business operations were
transferred to Boliden Kokkola Oy on May 1, 2010.

Kemira continues chemical terminal operations in Kokkola including services to Boliden. The transaction has no significant impact on Kemira's financial result.

Kemira and German Catec GmbH financially supported by Fengler Beteiligungs GmbH have signed a contract, according to which Kemira sells its global Fluorescent Whitening Agents to Catec.

Randy Owens, President, Kemira Oil & Mining, will alongside his current role be the region head of North America. Hannu Melarti, SVP, Region North America has left the company to pursue career options outside Kemira as of July 1, 2010.

Kemira has received the  European Commission's decision regarding anticompetitive activities of  animal feed phosphates producers in Europe on July 20, 2010. The  European Commission decided that Kemira should not pay any  fine, since it was the first company to report these activities to the
Commission. Kemira has cooperated with the European Commission during the investigation which began at the end of 2003. Kemira divested the animal feed phosphates business in 2004.
Kemira informed the public about the Commission's investigations in 2004, in the prospectus of Kemira
GrowHow. The decision of the  European Commission will not have any financial impact on Kemira.
Short-term risks and uncertainties
Kemira's main short-term risks and uncertainties are connected to raw material availability and prices. Substantial fluctuations in the world market prices of electricity and oil are reflected in Kemira's financial
results, via raw material prices and logistics costs.

Introduction of REACH legislation may decrease the available raw material options and thus increase our raw material costs. REACH registration of Kemira's own products may also be more expensive than estimated, in particular if we are not able to share the costs with other companies. Acrylamide, boric acid, borates and sodium dichromate have been added to the list of candidates for authorization under REACH. If acrylamide, which Kemira uses as a raw material for polymers, will be added to the list of substances subject to authorization under REACH, this would make its use more difficult. Boric acid, borates and sodium dichromate are mainly used in the production at Kemira Chemicals Oy.
Changes in the exchange rates of key currencies can affect Kemira's financials.

A detailed account of Kemira's risk management principles and organization is available on the company website at  www.kemira.com. An account of financial risks is available in the Notes to the Financial Statements 2009. Environmental and hazard risks are discussed in Kemira's environmental report.
Outlook

Kemira's goal is to be a leading water chemistry company. Implementation of Kemira's water strategy has progressed well and the company has improved its profitability significantly and strengthened the balance sheet with several measures. Kemira will continue to focus on improving profitability and reinforcing positive cash flow, and the company will also increase its actions to boost growth.

The basis for growth is the expanding water chemicals markets and Kemira's strong know-how in water quality and quantity management. Increasing water shortage, tightening legislation and customers' needs to increase operational efficiency create opportunities for Kemira to develop new water applications for

Page 43 of 63 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
both new and current customers. Investment in research and development is a central part of Kemira's strategy. The focus of Kemira's R&D activities is on the development and commercialization of new innovative technologies both globally and locally.

During the current year, Kemira expects the demand to develop favorably as our customers' demand is getting stronger. Operating profit from continuing operations, excluding non-recurring items, is expected to grow notably from last year (2009: EUR 124.9 million).

Kemira had in its possession 3,600,225 of its treasury shares on June 30, 2010.

The average share price of treasury shares was EUR 6.73 and they represented 2.3% of the share capital and the aggregate number of votes conferred by all shares. The aggregate par value of the treasury shares is EUR 5.1 million.

The capital paid-in in excess of par value is a reserve accumulating through subscriptions entitled by the Management stock option program 2001 and is based on the Finnish Companies Act (734/1978), which does no longer change. According to IFRS, the Fair Value reserve is a reserve accumulating based on available-for-sale financial assets (shares) measured at fair value and hedge accounting. Other reserves are required by local legislation. The unrestricted equity reserve includes other equity type investments and the subscription price of shares to the extent that it will not, based on a specific decision, be recognized in share capital.

Litigation

On August 19, 2009, Kemira Oyj received a summons stating that  Cartel Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA (CDC) had filed an action against six hydrogen peroxide manufacturers, including Kemira, for violations of competition law applicable to the hydrogen peroxide business. In its claim,  Cartel
Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA seeks an order from the Regional Court of Dortmund in Germany to obtain an unabridged and full copy of the decision of the  European Commission, dated May 3, 2006, and demands that the defendants, including Kemira, are jointly and severally ordered to pay damages together with accrued interest on the basis of such decision.

Cartel Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA states that it will specify the amount of the damages at a later stage after the full copy of the decision of the European Commission has been obtained by it. In order to provide initial guidance as to the amount of such damages, Cartel Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA presents in its claim a preliminary calculation of the alleged overcharge having been paid to the defendants as a result of the violation of the applicable competition rules by the parties which have assigned and sold their claim to  Cartel Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA. Such alleged overcharge, together with accrued interest until December 31, 2008, is stated to be approximately EUR 641.3 million. The process is currently pending in the Regional Court of Dortmund, Germany.
Kemira defends against the claim of  Cartel Damage Claims Hydrogen Peroxide SA.

However, Kemira is currently not in a position to make any estimate regarding the duration or the likely outcome of the process. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of the process, and an
unfavorable judgment against Kemira could have a material adverse effect on Kemira's business, financial condition or results of operations. Due to its extensive international operations the Group, in addition to
the CDC claim, is involved in a number of other legal proceedings incidental to these operations and it does not expect the outcome of these other currently pending legal proceedings to have materially adverse effect upon its consolidated results or financial position.

The fair values of the instruments which are publicly traded are based on market valuation on the date of reporting. Other instruments have been valuated based on net present values of future cash flows. Valuation models have been used to estimate the fair values of options.

Nominal values of the financial instruments do not necessarily correspond to the actual cash flows between the counterparties and do not therefore give a fair view of the risk position of the Group.
