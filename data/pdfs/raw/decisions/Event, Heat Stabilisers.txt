BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - French specialty chemicals maker Arkema could be fined in excess of 100 million euros on charges of taking part in a cartel when EU anti-trust regulators rule on Wednesday, a company spokeswoman said.

The EU's executive Commission in March formally charged an unnamed number of companies with taking part in a cartel involving the supply of heat stabilisers, a substance added to PVC products to make them more resistant and rigid.
The charges followed raids on 14 companies in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and
Britain in February 2003.

"Concerning the decision of the European Commission expected tomorrow on heat stabilizers ... if we do base on the past fines, it can be between the scope of a few million euros to more than 1 hundred million," Arkema spokeswoman Sybille Chaix said in an email referring to the expected fine.

Arkema, spun off from French oil company Total in 2006, expects the fine to have a "very low" impact on its results, she added.

"According to the warranty agreed with Total... Total will pay 90 percent of the fine and Arkema 10 percent. Provisions are already booked for the 10 percent Arkema will have to pay," Chaix said.
Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel said it has not been formally notified of any Commission decision. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who has likened cartels to an evolving virus, has estimated the
economic cost created by 18 cartels reviewed by the EU executive between 2005 and 2007 at 7.6 billion
euros ($11.38 billion).

The Commission last year imposed a 1.38 billion euro fine, its biggest ever on a cartel, on a group of companies that were accused of taking part in a car glass cartel. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

The European competition watchdog on Wednesday slapped fines totalling 173 million euros on a plastics cartel of companies making products used in everything from credit cards to PVC fake leather.

The fines, worth 260 million dollars, target 10 corporate groups operating in the plastic additives sphere which also ends up making the likes of soft drinks bottles, food packaging and budget flooring products.

TD
"These companies must learn the hard way," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who said 24 individual companies had conducted "elaborate precautions to cover their tracks" between 1987 and 2000.

The fines result from a probe first announced in February 2003. The companies hit were Akzo, Baerlocher, Ciba, Elementis, Elf Aquitaine (Arkema France), GEA, Chemson, Faci, Reagens and AC Treuhand.

The record European Commission fine for a cartel carve-up was dished out to the car glass sector in 2008 and ran to nearly 1.384 billion euros.

The biggest ever fine for an individual company was construction giant Saint Gobain, at 896 million euros, also last year.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission Wednesday said it has fined 10 chemical companies a total of EUR173 million for fixing the prices of heat stabilizers in two separate cartels.

Heat stabilizers are chemicals used in plastic products to increase their heat resistance, rigidity and protect products from discoloration.

The commission found that between the years 1987 and 2000, 11 companies in total including Akzo Nobel (AKZA.AE), Baerlocher, Ciba now owned by BASF SE (BAS.XE), Elementis, Arkema France (AKE.FR) now part of Elf Aquitaine (AQ.FR), GEA, Chemson, Faci, Reagens and AC Treuhand, fixed prices, shared customers and allocated markets for the plastic chemicals.
U.S. Centura received immunity from fines for blowing the whistle on the cartels, the commission said.

The commission found evidence of two separate cartels: One for tin stabilizers running from 1987 to 2000 and the other involving Epoxidized soy bean oil, or ESBO, esters taking place during the years 1991 to
2000.

The combined market for the two chemicals used as heat stabilizers was worth some EUR121 million at the time of the infringement, the commission said.
BASF's Ciba faces the highest total fine at EUR68.4 million. A spokeswoman for the company said BASF
plans to appeal the Ciba share of the fine.

Akzo Nobel's faces the second highest combined fine at EUR40.6 million. The company declined to comment on the cartel decision.

The commission increase the fine on Arkema by 90% to total EUR28.6 million for the two cartels, due to previous participation in chemical cartels. The company wasn't immediately available for comment.

German Baerlocher's fine was reduced from over EUR6 million to EUR1 million due to the company's argument that its financial situation was such that it wouldn't be able to pay a full fine without great difficulties, the European commissioner for competition Neelie Kroes said.
It is unusual for the commission to agree to reduce fines based on arguments about financial difficulties.

The commission increased the fine on Arkema by 90% to total EUR28.6 million for the two cartels, due to previous participation in chemical cartels. The company wasn't immediately available for comment due to a public holiday in France.

BRUSSELS (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday jointly fined Akzo, Ciba, Elf Aquitaine and seven others euro173 million for fixing the price of plastic additives.

Ciba was fined euro68.4 million, Akzo was ordered to pay euro40.6 million, Elementis must pay euro32.57 million and Elf Aquitaine euro28.6 million. Baerlocher, Reagens, GEA and Faci were fined smaller amounts. Chemtura escaped a fine for alerting the EU executive to the cartel.

TD
The European Commission said the companies fixed prices, shared customers, carved up markets and swapped commercial information from 1987 to 2000 for tin stabilizers and ESBO/esters heat stabilizers, two additives used in packaging, credit cards, bottles and other plastic products.

The market for the stabilizers was worth some euro121 million a year during the time the cartel was active, the EU said.

Tin stabilizers are used to protect PVC plastic from heat when it is being formed into final products. Heat stabilizers are added to PVC products to help them cope better with higher temperatures, make them more rigid and protect them from discoloration.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said "these companies must learn the hard way that breaking the law does not pay and that repeat offenders will face stiffer penalties."

Regulators said they had increased a fine on Arkema France -- owned by Elf Aquitaine -- by 90 percent because it has been found guilty of joining three other cartels before. However, it also granted a small reduction to Arkema, Baerlocher and Ciba for sharing information with officials.

Swiss consultancy AC Treuhand was also fined euro348,000 for aiding the cartel and hosting monthly meetings at its Zurich offices -- held outside the European Union in an effort to evade EU antitrust officials who can seize documents from offices within the EU.

Kroes said the companies' "elaborate precautions to cover their tracks did not prevent the Commission from revealing the full extent of their determined efforts to rip off their customers."

HD        EU fines consultant for alleged cartel role

A consultancy company has, for the first time, been slapped with a significant fine for cartel involvement by Europe's competition regulators - even though its alleged role was in organising the market-rigging rather than participating directly.

According to the European Commission, Zurich-based AC Treuhand prepared the operational framework for cartels involving "heat stabilisers", which are used as additives in the plastics industry. It then monitored implementation of the illegal agreements by nine companies - including Holland's Akzo, France's
Elf-Aquitaine and Switzerland's Ciba.

TD
Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said on Wednesday that the company's Swiss premises were chosen for secret meetings of cartel participants as they were outside the EU and beyond the commission's jurisdiction. This made it harder for the watchdog to seize documents.

EU officials also claim that there was a special colour-coding system for documents - those which were red or pink had to remain in AC Treuhand's offices
Treuhand's fine of €174,000 ($260,000) is a small portion of the aggregate €173m penalty being imposed on
10 players for the cartels in tin stabilisers and esbo/esters, used to enhance PVC products, which allegedly
ran from 1987 to 2000.

The biggest single penalty is on Ciba, which must pay a combined €68.4m. The US's Chemtura blew the whistle to the regulators and so receives immunity.

But the Treuhand penalty marks the first significant fine for cartel consultancy services. Several years ago, the commission pursued a token fine of just €1,000 against the same Zurich company over its similar role in an organic peroxides cartel. After a lengthy appeal process, the European courts last year agreed that a business which facilitated an illegal cartel but was not directly involved in it could still be penalised.

However, AC Treuhand - which describes itself as a small company with four partners - hit out at the latest fine. "I'm very angry - we are a services company," said Martine Kalmar, adding that it would, again, be appealing. She said it had found it difficult to defend itself in the proceedings with Brussels. She stressed that none of the people working at the company had been involved with additive products.

BRUSSELS, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission issued fines totalling 173 million euros ($260 million) to 24 companies on Wednesday for belonging to a cartel that fixed prices for heat stabilisers.

The biggest fine was issued to Swiss group Ciba , which was told to pay a total of 68.4 million euros for coordinating the pricing of two kinds of heat stabiliser -- chemicals which are involved in making PVC and packaging products heat resistant and more rigid.

Dutch group Akzo was fined a total of 40.6 million euros, France's Elf Aquitaine was ordered to pay 28.6 million and British-U.S. group Elementis 32.5 million. An Austrian firm, Chemson, was fined 3.8 million.

"The companies' elaborate precautions to cover their tracks did not prevent the Commission from revealing the full extent of their determined efforts to rip off their customers," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"These companies must learn the hard way that breaking the law does not pay and that repeat offenders will face stiffer penalties."

U.S. corporation Chemtura was found to have participated in the cartel but had its fines cancelled because it brought the price-fixing issue to the Commission's attention.

Arkema , a firm owned by Elf Aquitaine, had its fines increased by 90 percent as it had taken part in previous such cartels, the Commission said.

BASF, the German company that owns Ciba, said it would appeal the fine, citing a statute of limitations. It said Ciba had sold the firm that engaged in the price-fixing 10 years ago.

Elementis also said it would appeal the fine, while AkzoNobel, owner of Akzo, said it was reviewing the decision and pointed out that it had two months to lodge a court appeal.

The Commission's decision is another sign that competition boss Kroes is determined to show she is a consumer champion and will root out corporate malpractice as she prepares to end her five-year term in office.

Her investigation into the companies' activities began in February 2003 after Chemtura lodged an application for immunity. The price-fixing began in 1987 for tin stabilisers and 1991 for what are known as ESBO stabilisers and continued until 2000.

"For both products, the companies fixed prices, shared customers, allocated markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information," Kroes said.

The main decisions for setting up both cartels were taken at the Zurich offices of a Swiss company, Treuhand, the Commission said. Treuhand was fined a total of 348,000 euros.

Heat stabilisers are added to PVC products to improve their thermal resistance and overall rigidity. They are used in packaging for food, in credit cards, bottles and coatings.

The European heat stabiliser market was worth about 121 million euros at the time of the infringements, according to the Commission.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday said it has fined 10 chemical companies a total of EUR173 million for fixing the prices of heat stabilizers in two separate cartels.

Heat stabilizers are chemicals used in plastic products to increase their heat resistance, rigidity and protect products from discoloration.

The commission found that between the years 1987 and 2000, 11 companies in total including Akzo Nobel (AKZA.AE), Baerlocher, Ciba now owned by BASF SE (BAS.XE), Elementis, Arkema France (AKE.FR) now part of Elf Aquitaine (AQ.FR), GEA, Chemson, Faci, Reagens and AC Treuhand, fixed prices, shared customers and allocated markets for the plastic chemicals.
U.S. Centura received immunity from fines for blowing the whistle on the cartels, the commission said.

The commission found evidence of two separate cartels: One for tin stabilizers running from 1987 to 2000 and the other involving Epoxidized soy bean oil, or ESBO, esters taking place during the years 1991 to
2000.

The combined market for the two chemicals used as heat stabilizers was worth some EUR121 million at the time of the infringement, the commission said.
BASF's Ciba faces the highest total fine at EUR68.4 million. A spokeswoman for the company said BASF
plans to appeal the Ciba share of the fine.

Akzo Nobel's faces the second highest combined fine at EUR40.6 million. The company declined to comment on the cartel decision.

The commission increase the fine on Arkema by 90% to total EUR28.6 million for the two cartels, due to previous participation in chemical cartels. The company wasn't immediately available for comment.

German Baerlocher's fine was reduced from over EUR6 million to EUR1 million due to the company's argument that its financial situation was such that it wouldn't be able to pay a full fine without great difficulties, the European commissioner for competition Neelie Kroes said.
It is unusual for the commission to agree to reduce fines based on arguments about financial difficulties.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Fines of €173 million for members of cartel on plastic  additives

Brussels, 11/11/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 11 November, the European Commission decided to impose total fines of €173,864 million on 24 companies from 10 different undertakings, which had divided up the market for heat stabilisers. The members of the cartel met regularly between 1987 and 2000 in the offices of the Swiss consultant AC Treuhand in Zurich, to conclude illegal agreements on this market.

TD
The following companies were members of the cartel: Akzo (Netherlands), Baerlocher (Germany), Ciba (Switzerland), Elementis (United Kingdom/USA), Elf Aquitaine (Arkema France) (France), GEA (Germany), Chemson (Austria), Faci (Italy), Reagens (Italy) and lastly AC Treuhand. All but the latter are active in production and sales of tin stabilisers (1987-2000) and ESBO/esters heat stabilisers (1991-2000). These are stabilisers which are added to PVC products to improve their heat resistance. They also increase the plasticity, rigidity and transparency of final PVC products and protect them from discoloration.

Three companies managed to get away without full fines. Although Chemtura Corporation also took part in the cartel, it was not fined because it revealed the existence of the cartels to the Commission. Additionally, the fines imposed on Arkema France, Baerlocher and Ciba were reduced due to their cooperation with the Commission's investigation. The fines on Arkema France were increased by 90%, as the company had previously taken part in similar cartels. It is worth noting that the company Akzo had also previously been
found guilty of participation in illegal cartels in 2004 (EUROPE 8845) and 2005 (EUROPE 8870), but as these infringements occurred later than those in the decision of 11 November, it cannot be deemed a repeat offence.

Private claims. European Trade Commissioner Neelie Kroes once again urged clients who may have suffered at the hands of the cartel to bring claims for damages and interest before their national jurisdictions. Claims of this kind are more viable for industrial products - in which the transactions, and the damages suffered, are very high - than for consumer products, where the modest amounts of money in question for individual consumers rarely merit a potentially costly legal procedure. The commissioner also pointed out that proposed legislation to facilitate these claims was being finalised by the Commission, and that her successor at the head of DG Competition would be responsible for presenting it to the European Parliament. A source close to the dossier explained that the legal basis of the text has been modified slightly, so that it is based more on the rules of the internal market. This means that a consultation procedure with the other Community institutions is required, rather than just a consultation, a major effect of which will be to increase the influence of the Parliament over the final text.

BRUSSELS—The European Commission fined 10 companies a total of €173 million ($259.1 million) for allegedly fixing the prices of heat stabilizers used in plastic products.

The commission found that between 1987 and 2000, 11 companies in the sector fixed prices, shared customers and allocated markets for the heat stabilizers—chemicals used in plastic products to increase their heat resistance and rigidity and protect products from discoloration. The companies include Akzo Nobel; Baerlocher; Ciba, now owned by BASF SE; Elementis; Arkema France, now part of Elf Aquitaine; GEA; Chemson; Faci; Reagens and AC Treuhand.

U.S. company Centura received immunity from fines for blowing the whistle on the cartels, the commission said Wednesday.
The commission said it found evidence of two separate cartels: one for tin stabilizers running from 1987 to
2000 and the other involving epoxidized soybean oil esters taking place from 1991 to 2000. The combined
market for the two chemicals used as heat stabilizers was valued at about €121 million at the time of the
infringement.

BASF's Ciba faces the highest fine at €68.4 million. A spokeswoman for the company said BASF plans to appeal the Ciba share of the fine.

Akzo Nobel has the second-highest combined fine at €40.6 million. Akzo said it will analyze the decision before deciding if it will file an appeal before the European Court of First Instance.

Elementis, which was fined €32.5 million, said it intends to appeal the cartel decision. The company said it believes the commission should be precluded from imposing any fine on the company.

The commission increased the fine on Arkema by 90% to total €28.6 million for the two cartels because the company previously participated in chemical cartels.

Baerlocher's fine, however, was reduced from more than €6 million to €1 million because the company argued that its financial situation was such that it wouldn't be able to pay a full fine without great difficulties, the European commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, said.
It is unusual for the commission to agree to reduce fines based on arguments about financial difficulties. Write to Peppi Kiviniemi at peppi.kiviniemi@dowjones.com

A consultancy company has, for the first time, been slapped with a significant fine for cartel involvement by Europe's competition regulators - even though its alleged role was in organising the market-rigging rather than participating directly.

TD
According to the European Commission, Zurich-based AC Treuhand prepared the operational framework for cartels involving "heat stabilisers", which are used as additives in the plastics industry. It then monitored implementation of the illegal agreements by nine companies - including Holland's Akzo, France's
Elf-Aquitaine and Switzerland's Ciba.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said yesterday that the company's Swiss premises were chosen for secret meetings of cartel participants as they were outside the EU and beyond the commission's jurisdiction. This made it harder for the watchdog to seize documents.

EU officials also claim that there was a special colour-coding system for documents - those which were red or pink had to remain in AC Treuhand's offices
Treuhand's fine of €174,000 ($260,000) is a small portion of the aggregate €173m penalty being imposed on
10 players for the cartels in tin stabilisers and esbo/esters, used to enhance PVC products, which allegedly
ran from 1987 to 2000.

The biggest single penalty is on Ciba, which must pay a combined €68.4m. The US's Chemtura blew the whistle to the regulators and so receives immunity.

But the Treuhand penalty marks the first significant fine for cartel consultancy services. Several years ago, the commission pursued a token fine of just €1,000 against the same Zurich company over its similar role in an organic peroxides cartel. After a lengthy appeal process, the European courts last year agreed that a business which facilitated an illegal cartel but was not directly involved in it could still be penalised.

However, AC Treuhand - which describes itself as a small company with four partners - hit out at the latest fine. "I'm very angry - we are a services company," said Martine Kalmar, adding that it would, again, be appealing. She said it had found it difficult to defend itself in the proceedings with Brussels. She stressed that none of the people working at the company had been involved with additive products.

THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday fined 24 companies, including London-listed Elementis, €173m for allegedly belonging to a cartel that fixed prices for heat stabilisers. The commission is demanding €14.3m from Elementis, and a further €18.2m jointly from on Elementis, Akcros Chemicals and other companies owned by Akzo Nobel. Fines for the US company Chemtura were cancelled, because it brought the issue to the EC's attention. Elementis said it intended to appeal against the penalty.

The commission found that between 1987 and 2000, 11 companies in the sector fixed prices, shared customers and allocated markets for the heat stabilizers -- chemicals used in plastic products to increase their heat resistance and rigidity and protect products from discoloration. The companies include Akzo Nobel; Baerlocher; Ciba, now owned by BASF SE; Elementis; Arkema France, now part of Elf Aquitaine; GEA; Chemson; Faci; Reagens and AC Treuhand.

U.S. company Centura received immunity from fines for blowing the whistle.
The commission said it found evidence of two separate cartels: one for tin stabilizers running from 1987 to
2000 and the other involving epoxidized soybean oil esters taking place from 1991 to 2000. The combined
market for the two chemicals used as heat stabilizers was valued at about 121 million euros at the time of
the infringement.
BASF's Ciba faces the highest fine at 68.4 million euros. The company said BASF plans to appeal the
Ciba share of the fine.

Akzo Nobel has the second-highest combined fine at 40.6 million euros. Akzo said it will analyze the decision before deciding if it will file an appeal before the European Court of First Instance.
Elementis, which was fined 32.5 million euros, said it intends to appeal the cartel decision.

Arkemafine was increased by 90% to 28.6 million euros because the company previously participated in chemical cartels.

Baerlocher's fine was reduced from more than 6 million euros to 1 million euros. The company successfully argued that its financial situation was such that it wouldn't be able to pay a full fine.

(Adds details)

AMSTERDAM, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV said on Thursday it would buy the powder coatings operations of U.S. firm Dow Chemical for an undisclosed sum as it seeks to further focus its operations.

Akzo Nobel, the world's biggest paint company, said the deal would provide synergies and improved operational efficiency.

"This is a strategic acquisition which will enable us to further penetrate key industrial coatings segments," said Leif Darner, Akzo Nobel's Performance Coatings director.
Dow purchased the powder coatings business earlier this year as part of its acquisition of Rohm & Haas. Akzo Nobel said the Rohm & Haas businesses it bought from Dow in the United States, Europe and China
have developed new technologies, especially for the automotive and architectural segments, and have
annual sales of several hundred million dollars.
The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2010, subject to regulatory approvals. The deal came one day after Akzo was fined 40.6 million euros by the European Commission, one of 24
companies fined a total of 173 million euros for taking part in a heat stabilisers cartel. [ID:nL7320506]

The European Commission imposed a total of €173.9 million fines on 24 companies from ten different plastics additives producers for price fixing and market sharing cartels. Particularly targeted by heavy fines are the Dutch-Swedish group AkzoNobel, Ciba of Switzerland and Arkema of France.

Between 1987 and 2000, explained the Commission, the companies fixed prices, shared customers, allocated markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information on tin stabilisers (1987-2000) and ESBO-esters heat stabilisers (1991-2000) in the European Economic Area (EEA). Heat stabilisers are added to PVC products in order to improve their thermal resistance. They also increase the plasticity, rigidity and transparency of final PVC products and protect them from discolouration.

TD
The companies agreed, between 1987 and 2000, to fix prices and share markets and customers for certain heat stabilisers added to PVC products in order to improve their resistance to heat or avoid discolouration.

The ten groups fined for violating the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81) are: Akzo, Baerlocher, Ciba, Elementis, Elf Aquitaine (Arkema France), GEA, Chemson, Faci, Reagens and AC Treuhand. Although Chemtura Corporation also participated, it was not fined because it revealed the existence of the cartels to the Commission.

In setting the fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved, the very serious nature of the infringement and the fact that the cartel covered the whole EEA. The Commission increased the fines for Arkema France (part of the Elf Aquitaine group at the time of the infringement) by 90% because it had already been fined by the Commission for previous cartels. With regard to the tin stabiliser cartel, the Commission also took into account the cooperation of Arkema France, Baerlocher and Ciba and reduced their fines by 30%, 20% and 15%, respectively. As regards the ESBO-ester cartel, the Commission also took into account the cooperation of Arkema France and Ciba and reduced their fines by 50% and 25%, respectively. Akzo requested leniency but did not meet the requirements for cooperation and so received no reduction in fine.

BASF has already announced that it will appeal the fine imposed on Ciba. Arkema, a former subsidiary of Total, reserves the possibility of appeal, according to a spokesperson. He specified, however, that Arkema would only pay 10% of the fine, the remainder being the responsibility of Total because the events occurred prior to the creation of Arkema and its launch on the stock exchange in 2006.

Shell sets up JV with Qatar Petroleum

Anglo-Dutch major Shell and state-run Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) have agreed to form a new joint venture (JV), QPI and Shell Petrochemicals Singapore. The new JV will own 50% of cracker operator The Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore and 30% of downstream polymer maker The Polyolefins Company (Singapore). Shell has agreed to sell its entire stakes in the two companies to the new JV, officials said. "This is one of the first significant investments of QPI. QPI is evaluating many opportunities in Asia Pacific. Singapore is a major energy hub," said Nasser al-Jaidah, CEO of QPI. The transaction will be completed by the end of this year, officials from the companies said.

Shell-QPI venture driven by feedstock edge

Anglo-Dutch major Shell's agreement to set up a new partnership with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) from its existing petrochemical assets in Singapore has been driven by the search for a feedstock edge, an official with Shell Chemicals said last Wednesday. "One of the critical success factors of any petrochemicals facility, whether it is in the Middle East or here in Singapore, is access to competitive feedstock," said Ben van Beurden, executive vice president of Shell Chemicals. "I'm hopeful that condensates and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) would flow from Qatar to Singapore as a result of [Qatar Petroleum] taking an investment in these joint ventures," said van Beurden. The shareholdings of Sumitomo Chemical in both of cracker operator The Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore and polymer maker The Polyolefins Company (Singapore) remain unaffected by the deal.
polymers distributor due for 2010 launch

Allandis, a new pan-European polymer distributor, is planned to be launched in the first quarter of 2010, its creator said last week. Financing is in place and a series of four or five acquisitions over the next 18 months should create a major player in European polymer distribution, said Peter Fields, formerly chief operating officer at European distributor Azelis. Fields told ICIS he aims for sales of €300-400m ($450-600m) within two or three years. Allandis may purchase Azelis Plastics, the polymers arm of Azelis, which is conducting a strategic review of its organization. Azelis president and deputy chairman Hans Udo Wenzel said the review should be completed by the end of the year.
Bidders eye up assets of bankrupt Chemtura

Potential buyers of Chemtura's assets have retained attorneys to help them prepare bids, according to a court document filed last week. New York City-based law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius disclosed that it was representing two potential buyers of certain of Chemtura's assets, in a letter to the US bankruptcy court of the southern district of New York. The attorneys will provide services, including "preparing and submitting initial
bid proposals," according to the letter. The potential buyers and targeted assets were not identified. Morgan, Lewis and Bockius also represents Chemtura in other legal matters. Chemtura filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 18 March and aims to emerge from the process in March 2010.

A group representing holders of about 13% of the shares of the bankrupt US producer Chemtura is aiming to form an official equity committee by the end of November, a cofounder said last week. In a typical bankruptcy, common shareholders are wiped out, while debt holders tend to recover value. However, in rare cases, there is residual value in the stock. "There is no reason to wipe out the current stockholders. We've asked the bankruptcy court to form an official equity committee representing Chemtura shareholders," said Jon Jacks, founding member of the Chemtura Stock Alliance, which represents shareholders with around 33m shares, or
13% of the total shares outstanding. "We could see a ruling by month's end," he added in an interview with
ICIS.
companies fined €173m for cartel

The European Commission has imposed a total fine of €173m ($258m) on 10 leading chemical companies, including Akzo, Ciba and Arkema France for their part in a plastics additives cartel. Ciba, which is now part of BASF, was fined €68.4m; Akzo, now AkzoNobel, was ordered to pay €40.6m; Elementis was fined €32.57m; and Elf Aquitaine, which at the time owned Arkema France, was fined €28.6m; while Baerlocher, Reagens, GEA and Faci were fined smaller amounts. Chemtura escaped without financial punishment because it revealed the existence of the cartel to the Commission. The Commission said that between 1987 and 2000, the companies fixed prices, shared customers, allocated markets and exchanged sensitive commercial information for tin and epoxidized soybean oil/esters heat stabilizers.
AkzoNobel to buy Dow's powder coatings

AkzoNobel has signed an agreement to buy US-based Dow Chemical's powder coating activities, the Dutch coatings, paints and specialty chemical company said. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Dow bought the powder coatings activities earlier this year as part of its acquisition of Rohm and Haas. "This business achieves global sales of several hundred million dollars and employs around 700 people," the company added in a statement. Leif Darner, the AkzoNobel board member responsible for Performance Coatings, said: "This is a strategic acquisition that will enable us to further penetrate key industrial coatings segments."
LANXESS Q3 net profit falls by 59% to €23m

Germany specialty chemical group LANXESS has posted a 59% fall in its third-quarter (Q3) net profit year on year to €23m ($34m) on lower sales, which fell by 24% on the same period last year to €1.37bn. "Our self-help measures coupled with an improved economic climate, in particular in China, have supported us in delivering
a very respectable third quarter performance," said Axel Heitmann, LANXESS board of management chairman. The Performance Chemicals segment was the only division to see an improvement in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) before exceptionals - it rose by 3% year on year to €67m. LANXESS said the global economic environment remained challenging, despite seeing some recent improvements.
US economists, petchems warn of job losses

Private sector economists, refiners and petrochemical officials have warned Congress that pending climate control legislation will kill US jobs and growth, while doing nothing to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association (NPRA) said in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee that the two climate change bills pending in Congress "would have devastating impacts on American businesses across the economic spectrum, and specifically on domestic refining and petrochemical companies." The Senate Finance Committee was hearing testimony on the potential jobs impact of two major climate bills. One bill would cap US industrial and transportation emissions of carbon dioxide and mandate annual reductions to 83% below 2005 levels by 2050.
Vopak's Q3 operating profit up by 27.5%
Dutch logistics company Vopak has reported a 27.5% increase in its third-quarter (Q3) operating profit to
€104.3m ($155.7m) due to its cost management and increased available tank capacity. The company's Q3
occupancy rate fell by 1% to 93% year on year, while capacity had increased by 900,000m3 this year.
"Demand for our services in the oil segment remained strong," Vopak chairman John Broeders said. "The
chemicals [throughput] activities showed a light recovery. We consider it too early to conclude whether the
recovery of the chemicals market is sustainable or not."
Huntsman's bid for Tronox at the low end

Huntsman's $415m (€278m) bid for most of the pigment plants of bankrupt producer Tronox falls on the low end of similar deals, according to a banker. Huntsman made a stalking-horse bid for most of the titanium dioxide plants of Tronox. Huntsman's offer will establish a floor on bids during an auction scheduled for December 8. If no-one beats Huntsman, then it would win the auction. Huntsman's bid falls at the low end of similar merger and acquisition deals in the chemical industry, according to Stephen Floyd, a managing director of US investment bank Young & Partners. The companies made no immediate comment.
Eitzen Chemical seeks to raise $115m

Eitzen Chemical plans to raise $115m (€77m) to reduce debt through a private stock issue to its parent, Camillo Eitzen, the Eitzen Chemical CEO and a board member, the Norwegian company said. Oslo-based chemical shipper Eitzen will present the stock deal to its parent, at a general meeting on November 26.

Eitzen Chemical plans to raise $115m (€77m) to reduce debt through a private stock issue to its parent, Camillo Eitzen, the Eitzen Chemical CEO and a board member, the Norwegian company said. Oslo-based chemical shipper Eitzen will present the stock deal to its parent, at a general meeting on November 26.
ARPECHIM TO CUT 360 PETCHEM JOBS BY END OF YEAR

Refiner Arpechim is to cut 360 jobs at its petrochemical unit at Pitesti, Romania, by the end of 2009, a Romanian national trade union confederation says. "The people will be dismissed gradually, but all of them will finally receive redundancy payments," said trade union leader Marian Dumitru. Arpechim employs approximately 500 people at its Pitesti unit.
GERMAN STATE BACKS ETHYLENE PIPELINE RULING

A key legislative committee in Germany's Baden-Wurttemberg state has approved a law allowing expropriations, ensuring that an ethylene pipeline project will be completed against the resistance of some of the affected property owners. Construction of the 364km (226 mile) pipeline to connect BASF's petrochemicals hub in Ludwigshafen with chemical producers at sites in Munchsmunster, Gendorf and Burghausen, in southern Germany, is well underway, with start-up expected by next year.
US CEREPLAST FORESEES $10BN MARKET BY 2020

US bioplastics manufacturer Cereplast expects evolving consumer preferences and the Obama administration's sustainability initiatives to help drive annual sales of US bioplastics to $10bn (€6.7bn) by
2020. By comparison, 2007 US bioplastics sales were $1bn. "American consumers are pushing major manufacturers and retailers to make the switch to environmentally conscious solutions," said Cereplast CEO Frederic Scheer. "Many of the largest retailers have already made inroads with programs designed to adopt alternative packaging, including Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola."
BAYER STILL COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY - CEO

German chemicals and pharmaceuticals major Bayer confirmed its commitment to sustainability last week, highlighting its focus on health care, nutrition and climate protection. "For us, innovation is also the driver of sustainability," said Werner Wenning, chairman of the board, adding that it remained at the center of Bayer's corporate strategy. "We are making specific contributions to balance commercial success with the protection of the environment and the needs of society."
PTT CHEM STARTS UP NEW HDPE PLANT

Thailand's PTT Chemical was expected to start production at its new 250,000 tonne/year high density polyethylene (HDPE) plant at Mab Ta Phut on November 13. The new plant will be operated by fully owned subsidiary Bangkok Polyethylene. Meanwhile, capacity expansion at PTT Chemical's existing 250,000 tonne/year capacity HDPE plant on the same site is expected to be completed at the end of December. The capacity of the plant will be raised by 50,000 tonnes/year.
BIOFUEL SUCCESS NEEDS GM ATTITUDES TO CHANGE

More effort must be made to change negative public perceptions over the use of genetic engineering in the production of biofuels to speed up widespread commercial viability, global consultancy firm Accenture said last week. A new study has revealed how important genetic manipulation of crops and organisms is to biofuel production processes. "We didn't realize how prevalent [genetic engineering] was before," said Accenture senior executive Melissa Stark. However, strict EU legislation could hinder the development and widespread use of the technology in Europe, she added.
DIVERSITY OF CHEM FEEDSTOCKS PROTECTS LATAM

Page 49 of 55 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Latin America's growing diversity of chemical feedstocks can buffer the region against competition from Asia and the Middle East, a consultant said last week. Tecnon OrbiChem chairman Charles Fryer said oil, natural gas, ethanol and vegetable oil-based feedstocks can help Latin America's chemical industry thrive amid the rapid growth of petrochemical capacities in the Middle East and Asia. Speaking at the 29th annual Latin American Petrochemical Association (APLA) meeting, he said Middle East producers have a distinctive feedstock cost advantage, and have more of a global market vision than their Asian counterparts. The biggest threat to Latin America from the Middle East stems from ethylene capacity, which is expected to expand to
30m tonnes/year in four years from 19m tonnes/year in 2009, he said.
BRASKEM, IDESA REVEAL PE CAPACITY FOR MEXICO JV

Brazilian chemicals major Braskem and Mexico's IDESA have revealed that their proposed Ethylene XXI polyethylene (PE) complex in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, will include a 450,000 tonne/year HDPE plant plus smaller linear low density and low density units. At APLA (see above) Braskem vice president Roberto Ramos said the complex would have capacity to produce 350,000 tonnes/year of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and 200,000 tonnes/year of low density polyethylene (LDPE). "The project will probably be the most important petrochemicals project to be built in the Americas," he said. Braskem will control the joint venture PE complex. The ethane-based complex will comprise a 1m tonne/year ethylene plant and the three integrated polymerization units.
FREP CHINA BEGINS COMMERCIAL OPERATION

Fujian Refining & Petrochemical Company (FREP) has started commercial operation at China's first fully integrated refinery and petrochemicals project. The Fujian Integrated Refining & Ethylene Joint Venture plant expands the capacity of FREP's refinery to 12m tonnes/year from 4m tonnes/year. The upgraded refinery primarily processes sour Arabian crude. Newly constructed facilities include an 800,000 tonne/year ethylene steam cracker, an 800,000 tonne/year polyethylene (PE) unit, a 400,000 tonne/year polypropylene (PP) unit, and a 700,000 tonne/year paraxylene (PX) unit.
CHAVEZ RHETORIC HURTS COLOMBIA POLYMER TRADE
Recent comments by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez renewed trade tension with Colombia, risking
further damage to the closely tied polymer markets of both countries, said Latin American plastic suppliers last
week. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) producers and traders throughout South America were reporting
sharply lower polymer trade between Colombia and Venezuela during the third quarter. As early as September
8, Colombian PET producer Enka cited decreasing orders from Venezuela, despite tighter inventories there.
Sources at Enka said Venezuelan buyers have faced limited access to funds at the official exchange rate,
turning instead to secondary markets.
SHELL TO START UP CRACKER IN Q1 2010

Shell Chemicals is on track to start up its new 800,000 tonne/year naphtha cracker in the petrochemical hub of Jurong Island, Singapore, in the first quarter of next year. The global producer is also in the process of starting up a downstream 750,000 tonne/year monoethylene glycol (MEG) plant at the same site, said its executive
vice president, Ben van Beurden. Shell had recently completed the construction of an ethylene jetty, and received its first shipment of ethylene at its Shell Eastern Petrochemicals Complex project in Singapore. The jetty has been designed to load and discharge refrigerated ethylene to and from ethylene carriers.
MOODY'S UPGRADES POLYONE OUTLOOK

US ratings service Moody's has upgraded the outlook on US polymer materials firm PolyOne to positive, from stable, behind significant improvements in the operating income of the company's specialty and performance businesses. PolyOne posted a Q3 net income of $49.6m (€33.2m), which is up from a loss of $5.6m year over year, as the company reported better margins and lower sales costs. Moody's, which cited income improvements in the prior two quarters, noted that the improved performance came in spite of very weak economic conditions in the US and Europe, with volumes down by 15-20% or more in most of PolyOne's specialty and performance businesses.
PROJECT HOLD-UPS MAY MEAN PEAK IS MISSED

Delays to petrochemical projects in Latin America could result in producers missing the expected peak in the global petrochemicals demand cycle between 2012 and 2014, warned a consultant with US-based Nexant last

week. Raul Arias said most of the major new petrochemical projects in Latin America are expected to start up between 2013 and 2015. Many have already been delayed.
CORRECTION

The story "Party like it's 1989" in the November 9 issue suggested that Hoechst is part of DuPont. In fact, it is the three units of the old Lacufa paints and coatings combine bought by Hoechst that are now part of DuPont. We apologize for the error.

The European Commission has fined around 10 chemical groups a total of EUR 173.9 M for their participation in cartels for PVC stabilizers. The investigation examined activities in the European Union during the period
1987-2000. Akzo Nobel, Elementis, Chemtura, Baerlocher, Arkema (through Elf Aquitaine), Reagens and Ciba were fined for a cartel covering tin stabilizers. A second file covered price fixing for PVC heat stabilizers (epoxidized soyabean oil and esters) during 1991-2000. Akzo Nobel, Ciba, Elementis, Arkema, Faci,
Chemson and Chemtura were found to have participated in the arrangement. The European market was worth an estimated EUR 121 M at the time. A histogram gives a breakdown of fines levied against Ciba, Akzo Nobel, Elementis and Arkema. The US group Chemtura has their fined waived for exposing the cartel. Ciba and Arkema had their fines reduced for cooperating with the investigation.

TD
However, Arkema's fine had been increased by 90% as the group had already participated in cartels for polypropylene, PVC and hydrogen peroxide. BASF, which acquired Ciba, is to appeal against the ruling. Ciba has been fined EUR 68.4 M.

The European Commission imposed a total of €173.9 million fines on 24 companies from ten different plastics additives producers for price fixing and market sharing cartels. Particularly targeted by heavy fines are the Dutch-Swedish group AkzoNobel, Ciba of Switzerland and Arkema of France.

Between 1987 and 2000, explained the Commission, the companies fixed prices, shared customers, allocated markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information on tin stabilisers (1987-2000) and ESBO-esters heat stabilisers (1991-2000) in the European Economic Area (EEA). Heat stabilisers are added to PVC products in order to improve their thermal resistance. They also increase the plasticity, rigidity and transparency of final PVC products and protect them from discolouration.

TD
The companies agreed, between 1987 and 2000, to fix prices and share markets and customers for certain heat stabilisers added to PVC products in order to improve their resistance to heat or avoid discolouration.

The ten groups fined for violating the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81) are: Akzo, Baerlocher, Ciba, Elementis, Elf Aquitaine (Arkema France), GEA, Chemson, Faci, Reagens and AC Treuhand. Although Chemtura Corporation also participated, it was not fined because it revealed the existence of the cartels to the Commission.

In setting the fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved, the very serious nature of the infringement and the fact that the cartel covered the whole EEA. The Commission increased the fines for Arkema France (part of the Elf Aquitaine group at the time of the infringement) by 90% because it had already been fined by the Commission for previous cartels. With regard to the tin stabiliser cartel, the Commission also took into account the cooperation of Arkema France, Baerlocher and Ciba and reduced their fines by 30%, 20% and 15%, respectively. As regards the ESBO-ester cartel, the Commission also took into account the cooperation of Arkema France and Ciba and reduced their fines by 50% and 25%, respectively. Akzo requested leniency but did not meet the requirements for cooperation and so received no reduction in fine.

BASF has already announced that it will appeal the fine imposed on Ciba. Arkema, a former subsidiary of Total, reserves the possibility of appeal, according to a spokesperson. He specified, however, that Arkema would only pay 10% of the fine, the remainder being the responsibility of Total because the events occurred prior to the creation of Arkema and its launch on the stock exchange in 2006.
