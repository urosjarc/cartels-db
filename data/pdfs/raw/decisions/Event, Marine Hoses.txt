Tokyo (Platts)--28Jan2009/1030 pm EST/330 GMT

The European Union's regulatory body, the  European Commission, has fined Japanese tire manufacturer Bridgestone and four other companies a total of Eur131.5 million ($174 million) for forming a price cartel for marine hoses, the EC said late Wednesday.

TD
The EC accused the companies of carving up the  marine hose market among themselves by fixing prices, rigging bids and sharing sensitive commercial information from 1986 to 2007.
Bridgestone, British-German Dunlop Oil and  Marine/Continental, French-Swedish Trelleborg, Parker
ITR of Italy and the US, and Italy's Manuli were the companies  fined by the EC.
"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice," she added.
BRIDGESTONE  FINED EUR58.5 MILLION

Bridgestone said it was notified by the EC about the  fine of Eur58.5 million for its role in the  cartel. The company said it will take appropriate action after reviewing documents from the EC.
Bridgestone was given the most  fine for leading the  cartel. Japan's Yokohama Rubber escaped a  fine
under the EC's leniency program for whistleblowers. It was the one that exposed the  cartel.
Bridgestone said it would announce possible impact from the  fine on its earnings separately.

The company's earnings were already under pressure because of falling tire demand amid the current global recession. In December last year, the company downgraded its consolidated earnings forecast for January-December.

The company reduced its net profit forecast by 82% to Yen 12 billion. Its operating profit forecast was downgraded by 24% to 118 billion, and pretax profit prediction was slashed 45% to 64 billion. Its revenue forecast was reduced by 5% to 3.25 trillion.

Marine hoses are used to load crude oil onto tankers.

EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday fined Bridgestone, Dunlop and three other companies 131.5 million euros for running an illegal cartel in the market for  hoses used in loading crude oil on tankers.

The European Commission accused the companies of carving up the  marine hoses market among themselves by fixing prices, rigging bids and sharing sensitive commercial information from 1986 to 2007.

TD
The fines targetted Japanese group Bridgestone, British-German company Dunlop Oil and Marine/Continental, French-Swedish group Trelleborg, Parker ITR of Italy and the United States, and Italy's Manuli.
"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice," she added.
Japanese group Yokohama was spared a  fine despite its participation in the  cartel because it tipped off
EU regulators.
Meanwhile Bridgestone's  fine was raised 30 percent to 58.5 million  euros and Parker ITR's was also
lifted 30 percent to 25.6 million  euros for leading the  cartel while Manuli's fine was reduced to 4.9 million
euros for aiding regulators.

HD     EU fines Bridgestone for price-fixing

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union finedBridgestone Corp. of Japan  euro58.5 million ($77 million) Wednesday for its role in a cartel that fixed prices for  hoses to load and unload oil tankers.

Sweden's Trelleborg AB and Italy's Parker ITR must pay around  euro25 million each as a six-company investigation resulted in a total of  euro131 million in fines.

TD
EU Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes says that for over two decades "the  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries."

In May 2007, regulators raided companies in France, Italy and Britain -- where Bridgestone operates -- joining U.S. and Japanese officials in an investigation into a suspected global  cartel for the hoses.

"I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice," Kroes said.

The Commission said that  cartel members regularly met in  Europe, East Asia and the United States, carving up the global market to the extent that some companies referred to big regions as their "private markets."

While the fines of Bridgestone and Parker were increased by 30 percent because of their leadership role in the cartel, Yokohama Tires of Japan escaped a  euro14.4 million fine because it revealed the  cartel and cooperated in the probe.
The European market for such  hoses stands at about  euro32 million a year.

Trelleborg Chief Executive Peter Nilsson said in a statement that "clearly, competition violations are completely unacceptable, and we have in an open way assisted the authorities with their investigations. We have also taken significant internal actions to minimize the risk that this could happen again."

"We will provide information on further actions when the complete decision has been received and analyzed," it said.
The U.S. Justice Department said in May that conspirators sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
marine hose and related products used by major oil companies and the U.S. military.

It arrested eight executives from Britain, France, Italy and Japan and charged them with involvement in an alleged conspiracy to rig bids, fix prices and allocate markets for U.S. sales of  marine hose used to transport oil dating back to 1999.

Bridgestone, Japan's largest tire maker, has said it plans to withdraw from the hose business following an internal probe that found a unit made improper payments to secure sales.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined five companies producing maritime hoses a total of EUR131 million for participating in a  cartel.

The commission found the companies; Japan's Bridgestone (5108.TO), British Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Sweden's Trelleborg (TREL-B.SK), and Italian companies Parker ITR and Manuli, to have fixed prices and divided up global markets between the years 1986 and 2007 for  marine          hoses.

TD
Japan's Yokohama, which also participated in the  cartel, escaped a fine because it was the first one to come to the  commission with information on the group.

Marine hose is a flexible rubber hose used to transport oil between tankers and storage facilities and buoys.

Bridgestone and Parker ITR face the largest  fines, of EUR58.5 million and EUR25.6 million, respectively. Both  fines were increased by 30% because they were leading the  cartel, the commission said.
Trelleborg faces the third largest  fine of the group at EUR24.5 million.
"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The commission estimates the  European market for marine hoses was worth an average EUR32 million per annum between 2004 and 2006.

Brussels, Jan. 28 (Jiji Press)--The  European Commission said Wednesday it has imposed  fines totaling 131.51 million euros on Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and four other firms for allegedly forming a price-fixing cartel for marine hoses used for oil transportation.

Of the five firms, Bridgestone faced the largest fines of 58.5 million  euros. U.S.-Italian concern Parker ITR S.R.L. SpA was  fined 25.61 million euros. The fines on the two companies were increased by 30 pct because of their leading roles in the illegal cartel, said the executive organ of the European Union.

TD
The three other firms were Anglo-German firm Dunlop Oil &  Marine Ltd., Franco-Swedish concern
Trelleborg AB and Manuli of Italy.

Japan's Yokohama Rubber Co. also took part in the  cartel, but was exempted from  fines because it came forward with information about the  cartel.

The commission concluded that the five companies colluded to fix the prices of marine hoses, allocated bids and exchanged commercially sensitive information between 1986 and 2007. Marine hoses are used to transport crude oil from tankers to storage facilities.

"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," Neelie Kroes, EU commissioner for competition, said, stressing that the EU remains ready to impose heavy  fines on companies involved in serious malpractice.
Bridgestone said in a statement that it will take appropriate action after examining the EU's decision. The European Commission in May 2007 launched investigations into the  marine hose cartel case
jointly with Japan's Fair Trade  Commission and the U.S. Justice Department.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 28 -- The European Commission on Wednesday ordered Japan's top tire maker Bridgestone Corp. and four U.S. and European companies to pay a total of 131 million  euros in fines for forming a price  cartel to sell marine hoses used to transport oil.
Bridgestone was  fined 58.5 million euros.

TD
The five companies, which also include Parker ITR S.R.L. S.p.A. based in Italy and the United States and Sweden's Trelleborg AB, fixed prices of  marine hoses and exchanged sensitive information, including the names of customers, between 1986 and 2007, according to the executive arm of the European Union.

Although Yokohama Rubber Co. of Japan had participated in the  cartel, it could avoid a  fine as it revealed the price-fixing agreement to the EC.

EU Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement, ''For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries.''

''I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice,'' Kroes added.
Bridgestone issued a statement in Tokyo, saying it will ''take an appropriate action'' after studying the
EC's decision.
The cartel led the U.S. Justice Department to arrest company executives in May 2007.

In February 2008, Japan's Fair Trade  Commission ordered Bridgestone and the four foreign companies to terminate the  cartel.

IMF sees 2009 global growth hitting worst level since WWII

WASHINGTON - The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday it now projects that the global economy will expand by a meager 0.5 percent in 2009, the worst pace of growth since World War II, due to the fallout from the worldwide financial crisis.

The Washington-based lender also cut its outlooks for the growth of the U.S. and Japanese economies in 2009 to minus 1.6 percent and minus 2.6 percent, respectively.

ILO foresees up to 230 mil. jobless people in 2009

DAVOS, Switzerland - With the global financial crisis having triggered a serious slowdown in world economic growth, some 230 million people may be out of work worldwide in 2009, raising the global unemployment rate to 7.1 percent in one of the worst-case scenarios, the International Labor Organization said Wednesday.

The projection -- the first rise above 200 million in the number of jobless workers and the highest percentage under comparable data since 1991 -- spells a percentage rise of 1.1 points from an estimated 6.0 percent in 2008 and an increase of 40 million in the number of unemployed workers, the LIO said in an annual report.

FY 2008 TV station revenues likely to record steepest-ever fall
TOKYO - Operating revenues at terrestrial television stations are likely to shrink 5.0 percent in fiscal
2008 from the previous year to 2,237.6 billion yen, the sharpest-ever fall, on falling advertisement
revenues amid the economic slowdown, an industry body said Wednesday.

TV stations in the nation's three main metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya are thought to have marked an average 5.5 percent drop in their operating revenue, the National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan said.

Aceh reconstruction is unprecedented success story: World Bank

JAKARTA - As an agency established by the Indonesian government to rebuild tsunami-devastated Aceh is about to leave the province in less than three months, the World Bank on Wednesday called reconstruction efforts in the region an ''unprecedented success story.''

''It's easy to make a big picture of failure, but this is a success story, an unprecedented success story,'' World Bank Country Director Joachim von Amsberg told a panel discussion of the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents' Club.

(Adds companies' reaction)

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) -  European Union competition authorities  fined a group of marine hose producers led by Japan's Bridgestone Corp 131.5 million  euros ($173 million) on Wednesday, saying they had run a global  cartel.

TD
The European Commission said the firms -- including Sweden's Trelleborg, British-based Dunlop Oil and Marine Ltd, a unit of Germany's Continental Group AG; Parker ITR Srl and Italy's Manuli Rubber Industries SpA -- fixed prices and exchanged sensitive information between 1986 and 2007.

"I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.
Japan's Yokohama Rubber Co had revealed the  cartel and so avoided a fine under the
Commission's leniency programme for whistle-blowers.

The Commission, executive arm of the 27-country European Union, fined Bridgestone 58.5 million euros. The company said last year it would pull out of the marine hose market after U.S. investigators arrested a staff member during an inquiry into bid rigging and price fixing.

Parker ITR, based in Italy and the United States, is to pay 25.6 million  euros, Trelleborg 24.5 million, Dunlop Oil and Marine 18 million and Manuli 4.9 million.

Bridgestone and Trelleborg said they needed to study the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

"We will take appropriate actions after examining the full text of the decision which will be sent to us later. We will also separately announce the impact on our financial results," Bridgestone said in a statement.

Marine hose is a flexible rubber pipe used to transfer oil between tankers and storage facilities. The
Commission said the market was worth about 32 million  euros annually between 2004 and 2006.

The EU executive said officials from the companies concerned had met secretly to fix prices, allocate bids and markets and exchange sensitive information.

"These meetings took place in several locations in  Europe, East Asia and the U.S.  Cartel members referred to some markets as their 'private markets' and agreed upon a dozen or so pages of detailed
'cartel rules'," the statement said.

The Commission decides on fines taking into account sales of the companies involved, market share and the geographical scope of the cartel agreements.
It reduced Manuli's  fine by 30 percent because of the company's cooperation in the investigation.

Fines for Bridgestone and Parker were increased by 30 percent "because of their leadership of the
cartel".
Some staff of Trelleborg, Dunlop Oil and  Marine and Bridgestone have been arrested in the United
States, where  price fixing  is a crime. (Editing by Dale Hudson)

BRUSSELS, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has imposed fines of 131 million euros
on five marine hose producers for participating in a cartel, the commission announced Wednesday.

TD
Bridgestone, Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and Manuli were  fined for participating in a  cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices in the EU laws.

"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries. I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice," the  European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Yokohama, a Japanese rubber product producer, also participated in the cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission, the commission said in a statement.

Marine hoses are used to transport crude oil to and from ships for transportation from production sites. The cartel members fixed prices for  marine hoses, allocated bids and markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information, the statement added.

The fines for Bridgestone from Japan and Parker ITR of Italy were increased by 30 percent because of their leadership of the cartel. Bridgestone will have to pay 58.5 million  euros in total while Parker ITR pays 25.61 million euros.

The European Commission on Wednesday slapped a 131-million-euro (173-million-dollar) fine on five companies that contributed to higher petrol costs by fixing the price of  marine hoses used to transfer crude oil to and from ships, reported  dpa.
The five companies - Bridgestone, Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and
Manuli, were found guilty of operating a marine hoses cartel between 1986 and 2007.

"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Marine hoses are used to transport crude oil to and from ships for transportation from production sites. The European market for this product is worth about 32 million  euros per year.

The biggest  fines, 58.5 and 25.6 million  euros respectively, went to those deemed to be the worst offenders - Japan's Bridgestone and Parker ITR, a US-Italian company.

The fine imposed on Italy's Manuli was reduced by 30 per cent because of its cooperation with the investigation, while Japan's Yokohama was entirely spared from a 14.4-million-euro fine for spilling the beans on the cartel.

HD           Japan: Bridgestone cuts projection for net earnings  in 2008; expects 94.3% drop

After projecting a net income of ¥12bn (US$133.54m) for fiscal 2008, which ended on 31 December
2008, Bridgestone Corporation has amended this projection down to ¥7.5bn.
This translates into a decrease of 37.5% from the supplier's earlier figure, which it stated on 22
December 2008. Bridgestone's net income of ¥7.5bn, as it has suggested at present, is lower than the
company's earnings in fiscal 2007, of ¥131.63bn, by a massive 94.3%.

TD
Sales revenue and operating income for the year, however, continue to remain as per the company's earlier projection. Income from sales, the company says, will drop from ¥3.39tr in 2007 down to
¥3.25tr, while operating income is expected at ¥118bn, from ¥249.96bn recorded a year earlier.

This decline in net income from its earlier projection has been attributed to the company accruing the amount of a  fine imposed by the European Commission on the Bridgestone Group companies. The fine amount totals €58.5m (¥7.5bn), with respect to an alleged international  cartel for marine hoses.

Japanese tyremaker Bridgestone on Thursday slashed its net profit estimate for 2008 after being slapped with a big fine by EU antitrust authorities for participating in an illegal  cartel.

Bridgestone, which vies with France's Michelin to be the world's top tyremaker, now expects a 94 percent slump in net profit to 7.5 billion yen (83 million dollars), down from a previous estimate of 12 billion yen.

TD
Bridgestone is being  fined 58.5 million euros (77 million dollars) for its involvement in a  cartel in the market for hoses used in loading crude oil on tankers, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

The Japanese giant had already slashed its profit forecast by 82 percent in December as the global financial crisis batters the auto industry. Bridgestone is due to announce its final 2008 results on February
19.

Brussels, 28/01/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 28 January, the European Commission imposed a total of €131,510,000 fines on five groups - Bridgestone, Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and Manuli - for participating in a cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and

cartel to the Commission.

Marine hoses are used to load crude oil from and onto ships. From 1986 to 2007  cartel members fixed prices for marine hoses, allocated bids and markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information. The fines for Bridgestone and Parker ITR were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the cartel. Manuli was granted a 30% reduction of its  fine for its cooperation with the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes stated: “For 20 years, this cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries”.

TD
The European market for this product was worth on average €32 million per annum between 2004 and
2006. Bridgestone, Yokohama, Dunlop Oil &  Marine, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and Manuli regularly met to
fix prices and exchange sensitive market information. These meetings took place in several locations in
Europe, East Asia and the US.  Cartel members referred to some markets as

their "private markets" and agreed upon a dozen or so pages of detailed "cartel rules" to limit their conduct on the market.

In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the  cartel agreements. Bridgestone's and Parker ITR's fines (€58.5 million and €25.610 respectively) were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the cartel. Yokohama was the first company to come forward with information about the  cartel under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice and therefore received full immunity from  fines. The cooperation of Manuli with the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme was also rewarded and Manuli was granted a 30% reduction in its fine (€4.9 million). Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental received a  fine of €18 million and Trelleborg a  fine of €24.5 million. (O.L./transl.rh)

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Bridgestone Corp. (5108.TO) said Thursday that it slashed its net profit estimate for 2008 due to an extraordinary loss related to an illegal  cartel.

The tire maker, which is competes with Cie Generale des Etablissements Michelin SCA, now estimates a net profit of Y7.50 billion for last year, lower than its previous estimate of a net profit of Y12.00 billion.
The company left unchanged its estimates for sales and operating profit for 2008.

Bridgestone will book a special loss of EUR58.5 million that EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday fined the Japanese tire maker for running an illegal  cartel in the market for  hoses used in loading crude oil on tankers.

The European Commission Wednesday accused Bridgestone, Dunlop and three other companies of carving up the marine hoses market among themselves by fixing prices.

HD      ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE : MARINE HOSE PRODUCERS HIT WITH BIG FINE FOR CARTEL ARRANGEMENT

Five groups of producers of  marine hoses used to transport crude oil to and from ships have been taking part in an arrangement in which they fixed prices, divided up markets between themselves and
exchanged commercial information for over twenty years (1986 to 2007).

This is a serious infringement of European Union rules banning such practices (Article 81 of the EC Treaty) and the European Commission decided, on 28 January, to impose a total of €131,510,000 of fines on the following companies: Bridgestone (€58.5 million), Dunlop Oil &  Marine/Continental (€18 million), Trelleborg (€24.5 million), Parker ITR (€25.6 million) and Manuli (€4.9 million).

TD
Yokohama also took part in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. The fines for Bridgestone and Parker ITR were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the cartel. Manuli was granted a 30% reduction in its  fine for cooperating with the investigation, under the  Commission's leniency programme.

The Commission's investigation was prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Yokohama under the 2006 leniency notice. The  Commission carried out surprise inspections in coordination with several other competent authorities in May 2007.
For the first time, the  Commission also inspected a private home, as it can under Council Regulation No
1/2003.

The average value of the products at issue on the  European market between 2004 and 2006 was €32 million per annum. The companies that were targeted met at regular intervals in various places in  Europe, East Asia and the US.

Sweden-based rubber products firm Trelleborg has said costs for competition law violations are now expected to grow by SEK 400mn (EUR 37.85mn USD 49.79mn), in addition to the SEK 100mn already earmarked, following the European Commission decision that its French subsidiary had taken part in illegal price cooperation on the market for marine oil hoses. Trelleborg has been  fined SEK 258mn for its part in the  cartel. The company has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision. The higher costs also include an ongoing  cartel investigation in the US.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined five producers of hoses used to load and unload oil tankers a total of 131 million euros ($172.8 million) for participating in a cartel.
"For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries," Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The commission found that the five companies -- Japan's Bridgestone Corp.; U.K.-based Dunlop Oil
&Marine, a unit of Germany's Continental Group AG; Sweden's Trelleborg AB; and Italy's Parker ITR
Srl and Manuli Rubber Industries SpA -- fixed prices and divided up global markets for  marine hoses
between 1986 and 2007.  Marine hoses are used to transport oil between tankers and storage
facilities.

Japan's Yokohama Tire Corp., which also participated in the  cartel, escaped a fine because it was the first one to come to the  commission with information on the group.

The commission, the European Union's executive arm, estimates the  European market for marine hoses was worth an average of 32 million  euros a year between 2004 and 2006.

Bridgestone said last year it would withdraw from the  marine-hose market following an internal probe that found improper payments.

Trelleborg Group Chief Executive Peter Nilsson said, "Clearly, competition violations are completely unacceptable." He added, "We have also taken significant internal actions to minimize the risk that this could happen again."
Dunlop, Parker ITR and Manuli couldn't be reached for comment.

Chubb saw fewer D&O claims in fourth quarter vs. third

(6:13 PM ET) SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Chubb Corp.(CB, US)Chief Operating Officer John Degnan said late Thursday that the insurer saw fewer new directors and officers claims in the fourth quarter than it received in the third quarter. He also said Chubb probably won't see big claims from the alleged Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. Chubb is a leading provider of D&O insurance. This type of coverage protects executives and members of a company's board from liability in the event of a lawsuit against them claiming wrongdoing in connection with their firm's business. The financial crisis has increased concern about a spike in securities class-action lawsuits, which could trigger more D&O claims. However, Degnan said on Thursday that such suits "trailed off dramatically" during the second half of 2008, despite a dramatic slump in equity markets. Chubb shares climbed 2.8% to $44 during after-hours trading on Thursday.
KLA-Tencor swings to quarterly loss

Second-quarter results include a $435 million charge related to the aggregate impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. On an adjusted basis, the company would have recorded a loss of 12 cents a share. Revenue decreased to $396.6 million from $635.8 million a year earlier, the chip equipment maker said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had forecast a loss of 7 cents a share on revenue of $393.6 million.
CA fourth-quarter net income rises 29%
(4:32 PM ET) SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- CA Inc.(CA, US)late Thursday reported its
third-quarter net income rose to $213 million from $163 million in the same quarter last year. On a
per-share basis, the company's earnings rose 29% to 40 cents from 31 cents. Excluding certain items,
CA would have earned 43 cents a share. Revenue decreased to $1.04 billion from $1.1 billion a year
earlier, said the business management software provider. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast
earnings of 37 cents a share on revenue of $1.07 billion.

$569 million, or $1.58 a share, from $620 million, or $1.60 a share, a year ago, Chubb reported. The
insurer was expected to make $1.52 a share, according to 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, down 4%.
Juniper posts gains, but falls shy of estimates
(4:14 PM ET) SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Network equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. said
Thursday its fourth-quarter net income rose to $132.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from $122.9 million,

(2:49 AM ET) HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Nintendo Co.(JP:7974, jp)(NTODY, US)Thursday said net incomkke for the nine months through Dec. 31 fell 18%, as brisk sales of its hit Wii video game console could not overcome the general slowdown in consumer spending and the effects of the stronger yen, which erodes the value of repatriated earnings from overseas. Nintendo, which didn't release a break down of its quarterly earnings, said net income for the three quarters fell to 212.52 billion yen ($2.36 billion) from 258.93 billion yen a year earlier. Nintendo cut its outlook for the fiscal year ending March 31 to 230 billion yen from its October forecast of 345 billion yen, a 36% reduction. Revenue for the
nine-month period climbed 17% to 1.536 trillion yen from 1.316 trillion yen a year earlier.

(2:25 AM ET) LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Legal &General(UK:LGEN, uk)said Thursday that worldwide new business rose 3% to 1.49 billion pounds during 2008, with U.K. new business also growing 3% to
1.37 billion pounds. The group said bulk purchase annuity sales jumped 73% to 194 million pounds, reflecting a "step change in demand," but unit-linked bond sales dropped 48% to 131 million pounds, in line with recent trends following a change to capital gains tax.
Xstrata plans $5.9 bln rights issue, profit drops 35%

(2:18 AM ET) LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.K.-listed miner Xstrata(UK:XTA, uk)said Thursday that it plans to raise 4.1 billion pounds ($5.9 billion) through a rights issue in order to repay debt. The firm said it also plans to acquire the Prodeco thermal coal assets from Glencore for $2 billion. Xstrata said the rights issue will be at a price of 2.10 pounds a share, or a roughly 66% discount to the closing price on Jan. 28. For 2008 the miner reported a net profit of $3.6 billion, down 35% from $5.54 billion a year earlier. Revenue fell 2% to $27.95 billion from $28.54 billion.
Toshiba forecasts $3.1 billion net loss for fiscal year

(1:40 AM ET) HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Toshiba Corp.(JP:6502, jp)(TOSBF, US)said Thursday it expects a group net loss of 280 billion yen ($3.1 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 31, its first loss in seven years, because of falling prices and slumping demand in its semiconductor and LCD business. A year earlier, Toshiba posted a net profit of 127.4 billion yen. For the October to December period Toshiba reported a net loss of 121.1 billion yen, compared to 80.5 billion yen a year earlier.

Page 41 of 70 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(1:31 AM ET) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Sony Corp.(SNE, US)(JP:6758, jp)said Thursday its fiscal third-quarter profit totaled 10.4 billion yen ($114 million), or about 10 yen a share, from 200 billion yen,
or 190 yen a share, in the same quarter a year before. The diversified Japanese electronics giant posted an operating loss for the quarter, ended Dec. 31, of 18 billion yen, compared to an operating profit of
236 billion yen in the year-earlier period. It attributed the loss partly to the appreciation of the Japanese currency against the dollar and  euro, as well as to a "deterioration in results at equity affiliates including Sony Ericsson" and losses in its financial services unit due to falls in the Japanese stock market. Revenue for the quarter was 2.15 trillion yen, compared to 2.86 trillion yen in the year-ago period. Sony also affirmed its outlook for a 150 billion yen loss for the fiscal year ending in March.
Bridgestone cuts outlook over  European fine

(12:11 AM ET) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp.(JP:5108, jp)(BRDC.Y, US)said Thursday it is cutting its profit estimate for 2008 after being slapped with a big  fine by European Union antitrust authorities for participating in an illegal  cartel, Agence France-Presse reported. Bridgestone, which vies with France's Michelin to be the world's top tire producer, now expects a 94% slump in net profit to 7.5 billion yen ($83 million), down from a previous estimate of 12 billion yen, the report said. Bridgestone is being  fined 58.5 million euros ($77 million) for its involvement in a  cartel in the market for  hoses used in loading crude oil on tankers, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

HD      Massive Cartel Fines For The Upstream Oil Sector

Yesterday, the European Commission announced that it has imposed  fines totalling over €131 million on five companies involved in the marine hoses cartel, which operated worldwide between 1986 and
2007. The  cartel members, Bridgestone, Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and Manuli, fixed prices for  marine hoses, allocated bids and markets and exchanged commercially sensitive information, all contrary to Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome. Regular  cartel meetings took place in several locations in Europe, East Asia and the US.  Cartel members referred to some markets as their "private markets" and agreed upon a dozen or so pages of detailed "cartel rules" to limit their conduct on the market.

TD
We have been following the story of the  marine hoses cartel since 2007, when we reported on the arrest of participants at the OTC in Houston (see UK execs arrested in US for involvement in alleged international marine hose cartel). The arrests followed dawn raids by the competition authorities of the US, EU and UK. In June 2008 we reported on the men's conviction (see A wake up call for the oil
industry) for the  cartel offence – the first such convictions in the UK. Since we last reported the men convicted have had their sentences cut on appeal to between 20 and 30 months.
The cartel came to light (as is often the case) because another one of the members, Yokohama, chose
to take advantage of the  Commission's leniency programme and become a "whistleblower". Companies
which reveal the existence of cartels to the competition authorities can under certain conditions obtain
immunity from  fines, as Yokohama did in this case. Manuli could not receive full immunity as it was not
the first to report the cartel but it was granted a 30% reduction of its  fine for its co-operation with the
investigation under the Commission's leniency programme.

On the other hand, the fines for Bridgestone and Parker ITR were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the cartel. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said "For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries. I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice."

When markets are suffering price falls, as is the case in some parts of the oil services sector at the moment, there can be a great temptation to seek to "stabilise" the market by the use of illegal cartels. Good compliance programmes can help to eradicate this behaviour or to mitigate  fines if it does occur.

WHEN markets are suffering price falls, as in some parts of the oil services sector, there can be a great temptation to use illegal cartels to “stabilise” the market, according to CMS Cameron McKenna, writes Sandra Speares.

The penalties of doing so were amply demonstrated last week when fines totalling more than €131m ($167.2m) were imposed on five companies involved in a marine hose cartel. The European                Commission imposed the fines on Bridgestone, Dunlop Oil & Marine/Continental, Trelleborg, Parker ITR and Manuli for participating in a  cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the European Union’s anti-trust legislation.

TD
Yokohama also participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it informed the  European               Commission of its existence.

Yokohama applied for immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice, after which the commission launched raids, in co-ordination with a number of other jurisdictions. For the first time, the commission inspected a private home under Article 21 of Council Regulation No 1.2003.

Bridgestone and Parker ITR’s  fines were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the  cartel, with Bridgestone’s  fine being the largest at €58.5m.
Manuli’s fine was reduced by 30% to €4.9m in recognition of its co-operation with the  commission
investigation.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “For 20 years, this  cartel added to the prices consumers paid for their oil deliveries. I will not tolerate illegal cartels and will continue to impose heavy  fines on those companies found guilty of this kind of serious malpractice.”

CMS Cameron McKenna writes in its Law Now newsletter that “good compliance programmes can help to eradicate this behaviour or to mitigate  fines if it does occur”.

EC fines hose makers

The European Commission has imposed $174.6 million in  fines on Bridgestone Corp., Dunlop Oil & Marine Ltd., Trelleborg A.B., Parker ITR S.R.L. and Manuli Rubber Industries S.p.A. for participating in a cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.

TD
Yokohama also participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the
cartel to the commission.

The fines for Bridgestone and Parker ITR were increased by 30 percent because of their alleged leadership of the  cartel. Manuli was granted a 30-percent reduction of its  fine for its cooperation with the investigation under the  commission’s leniency program.
Bridgestone was hit hardest, with a  fine of $77.6 million. Huntsman to trim staff
Huntsman Corp. said it aims to cut its work force by 9 percent to reduce costs across its divisions and functions, saving a projected $150 million, and plans to cut another $190 million from its capital expenditures in 2009.

Huntsman also said that it will close its titanium dioxide plant with capacity of 40,000 metric tons per year in Grimsby, England, in the first quarter, with the loss of about 200 jobs, saving annual costs of about $28 million.
Lanxess to cut workweek
Lanxess A.G. is reducing its workweek to 35 hours with corresponding wage decreases, beginning
March 12.

The company also will not pay bonuses to 5,000 German nonmanagerial employees in 2009. The board of management will take a 10-percent pay cut, while other managers will have varied salary adjustments, and their fixed salary reviews for 2009 will be postponed by at least six months.

Bridgestone Corporation has revised its financial projections for the fiscal year ended 31 December
2008. The company now expects a 33.3% increase in net profit, compared with its earlier forecast.

On 29 January Bridgestone cut its net income forecast for the year from ¥12bn (US$133.54m) to ¥7.5bn. The company attributed this to accruing the amount of a fine imposed by the European Commission,
of €58.5m, with regard to an alleged international  cartel for marine hoses. It has now revised its net income forecast up 33.3% from its earlier prediction, to ¥10bn. The supplier expects its operating income for the year to increase as well, by 11%, from ¥118bn to ¥131bn. According to Bridgestone, this increase in its net and operating results is primarily due to the effects of decreasing manufacturing costs and selling, general & administrative expenses.

TD
Sales revenue for the fiscal year, however, is expected to fall further below its 29 January forecast of
¥3.25tr, by 0.6% or ¥20bn, down to ¥3.23tr.

Bridgestone has announced that it has lifted its profit forecast for 2008, reports Dow Jones International News. The company said that although it expects to have posted a further decline in sales revenues last year to ¥3.23 trillion (US$35.3 billion) from ¥3.25 trillion, it has lifted its operating profit forecast from
¥118 billion to ¥131 billion. Bridgestone also said that it expects to have recorded an increase in net profit from ¥7.5 billion to ¥10 billion, thanks to a reduction in production costs and lower sales, general and administration (SG&A) expenditure.Significance: Although the company has seen some benefits from its cost-cutting programmes, these forecasts are still below the sales revenues of ¥3.39 trillion and net income of ¥131.63 billion achieved in 2007.

TD
The company slashed its profit forecast at the end of January after being hit with a 58.5-million-euro (US$75.9-million)  fine by the European Commission for its involvement in a  cartel for hoses used in the loading of crude oil onto tankers.

HD      ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE : MARINE HOSE PRODUCERS HIT WITH BIG FINE FOR CARTEL ARRANGEMENT

Five groups of producers of  marine hoses used to transport crude oil to and from ships have been taking part in an arrangement in which they fixed prices, divided up markets between themselves and
exchanged commercial information for over twenty years (1986 to 2007).

This is a serious infringement of European Union rules banning such practices (Article 81 of the EC Treaty) and the European Commission decided, on 28 January, to impose a total of €131,510,000 of fines on the following companies: Bridgestone (€58.5 million), Dunlop Oil &  Marine/Continental (€18 million), Trelleborg (€24.5 million), Parker ITR (€25.6 million) and Manuli (€4.9 million).

TD
Yokohama also took part in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. The fines for Bridgestone and Parker ITR were increased by 30% because of their leadership of the cartel. Manuli was granted a 30% reduction in its  fine for cooperating with the investigation, under the  Commission's leniency programme.

The Commission's investigation was prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Yokohama under the 2006 leniency notice. The  Commission carried out surprise inspections in coordination with several other competent authorities in May 2007.
For the first time, the  Commission also inspected a private home, as it can under Council Regulation No
1/2003.

The average value of the products at issue on the  European market between 2004 and 2006 was €32 million per annum. The companies that were targeted met at regular intervals in various places in  Europe, East Asia and the US.

HD     WORLD'S LEADING RUBBER COMPANIES RIGGED BIDS FOR OIL TANKER HOSES; ANTITRUST Six executives convicted, millions in penalties

It carries all the drama of a corporate thriller.

Millions of dollars at stake. Decades of an alleged conspiracy involving multinational companies using code names, a Svengali-like English consultant and two informants working with the feds to bring it all down.

TD
But this is not some "Michael Clayton" blockbuster. We're talking about  marine hoses.
Big ones.

The fallout has been severe: Six  marine hose executives convicted, two other operatives sent to prison, millions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties, federal multi-district litigation in Miami that won't die, and a federal criminal trial that ended in two acquittals.

"This is a  cartel that stretched from at least 1985 to the present. The  cartel met in Bangkok, Paris, London, Italy, Key Largo and Houston, and they came up with a very sophisticated way of rigging the bids for these marine hoses," said attorney Alexander Rundlet of Podhurst Orseck in Miami.

He and partner Robert Josefsberg are serving as plaintiff liaison counsel in the MDL case on behalf of marine hose buyers. Bayside Rubber in Mobile, Ala., has agreed to be a representative for a class of at least 60 companies. Buyers include Exxon, Shell, Chevron and the Defense Department.

"Competitors are supposed to compete on price, and when they conspire to fix prices, they harm our system of free enterprise by overcharging their customers," said plaintiff counsel Gregory P. Hansel with Preti Flaherty in Portland, Maine.

Marine hoses — 6 to 24 inches in diameter and about 40 feet long — were manufactured by Dunlop Oil
& Marine in England, Bridgestone and Yokohama Rubber Industries in Japan, Trelleborg Industrie in
France, and Parker ITR and Manuli Rubber in Italy, according to court documents.

The Justice Department and the Pentagon investigated allegations of bid rigging,  price fixing  and allocation controls among the six manufacturers, according to a May 2007 affidavit filed in the executives' criminal cases.
Federal agents swooped in on a meeting at a Houston hotel to arrest eight executives May 2, 2007. Two
Yokohama insiders worked with federal agencies in the probe.

The criminal cases against Manuli, Dunlop and the executives have become a source of pride for the Justice Department, which calls it unprecedented. The two corporations settled their cases, six executives were convicted, and two were cleared.

Thomas O. Barnett, then assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, issued a statement last April saying, "The world continues to become a riskier place for cartels. The risk of detection is increasing, safe havens from prosecution are diminishing, and penalties imposed are rising."

The Justice Department had no comment on the  marine hose investigation or why prosecutors made their case in South Florida. Manuli has a sales office in Plantation, and the  cartel met once in Key Largo to give the criminal case a geographic nexus.

Once the cartel was exposed, its customers started filing civil suits across the country. The lawsuits were assembled in multi-district litigation assigned more than a year ago to U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham in Miami. All defendants except Manuli have settled. Plaintiff attorneys filed an amended antitrust complaint solely against Manuli last week.

"Essentially, conspirators agree in advance who will submit the winning bid on a contract being let through the competitive bidding process," Thomas H. Errion, a Defense Department criminal investigator said in
the affidavit. "Conspirators, as they have here, may submit bids but take turns being the low bidder."

Federal investigators traced the conspiracy back to the late 1990s to make their case, saying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of  marine hose and related products were sold by the  cartel in that time.

Two Yokohama executives who cooperated with the federal government said the  cartel rigged bids and fixed prices for  marine hose sales around the world, including contracts for U.S. military bases in Turkey and Japan.

The mastermind was Peter Whittle, a former Dunlop executive who set off on his own with PW Consulting in England, according to the Yokohama executives.
It was through Whittle that the manufacturers received information about upcoming jobs, and it was
Whittle who designated the "lowest bidder," investigators said.
In e-mail reviewed by Errion, Whittle referred to the winner as the "champion." Dunlop was code-named B-1, Rundlet said.
"Whittle attempted to maintain market shares agreed to by the conspirators when designating which manufacturer would be champion," Errion wrote. Whittle got paid $300,000 a year to coordinate the  cartel and also charged the companies individually.
After the Houston raid, the world caved in on the  cartel's executives and its leader.

Dunlop officials Bryan Allison and David Brammer pleaded guilty in November 2008 to participating in the conspiracy and were sentenced in England to serve 24 and 20 months, respectively. Whittle pleaded guilty and is serving 2 years in prison.

Two Manuli and two Trelleborg executives ended up pleading guilty and serving time, as did a manager for Parker, who ended up getting house arrest.

Misao Hioki, a broker working for Bridgestone, was sentenced to two years in prison last December. Besides admitting his role in the  price-fixing scheme, he said he also violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing officials in Latin America and elsewhere.
Two companies were charged with violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, which carries possible corporate
fines of up to $100 million. Manuli pleaded guilty to conspiracy and paid a $2 million  fine in July.
Dunlop did the same in December, paying a $4.54 million penalty. And it just keeps coming.
The Justice Department investigation is still open. On Jan. 28,  European Union antitrust authorities  fined
the six companies $173 million. The Fair Trade  Commission of Japan also fined Bridgestone about
$26,000. The Tokyo conglomerate cried uncle, pulling out of the  marine hose market.

The six companies or their attorneys did not have anything new to say on the litigation. Bridgestone said a year ago that it discovered foreign bribes by Hioki and company employees through an internal investigation.

"Such acts betray the confidence that customers, shareholders and business counterparts have in our company. We solemnly apologize for all such acts," Bridgestone said in the statement.
The marine hose investigation has not been a complete victory.

A West Palm Beach jury acquitted two Manuli employees in a trial before U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley last November.

Page 52 of 70 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The acquittals are the only blemish on an otherwise successful attack in criminal and civil courts. Francesco Scaglia, Manuli's deputy manager, and Val M. Northcutt, a regional sales manager in the company's Plantation office, were arrested in the Houston roundup. Their attorneys said it was a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Whittle was one of the prosecution witnesses.

"The government's case was based on guilty people trying to get a lower sentence for themselves by blaming Francesco. Thank goodness we had a smart jury and a scholarly judge to see through it," said Scaglia's lead attorney, David Gerger of Gerger & Clarke in Houston.

Miami criminal defense attorney David O. Markus, Scaglia's local counsel, said the jury was out for only two hours. He claimed Whittle cut a sweetheart deal — making $7 million in the last decade and paying a fine of $100,000 plus his prison sentence.

"Very few antitrust cases go to trial," he said. "The government did the right thing going after the people who actually committed the crime. Where they messed up is they threw their net too wide, and they caught some innocent people, and that is the danger in these types of overarching cases."
Manuli is still standing in the MDL case.

"This has been a very busy case for sure," Hansel said. "We're still battling away with Manuli. I can't take anything for granted."

It carries all the drama of a corporate thriller.

Millions of dollars at stake. Decades of an alleged conspiracy involving multinational companies using code names, a Svengali-like English consultant and two informants working with the feds to bring it all down.

TD
But this is not some "Michael Clayton" blockbuster. We're talking about  marine hoses.
Big ones.

The fallout has been severe: Six  marine hose executives convicted, two other operatives sent to prison, millions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties, federal multi-district litigation in Miami that won't die, and a federal criminal trial that ended in two acquittals.

"This is a  cartel that stretched from at least 1985 to the present. The  cartel met in Bangkok, Paris, London, Italy, Key Largo and Houston, and they came up with a very sophisticated way of rigging the bids for these marine hoses," said attorney Alexander Rundlet of Podhurst Orseck in Miami.

HD    Cartels & Leniency  In The United Kingdom
BY    Mr Simon Holmes

This article first appeared in the second edition of The International Comparative Legal Guide to: Cartels & Leniency; published by Global Legal Group Ltd, London  www.iclg.co.uk
1 The Legislative Framework of the  Cartel Prohibition

TD
1.1 What is the legal basis and general nature of the  cartel prohibition e.g. is it civil and/or criminal?

The legal basis for the  cartel prohibition in the UK is section 2 of the Competition Act 1998 (the "Competition Act") and section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the "Enterprise Act"). In addition, Council Regulation 1/2003 allows the competition authorities and courts of EU Member States such as the UK to enforce the  cartel prohibition under article 81 of the EC treaty (see the EU chapter for further details).

The cartel prohibitions under the Competition Act and article 81 of the EC Treaty are civil/administrative in nature and exclusively relate to the conduct of companies. The parallel  cartel prohibition under the Enterprise Act is criminal and exclusively relates to the conduct of individuals.
1.2 What are the specific substantive provisions for the  cartel prohibition?

Section 2 of the Competition Act prohibits agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices which may affect trade within the UK and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK (the "Chapter I prohibition"). The Competition Act contains a non-exhaustive list of corporate conduct that is prohibited by the Chapter I prohibition and this includes, among others, agreements, decisions or practices which:
directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions; limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment; or share markets or sources of supply.
The Chapter I prohibition applies both to horizontal agreements between competitors as well as vertical agreements between, for example, a wholesaler and a retailer. There are certain limited exemptions that are described under question 1.5 below.

Under section 188 of the Enterprise Act an individual is guilty of a criminal offence if he dishonestly agrees with one or more other persons to make or implement, or to cause to be made or implemented, arrangements between at least two undertakings involving any of the following:

price fixing;

market sharing;
limiting supply or production; and bid-rigging.
The criminal cartel offence only applies to horizontal arrangements between companies which were brought about by the dishonest conduct of two or more individuals.

If the cartel arrangements have been made in the UK, it is irrelevant for both the Chapter I prohibition and the cartel offence whether the restrictive arrangements have actually been implemented in the UK.
1.3 Who enforces the  cartel prohibition?

In the UK both the Chapter I prohibition under the Competition Act and article 81 of the EC Treaty are enforced by the Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") as the principal competition authority in the UK. In addition, the following UK sectoral regulators have concurrent jurisdiction to investigate  cartel conduct in their sectors under the above provisions: OFCOM (communications); OFGEM (electricity and gas); OFREG NI (energy in Northern Ireland); OFWAT (water and sewerage); CAA (civil aviation); and ORR (railway services).

Investigations and prosecutions under the criminal  cartel offence under the Enterprise Act in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are conducted by the OFT or the Serious Fraud Office ("SFO"). Private prosecutions may only be brought with the consent of the OFT. In Scotland, prosecutions will be brought by the Lord Advocate through the offices of the International and Financial Crime Unit of the Crown Office.

1.4 What are the basic procedural steps between the opening of an investigation and the imposition of sanctions?

The OFT (or a regulator with concurrent jurisdiction) starts an investigation on the basis of one or more of the following three grounds: (i) its own market intelligence; (ii) following a complaint; or (iii) following a leniency application. Investigations started on the basis of (i) and/or (ii) are referred to as 'own initiative' cases. The OFT may also obtain evidence from leniency applicants. The OFT can exercise its formal powers of investigation (see Section 2 below) where there are 'reasonable grounds for suspecting' that civil or criminal cartel conduct has occurred. In  cartel cases, the OFT will usually conduct simultaneous
parallel unannounced inspections (or 'dawn raids') of relevant business and residential premises to obtain further incriminating evidence.

Once the OFT believes that it has sufficient evidence in its possession to prove the suspected  cartel conduct, it will issue a statement of objections to the alleged  cartel participants setting out the facts upon which it relies, its reasoned provisional conclusions and the action which it intends to take (for example, the imposition of  fines). The addressees of the statement of objections then have the opportunity to inspect the OFT's investigation file, to make written submissions and to attend an oral hearing to respond
to the allegations advanced in the statement of objections. If, after having had regard to the parties' written and oral submissions, the OFT concludes that it has sufficiently strong evidence to prove the alleged
cartel conduct it will issue an infringement decision to all parties concerned imposing  fines. Anon-confidential version of the decision will then be published on the OFT's website.

The OFT investigates all  cartel cases in accordance with the standards required for criminal investigations. This allows the OFT to convert a civil investigation into a criminal investigation. Alternatively, the OFT can decide to open a separate parallel criminal investigation (in which case a separate investigation team will be formed and strict disclosure rules will apply between the two investigation teams).

In the case of criminal investigations, the OFT or the SFO (or the Crown Office in Scotland) starts the investigation on the same basis as civil investigations. The OFT/SFO's formal investigatory powers are similar but more extensive in criminal investigations than in civil investigations (see Section 2 below). Where the OFT/SFO believes that it has sufficient evidence to bring a successful prosecution it will commence criminal proceedings. Proceedings can be brought in the magistrates' court or before a jury in the Crown Court.

A criminal investigation can be started by the OFT and then subsequently be transferred to the SFO for further investigation and/or prosecution. The SFO will, however, only prosecute  cartel cases, which amount to serious or complex fraud. This would, for example, exclude smaller bid-rigging cases.
1.5 Are there any sector-specific offences or exemptions?

The Competition Act excludes certain agreements from the Chapter I prohibition, for example agreements relating to the production or trade of agricultural products and agreements that are subject to competition scrutiny under other legislation such as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Broadcasting Act
1990 and the Communications Act 2003. Further, the Secretary of State may order that the Chapter I prohibition should not apply to an agreement or agreements of a particular description if there are exceptional and compelling public policy reasons to do so. This power has been used to exclude certain defence related agreements from the Chapter I prohibition.
There are currently no sector-specific exemptions for the  cartel offence under the Enterprise Act.

1.6 Is cartel conduct outside the UK covered by the prohibition?

The Chapter I prohibition applies to all restrictive agreements, decisions or practices which are or are intended to be, implemented in the UK. The criminal  cartel offence under the Enterprise Act only applies to agreements struck outside the UK if they are implemented in whole or in part in the UK. The above
'implementation' tests are generally accepted to amount to an 'effects' test.
2 Investigative Powers
2.1 Summary of general investigatory powers. Table of General Investigatory Powers


Please Note: * indicates that the investigatory measure requires the authorisation by a Court or another body independent of the competition authority
2.2 Specific or unusual features of the investigatory powers referred to in the summary table.

In civil investigations the OFT can only take originals where this is necessary to preserve the documents or where it is not reasonably practicable to take copies. Any originals must be returned within three months.
In criminal investigations, the OFT/SFO will always take possession of the original documents.
2.3 Are there general surveillance powers (e.g. bugging)?

The OFT has the power to authorise 'directed surveillance' (for example watching an office building from a public place to establish when the office opens and shuts) and to use 'covert human intelligence sources' (i.e. informants) in its  cartel investigations both under the Competition Act and the Enterprise Act.

In criminal cartel investigations the OFT is further granted the power of 'intrusive surveillance' (for example bugging a hotel room) and the related power of 'property interference' which allows the OFT, for example,
to place listening devices into private places. The SFO has the same powers.

2.4 Are there any other significant powers of investigation? In criminal  cartel offence investigations, the OFT/SFO also has the power to obtain access to communications data (for example, obtaining from the telecommunications provider, records of telephone numbers called by individuals under investigation).

This power is not available in civil  cartel investigations. The OFT has recently adopted an informants programme, under which financial rewards of up to £100,000 are available for significant 'inside information' about the existence of a  cartel, submitted by a party who has knowledge of, but is not
involved in, the  cartel. This is an entirely discretionary possibility available to the OFT. As a general rule, it is not envisaged that persons involved in a  cartel will be eligible for a financial reward, although they can apply for leniency. Nevertheless the OFT has left open the possibility of simultaneous application of leniency and financial rewards in cases where, for example, the person concerned was involved in a very indirect way in the  cartel.

2.5 Who will carry out searches of business and/or residential premises and will they wait for legal advisors to arrive?

When entering business or residential premises under a civil or criminal search warrant, the OFT can make use of outside (third party) investigators and forensic IT specialists to assist the OFT officers with their search. Any accompanying persons must be named on the warrant. In practice, having secured the premises, the OFT will usually wait for about 30 minutes for the arrival of legal advisors before commencing its search.
2.6 Is in-house legal advice protected by the rules of privilege?

Where the OFT investigates  cartel conduct under its own national investigatory powers, the UK rules of privilege apply and legal advice provided by both external and in-house counsel may (subject to certain restrictions) be protected. This applies to both investigations of the Chapter I prohibition and article 81 and also covers investigations where the OFT investigates  cartel conduct on behalf of another EU competition authority or the European Commission. Where the OFT merely assists the  European Commission with its investigation in the UK, and the Commission's EC investigatory powers are relied on, the EC rules of privilege apply and communications containing legal advice provided by inhouse counsel are not
protected.

2.7 Other material limitations of the investigatory powers to safeguard the rights of defence of companies and/or individuals under investigation.
Page 62 of 70 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The OFT is not entitled to search a person.

In civil investigations, the OFT may compel an undertaking to provide specified documents or specified information but cannot compel the provision of answers to requests for information which might involve an admission on its part of the existence of a competition law infringement, which is incumbent on the OFT to prove.

In criminal cartel investigations, where the OFT/SFO has the power to compel an individual to answer questions, statements made in response to mandatory interview questions may, as a general rule, not be used in evidence against that person on prosecution for the  cartel offence.

Part 9 of the Enterprise Act imposes limits on the disclosure of information relating to the affairs of any individual or to any particular business that is obtained in connection with the exercise of any function of the OFT under the Act (including both the OFT's civil and criminal powers of investigation).
2.8 Are there sanctions for the obstruction of investigations? If so, have these ever been used?

There are criminal sanctions (Sections 42 to 44 of the Competition Act) for persons who fail to comply with requirements to provide information, destroy documents or provide false of misleading information in civil cartel cases. If convicted of a criminal offence, a criminal can be punished with a  fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum of two years. Financial penalties for undertakings may take into account a failure to
co-operate with the OFT. Criminal sanctions for similar offences are contained in the Enterprise Act in relation to criminal  cartel offence investigations (please see question 3.2 below).
3 Sanctions on Companies and Individuals
3.1 What are the sanctions for companies?

Any agreement that breaches the Chapter I prohibition is void and unenforceable. In addition, the OFT may impose financial penalties on a company which has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement of the Chapter I prohibition (and/or article 81 of the EC Treaty) of up to 10 per cent of its worldwide turnover.

As a general rule, 'small agreements' between undertakings whose combined annual turnover does not exceed £20 million normally benefit from immunity from financial penalties. However, this safe harbour does not apply to  price-fixing agreements and breaches of article 81 of the EC Treaty.

Third parties adversely affected by  cartel conduct may take action in the courts to stop the conduct and/or seek damages for any loss suffered as a result of the  cartel conduct. See Section 8 for further details.
3.2 What are the sanctions for individuals?

Under the Enterprise Act 2002 it is possible to charge individuals with the  cartel offence for conduct committed since 20 June 2003. The  cartel offence is triable either in a magistrates' court (summary trial) or before a jury in the Crown Court (trial on indictment). Any individual found guilty of committing the criminal cartel offence before a magistrates' court may be imprisoned for up to six months and/or receive a  fine up to the statutory maximum (which is currently £5,000) and may be imprisoned for up to five years and/or receive an unlimited  fine if found guilty by a jury on indictment in the Crown Court. Under the normal
parole rule, an individual must usually serve at least one half of the sentence passed by the judge.

In addition, where a company has committed a breach of competition law, a director whose conduct in relation to that breach makes him unfit to be concerned with the management of any company going forward, can be disqualified from acting as a company director or shadow director for up to 15 years (under the provisions of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 as amended by the Enterprise Act).

In June 2008 three UK businessmen became the first individuals to be convicted under the new  cartel offence provisions, and were sentenced to between two and a half and three years imprisonment, and disqualified from acting as company directors for five to seven years, for bid-rigging conduct in the field of marine hoses. Two of the three individuals were also ordered to surrender assets under confiscation orders of in total £1 million. More recently in August 2008, four British Airways executives were charged with the  cartel offence, in relation to the British Airways/Virgin Atlantic Airways fuel surcharges for passenger flights  cartel.
3.3 What are the applicable limitation periods?
There is no limitation period for public enforcement action under the Chapter I prohibition of the
Competition Act or the criminal  cartel offence provisions under the Enterprise Act.

3.4 Can a company pay the legal costs and/or financial penalties imposed on a former or current employee?

The company can, if it so decides, indemnify the legal costs and/or financial penalties imposed on a former or current employee.
4 Leniency for Companies
4.1 Is there a leniency programme for companies? If so, please provide brief details.

The OFT operates a leniency policy for companies in respect of infringements of the Chapter I prohibition under the Competition Act and of article 81 of the EC Treaty. The policy is contained in Section 3 of the OFT's Penalty Guidance (the "OFT's guidance as to the appropriate amount of a penalty", December
2004). In parallel, the OFT also operates a 'no-action' policy offering immunity from prosecution for the cartel offence to cooperating individuals (the "OFT's  Cartel Offence Guidance", April 2003). Both policies are closely linked. The two formal leniency and noaction policy documents are supplemented by the OFT's draft final guidance note on the handling of leniency (for companies) and noaction (for individuals - see question 4.2 below) applications (the "Guidance Note for Leniency Applications"). This Guidance is due to be finalised by the end of 2008.The OFT guidance distinguishes four basic types of leniency: (a) Type A immunity; (b) Type B immunity; (c) Type B leniency; and (d) Type C leniency. A company, which has
'coerced' another company into participating in  cartel conduct, can only benefit from Type C leniency.
Type A immunity: First to come forward and no pre-existing investigation

To encourage companies to come forward, the OFT will grant total immunity from financial penalties for an infringement of article 81 and/or the Chapter I prohibition to a participant in  cartel activity who is the first to come forward where there is no pre-existing investigation and where the company satisfies the following requirements. The company must: (a) provide the OFT with all the information, documents and evidence available to it regarding the  cartel activity; (b) maintain continuous and complete co-operation throughout the investigation and until the conclusion of any action by the OFT arising as a result of the investigation; (c) refrain from further participation in the  cartel activity from the time of disclosure of the  cartel activity to the OFT (except as may be directed by the OFT); and (d) not have taken steps to coerce another undertaking to take part in the  cartel activity ("Type A immunity"). Where the above conditions are fulfilled, the OFT will also grant complete criminal immunity under the  cartel offence provisions of the Enterprise
Act to all cooperating former and current employees of the applicant.
Type B immunity: First to come forward but there is a preexisting investigation
Alternatively, if an undertaking is the first to report the  cartel conduct (possibly after an OFT inspection)
but does not qualify for Type A immunity because there is a pre-existing investigation, it can still qualify for
Type B immunity if it fulfils the other conditions of Type A immunity set out above and is able to 'add
significant value' to the OFT's investigation. In return for the company's cooperation and to reward the fact
that the company was the first to apply for leniency, the company is granted complete immunity from  fines
(as under Type A) and complete criminal immunity under the  cartel offence provisions of the Enterprise
Act to all cooperating former and current employees of the applicant. Type B immunity is, however, not
available if the OFT believes that it already has, or is in the course of gathering, sufficient evidence to bring
a successful prosecution against specified individuals. The fundamental difference between Type A and
Type B immunity is that the former is available as of right if the necessary conditions are met, whereas the
latter is discretionary. However, the OFT's Guidance Note for Leniency Applications notes that the grant of
Type B immunity (rather than Type B leniency) can be "expected to be the norm rather than the
exception".
Type B leniency: First to come forward but there is a preexisting investigation and no immunity is offered

Type B leniency refers to the situation where a company is the first company to report the  cartel conduct to the OFT (possibly after an OFT inspection) but does not qualify for Type A immunity because there is already a pre-existing investigation and the OFT exercises its discretion not to offer Type B immunity to the applicant. Under Type B leniency the OFT can offer a reduction in  fines of up to 100 per cent and
individual criminal immunity for the applicant's cooperating former and current employees. There is, however, no automatic criminal immunity for all cooperating employees under Type B leniency.
Type C leniency: Not first to come forward but can 'add value'

Should the OFT consider that leniency ought to be granted to more than one party in a case, Type C leniency is in principle available to a company which is not 'first in' but can 'add significant value' to the OFT's investigation. Accordingly, it is available to companies which are not the first to apply for leniency and/or which have coerced another undertaking into participating in the reported  cartel conduct. In return for the company's cooperation the OFT will grant a reduction of up to 50 per cent of the level of financial
Page 64 of 70 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
penalty imposed under the Competition Act (or the EC Treaty). Criminal immunity for individual former and current employees of the applicant must be agreed on an individual basis with the OFT under Type C leniency.
4.2 Is there a 'marker' system and, if so, what is required to obtain a marker?

The OFT does operate a 'marker' system. In order to secure a marker, an applicant should be able to identify a 'concrete basis for the suspicion' that  cartel conduct has occurred. Normally, the applicant would be expected to specify the nature and the emerging details of the suspected infringement and the evidence uncovered so far (that is, its form and substance). A discussion of the timing and process of perfecting the marker by the prompt provision by the applicant of relevant information will then follow.

In principle, markers are only granted on a named basis, i.e. the applicant must disclose its identity at the outset. However, in cases where the applicant wishes to make a parallel application for immunity to the European Commission, a no-names marker may be available from the OFT for a short period of time until the Commission application has been made.

To 'perfect' a marker for Type A immunity, i.e. to be granted conditional immunity, the applicant must be able to provide the OFT with all information available to it in relation to the  cartel activity and, as a minimum, that information must be such as to provide the OFT with a 'sufficient basis for taking forward a credible investigation'. In practice, this is a fairly low threshold and the OFT interprets this to mean that the information is sufficient to allow the OFT to exercise its formal powers of investigation, for example to carry out on-site inspections.

To 'perfect' a marker for Type B immunity or leniency or Type C leniency, the applicant must provide all information available to it in relation to the  cartel and that information must be such as to add 'significant value' to the OFT's investigation, i.e. the additional information provided must 'genuinely advance the OFT's investigation'.

4.3 Can applications be made orally (to minimise any subsequent disclosure risks in the context of civil damages follow-on litigation)?

Leniency applications can be made on an oral basis. However, all pre-existing written evidence of the cartel will need to be provided to the OFT and witnesses will also need to be made available for interview and to sign witness statements.
4.4 To what extent will a leniency application be treated confidentially and for how long?

The OFT will normally disclose the identity of leniency applicants in its statement of objections to the other parties of a case, i.e. the other addressees. Further, the OFT will reveal the identity of leniency applicants in its final decision, a copy of which will be made available on the OFT's website.
4.5 At what point does the 'continuous cooperation' requirement cease to apply?

The OFT requires leniency applicants to 'maintain continuous and complete co-operation throughout the investigation and until the conclusion of any action by the OFT arising as a result of the investigation'. The OFT considers this to extend to the conclusion of any appeals.
4.6 Is there a 'leniency plus' or 'penalty plus' policy?

The OFT does operate a leniency plus policy (points 3.16 and 3.17 of the OFT's guidance as to the appropriate amount of a penalty: "Additional reduction in financial penalties") but not a penalty plus policy.

Under the OFT's leniency plus policy, an applicant who already benefits from a reduction of  fine under leniency in relation to one case (case A) and then subsequently makes a distinct leniency application in relation to an unrelated matter and obtains immunity as a result (case B) will be offered a small additional reduction in its leniency discount in case A.
5 Whistle-blowing Procedures for Individuals

5.1 Are there procedures for individuals to report  cartel conduct independently of their employer? If so, please specify.

Individuals can benefit from criminal immunity for the  cartel offence as a result of their former or current employer's leniency application (see question 4.1) if they cooperate with the OFT's investigation. However, an individual can also report  cartel conduct directly to the OFT in return for a promise of immunity from prosecution for the  cartel offence and protection from director disqualification and asset recovery orders
i.e. the grant of a so-called 'no-action letter'. In order to be guaranteed a no-action letter, the individual must be the first individual or company to report the relevant  cartel conduct. Where an individual applies
Page 65 of 70 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
on his or her own account, the applicant's identity may remain secret (the applicant may be a 'secret source') if the safety of that individual would be in serious jeopardy or other adverse consequences would follow as a result of disclosure of his/her identity.

In cases where the individual within an undertaking reports the  cartel on his or her own account before the company does, the company will lose guaranteed corporate and individual immunity status, in circumstances where that company would otherwise have qualified for it. However, the OFT may still grant corporate and individual immunity in such circumstances, depending on what stage the OFT's investigation has reached and the value which it is likely to gain from any additional evidence the company can provide. This is therefore the only possible exception where immunity may still be available even though the applicant is not the first to report the  cartel conduct to the OFT (c.f. questions 4.1 above and 9.1 below).

6 Plea Bargaining Arrangements 6.1 Are there any early resolution, settlement or plea bargaining procedures (other than leniency)?

There are no formal plea bargaining procedures in the UK. The OFT has however proved willing to explore innovative case settlement options on a case-by-case basis in the past, recognising the benefits they may give rise to in civil  cartel cases under the Competition Act. In December 2007, the OFT reached 'early resolution agreements' with certain parties in its investigation into Dairy Pricing Initiatives. Similarly, in July
2008, the OFT settled with six of the parties in the Tobacco case. In each case, the settlement offer involved the admission of part or all of the alleged infringements in return for a lower  fine than would otherwise have been imposed.
7 Appeal Process
7.1 What is the appeal process?

'On the merits' appeals (i.e. both on points of fact and law) on both liability and the amount of any penalty against OFT decisions are heard by the Competition Appeal Tribunal ("CAT"). Cases are heard before a panel consisting of three members: either the President or a member of the panel of chairmen and two ordinary members. The members of the panel of chairmen are judges of the Chancery Division of the High Court and other senior lawyers. The ordinary members have expertise in law and/or relevant fields e.g. economics. The CAT's jurisdiction extends to the whole of the UK.
A further appeal lies from decisions of the CAT either on a point of law or in penalty cases as to the
amount of any penalty: to the Court of Appeal in relation to CAT proceedings in England and Wales, and in
relation to CAT proceedings in Scotland, to the Court of Session; and in relation to CAT proceedings in
Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. Such a further appeal may only be made with
the permission of the CAT or the relevant appellate court.
7.2 Does the appeal process allow for the cross-examination of witnesses?

The appeal process does allow for the cross-examination of witnesses. However, any cross-examination can be limited to any extent or in any manner the CAT deems appropriate.
8 Damages Actions
8.1 What are the procedures for civil damages actions for loss suffered as a result of  cartel conduct? Under section 47A of the Competition Act (amended by the Enterprise Act) any person who has suffered
loss or damage as a result of an infringement of either UK or  European Community competition law may
bring a claim for damages or for a sum of money before the CAT in respect of that loss or damage. In
general, claims may only be brought before the CAT when the OFT or sectoral regulator or the  European
Commission has made a decision establishing that one of the relevant prohibitions has been infringed,
and any appeal from such decision has been finally determined. In determining a claim for damages, the
CAT is bound by the competition authority's decision that established the infringement. Therefore, at least
in theory, the issue of liability should be settled, leaving the CAT to determine causation and quantum (i.e.
the amount of any loss and the resulting damages). These claims are referred to as 'follow-on actions'.

Alternatively, actions for damages suffered as a result of  cartel conduct can also be brought in the civil courts. Where there is a prior infringement decision by a relevant competition authority, the rules that apply to the CAT (see above) are similar in the civil courts, i.e. the courts are bound by findings of fact and
liability by, for example, the OFT and the CAT provided that the time for appeal against a decision has elapsed or the appeal has been determined.

Where there is no prior infringement decision, the claimant must commence an action for damages in the civil courts and must of course establish the infringement itself (i.e. liability) before being able to claim damages.

8.2 Do your procedural rules allow for class-action or representative claims?

Section 47B of the Competition Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act), creates a specific right for representative actions by 'specified bodies' on behalf of named consumers in follow-on cases. There is no equivalent right for representative claims for businesses. At present, the UK Consumers' Association, (Which?) is the only specified body. To date, the Consumers' Association has brought one damages action under this new provision against the sports retailer JJB, which arose from the OFT's Football Replica Kits price fixing  decision. (The  European Commission criticised the UK procedure in this case as it did not allow identifiable victims to join the representative action at a later stage of proceedings.) In addition, there are Group Litigation Orders ('GLOs') which are a generic multi-party civil procedural device, which in
theory allows representative claims to be made. However, in practice, it is very difficult to bring a representative claim on the basis of GLOs.
8.3 What are the applicable limitation periods?

The limitation period for bringing follow on claims in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal is two years from the determination of any appeals of the underlying infringement decision by the  European Commission or the OFT (as recently confirmed in BCL Old Co et al v BASF [2008] CAT 24).

In relation to stand alone actions, the limitation period is six years from when the cause of action accrued or where there is evidence of deliberate concealment (as is the case in most  cartel cases) from when the claimant could reasonably have known about the  cartel conduct.
8.4 What are the cost rules for civil damages follow-on claims in  cartel cases?

Rule 55 of the Competition Appeal Tribunal Rules 2003 places costs at the discretion of the court, taking into account the conduct of the parties in the proceedings and the requirements of justice.
8.5 Have there been any successful follow-on or stand alone civil damages claims for  cartel conduct? While there is clear evidence that claims for damages concerning  cartel conduct are increasing, few such
cases have actually reached the stage of trial and judgment. In the Crehan case, damages were awarded
by the Court of Appeal in 2004 but the decision was overturned by the House of Lords in 2006. To date,
there have been no cases in which damages have been awarded by UK courts to third parties for breach
of either the Chapter I prohibition or article 81 and ultimately upheld. That said a number of cases have
been settled out of court - some for substantial sums.

In November 2007, the OFT published a recommendations paper to the Government entitled "Private Actions in competition law cases: effective redress for consumers and business" to improve the effectiveness of redress for those harmed by competition law breaches. However, there has been no legislative action as a result so far.

There is currently a claim, which has been brought in the High Court in London on behalf of two freight companies against BA in relation to alleged  price fixing  conduct for air cargo services, even though the European Commission's investigation is yet to conclude. The claimants are seeking a declaration from the High Court's Chancery Division that BA participated in a freight  cartel as a result of which they caused loss. However, the claimants have also said that its case will be stayed pending the decision from the European Commission.
9 Miscellaneous

9.1 Provide brief details of significant recent or imminent statutory or other developments in the field of cartels and leniency.

As noted above, the OFT is currently finalising its Guidance Note on Leniency Applications and the OFT's revised guidance is expected to be published late in 2008.
9.2 Please mention any other issues of particular interest in the United Kingdom not covered by the above. None.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Rich Kramer, president of Goodyear’s North American Tire unit, said work on the new headquarters building in Akron has been delayed because of funding setbacks, but that the company is still committed to completing the building.

The $900 million, 600-acre project, originally scheduled to break ground last fall, grew out of a partnership among Goodyear, Industrial Realty Group of Los Angeles, the state of Ohio, the city of Akron, Summit County and the Summit County Port Authority.

While the public financing portion of the project is in place—including a $30 million state tax credit to Goodyear for the retention of 2,900 jobs—the current unwillingness of private lenders to finance major projects has left the development in limbo.

Debra Harrell, Industrial Realty’s senior vice president, said a new start date cannot be determined until the final leg of financing is secured.
Parker might appeal  fine

Parker Hannifin Corp. said it is evaluating all options, including an appeal, following a $33.4 million fine imposed by the European Commission over subsidiary Parker ITR’s participation in a  marine hose cartel.

Parker said there was no indication of the potential liability when Parker ITR was acquired in 2002 and said it is particularly disappointed over the portion of the  fine that applied to events before the acquisition.
The company also said it fully cooperated with the investigation. Pirelli recalls motorcycle tires
