European Commission condemns producers of stainless steel for illegal intent and gives fines.

BRUSSELS, Wednesday 18 July 1990 - The European Commission has condemned several Community and EFTA producers of  flat and cold laminated stainless steel products according to Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty.

TD
A cartel in this sector existed from 1986 to 1988 and had agreements on deliveries and prices.

The Commission took into account the particular situation of the  steel market during that period (production quotas existed for several products) and, consequently, it only gave modest fines to a certain number of companies, without penalising others.
EUROPE will give details tomorrow. (c) Agence EUROPE, Brussels 1990.

Efforts by British  Steel to expand its interests in continental Europe received a partial boost yesterday as it won agreement to take a 40 per cent stake in the Spanish  steel makers, Aristrain.

British  Steel, under fire for its decision to close the Ravenscraig hot strip mill in Scotland, with the loss of 770 jobs, had originally hoped to take control of the Spanish group but met local opposition. At one time it faced the prospect of a counter-bid, led by the state-owned  steel maker Ensidesa.

TD
British  Steel has joined forces with La Corporacion Banesto, the industrial conglomerate owned by the Spanish Banesto banking group, which will also take a 40 per cent stake in Aristrain if the deal is cleared by the Spanish Authorities. They will carry out an investigation into the proposed takeover lasting up to six months.
Under the agreement, Ensidesa has the option to take up to 10 per cent of the company from British
Steel and Banesto while the remaining 20 per cent of the shares will be held by present shareholders.

The deal is the second significant continental acquisition by British  Steel in recent weeks. In June it bought the Mannstaedt division of the West German group Klockner Werke for about #100 million.

Aristrain, which specialises in making  steel sections for the construction industry, had sales last year of about #400 million and an asset value of about #225 million.
Meanwhile, The European Commission fined British Steel and six other EC  steel producers
#300,000 for taking part in an illegal cartel for stainless steel products.
The commission said the fines were much lower than would be expected because at the time the
cartel operated Brussels had established a quota for other  steel products.

From Peter Guilford

British Steel and several other European  stainless steel producers have been fined by the  European commission for conspiring to rig the market and fix prices between 1986 and 1988.

TD
After a protracted enquiry that began when EC investigators raided the companies' headquarters, Brussels has found seven firms guilty of carving up the market in 17 European countries by setting permitted tonnages of  steel four times a year. They were also accused of operating a "pricing committee" to rig prices.

The cartel, covering all sizes and grades of cold rolled  stainless-steel flat products, was deemed to violate the European Coal and  Steel Community treaty, which regulates the EC  steel market.

British  Steel and Thyssen Edelstahlwerke, of West Germany, have each been fined #35,000. Ugine Aciers de Chatillon et Gueugnon, of France, Krupp Stahl, of Germany, and Terni Accial Speciali, of Italy, all face fines of #70,000. Belgium's ALZ has been fined #17,500. Spanish, Swedish and Finnish firms allegedly in the  cartel have been spared.

The case highlights the commission's difficulties in trying to enforce competition in some sectors of the steel market while continuing to permit quotas in others. The commission admitted that the fines were, as a result, deliberately set low.

The European Commission reduces fines, taking account of the particular circumstances of the  steel
market in the 1980S - a few questions.

European Commission sentenced the  INOX cartel established by producers of  flat stainless steel products for infringing competition rules of the ECSC Treaty (Art. 65). The understanding included a repartition of markets and the  fixing  of prices. Here are the main elements of the case. A. The content of the understanding. The self-limitation agreement for deliveries of cold-rolled stainless steel flat products was concluded between all the main Community producers of cold-rolled stainless steel flat products and Swedish and Finnish producers in May 1986.

TD
It was officially discontinued in October 1986 after the companies received an explanatory memorandum.

The main provisions of the agreement were the following : - it concerned all the qualities, sizes and grades of cold-rolled stainless steel flat products; - 17 national markets were involved, including those of all the EEC Member States and most EFTA States; - it included a system of delivery quotas  fixing  the market share for each company and determining, on the basis of quarterly forecasts, the quantities that could be sold by each of them during each quarter on each of the 17 national markets concerned. Fines were imposed on companies which exceeded their quotas; - it included the creation of a "pricing committee" which coordinated price increases. B. The Commission's assessment and the "particular circumstances". The agreement infringed Article 65(1) of the ECSC Treaty because it restricted production and allocated markets.

Moreover, by restricting production levels and the producers' freedom to develop their sales in the countries covered by the agreement, the latter contributed to maintain prices at a higher level than that which would have resulted from normal conditions of competition. The fines have been very substantially reduced compared with the amounts that should normally be assessed in case of a serious breach of competition rules, for several reasons : (a) the Commission had earlier established a quota scheme for other  steel products and the companies may have been under the impression that the normal application of
competition rules had been changed; (b) certain Commission officials had been informed about the agreement (but these officials were not those in charge of competition questions, to whom the agreement should have been notified). C. The fines decided by the Commission. No fine was imposed on the Spanish, Swedish and Finnish companies. As regards Acerinox, the Spanish company, interim measures were applicable (1986-1988) under the protocol of Spain's Act of Accession which fixed quantitative export limits managed by the Spanish government, which restricted Acerinox's capacity to export to the Community during the period during which the illegal agreement was in force. Exchanges of letters between the Community and Sweden and Finland resulted in restricting the freedom of the companies from the Nordic countries, Avesta and Outokumpu, to sell in the Community. Although they signed the multilateral agreement condemned by the Commission's decision, they had earlier, at their own initiative, concluded certain bilateral agreements, at the request of their national authorities and following the advice of the Commission.
The Commission imposed the following fines on the various companies:


ALZ, NV        Belgium     25,000 ECUs


Page 8 of 13 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ugine Aciers de


Chatillon et Guegon      France     100,000 ECUs
British
Steel plc   UK     50,000 ECUs
Krupp Stahl AG      FRG   100,000 ECUs
Ternie Acciai Speciali Spa    Italy 100,000 ECUs
Thyssen Edelstahlwerke AG     FRG    50,000 ECUs

D. The Commission's intentions for the future. Since the crisis in the iron and  steel sector is now over, as the Commission remarked in its document entitled "General  steel objectives 1995", and since the quota system ended 18 months ago, the  steel industry must operate in a free and competitive environment. Even though there were unusual elements in this case, which resulted in much lower fines than would have normally been the case, the Commission will not tolerate any infringement of the competition rules established by the ECSC Treaty.

Six flat-roll makers fined for running illegal  cartel

LONDON - The European Community's first investigation into illegal cartels in 13 years ended this week with fines against six major  flat-rolled stainless steel producers for a total of 425,000 European currency units ($533,970).

TD
The companies fined for operating an illegal  cartel were ALZ NV of Belgium, 25,000 ECUs ($31,410); Ugine Aciers de Chatillon et Guegnon of France, 100,000 ECUs ($125,640); Terni Acciai Speciali SpA of Italy, 100,000 ECUs ($125,640); British  Steel Plc of Britain, 50,000 ECUs ($62,820); and Krupp Stahl AG and Thyssen Edelstahlwerke AG of West Germany, 100,000 ECUs ($125,640) and 50,000 ECUs ($62,820), respectively.

The fines resulted from a probe that found that between May 1986 and October 1988 the community's seven top producers and two Scandinavian  steelmakers agreed to fix prices and divide the market in cold-rolled stainless steel flat products between themselves.

The investigation began in May 1988 with a series of surprise raids on  steelmakers by the European     Commission's anti-cartel division. It came after attempts by Spanish and British buyers to buy
cold-rolled products outside their native countries were thwarted because of production quotas and high prices due to restricted production (AMM, May 1), the commission said.

Fines were not imposed on the Spanish, Swedish and Finnish companies involved because they were already subject to national agreements with the EC to limit their exports to the community, officials said.

The six companies fined have the right to appeal the ruling in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, but sources said it was unlikely that British  Steel would be appealing the ruling due to the "almost derisory" amount of the fine.

"It is a very small fine. An appeal is possible but it is hardly worth it," one source said. "The company's defense was that the EC was fully cognizant of what was going on in terms of the  cartel agreement."

The agreement, which ended in October 1988 after the commission raised formal objections to it, carved up all the community and most of the European Free Trade Association market in cold-rolled  stainless   steel products, according to EC officials.

The agreement set up a quota system limiting the tonnages each company could share every quarter. The pact also established a committee to coordinate prices.

A spokesman for British  Steel said that the company would "carefully consider the full implications of the EC decision for its business." At the same time, officials at Ugine Aciers said they intended to appeal the decision.

"In view of the commission's involvement in industrial and marketing policies in this industry and of its explicit knowledge of the contacts established - at the commission's request - among European producers in the context of the management of the `manifest state of crisis' in the  steel industry, Ugine intends to contest this decision before the European Court of Justice," officials said in a statement.

West Germany's Krupp said it had no official comment, adding that the company was waiting to receive documentation of the investigation from Brussels and would issue an official statement in about two weeks. Officials from the other three companies - ALZ, Terni and Thyssen - were not available for comment at presstime yesterday.

The commission warned that companies involved in  steel cartels would face much steeper fines in the future than the amount demanded in this case.

"The commission will in the future take severe action against any  steel producers attempting to form cartels or make less-formal arrangements to restrict or control markets or prices," officials said.

HD          European `cartel' blamed for steel closure  at Ravenscraig. BY           By John Palmer, European Editor, in Brussels.

The European Commission has been asked to investigate an alleged illegal  cartel agreement involving British Steel and other EC  steel companies under which the Ravenscraig hot strip mill is to be closed.

A delegation of Ravenscraig trade unions and Scottish local authorities led by Ken Collins, Labour MEP for the Lothians was told in Brussels yesterday that Sir Leon Brittan, the British commissioner for competition policy, would examine any evidence of an illegal  cartel when Scottish  steel workers submit a dossier in September.

TD
Last week the commission imposed a #298,000 fine on seven large European  stainless steel producers including British  Steel for operating a price and production  cartel. There has been growing suspicion among steel users of increasingly close co-ordination of prices among  steel manufacturers.

Mr Collins said yesterday: "We had a very good meeting with Sir Leon, who advised us on how best to present our case, and assured us our evidence would be investigated by the commission.

"Steel making at Ravenscraig is profitable, but the management have opted for an arrangement with the other steel firms under which British  Steel is buying into Germany in return for closing down special steel making at Ravenscraig.
"We have the gravest suspicions that a  cartel is at work."

Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said: "The figures show that production per worker in Ravenscraig is among the highest in the European  steel industry. It cannot be in the interests of the community that, at a time of rising demand for special  steel, capacity is being closed."
In a statement after the meeting Sir Leon said there was as yet no evidence to justify an inquiry. British  Steel announced in May that the hot strip mill would close next year with the loss of 770 jobs,
prompting fears for the future of the rest of the works.

For most of the 1970s and early 1980s the EC  steel industry was deemed to be in crisis, but in the past few years demand has recovered and production become profitable.
The Ravenscraig workers, who say capacity is being cut to restrict competition, want the EC to make
British  Steel offer the works for sale as a going concern.
