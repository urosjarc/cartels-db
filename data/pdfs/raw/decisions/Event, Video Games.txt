HD           Europe Decides to Fine Nintendo  --- Antitrust Enforcers Rule That the Videogame Maker
Illegally  Carved Up Market

BRUSSELS -- Nintendo Co., the Japanese creator of such  videogame  icons as Super Mario and Donkey Kong, has been found in violation of  European antitrust laws and will be hit with a  fine, said a person familiar with the matter.

European antitrust enforcers have concluded that Nintendo and its distributors illegally carved up the European market for game consoles and  video-games by preventing sales from one  European Union country to another and thus keeping prices higher.

TD
The European Commission's antitrust department formally outlined its initial suspicions about Nintendo's business practices in April 2000. At the time, the antitrust enforcers said they suspected the existence of a "cartel-like agreement" among Nintendo and a number of its official importers, "with the aim of partitioning the  European single market."

In the course of the subsequent investigation, the  commission confirmed its initial suspicions and plans to sanction the company as early as Wednesday, said the person familiar with the case. The amount of the  fine the commission plans to impose on Nintendo couldn't be confirmed.

George Harrison, a senior vice president at Nintendo's U.S. unit in Redmond, Wash., confirmed that the fine will be announced within the next 10 days. He said Nintendo already put an adequate amount of money into reserve to pay for the  fine, so the company won't be financially affected by it this year. He couldn't say how much is in reserve. Mr. Harrison added that Nintendo has changed its distribution arrangements to bring them into compliance with the  European Commission.

The Nintendo investigation underscores a lingering problem faced by  European regulators as they try to dismantle restrictions to free trade across the 15-nation  European Union. Even though the EU proudly bills itself as a "single market," prices for the same product can vary significantly from country to country because of different national tax levels and retail policies.

As a result, auto makers and pharmaceutical companies, to name just two industries, have historically tried to prevent their distributors from exporting products from a lower-price country to a higher-price country outside the official sales channels. This practice, known as "parallel trade," usually undercuts a company's profits because consumers will buy cheaper parallel-exported products instead of the more expensive ones sold through official outlets.

BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) -  European antitrust regulators next week will  fine Japanese
video game maker Nintendo and a number of its distributors for sales practices it employed in the
mid-1990s, EU  Commission sources told Reuters.

Nintendo Co. Ltd. , maker of the popular handheld  video game console Game Boy, plus the Donkey Kong and Pokemon  video games, was accused in 2000 of collaborating with distributors to limit cross-border flow of its products in an effort to raise wholesale prices.

TD
The EU is expected to take up the matter next week, slapping the world's No. 2  video game maker with a fine. The Nintendo settlement is on the  commission agenda for Wednesday, EU sources said.

"A formal decision has not yet been received from the EuropeanCommission. However, we are aware that a decision is imminent," a Nintendo spokesman in London said.
The size of the  fine could not be confirmed. A spokesman for Nintendo of America confirmed that
Nintendo had already set aside funds to deal with the  fine.

In 2000, the European Commission said it believed Nintendo and seven of its distributors participated in a "cartel-like" arrangement with the aim of partitioning the market and inflating wholesale prices for its consoles and  games.

Nintendo has cooperated with the EU from the outset of the investigation, which dates back to 1995. Nintendo no longer operates its  European retail channel in this manner.

Shares in Nintendo, which earlier this month cut its hardware shipment forecast for 2002/03, have been in a tailspin, down 19 percent this month. It closed up 2.6 percent on Friday at 11,350 yen in Tokyo.

Demand for Nintendo's premier product, the GameCube, has tailed off lately in the crucial Japanese and German markets. Still, the company expects to ship 3 million GameCubes to  European resellers by year-end.

GameCube is battling with Sony Corp.'s market-dominant PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox for share in the brutally competitive videogames console market. (Additional reporting by Anna Eriksson and Joelle Guggenbuhl in Brussels).

Nintendo of America (NOA) will be working with retailers on yet another GameCube bundle this holiday, offering key Christmas title Metroid Prime and hardware for $179.95 -- $10 less than price of Mario Sunshine bundle (CED Oct 7 p1). But Senior Mktg. Vp George Harrison told us that unlike now-available Mario bundle -- which includes hardware, game and memory card that most stores are carrying at $189.95
--Metroid bundle would be put together by retailers themselves and wouldn't include memory card, just console and game. Metroid bundle is likely to be fairly short-term promotion, Harrison said, running 2-3 weeks around Thanksgiving.

TD
NOA plans to kick off Metroid TV ads this week that include 30-sec. teaser spots, Harrison said, and
in-cinema ad campaigns and full TV spots will begin Nov. 1. Company has been scrambling somewhat to
get some hardware yet to be unloaded because of West Coast dock lockout earlier this month, but
Harrison said most of its holiday inventory now was in U.S. Original GameCube SKU, platinum version of
GameCube, black & indigo version of it and 2 bundles give NOA variety of hardware offerings for
consumers this Christmas.

On current softness in console market, Harrison said: "We're a little behind where we expected to be," but "in terms of the total installed base, it's far ahead of where PlayStation 1 and N64 were at this time in their life cycles." He said NOA had been telling analysts since E3 it expected overall console market to grow only 10% this year and not 20-30% predicted by others. As for current grumbling among 3rd-party publishers about flat market, Harrison said, problem simply was glut of titles on market this year: "The top games seem to be doing very well and a lot of other titles seem to be struggling." Situation is similar for Game Boy Advance (GBA), he said, with most retailers having room for only 45-65 titles, far fewer than number of GBA  games competing for that space. GBA should get boost from Nov. release of Electronic Arts' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harrison said, which should carry platform until March
2003 release of 2 new Pokemon titles -- Ruby and Sapphire. There have been concerns that Pokemon fad is losing steam, but Harrison said: "The [TV] show continues to do well, so we hope 2 new  games will revive interest on the game side."

Separately, Nintendo Europe had no comment Fri. on Wall St. Journal report saying company had been found in violation of European antitrust laws and would be hit with  fine. Report said European Commission's Antitrust Dept. concluded Nintendo and its distributors illegally carved up European market for game consoles and their software by preventing sales from one  European Union country to another, keeping prices higher. Citing "person familiar with the case," report said Nintendo was to be sanctioned as early as Wed. but amount of the  fine couldn't be confirmed. Report said Japanese news articles in 2000 indicated Nintendo was planning to change its  European distribution system in response to cartel probe in Europe.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is set to issue verdicts Wednesday in two cartel investigations, proving he can still pack a punch despite devastating rulings against him last week.

E.U. officials told Dow Jones Newswires that Japanese  video-game maker Nintendo Co. Ltd. (J.NTD) and its European distributors are likely to be  fined for illegal sales practices in the mid-1990s. Also, two of the world's largest auction houses Sotheby's Holding Inc. (BID) and Christie's International PLC will pay for conspiring to fix prices over seven years.

TD
Both cases are considered important to restoring Monti's battered prestige. The  European Court of First Instance eroded his power to block mergers last week when it overturned two merger veto's. But the European antitrust czar can still open investigations against companies he suspects of illegal activities and order dawn raids by investigators to collect evidence. He only needs to gain support of his other commissioners to impose  fines.

"Monti has lost some feathers in blocking mergers," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former senior Commission official and now partner with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Brussels. "But his authority over cartels remains intact."

Nintendo has been targeted for  price-fixing. The world's second largest video-game maker is believed to have collaborated with distributors to limit the cross-border flow of its games in the period
1995-2000.

"The Commission must protect the public against commercial practices which try to artificially maintain prices at a high level," Monti said at the beginning of the investigation in March 2000.

Another aggravating factor is the way Nintendo and other  video-game manufacturers tie together their hardware and software. Nintendo  games only work with Nintendo software. This makes customers dependent, analysts say.

Although the law is unclear whether Monti could demand breakups of Nintendo or other game makers, this bundling could push him to issue a heavy  fine. Seven other distributors are also likely to face penalties.

Auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's are expected to get off easier. Both companies already have been fined in the U.S. where they agreed to pay over $512 million. Sotheby's former chairman Alfred Taubman is serving a one-year jail sentence in the U.S.

E.U. officials said the investigation had uncovered evidence of a widespread agreement between the two houses to raise fees charged to sellers at auctions, and that the scheme had been agreed by top management. But both auction houses cooperated with the investigation.

HD   Nintendo  fined E167.8m by EU for price fixing
WC   334 words

The European Commission has imposed a total fine of E167.8m on Japanese  video games maker Nintendo and seven of its official distributors in Europe for colluding to prevent exports to high-priced from low-priced countries.

The fine on Nintendo alone was calculated at E149m "to reflect its size in the market concerned, the fact that it was the driving force behind the illicit behaviour and also because it continued with the infringement even after it knew the investigation was going on," the  Commission said in a statement.

TD
Prices for play consoles and games differed widely from one  European Union country to another during the period investigated by the Commission, with the United Kingdom found to be up to 65 per cent cheaper than Germany and the Netherlands.

The decision concerns Nintendo and seven distributors of Nintendo products, namely John Menzies plc (Nintendo's distributor for the UK), Concentra -Produtos para criancas S.A. (Portugal), Linea GIG. S.p.A. (Italy), Bergsala AB (Sweden), the Greek unit of Japan's Itochu Corp, Nortec A.E. (Greece), and the Belgian unit of Germany's CD-Contact Data GmbH.

The Commission said it has collected evidence showing that Nintendo and its distributors colluded to maintain artificially high price differences in the EU between January 1991 and 1998.
Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games," Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti said.
"They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer. "We will not tolerate... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the  European single market." The fine on Nintendo is also the fourth largest ever imposed on an individual firm for a single infringement
and will be contested by the company. "In view of the size of the  fine, which Nintendo finds surprising,
Nintendo will lodge an appeal," the company said. ((Distributed via M2 Communications Ltd -

BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (AFP) - The European Commission is expected to sanction Japanese  video game maker Nintendo Wednesday, imposing a fine for illicit distribution practices, a  European Union official said Tuesday.

According to the source, the EU executive body would conclude that Nintendo and its distributors had violated EU competition regulations throughout most of the 1990s.

In April 2000, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti launched a formal inquiry against Nintendo and seven of its distributors on suspicions they had set up a form of  cartel aimed at controlling the EU market.

The practice could contravene  European competition rules because prices were artificially maintained at a high level, he had said in opening the investigation.

The French business daily La Tribune reported that Nintendo  Europe and its Japanese parent would be hit with the most severe penalties.

Most of the distributors involved would be given lighter sanctions because of their cooperation with the inquiry, it said.

SUMMARY

Legal and regulatory risk stems from the inefficiency of the courts and uncertainty over the regulatory environment and property rights. Uncertainty has been fuelled by conflict over a series of controversial laws decreed in November 2001. The risk that a contract will not be enforced or that foreign companies
will be discriminated against remains moderate, but effective means of arbitration are few in the event of a dispute. Progress on judicial reform will remain slow, so the chronic inefficiency of the court system will persist. Venezuela's record of regulating unfair competitive practices is poor, as is its protection of intellectual property rights. Price controls apply to pharmaceutical products, gasoline, and certain agricultural products, for which tariffs are adjusted if the price falls outside a certain range. A return to a wide-ranging system of price controls is unlikely.
ANALYSIS
* Firms suffer abuse of intellectual property rights (High risk).

Venezuela's mechanisms and legislation for enforcing intellectual property rights (IPRs) have improved over the past decade but remain weak, particularly regarding clothing, software and pharmaceuticals. The
1999 constitution guarantees IPRs but in practice the legal deterrents to trademark piracy or the production of counterfeit goods are ineffective. Plans to revise IPRs appear to have slipped well down the list of priorities. As foreign patents are not automatically registered, foreign investors should consider registering trademarks and patents under as many categories as may be applicable in order to maximise protection.
* Firms' land rights are inadequately protected (High risk).

A new Land Law approved in late-2001 accords the recently-created Instituto Nacional Agraria (national land institute) discretion to determine whether privately held land is being adequately exploited. Properties that fail the test will be liable to taxation or expropriation. In a context of weak institutions and marked political centralisation, the law compounds uncertainties facing business and may encourage more land "invasions" and, potentially, partisan rulings on cases by the judiciary. Investors who might be exposed should seek advice from local business chambers, embassy officials or legal counsel.

* Firms face long delays in resolving legal disputes (High risk).

The effectiveness of the judiciary has long suffered from politicisation and corruption. The overhaul of the judiciary launched in 1999 has led to widespread dismissals but progress in building an effective institution will remain slow, not least because deteriorating economic fundamentals will pose an additional
distraction. Judicial procedures will remain extremely slow and accountability low. Foreign investors should expect long delays in legal proceedings, and be aware that favourable judgements may not be enforced. Firms are strongly advised to contract the services of a well-established locally based lawyer.
BACKGROUND Enforceability of Contracts
President Hugo Chavez's rise to power has fundamentally changed relations between the public and private sectors and increased the risk that contracts will not be fully respected. One example was the promise (under the previous government of ex-President Rafael Caldera) to liberalise the retail petrol sector, which had attracted millions of investment dollars during 1997-98. Unfortunately for these investors, the Chavez administration has frozen petrol prices since taking office.

Regulatory agencies in the telecommunications, transport and electricity industries have repeatedly delayed rate increases that had been contractually agreed. A new Land Law approved by presidential decree in November 2001 has been cited as evidence of ambivalence in the government's attitude to private property rights. Among other things, the legislation allows the government to confiscate privately held productive land which it considers is not being put to proper use. The reform's express purpose is to facilitate rural development, but business and opposition groups say it will be used to justify peasant "land invasions".

Most recently, the decision to float the bolivar has resulted in the currency depreciating sharply. This led to public outcry calling for dollar-denominated contracts to be re-valued. The government may be forced to give in to these calls, resulting in substantial losses for contract- holders.
Independence of the Judiciary

Legal conditions in Venezuela remain unclear following wholesale revision of legislation to adapt existing laws to the 1999 constitution. A survey in June 2001 by Datanalisis, a local polling firm, showed that four out of ten local businesses had frozen their investments because of legal uncertainties.
Reform of the judiciary has so far failed to bear fruit. A large number of judges were removed from office in
1999 as part of an anti-corruption drive but the judiciary is of poor quality and open to political and financial
pressures. Although Mr Chavez was swept to power on a mandate to clamp down on corruption, his
administration has already seen several corruption scandals, and the executive has yet to elaborate on a
strategy to fight graft. A new branch of government created under the 1999 constitution, comprising the
offices of comptroller-general, public prosecutor and public defender, has yet to make its presence felt.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

Although President Chavez has repeatedly said he welcomes foreign investment in Venezuela, his anti-capitalist rhetoric and the turbulence following his political reforms have worked against this aim. Inflows of foreign direct investment remain well below potential, although several capital-intensive sectors are expected to attract substantial interest in coming years. There is little resentment of foreign investors. Venezuelans have been used to foreign companies ever since the oil boom took hold in the 1920s, and the public and local business community remain receptive to overseas investment. Indeed, brands from the US and  Europe wield a good deal of social cachet in image-conscious Venezuelan society.

The legislative framework for foreign investors has improved since Mr Chavez took office. He decreed the Law for the Promotion and Protection of Investment, guaranteeing equal treatment for foreigners and Venezuelans in October 1999 (Decree 356, Official Gazette No. 5,390). The law, which does not supersede international treaties, eliminates the required authorisation to invest, preserves the right to repatriate freely 100% of capital and profits, and introduces a general protection system for foreign and national investments. It also provides for legal contracts for investors with the state guaranteeing stability in taxation and investment incentives for up to ten years. Article 301 of the 1999 constitution adopts an
international standard for the treatment of private capital by establishing equal conditions for domestic and foreign capital.

The private-public investment promotion council, Conapri, provides custom- tailored advice to investors interested in specific economic sectors. Official promotion of foreign investment in Venezuela is primarily done by the Superintendency of Foreign Investment (Siex), which also registers investors. There are no official figures incorporating all foreign investment in Venezuela. Statistics from Siex exclude investments
Page 14 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in hydrocarbons, gas, petrochemicals and mining --the country's most important economic activities. But these sectors are included in figures from the Ministry of Energy and Mines. Figures from both sources can vary greatly as the result of one or several large investments.

According to Siex figures, total registered foreign direct investment (FDI) rose to US$728m in 2001, compared with only US$586m in 2000 and US$515m in 1999.

Broken down by country, the Netherlands was the largest investor, with US$371m during 2001, followed by the United States (US$93m) and Chile (US$81m). By far the largest sector for registered investment was transport and communications, with some US$381m invested, compared with only US$77m a year earlier. Next came manufacturing, with US$280m in investment, up from US$197m in 2000.

According to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, FDI in oil, gas, petrochemicals and mining reached US$221m in 2001. These inflows were much stronger than the US$57m recorded in 2000, but weaker than the US$237m of 1999. FDI in 2001 was almost equally divided between hydrocarbons (US$111m) and petrochemicals (US$110m), with no recorded foreign investment in gas or non-fuel mining.

More than half of Venezuela's financial system is in the hands of foreign investors after a series of acquisitions in 1996 spear-headed by Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), both of Spain. Banco de Venezuela (a BSCH subsidiary) acquired 93% of Banco Caracas (the country's fourth-largest bank) in December 2000 for US$316m to leapfrog past Banco Provincial (a BBVA subsidiary) as the largest bank in Venezuela.

In the fast-growing telecommunications sector, all the dominant players are foreign owned. An international consortium led by Verizon Communications (US) took control of the national telephone company, Compania Anonima Nacional de Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), in 1991 for US$1.89bn. AES, a US power firm, launched an unsuccessful US$1.4bn unsolicited takeover bid for CANTV in August
2001. CANTV subsidiaries include Movilnet (mobile phones), Cantv.net (Internet access) and Caveguias
(directories).

BellSouth (US) owns Telcel, Venezuela's leading mobile-telephone company and second-largest telecoms firm. A dozen new foreign competitors have entered the market since the end of CANTV's monopoly on fixed-line telephony in November 2000. The largest, Digitel, is controlled by Telecom Italia Mobile, and it plans to invest US$300m to boost its subscriber base.

In the crucial hydrocarbons sector, Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, remains the key player. Foreign companies entered the upstream oil production segment in 1996, with the sale of marginal fields and the third round of exploration licences. So far, only four of the eight third- round licence holders have produced oil in commercially viable quantities and have plans for further development, despite the US$800m companies paid for the licences. Although tariff freezes have blocked foreign investment in the retail petrol sector, foreign companies are eyeing opportunities in chemicals and natural gas.

ExxonMobil, a US oil giant, recently completed a US$2bn crude upgrading project called Cerro Negro, and it has expressed interest in two US$2bn projects: the Paria liquefied natural gas (LNG) complex it plans with Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands/UK) and Mitsubishi (Japan) and a separate olefins petrochemicals plant. US firms remain the leading investors in the hydrocarbons sector, with an estimated US$20bn invested to date in the country.

Despite the government's generally favourable stance on foreign investment, investors complain that regulators are often poorly equipped, trained and staffed and that decisions are based on political rather than technical criteria. Conatel, the telecoms regulatory agency, delayed contractual rate increases in
1999 for CANTV, alleging it had not fulfilled contractual responsibilities. Although the issue was eventually resolved to the satisfaction of both parties (with a sharp lowering in international and long-distance rates in January 2000), the government's heavy-handed tactics nearly provoked a serious legal dispute.

Venezuelan regulators were also put to the test by a record US$1.6bn hostile takeover in June 2000 of the country's largest private electricity firm, Electricidad de Caracas. Venezuela's National Securities Commission twice suspended the offer by AES, a US power company, pleading changes to bolster minority shareholders' rights. In a positive sign for foreign investors, however, the Chavez government welcomed the acquisition as a sign of foreign investors' faith in the government.

A mining law, which took effect in September 1999 (Decree 295, Official Gazette No. 5,382), earned criticism from the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Mines for imposing higher taxes on mining exploration and development. The law also increased the discretion of state officials in awarding contracts
and reversed several concessions granted investors by the Corporacion Venezolana de Guyana under the previous 1945 mining legislation.

Local-content requirements have been eliminated for all but a few industries, in line with recent emphasis on trade liberalisation and export promotion. Article 26 of Decree 2095 specifies that national investors must be responsible for 80% of stock in the following sectors:
* television, radio and Spanish-language newspapers; and

* professional services whose exercise is regulated by national laws, such as doctors' services, lawyers' offices or architects.

At least two-thirds of the stock of air transport companies must belong to Venezuelan investors to be able to register the planes under the national flag. Domestic navigation is reserved to vessels registered under the national flag, meeting the same requirement.
A September 1999 agreement with Colombia and Ecuador excused local car assemblers from a 33%
local-content requirement in order to bring the countries into compliance with WTO rules.

As one of the conditions of its entrance into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Venezuela agreed to phase out its "Buy Venezuelan" law (Decree 1182 of 1986). The law remains on the books, however, and the Chavez government has created friction by pressuring foreign oil companies to give preference in supply-and-service contracts to domestic companies if price differentials with foreign suppliers do not exceed 5%.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Venezuela's anti-monopoly law took effect in May 1992. It is enforced by Procompetencia, a superintendency under the aegis of the Ministry of Production and Commerce. The agency has been moderately successful in implementing the law, and its activity has recently increased, focusing mainly on issues of economic concentration and abuse of dominant market positions. Procompetencia has said it intends to step up actions against  price-fixing, but this process could be hindered by President Chavez's ambivalence towards freeing the prices of basic goods and services. Article 49 of the 1992 anti-monopoly law empowers the superintendency to impose  fines of as much as 20% of an offending company's gross income in the year prior to the decision (up to 40% for repeat offenders). The norm is 10% for first-time offenders. The law does not provide for prison sanctions.
Although typical cartels and private monopolies do not exist in Venezuela (there are some
quasi-monopolies, and informal cartels are common), ownership of many businesses is concentrated
among a few families. Examples are: the Cisneros Group (soft drinks, consumer goods, finance,
broadcasting, retail and distribution); the Lorenzo Mendoza family's Polar Group (beer, food products); the
Eugenio Mendoza family (paper and animal feeds); the Neumann family's Corimon Group (paints and
chemicals); the Boulton family (airlines and shipping); the Vollmer and Zuloaga families (utilities, brewing,
finance, sugar milling, real estate); the Phelps Group (broadcasting, newspapers, real estate); the Sosa
Rodriguez affiliation (chemicals); the Delfino group (paper products and news media); the Blohm Group
(textiles, appliances, news media); and the Tamayo family (processed foods, packaging, distilling).
The Chavez administration's wariness towards the excessive concentration of power in the private
sector--which cannot be divorced from its political hostility towards local big business--was exhibited in the
1999 constitution: Article 114 strictly forbids speculation and the creation of cartels; Article 113 forbids
monopolies and guarantees the protection of consumers' rights.

Rather than banning monopolies or groups that act as such, Venezuela's 1992 anti-monopoly law focuses on the abuse of a dominant market position. Major provisions include bans on all of the following practices:

* horizontal agreements to limit competition, including (1)  price fixing,  (2) limits on the production, distribution or technological development of an item, (3) collusive allocation of markets and (4) price discrimination;
* vertical agreements that set minimum prices or limit production, distribution or development of an item;

* attempts by companies in dominant market positions to discriminate by price, create unjustified production limits (artificial scarcity), constrain distribution or development, or refuse to satisfy demand.
The law does allow for certain "natural" monopolies, such as the oil industry, and exempts certain items of
"prime necessity", such as petrol.

A related regulation, published in May 1993 (Decree 2775), ratifies the illegality of establishing single distribution channels or a dominant market position, but it clarifies the exceptions to vertical and horizontal accords. The decree sets guidelines in areas such as exclusive- distribution agreements (franchises),

technological co-operation and rationalisation of production. Such agreements are subject to authorisation and can be revoked.

A second amendment to the anti-monopoly law was Decree 1311, published in the Official Gazette on May 21st 1996. Decree 1311 defines as "economic concentration" all mergers, joint incorporations, acquisitions and any other transactions that lead to a consolidation of companies or assets, when the participating companies or entities have net sales in excess of 120,000 UTs. (The UT, or unidad tributaria, is fixed every year; it has been equivalent to Bs14,800 since April 2002.)

A detailed description of the criteria that Procompetencia applies in judging whether a challenge to free competition has taken place is given in its resolution SPPLC/039-99 (Official Gazette No. 36,819, November 1st 1999).
Intellectual Property Rights

Venezuelan legislation has traditionally distinguished between copyrights and industrial property rights. The former include literature, graphic arts, audio and visual productions, which are protected by the August 1993 Copyright Law. The latter include patents and trademarks, which are protected by Andean Community Decisions 486 (industrial property: trademarks and patents) and 345 (plant varieties).

Venezuela and the other Andean countries adapted their previous legislation on intellectual property rights (Decision 344) in September 2000. Decision 486 was passed to comply with the World Trade Organisation's Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement. Although the ruling considerably broadens the previous legislation, the US Trade Representative states that it does not
include sufficient protection for confidential test data and second-case patents.

Decision 486 protects trade secrets, establishes criteria for famous marks and provides for loss of ownership of a mark through action or omission of its owner. It expands on the previous Decision 344 by making clear definitions of ownership rights for things as diverse as textile and industrial designs, television and audio signals, audio and visual cassettes, software and technology.

Prohibited patents include those on animal species and varieties, inventions contrary to health, inventions relating to the material of the human body and medicines considered generic by the World Health Organisation.

Along with other countries of the Andean Community, Venezuela has ruled that know-how, once transferred, becomes the property of the licensee. The application of this law is difficult and further impeded by judges inexperienced in these matters. Without written documentation sustaining a case on know-how, successful litigation is unlikely. Among the most urgent improvements needed in the area of intellectual property rights are increased border and customs controls to curb high levels of contraband.

Patents last for 20 years, without provisions for renewal. First-time applicants for patents in any other Andean Community country have a one- year preferential term in which to file the patent in Venezuela. Trademarks last for ten years and are renewable for successive ten-year periods. A six-month grace period for renewal is provided after a registration has expired. Famous (internationally known) marks are now recognised in Venezuela, but Venezuelan courts sometimes require plaintiffs to post bonds to obtain
injunctions against infringers. Furthermore, proving piracy can be difficult. Because legal recourse is costly and time-consuming, many foreign firms have chosen out-of-court settlements.
Patent registration and approval are slow and can take as long as four years, although they usually require
1-2 years. A patent application must be examined and published within 18 months of the date of
application. Approval establishes exclusive rights to exploitation of a patent. The government can award a
compulsory licence to a third party when a title- holder does not produce or import a product within any
five-year period. The third party, however, would still have to compensate the legitimate owner of the
patent through a royalty. Trademark registration now takes an average of eight months if there is no
opposition.

Penalties for infringement of patent and trademark rights include  fines and prison terms of up to four years, which are almost never applied. To preserve their legal protection, firms must comply with Venezuela's trademark, patent and copyright regulations. Carelessness in this area has obliged some
firms to pay trademark "ransoms" of as much as US$100,000 to pirates. Trademark renewal can also be a problem, and owners must take care to submit renewal applications within the six-month grace period. A number of companies have lost trademarks to local firms when they delayed the initial registration or renewal. These companies have had to resort to buying out the local producer or even, in extreme cases, entering into joint ventures.

Unwarranted judicial delays also occur in copyright cases. Nintendo (Japan) filed a civil copyright infringement case against a local software retailer, Atari Mundial, in July 1995 for distributing counterfeit
Page 17 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
software. It was not until July 2000 that the Superior Civil and Mercantile Court of Caracas ruled in favour of the seizure and destruction of pirated  games and software and issued an injunction against the defendants for the sale of these materials.

International classification of goods and services has replaced Venezuela's previous sui generis classification, and protection for service marks could open up new franchising possibilities. Recognition of well-known marks will prevent local registration of foreign brands solely to attempt charging the foreign owner for local use of the brand.

The Copyright Law (Ley de Derecho del Autor) passed by Congress in August 1993 is considered one of the most comprehensive of its type in the world. The law--almost a verbatim copy of Andean Community Decision 351--replaced Venezuela's 1962 Copyright Law. Venezuela is a signatory to both the Bern Convention and Universal Copyright Convention treaties.

The 1993 law covers creative works of a literary, scientific or artistic nature, and it clearly defines each category while redefining and expanding others. The concept of "cinematographic works" was redefined as "audio-visual works", effectively extending protection to  video works. The concept of "radiophonic works" was greatly expanded, and computer programs, databases, and cable and satellite television are now protected. Protection is granted for the life of the author plus 60 years, a ten-year extension of the previous law's provision.

Frustrated with the slow progress of enforcing intellectual property rights, professional associations have increased lobbying efforts and public-awareness campaigns. The Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce and others have given training courses to judges and court officials.

Venezuela remained on the US Trade Representative's 32-country watch list in 2001 for violations of intellectual property rights--for the seventh year in a row. It was previously on the priority watch list. Although the US notes progress by Venezuela on protecting intellectual property rights, the following differences remain:

(1) The US feels that a 20-year patent on drugs should not begin until the product receives federal approval, a process that often takes ten years. Venezuela disagrees, and without such laws, US
high-technology products would receive patent protection for only the remaining years after approval and before the 20-year cut-off.

(2) When a company leases its patent to a company in another country, it might stipulate that the resulting products be used domestically. If the leasing company exports those products to a third country, they are known as parallel imports to that country. Western countries want Venezuela to agree to forbid such imports.

(3) Venezuelan law does not contain sufficient penalties for trademark piracy or the production of counterfeit goods. Trademark pirates face prison terms of 1-2 months, but in practice these are almost never applied.

The anti-piracy command, Comanpi, completed its first five years in action in July 2001. Comanpi is a joint effort between the police force, the justice ministry and the private sector, particularly the Business Software Alliance (BSA) and the Motion Picture Association (MPA). It has raided suspected copyright pirates, shut down several illegal  video producers and taken them to court, and clamped down on satellite signal poaching.

Previously, it took up to a year for courts to order a legal injunction before the police would raid an illegal production site. Now raids occur two weeks after charges are presented. The BSA has even installed a toll- free telephone number for the general public to report software piracy, which it puts at around 62%.

Annual losses due to copyright piracy in Venezuela are significant. The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimated such losses at around US$170m in 2000, representing a slight decline from previous years. According to the US Trade Representative, only a few central government offices have legalised their business software; the vast majority continues to use pirated material despite government directives banning this practice. Software piracy is usually settled out of court with a compensation payment. Comanpi confiscated more than 50,000  videocassettes during 2000. The advent of easily reproduced digital videodiscs has introduced a new challenge for the agency.
Price Controls

Venezuela removed most of its price controls between 1996 and 1998; only a few remain, on agricultural products, some medicines and petrol. However the populist government of President Chavez has proved resistant to removing the remaining price restraints--particularly on petrol--despite pressure from private companies, arguing this would hurt the poorest Venezuelans most. Mr Chavez's predecessor, Rafael
Page 18 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Caldera, was also hesitant about fully freeing petrol prices, which are highly sensitive politically, not only because of the memory of the 1989 Caracas riots (in which hundreds were killed and which was partly triggered by a hike in petrol and public transport prices) but also because of a widespread conviction that cheap petrol should be a 'right' in an 'oil-rich' state. Price controls may yet return on other products as the currency depreciates and consumer prices rise.

After substantial reductions in petrol subsidies in 1996 and 1997, Mr Chavez halted the process in 1999, in order to maintain price subsidies. The minister of energy and mines, Alvaro Silva, convened a
commission in early 2001 with private oil companies to discuss how to make further investment attractive in this sector. Companies insist that an increase of only Bs15 per litre would make investment profitable until 2006.

The price of petrol has been increased several times in recent years, an average of US$0.02 per litre during 1996 to US$0.11 per litre in September 1999; it has since remained at that level, however, creating frustration among foreign investors that entered the fuel retail market. Under a 1998 law to open the domestic oil-derivatives market to competition, the price is eventually to be fixed at its export cost--that is, eliminating all subsidies and covering all costs.

Article 301 of the constitution allows the government to impose trade barriers to protect domestic production. The Ministry of Agriculture has the power to fix minimum prices temporarily on certain imported goods within the framework of the Andean System of Prices and Tariffs on a bi- weekly basis. These include pork, milk, wheat, rye, yellow and white maize, soya grain, unprocessed soya and palm oil, and sugar.

The Ministry of Agriculture may also fix the domestic wholesale price of a number of products, including maize, sorghum, rice, milk and certain vegetables, though such prices are generally set in concert with producers. Under Decree 230, the Ministry of Production and Commerce may set maximum wholesale and retail prices and establish special conditions for the circulation, sale and consumption of articles declared to be of prime necessity (like foodstuffs, medicines and fuels). The anti-monopoly and consumer-protection laws reaffirm this power.

Decree 230 also gives the ministry the power to set maximum rates for the internal transport of persons and goods; to subject the imports of certain articles to contingencies, quotas or import-licence requirements; and to require licences to export certain goods. Producers of controlled items must submit proposed price increases to the Ministry of Production and Commerce 60 days in advance; the price hike may take force unless explicitly rejected by the ministry.

A new Pharmaceutical Products Law that became effective in March 2001 (published August 3rd 2000, Official Gazette No. 37,006) reaffirms the right of authorities to set prices for certain basic medicines and to impose controls and regulations on the pharmaceutical industry in all stages of production and
marketing. The law made no changes to the government's list of roughly 1,400 essential medicines, which are subject to price controls.

Public-service rates, especially utilities and telephony, are also strongly controlled. In an attempt to slow inflation and avoid adverse social impact in recent years, the government has said it would restrain increases in telephone and electricity rates.

CANTV, the national telephone company, had its rates frozen for nine months until March 2000 as it squabbled with Conatel (the telecoms regulator) over prices--which had a hefty effect on its financial results. Despite the opening of the fixed-line telephone market in November 2000, Conatel has said it would continue to monitor prices closely until there is full competition in the market. In July 2001 Conatel ordered telephone operators to slash rates for calls from fixed-line to mobile phones as a way to promote growth in Venezuela's struggling fixed-line telephone sector. While mobile operators complained the reduction in interconnection would hurt their profits, leading telecoms company CANTV announced a 50% reduction in fixed-line to mobile rates this year, rising to 70% in 2002.

Regional electricity companies also squabbled during 2000 with the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The ministry was pushing for a revision of a 1997 four-year tariff deal, which companies resisted. Companies, including Electricidad de Caracas, were eventually forced to implement their own increases under the existing agreement. But company officials say they are confident the government will abide by the terms of the rate deal in future, and they add that the Chavez government appears to be adopting a more conciliatory attitude.

HD          EU Fines Nintendo  EUR149M For Breaking  Antitrust Rules

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Wednesday fined Nintendo Co. Ltd. (J.NTD) and its  European distributors EUR167.8 million for illegal sales practices in the mid-1990s.

The Commission said Nintendo and its distributors colluded to prevent exports to high-priced from low-priced countries.

TD
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behavior intended to keep prices artificially high."

The Commission said the world's second-largest  video-game maker collaborated with distributors to limit the cross-border flow of its  games in the period 1991-1998.
Prices for consoles and  games differed widely across the E.U., with prices in the U.K. up to 65%
cheaper than in Germany and the Netherlands.

The Commission said companies are entitled to decide on different prices and distribution networks. But it added that it was perfectly legitimate for retailers to import the same goods from cheaper markets, a practice that Nintendo sought to prevent by boycotting those retailers.

Nintendo alone was  fined EUR149 million, since it continued with the infringement even after it knew the Commission had opened an investigation.
The fine is the fifth-largest to be imposed by the  Commission at the end of a  cartel investigation. The Commission already has investigated other  video-game manufacturers. In 1996, it opened
formal proceedings against Nintendo, Sony Corp. (SNE) and Sega Corp. (J.SEA) about their licensing
practices. All three companies decided to change their policies as a result of the investigation.

In Japan, a company spokesman said Nintendo intended to appeal against the size of its  fine, claiming the case against it was based on information voluntarily submitted by the company. He didn't contest the facts.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company had already made preparations to cover the size of the  fine and insisted it would have no impact on earnings.

HD    (pounds)  101m fine for Nintendo  price fixing. WC   373 words

Nintendo and seven  European distributors, including Scots firm John Menzies, were  fined a total of
(pounds) 101million today for market rigging to keep prices high.
The fine was imposed by the European Commission.

TD
Nintendo games were cheapest by far in the UK, the  Commission said - and John Menzies acted to keep out cheaper imports.
The aim was to maintain artificially high prices in breach of EU rules.

Distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were also part of the price  cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo  video games from cheaper sources.
The parent company was  fined (pounds) 89m, with a (pounds) 5.2m penalty imposed directly on John
Menzies.
There were smaller fines for the other members of the  cartel and European competition.

Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Families have the right to buy  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer.
"Wwe will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high." The price fixing
covered a seven-year period from 1991 to 1998.

UK prices were generally by far the lowest, which understandably tempted outside traders into re-exporting cheap goods into high-price markets.
A major fine was also imposed on auction house Sotheby's.
The firm was  fined (pounds) 12m by the Commission for rigging the art market in collusion with rival
Christie's.

Christie's escaped a  fine because company officials provided the Commission with the crucial evidence to prove the operation of a  cartel between the world's two leading fine art houses in a scam which defrauded sellers out of (pounds) 290m.
The fine represents
6% of Sotheby's annual turnover.

Former Sotheby's chairman Alfred Taubman has already been jailed in America for a year after being found guilty of  price

fixing.  He was also fined (pounds) 4.7m.
His Christie's counterpart at the time, Sir Anthony Tennant, also named in today's  Commission ruling, is now living in

Hampshire.
He refused to go
to America to stand trial and cannot be extradited on the anti-trust charges he faces.

The fine imposed on Sotheby's includes a 40% reduction in acknowledgement of its co-operation in the investigation.

Filed: 13: 50 UTC Japanese computer game maker, Nintendo and seven of its  European distributors are being fined $165 million by the EuropeanCommission for breaking antitrust laws.
The commission says Nintendo worked with distributors to inflate prices and block sales among
European Union countries. EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti says in a statement that millions of
European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. He says they have a right to buy the
games at the lowest price the market can offer.

TD
The other companies  fined were John Menzies, Concentra, Itochu, Linea, Bergsala, Nortec, and CD Contact Data. Under EU law, the  commission can fine companies accused of operating a  cartel as much as 10 percent of their annual sales.

HD     EU fines John Menzies £5.2m over collusion. WC     350 words

Japanese video games maker Nintendo and seven of its European distributors including John Menzies were fined a total of £101m by the EuropeanCommission yesterday for rigging the market to keep prices high.

Nintendo games were cheapest by far in Britain, the  Commission said - and John Menzies acted to keep out cheaper imports.

TD
The aim was to maintain artificially high prices in breach of EU rules.

Distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were also involved in the price  cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo  video games from cheaper sources.
The parent company was  fined £89m, with a £5.2m penalty imposed directly on John Menzies.

There were smaller fines for the other members of the cartel and European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Consumers have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer, and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."

The price fixing  covered a seven-year period from 1991 to 1998, when the price gap for Nintendo goods was significant and varied, said the  Commission.
Prices in Britain were generally by far the lowest, which understandably tempted outside traders into
re-exporting cheap goods into high-price markets. Nintendo's aim was to block such "grey" imports which
could undermine its official retail prices.

The most striking price differences were spotted early in 1996 when certain Nintendo  games and products were up to 65 per cent cheaper in Britain than in the Netherlands and Germany.

The British end of the operation was conducted by The  Games Ltd, part of John Menzies, which became Nintendo's official distributor for the UK and Ireland in 1995 - the year the  Commission investigation began.
But John Menzies later said the scale of the  fine was "disproportionate".

Chief executive David Mackay said: "We feel that the EC has not fully recognised, in the level of this  fine, their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression."
The company is considering whether to appeal.

LP
BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (AFP) - The  European Commission Wednesday fined Japanese company Nintendo
149 million euros (146.5 million dollars) for trying to rig distribution of its consoles and  games in Europe
during the 1990s.

Nintendo and seven European distributors were  fined a total of 167.8 million  euros, the fifth-largest levied by the commission for cartel practices.

TD
"Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games," Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high," he said.

Nintendo's net profit rose 10.2 percent in the last fiscal year on the back of healthy sales of a new hand-held gaming device, Game Boy Advance, and its Gamecube console for home use.

But the creator of Super Mario is locked in a price war around the world with the Xbox console of Microsoft and Sony's PlayStation2.

In April 2000, Monti launched a formal inquiry against Nintendo and the seven distributors on suspicions they had set up a  cartel aimed at controlling the  European Union market.
The Japanese company prevented parallel imports of consoles and  games from cheaper markets such as
Britain from entering other EU countries, the investigation by the EU's executive arm found.
"It's been found that Nintendo and its distributors have been involved in this illicit behaviour for most of the
'90s, between '91 and '98,"  commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said.

The fines were the fourth largest imposed by the  commission against a single company and the fifth largest overall, she said.

The highest of 855 million  euros was slapped last year against a group of pharmaceutical giants accused of running a cartel in vitamin pills.
The commission found that prices for Nintendo consoles and  games were up to 65 percent cheaper in
Britain -- Europe's biggest computer game market -- than in Germany or the Netherlands.

The low prices in Britain "understandably tempted traders into re- exporting cheap goods to high-price countries", the  commission said.

"Under the leadership of Nintendo, the companies intensively collaborated to find the source of any parallel trade," it said.



Page 27 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Traders that allowed parallel exports to occur were punished by being given smaller shipments or by being boycotted altogether."

Nintendo's British distributor, John Menzies, was initially boycotted for failing to toe the line on parallel imports but then colluded with the Japanese company after 1996, the  commission said.

"Nintendo was the instigator and the leader of the infringement and carried on with the illicit behaviour even after the  Commission had started its investigation, as did John Menzies."

The commission noted, however, that both Nintendo and John Menzies had cooperated with preliminary enquiries from December 1997.

The other distributors  fined were Concentra in Portugal, Linea in Italy, Bergsala in Sweden, Japanese trading house Itochu, Itochu's Greek unit Nortec, and the Belgian unit of Germany's CD-Contact Data.

Nintendo accepted it had been wrong but vowed to appeal at the Luxembourg-based  European Court of
First Instance over the "surprising" level of the  fine.
"Nintendo accepts the finding that, up to 1998, its distribution practices did not comply with EU
competition rules," Nintendo  Europe said in a statement.

"Nintendo has rectified the relevant aspects of its distribution in  Europe and has instigated a thorough and far-reaching compliance programme that enables the free flow of product across  Europe," it said.

The European Commission has fined Japanese video game maker Nintendo almost E150m for fixing prices in the EU.

The fine on Nintendo is also the fourth largest ever imposed on an individual firm for a single infringement of anti-trust rules.

TD
The Commission said the company and seven of its official distributors had colluded to maintain artificially high price differences between EU States during the 1990s and to prevent exports within the EU through "unofficial" distribution channels. The distributors were  fined E19m between them.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the size of the  fine levied on Nintendo reflected the fact that it was the driving force behind the illicit behaviour and also because it continued with the infringement even after it knew the investigation was going on. "Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on videogames. They have the right to buy the consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high," Monti added. The  price fixing  affected the Nintendo, Super Nintendo and N64 consoles, and the hand-held Game Boy.

HD      Smoking  Gun antitrust violation brings  Nintendo  EUR149million  fine, Sotheby's fined tooL WC     486 words

The European Commission today imposed heavy fines on Nintendo, the  video game s maker, and Sotheby's, the fine arts auction house. Nintendo and seven of its distributors were  fined for colluding to prevent exports, primarily of Game Boy consoles, from low-priced EU countries - particularly from the UK
- to high-priced ones. Sotheby's was  fined for colluding with Christie's for fixing  commission fees and other trading terms.

Nintendo, which has already indicated its surprise at the level of the  fine ( the fifth largest ever imposed for any anti-trust violation), was found to ha ve put pressure on its distributors to make sure that its products did not en d up on the grey market. Its EUR149million  fine was imposed largely because Nintendo allegedly tried to mislead the  Commission and continued in its anti-competitive conduct even after the  European Commission had started its investigation.

TD
Tom Heide, competition law expert at Bristows, commented: "Both cases deal with serious violations of competition law and send a very strong message to companies: don't disregard the competition rules. Specifically, don't try to restrict parallel trade in the EU and don't price fix.

The fine imposed on Nintendo is somewhat surprising but clearly shows that th e EC is clamping down on anyone ignoring competition law. Restrictions on pa rallel trade in the EU represent one of the most serious infringements of the EC competition rules, as was recently demonstrated in the  fine levied
against Volkswagen for systematically forcing its authorised dealers in Italy to refuse to sell Volkswagen and Audi cars to foreign buyers.  Price-fixing between competitors like Sotheby's and Christie's should be an obvious no-no, but companies still try to get away with it."

The investigation into Sotheby's and Christie's likewise dealt with one of th e most serious forms of anti-competitive conduct, cartel behaviour. Only So theby's ended up being  fined in the investigation because Christie's went to the European Commission and "spilt the beans", thereby benefiting from the leniency rules providing full immunity from fines in certain circumstances. These rules did not help Sotheby's which ended up with a EUR20.4million  fine in the EU. In the US, where the antitrust authorities also investigated the two companies, Sotheby's was also  fined, and the ex-Sotheby's chairman tycoon Alfred Taubman, was personally  fined $7.5 million and sentenced to a year and a day in jail.
Criminalisation of  cartel behaviour is one of the controversial issues that a re currently on the agenda in
UK in the Enterprise Bill.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The  European Union zapped Japanese video game maker Nintendo and its distributors with  fines worth 167.8 million  euros ($165 million) on Wednesday for cooperating to keep prices high.
Nintendo said it was surprised by the size of the  fine and would appeal.

TD
The European Commission said it fined the eight firms for using anti-competitive practices in the
1990s.
"Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games,"
Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a news conference.

"They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer," she added.

Nintendo, the world's number two  video-game maker, got the biggest  fine, 149 million euros, "to reflect its size in the market concerned".

"In view of the size of the  fine, which Nintendo finds surprising, Nintendo will lodge an appeal," the company said in a statement.

The fine compared with the firm's annual sales to the year ending March 31 of more than 550 billion yen ($4.5 billion).

Nintendo said it accepted the  Commission finding that until 1998 its distribution practices had not complied with European Union competition rules, but said it had since taken measures to rectify the situation.

British airport services and newspaper and magazine distribution firm John Menzies said the punishment it received was totally disproportionate and it might appeal.

"Menzies considers this totally disproportionate in the light of the company's involvement in and the duration of the offence and the company's high level of co-operation with the authorities," it said after being fined 8.64 million euros.

"The company and its advisers will study the full text of the decision (which is yet to be received by the company) and today's announcement further with a view to a possible appeal."
MARKET COLLUSION

The Commission said the eight firms had colluded to limit cross-border flow of its products in an effort to raise prices.
"The Commission will not tolerate ... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the
European single market," Torres said.

She added that the  fine was the fifth largest ever imposed against a  cartel by the Commission and that Nintendo's 149 million  euro share was the fourth largest individual sanction.

A spokesman for Nintendo of America told Reuters last week that the company had set aside funds to deal with the  fine.

The Commission said it believed Nintendo and seven of its distributors participated in a "cartel-like" arrangement with the aim of partitioning the market and inflating wholesale prices for its consoles and games.
The Commission started its investigation in 1995 and Nintendo started cooperating with it in late
1997, the Commission said.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) -
European Union competition
authorities fined Japanese video game maker Nintendo
and its distributors 167.8 million euros on Wednesday for

anti-competitive practices during the 1990s.

TD
The fine on Nintendo alone was 149 million  euros "to reflect its size in the market concerned", the
European Commission said in a statement.

"The European Commission has imposed a total  fine of 167.8 million  euros on Japanese video      games maker Nintendo and seven of its official distributors in  Europe for colluding to prevent exports to high-priced from low-priced countries," the statement said.

In 2000, the  Commission accused Nintendo, the world's number two  video game maker, of collaborating with distributors to limit cross-border flow of its products in an effort to raise wholesale prices.

"Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer," Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a news briefing.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Spokesman Jonathan Faull said  European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy would hold a news conference at 1245 CET/1145 GMT on Wednesday about a  Commission proposal for mechanisms to ensure that drugs intended to combat transmissible diseases in poor countries were not diverted back into the European Union. At 1445/1345 GMT on Wednesday, there will be a VIP corner with  European Commission President Romano Prodi and Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid.
Faull said copies of the  Commission's Work Programme for 2003 would be available from Wednesday.

INSTITUTIONS-DEBATE

Faull said the  Commission was currently holding an intial debate to prepare its position on the institutional questions raised by the Convention on the future of the EU.

A document setting out this position was due to be published in mid-November, Faull said, adding that a news release would be issued if anything concrete came out of Wednesday's debate.

In response to a question, Faull said the structure of the debate was set by a list of questions selected by European Commission President Romano Prodi on the basis of institutional discussions in other forums. - - - -
CARTELS-NINTENDO

Spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the Commission had on Wednesday fined Japanese video game maker Nintendo and its distributors 167.8 million euros for anti-competitive practices during the 1990s.

She said that 149 million  euros of the total fine was imposed against Nintendo, and the rest distributed among seven of its official distributors in Europe for colluding to prevent exports to high-priced from
low-priced countries.

"Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer," Torres said.
"The Commission will not tolerate... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the  European
single market," she added.

Torres said the  fine was the fifth-largest  fine ever imposed against a  cartel by the Commission and that Ninetendo's 149 million  euro fine was the fourth largest individual sanction.

CARTELS-AUCTIONEERS

Torres said the Commission had fined Sotheby's auction house 20.4 million  euros on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s, but had let off fellow auctioneer Christie's.
The European Commission said in a statement it had found that the two had colluded to fix
commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

Torres said Christe's had escaped  fines as it had been the first to provide crucial evidence which enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the  cartel.

"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," she quoted  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti as saying.

Sotheby's former chairman Alfred Taubman was convicted last December in New York of conspiring with Christie's former chairman, Anthony Tennant, to fix auction  commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars.

Both companies had applied for leniency by the  Commission, which had the right to  fine them up to 10 percent of their annual turnover. In reply to a question, Torres said the  fine on Sotheby's was equal to six percent of its annual turnover.

In response to other questions, Torres said the auction houses had a right to reply, and to appeal any Commission decision to the  European Court of Justice, but that they did not face jail sentences in Europe because the EU has no criminal anti-cartel rules. Civil lawsuites like those brought by consumers in the U.S. could not be ruled out, she added.
The two firms agreed to jointly pay clients $512 million. Sotheby's paid a further $45 million in criminal
fines in the United States and another $70 million to shareholders.

CARTELS-GAMES

In reply to a question, Torres said the Commission had closed an investigation into alleged illegal practices similar to those of Nintendo by games makers Sega and Sony.
- ~- --
CARTELS-DVDs
In response to another question, Torres declined to comment on a  Commission probe of the EU's DVD
retail market.
- ~- --
STATE AID-ITALY
Torres was asked to comment on an article on state aid by Commissioner Mario Monti published in
Italian newspaper Corrierre della Serra.

She said the  Commission had last year identified Italy and Germany as having the highest EU levels of state aid paid to an individual industry. EU leaders had agreed this type of state aid needed to be reduced in favour of less competition-distorting subsidies, she added.

Torres said overall state aid in the EU had been substantially reduced over the years, but that at 80 billion euros it still remained at a very high level.

HD       Fix - Price fiddle costs Nintendo  £89m. BY        By CLINTON MANNING, Business Editor.

VIDEO games giant Nintendo and seven of its distributors were yesterday fined £101million for price   
fixing.

The European Commission punished the firms for using anti-competitive practices in the 1990s. Spokeswoman Amelia Torres said: "Every year, millions spend large amounts of money on  video           games. They have the right to buy  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can offer."

TD
Nintendo, the world's number two  video game maker, got the biggest  fine of £89million.

The firm accepted that between 1991 and 1998 its distribution practices breached EU rules but said in a statement: "In view of the size of the  fine, we will appeal."

British distributor John Menzies was  fined £5.2million. A spokesman said the  fine was "totally disproportionate" and it may appeal.

The Commission ruled the eight firms had colluded to limit cheap imports of Nintendo products. In 1996 certain games, such as Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendo products were found to be 65 per cent cheaper in the UK than in the Netherlands and Germany.

VIDEO game giants Nintendo have been  fined £101million in a Europeancartel-busting action.

The European Commission said the company and seven distributors artificially kept prices high by keeping cheaper imported Nintendo products off the shelves.

TD
Scottish firm John Menzies, Nintendo's official distributors in Britain are considering an appeal against the £5.2million  fine they have been given.
The EC said distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were also involved. The ruling was relayed to Menzies bosses yesterday.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games.
"They have the right to buy  games and the consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer." The EC ruled that Nintendo prevented distributors selling their goods from cheaper EU countries to
those where they were up to 65 per cent more expensive.
Last night, a Menzies spokeswoman said: "We believe this  fine to be disproportionate.
"The company involved in this was a subsidiary which is no longer connected to John Menzies. "The level of this  fine is higher than previous  fines handed out for similar offences."
Nintendo are to appeal against the size of the  fine.

THE games manufacturer Nintendo was  fined #92.4 million by the  European Commission
yesterday for trying to rig prices.

Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, said the firm and seven of its distributors had run a "cartel-like" arrangement between 1991 and 1998.

TD
The prices for consoles and  games in Britain were as much as 65 per cent cheaper than in
Germany, he said.

The Japanese company told distributors not to export to retailers where the price was higher, on threat of being cut off. At one point Nintendo goods on the Spanish market were 67 per cent more expensive than in Britain.

The commission also fined several Nintendo distributors, including John Menzies, which had the sole UK distribution rights until 2000, through its THE  Games company. The firm was  fined #5.4 million.

David Mackay, chief executive of John Menzies, said yesterday that the fine was "totally disproportionate". He said the firm participated fully with the commission.
John Menzies became Nintendo's UK distributor in 1995. In 1996, the firm began exporting to
European wholesalers to the dismay of the Japanese company.
"Nintendo cut off our supply for eight weeks until we got the EC to force them to restart it," he said. Mr Mackay said John Menzies was "compelled" by Nintendo to join in the practices.
"We feel that the EC has not fully recognised their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression."
Nintendo said it would be appealing against the size of the  fine.

HD   John Menzies hit by 5.4m pounds  fine from EC. BY    GARETH MACKIE.

JOHN Menzies, the Edinburgh-based newspaper distributor, has been  fined 5.4 million pounds by the European Commission after a seven-year investigation into its involvement in a  price-fixing cartel organised by Japanese video game giant Nintendo.

The Commission fined Nintendo #94m for keeping prices artificially high in some  European markets by illegally collaborating to limit cross-border sales in the 1990s.

TD
Nintendo's products, such as game cartridges and the N64 and GameBoy consoles, were found to be up to
67 per cent cheaper in the UK than in other  European countries, and the company prevented distributors
from exporting the goods at the lower prices.
Seven of the company's official  European distributors, including John Menzies, were  fined a total of
#13.2m, but Menzies was handed the largest fine, #5.4m, because the  Commission said it "carried on
with the illicit behaviour even after the Commission had started its investigation". Menzies distributed
Nintendo's consoles and  games through its THE Games subsidiary, which was shut down last year when
the group repositioned itself. A spokesman said the group considered the  fine "totally disproportionate in
the light of the company's involvement in, and the duration of, the offence and the company's high level of
co-operation with the authorities".

He said the Commission had recognised there was no "deliberate intention to breach competition regulations", and Menzies would consider an appeal once it had studied the full text of the decision.

Chief executive David Mackay said: "We feel that the EC has not fully recognised, in the level of this fine, their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression." He said THE Games "was more victim than villain", had a limited involvement in the  cartel and co-operated fully with the EC's investigation.
He added: "This  fine will be treated as an operating exceptional cost."

A spokesman for Nintendo said the company had set aside funds to deal with the  fine, which is the fourth-largest ever handed down by  European competition authorities on an individual company for a single offence. But he added: "In view of the size of the  fine, which Nintendo finds surprising, Nintendo will lodge an appeal."

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said the heavy  fine reflected Nintendo's size in the market and its role as the "driving force behind the illicit behaviour".

Nintendo, the world's second largest  video game maker, said it accepted the  Commission's finding that, until 1998, its distribution practices had not complied with  European competition rules, but it has since "taken measures to rectify the situation".

JAPANESE video game maker Nintendo pledged to appeal against the EuropeanCommission's decision to fine it 149 million euro for anti-competitive practices. It said the level of the fine was "surprising" even though it accepted the  Commission's finding that until 1998 its distribution practices were in breach of EU anti-trust rules.

FINES of Euro 167.8 million ( £109 million) were imposed yesterday by Europe's competition watchdog on Nintendo, the world's second-largest maker of video games, and several of its distributors for forcing some gamers in  Europe to pay higher prices than their British counterparts.

The European Commission found that during the 1990s the price of popular  video game franchises such as Super Mario Bros and Donkey Kong had been as much as 65 per cent cheaper in Britain. It is thought that this might be because the  games are made in English and translation costs are involved for nonEnglish speaking countries.

TD
Nintendo, the company behind the Game Boy and GameCube machines, was found to have pressed its distributors to ensure that products did not end up on the "grey market". This stopped them being exported from low-priced countries to more expensive ones such as Germany and the Netherlands.

Mario Monti, the  European Competition Commissioner, said: "Every year millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. We will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."

Signor Monti is sometimes referred to as "Super Mario", after one of Nintendo's most famous computer game characters, for his aggressive stance against anti-competitive behaviour.

Nintendo will be forced to pay £96.8 million because, the  Commission said, of its role as the ringleader and "because it continued with the infringement even after it knew the investigation was going on".

John Menzies, the newspaper distributor and Nintendo's agent in Britain, was  fined £5.61 million for its role in the affair. The  Commission said that John Menzies was boycotted for failing to comply with the price-fixing, but fell into line after 1996. Brussels said that Nintendo, which is based in Japan, and
John Menzies had co-operated with investigators from December 1997, bringing reduced  fines.

In handing down the judgment the  Commission unveiled "smoking gun" evidence in the form of memos between the two, which had been voluntarily handed to investigators. A note from a John Menzies representative in April 1996 said: "I am sure that we can, by working closely together,

better control the situation on grey imports and find a much better way of isolating our products and our prices to within the shores of the UK, thus reducing the impact that this differential pricing has upon mainland Europe."

Nintendo, which had sales last year of about £2.89 billion, was surprised by the size of the  fine, the fifth largest by the  Commission for anti-competitive behaviour. It accepted the finding that until 1998 its distribution practices had not complied with EU competition rules. However, it argued that it had taken measures to rectify the situation, and will appeal. John Menzies called the punishment disproportionate to its role, adding that it also might appeal.

WMRC       Perspective
Significance            In one day,       the
Commission meted out the
fourth-highest fine for breaches of EU       competition legislation and agreed to increase co-operation in relation to      merger scrutiny with its trans-Atlantic trade partner.

TD

Implications            Strong       signals were sent out by the

Commission yesterday that competition rules      are there to be abided by and will be enforced with an iron fist. However,      it was not all doom and gloom, as the Christie's/Sotheby's case proved the       whistle-blowing provisions are doing their job.
Outlook                 Increased       co-operation with the US should bring speedier, more convergent decisions       for merger decisions that come under scrutiny in both jurisdictions.      However, this is just the first step and more work is needed.

Yesterday Japanese  video game maker Nintendo and seven of its official distributors across the European Union (EU) were hauled over the coals by the  European Commission yesterday. The manufacturer and its seven distributors - John Menzies plc (Nintendo's distributor for the United Kingdom), Concentra, Produtos para criancas S.A. (Portugal), Linea GIG. S.p.A. (Italy), Bergsala AB (Sweden), the Greek unit of Japan's Itochu Corp, Nortec A.E. (Greece), and the Belgian unit of Germany's CD-Contact Data GmbH - were found guilty of colluding to prevent exports to high-priced countries from lower-priced countries between 1991 and 1998. The prevention of parallel imports was enforced by Nintendo by targeting those that did not play ball with smaller shipments, or by boycotting them altogether.


Page 53 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nintendo bore the brunt of the  fine, a huge 167.8m  euro (US$165.5m) - unsurprisingly really when it was not only the instigator of the illegal practice, but continued to indulge in it despite the ongoing anti-trust investigation, as well as trying to mislead the Commission as to how widely spread the behaviour was. The other seven shared the remainder of the fine between them. The  fine is the fifth highest ever handed down to a cartel - although Nintendo's share is the fourth biggest to a single player - by the  Commission, and possibly the highest penalty for vertical infringement.

Commission Brings Down Hammer on Auction Houses'  Price-Fixing

In another anti-trust case yesterday, the  European Commission ruled that two leading  fine arts auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, had failed to abide by the trading bloc's competition rules, particularly Article 81(1) of the EU treaty, which bans agreements or concerted practices that fix prices, limit production or share out markets. For a period of nearly seven years, the two operated a  cartel, colluding
in order to fix both  commission fees and trading terms in a bid to reduce the previously fierce competition between the two world leaders in the field. The offending deal was brokered in 1993 between the then chairman of Sotheby's, Alfred Taubman, and Anthony Tennant of Christie's. However, once the agreement collapsed in 2000, Christie's approached both the US and  European anti-trust authorities with proof of the cartel, so securing more lenient treatment under the jurisdictions' whistle-blowing provisions, a move that was subsequently followed by Sotheby's when it furnished the EU with further evidence of the  cartel.

In deciding that the two auction houses had infringed the  European rules, the Commission had the power to apply fines of up to 10% of the undertakings' world-wide turnover. However, the Commission decided to fine Sotheby's 20.4m  euro, equating to 6% of its world-wide turnover, incorporating a 40% reduction for its co-operation, whereas Christie's escaped under the leniency provisions. The two now have three months to pay the  fines, or two months to appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI).

The case, which has already been scrutinised in the US (see US: 7 December 2001: Sotheby's Chief Found Guilty), is indicative of the kind of co-operation that can work well between the two trans-Atlantic powers. The case was expedited due to an agreement from both Sotheby's and Christie's to allow confidential information to be shared between the anti-trust bodies. The level of co-operation looks to be a sign of things to come, with a recent agreement paving the way for increased co-operation between the two in the hope of heading off another GE/Honeywell affair at the pass.
Greater EU-US Co-operation

In a bid to put this new-found co-operation on a more formal footing, the US and the EU published an overview of their best-practice guidelines relating to mergers yesterday. The guidelines are the result of extensive deliberations by a working group comprised of senior members of the two anti-trust agencies. Crucially, the guidelines support tandem scrutiny of mergers, speeding up the process and hopefully ruling out any embarrassing differences of opinion in the future and making the whole procedure more effective. Co-operation is to be increased in other areas as well, including:
The collection and evaluation of evidence. Improved communication between the respective agencies. Outlook and Implications
The Nintendo case demonstrates that behaviour contravening the competition rules that are in place to safeguard business and consumers alike will not be tolerated. In addition, the imposition of such a hefty fine on the main protagonist, Nintendo itself, shows that the  Commission tries to be even-handed in dishing out punishment, hitting those hardest that coerced such errant practices. Further, the lack of a  fine for Christie's goes some way towards demonstrating how effective the whistle-blowing provisions are. Without the information that was handed to them on a plate, the authorities would have been unlikely to have uncovered the cartel so quickly and the public and their competitors could have faced years of more damage.

In addition, the publication of guidelines outlining the way the anti-trust authorities in the EU and US should co-operate has been a long time coming. Undoubtedly spurred on by the debacle that was GE/Honeywell, the decision to increase co-operation and try to come to some mutually acceptable decision when scrutinising mergers will be welcomed by any businesses contemplating trans-Atlantic mergers. The increased co-operation should mean more speedy decisions as well.

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - Nintendo  receives large fine. WC  469 words

Brussels, 30/10/2002 (Agence Europe) - The Japanese manufacturer of videogames, Nintendo and seven of its official distributors in Europe have had a substantial  fine inflicted on them, for a total of 167.8 million euro (149 million of which or Nintendo alone) on the part of the European Commission, for having impeded the marketing of low-price products. This  fine is the fifth largest the Commission has ever
inflicted in an anti-cartel decision. The procedure was initiated in April 2000 against Nintendo and seven of its distributors: Nintendo of  Europe GmbH (jointly responsible with Nintendo Corp.), John Menzies plc
(UK), Concentra-Produtos para criancas SA (Portugal), Linea GIC Spa (Italy), Bersala AB (Sweden), the
Greek branch of the Japanese firm Itochu Corp Nortec AE and the Belgian branch of the German firm
CD-Contact Data GmbH.

TD
In its in-depth investigation, the  Commission was able to gather proof that Nintendo and its distributors had colluded to maintain artificially high price differences in the EU between January 1991 and 1998. The most flagrant price differences were recorded in Germany and in the Netherlands in 1996 where prices were as much as 65% higher for certain products than in the United Kingdom, and in Spain in 1997, with price differences of 67%, still compared with the British market. the  Commission accuses Nintendo's distributors of having agreed to prevent parallel trade from their territories (i.e., exports from one country to another via unofficial distribution channels), through a total boycott or a reduction in their supplies, which is a serious infringement of Article 81 of the EC Treaty (cartels). "When there are such high price differences, it is legitimate for companies to see an opportunity to trade in or import products from third countries where they are cheaper, whereas Nintendo obstructed this parallel trade", stressed the spokesperson for
commerce, Amelia Torres. Nintendo, which instigated the  cartel, like John Menzies (8.64 million  euro         fine), continued the practices even after the opening of the investigation, which constitutes aggravating circumstances. However, the  Commission took account of the fact that the company and its distributor collaborated in the investigation, and looked favourably upon Nintendo's decision to offer large financial compensations to third parties having suffered injury. Commissioner Monti commented on the decision as follows: "Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high".
Reacting to the decision, Nintendo acknowledges that its practices were, until 1998, an infringement to the
European rules of competition but disputes the size of the  fine and will appeal on that score.

JAPANESE computer games maker Nintendo was fined almost £100 million by the  European                  Commission yesterday for price fixing.

The company and seven of its  European distributors were  fined a total of £106 million for keeping prices in some European markets high by illegally collaborating to limit cross-border sales during the 1990s.

UK wholesaler and distributor John Menzies was yesterday  fined £5.4 million for its part in a  price-fixing
deal involving Nintendo, the Japanese computer  games company.

The fine was part of a £106 million penalty imposed on Nintendo and seven of its European distributors by the European Union on Nintendo and seven of its official distributors in Europe. The Commission said Nintendohad operated a  cartel to keep prices artificially high in the EU market throughout most of the 1990s.

TD
It also said that cheaper Nintendo prices in the UK had tempted traders into re-exporting its products to higher priced countries such as Germany where they were up to 65 per cent dearer.

According to the  Commission, Menzies had written in a memo to assisted rather than resisted the user? Instead of having weights and pulleys that you fought against to increase your muscle-power, why couldn't they be your friends?

The story of how effective design turned an inspiring idea into a success will be told at Millennium Point, Birmingham, on November 18, when the Design Council's annual Design in Business Week comes to the city.

Cliff's first step was to ring former partner Chris Weaving, who had also taken early retirement, and talked him into returning to the fray. Cliff sold up and returned to the West Midlands - 'home turf - I knew how to get things done there' - and together they engineered a series of prototype machines that would encourage the less athletic to improve their fitness levels, rather than humiliating them by setting targets they had no hope of achieving.

Basically, the Exten System is a high-tech motorised chair that can be programmed to suit all muscle groups and which, its makers claim, can provide even the most out-of-condition user with a beneficial exercise circuit.

At the end of the session, instead of a resounding 'clang' as you finally admit defeat and let the weights fall to the floor, the Exten glides silently to a halt and provides you with a read-out which shows how much effort you have expended. You leave the place with a spring in your step, fuelled with the determination to do better next time. A congratulatory pat on the back, in other words, rather than a loud and embarrassing ticking-off which brings a knowing smile to the face of every gym-bunny within earshot.
But there's many a slip 'twixt brilliant idea and best-seller. 'It was as if we'd unveiled a car without
wheels,' Cliff Johnson recalls, 'and people are resistant to change. We knew we were on to a winner, but
something wasn't quite right.'

So Exten called for help - from the local Business Link office - who at once identified a problem. Sure, it was a great idea, they said, but the machine looked wrong. More like an instrument of torture than a leisure product. Why not soften the lines and make it more user friendly? That way, more women might be tempted to try it. Business Link recommended three designers, and a Leicester company won the contract.

Transforming the product cost between £15,000 and £20,000 but Cliff Johnson regards it as money well spent. 'The redesign has made it easier to sell,' he says, 'and the more people who use it, the more word gets around.'

To date, Exten has sold more than 20 complete systems costing £50,000 apiece. Their Stechford factory now employs seven full-timers, and they reckon the manufacture of each system creates four or five new jobs for the region.

Among their customers is the former Aston Villa manager Ron Saunders, who bought a leg extension machine following a hip replacement. Now he swears by it. When a leisure centre at Huyton, Liverpool invested in a system, GPs began referring disabled patients there, with remarkable results. A woman in Henley-onThames trimmed nine inches off her waist in 14 weeks, and there are scores of other success stories.
Exten's own success story proves two things. One is that thoughtful design can turn a good product into
a great one. And the other is that like many of the best ideas - ring pull cans, the paperclip, and the chord
structure of Yesterday - the simple ones can have the greatest impact.
To attend the Design in Business Week event, visit  www.designcouncil.org.uk or call 020 7378 7414. Nintendo: 'I am sure that we can, by working closely together, better control the situation on grey imports
and find a much better way of isolating our products and our prices to within the shores of the UK, thus
reducing the impact that this differential pricing has upon mainland  Europe.'

Menzies said it considered the  fine to be 'totally disproportionate in the light of the company's involvement in and the duration of the offence and the company's high level of cooperation with the authorities'.

The company also said it will consider all its options carefully and will treat the  fine as an operating exceptional cost. It added that the it had operated distribution practices inherited from the period when Nintendo did its own distribution in the UK. Menzies chief executive, David Mackay said: 'We feel that the EC has not fully recognised, in the level of this  fine, their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake and was not a deliberate transgression.'
Nintendo said it would appeal against the size of the  fine, the fourth largest ever handed out by Brussels.

BRUSSELS (Nikkei)--The  European Commission announced Wednesday that it has  fined Nintendo Co. (7974) and seven of its affiliated distributors around 168 million euros, or roughly 20 billion yen, for fixing prices on game machines and game software sold in European Union countries.
Nintendo itself was  fined 149 million euros, or roughly 18 billion yen.

TD
The fine is the highest ever imposed on a Japanese company under the EU fair competition law.

The same day, Nintendo announced an intention to appeal the decision to EU judicial authorities, complaining that the  fine was excessively high.

Among the seven distributors was Itochu Corp. (8001), which marketed Nintendo's products in Greece. Itochu has been  fined 4.5 million euros, or about 540 million yen.

The European Commission has charged Nintendo with collaborating with distributors based in countries like the U.K. and Italy from 1991 to 1998 to prevent the movement of its products from countries where they were sold at low prices to those where they were sold at higher prices. As a result, price differences for the same goods across EU countries amounted to a maximum 65%, the commission said.
The European Commission began a full-scale investigation into Nintendo's practices in the spring of
2000. Nintendo has since changed its sales methods in  Europe. The commission has determined that
its marketing method no longer presents a problem.
Nintendo sold 5 million  video game consoles and 12 million game software copies in  Europe in 1997. (The Nihon Keizai Shimbun Thursday morning edition)

NINTENDO and seven of its distributors were yesterday  fined a total of #101 million by the  European    Commission for trying to rig the computer game market.
The company was found guilty by anti-trust officials of attempting to keep prices artificially high in some
European Union states between 1991 and 1998.

TD
Distributors in Portugal, Italy, Sweden, Greece and Belgium were part of the price  cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo videogames from cheaper sources.

Nintendo, the world's number two  video-game maker, was fined #89 million. A #5.2 million penalty was imposed on John Menzies, the Scottish firm, which was heavily implicated in the plot.
The fine compared with the firm's annual sales to the year ending 31 March of more than #2.9 billion. Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, said: "Every year, millions of families spend large
amounts of money on video games. They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest
price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices
artificially high."

The fine was welcomed by the Consumers' Association, but it said the case highlighted the need for the public to recover damages as a result of corporate lawbreaking.

Allan Asher, the campaigns director for the association, said: "This conduct, which affected millions of consumers, amounts to theft from consumers. While the  fine is welcome, consumers are still out of pocket.

"The UK parliament is currently debating a bill which will allow consumers to gain compensation in similar cases bought in the UK. We hope this case speeds up the process."

During the 1990s, UK prices were generally the lowest in the EU, a situation that tempted outside traders into re-exporting cheap goods into high-price markets. Nintendo's aim was to block such "grey" imports, which could undermine its official retail prices.

The most striking price differences were spotted in 1996, when some of the company's  games and products were up to 65 per cent cheaper in the UK than in the Netherlands and Germany. At one point, Nintendo goods on the Spanish market were 67 per cent more expensive than in the UK, with Italy 54 per cent more expensive and Sweden 39 per cent.

During 1997, the UK price for all N64 consoles and game cartridges was, on average, 33 per cent lower than anywhere else in the EU.

The commission yesterday revealed a memo written by John Menzies for Nintendo in April 1996, outlining its prices strategy. It said: "I am sure that we can, by working closely together, better control the situation on grey imports and find a much better way of isolating our products and our prices to within the shores of the UK, thus reducing the impact that this differential pricing has on mainland  Europe."

Page 64 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A subsequent letter from the company described how it had either shut off supplies of cheaper imports completely or restricted the supply of products into the UK marketplace to "certain questionable retailers".

What was happening, the  commission explained, was that in collusion with the parent company, each distributor was under the obligation to prevent "parallel" trade. It said: "Under the leadership of Nintendo, the companies intensively collaborated to find the source of any parallel trade, traders that allowed parallel exports to occur were punished by being given smaller shipments or by being boycotted altogether."

The UK end of the operation was conducted by The  Games Ltd, part of John Menzies, which became Nintendo's official distributor for the UK and Ireland in 1995, the year the  commission's investigation began.

The inquiry gained momentum when, in December 1997, John Menzies and, subsequently, Nintendo decided to co-operate with the  Commission.

The huge fine on the parent company reflects the fact it was the "driving force" behind the illegal operation and also because it continued attempting to interfere with the market even after it knew the investigation was going on, said the  commission.
The fine is the fifth largest imposed by the  commission for anti-trust breach of EU rules.

In a statement, Nintendo said it had co-operated fully with the  commission's investigation and, following an internal review in late 1997, voluntarily provided much of the information relied upon by the Commission in taking its decision.

The company accepted its distribution practices did not comply with EU rules, but said it had now rectified this. However, it will appeal against the size of the  fine.

John Menzies described its  fine of #5.4 million as "totally disproportionate" and said it was considering legal options.

David Mackay, the chief executive, said: "We feel the EC has not fully recognised, in the level of this  fine, their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression."
He added that its The  Games subsidiary was "more victim than villain".

JOHN Menzies has been hit with a hefty #5.4 million  fine by the EuropeanCommission for its role in a computer game price-fixing cartel run by Japanese elecrontics giant Nintendo.
The Edinburgh-based distribution company insisted it was the "victim not the villain" in the case.

TD
With six other companies across  Europe, however, Menzies - Nintendo's sole UK distributor in 1995-97
- has been accused of "colluding to prevent trade" between EU countries.

A whopping 149 million (#94 million)  fine has been thrown at Nintendo itself - the fourth highest penalty levied against a single company by the EC's competition  commission.
John Menzies chief executive David Mackay said: "We are the victim not the villain in this whole thing. "We were the company that was trying to encourage free trade, we were the ones being leaned on -
and that is something they accepted previously."

Menzies is currently locked in talks with its lawyers over a possible appeal - particularly in relation to the "totally disproportionate" size of the  fine. The company accepts it broke competition rules, but claims it had no "deliberate intention" of doing so.

European competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games.

"They have the right to buy  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can offer, and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."
Monti branded Nintendo "the driving force behind the illicit behaviour".
Along with Menzies, distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were part of the price
cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo  games from cheaper sources, Monti said.

A Nintendo spokesman said the company did not contest the charges, but intended to appeal against the size of its  fine.
Menzies subsidiary, THE  Games, was selling Nintendo  games and consoles at wholesale prices up to
65 per cent less than some other  European countries in 1996 and 97, amid fierce competition in the
UK market, the report said.

Retailers from other  European countries started to trade with Menzies rather than their local distributors, prompting Nintendo to cut off supplies to Menzies in the run up to Christmas 1996 as a warning for disrupting the  cartel.

But Menzies caved into the pressure. In letters written by Menzies to Nintendo, the company said: "A significant amount of activity has been undertaken by THE  Games with a view to stopping the grey exporting of products from the UK into the continental market."

Menzies also said it was finding new ways of "isolating our products and our prices to within the shores of the UK" - breaching the  European Union's free trade regulations.
Mackay claimed the EC had taken the comments "completely out of context". He added: "The
commission seems to have misunderstood the situation completely."
The fine will be charged as a one-off operational expense and will not alter its dividend policy.

101million for rigging the market.
The European Commission found they acted to maintain artificially high prices for seven years up to
1998. Nintendo was fined Pounds 89million, while UK distributor John Menzies was hit with a Pounds
5.2million penalty.

TD
A two-year probe found prices in Britain were up to 65 per cent cheaper than in  Europe.

But a price  cartel acted to prevent the sale of  games from the UK to countries where the price was higher.

John Menzies hit out at the scale of the  fine, insisting: "It was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression."

Nintendo has been ordered to pay a  fine of Euros 149m ( $145m, £94m) for unfairly carving up the
European market for its best-selling Game Boy hand-held  video game.

European Union regulators said Nintendo breached competition rules by preventing its  European
distributors from competing against one another in order to keep prices high.

TD
After a seven-year investigation, the  European Commission found that each distributor was given an exclusive territory to sell Game Boy.

According to the Brussels authorities, Nintendo and its distributors made sure that products were not imported across countries in order to avoid price competition.

As a result, consumers in countries where Game-Boy and its  games had a high price-tag could not buy lower-priced, imported products.

The practice is in breach of competition rules and the principles of the EU single market, which state that goods should circulate freely within the Union, the  Commission concluded.

Game Boy is crucial to Nintendo's growth. Unlike the cut-throat market for game consoles, where Nintendo competes with the likes of Microsoft and Sony, the Japanese group has a virtual monopoly in hand-held video games.
City analysts said that last year,  European sales of Game Boy hardware and software were more than
Euros 850m, almost a third of its worldwide revenues of more than  Euros 3bn.

The period of the  Commission's investigation, which began in 1995, coincided with a boom in Game Boy's popularity. According to the Brussels authorities, by 1997 Nintendo had sold 55m Game Boy consoles and 235m Game Boy-compatible  games worldwide.

HD         EU fines Nintendo  £94m for rip-off. BY         By Andrew Osborn in Brussels.

Nintendo, the Japanese video games manufacturer, was yesterday found guilty of ripping off its customers in continental Europe for most of the 1990s and  fined £94m by the European commission. Edinburgh-based John Menzies, the sole UK distributor of Nintendo products, was also punished for its role in the scam.

The commission said Menzies had helped Nintendo operate the  price-fixing cartel along with distributors in six other European countries and fined it £5.5m. Nintendo immediately said it would appeal against the size of the fine although it did not contest the  commission's findings.

TD
The commission said that the  fine was the fourth largest ever and reflected the seriousness of the offence. "The fine ... reflects its size in the market concerned [it is the second largest maker of videogames in the world], the fact that it was the driving force behind the illicit behaviour and also because it continued with the infringement even after it knew the investigation was going on," the Brussels statement said.

The fines would have been "significantly" higher, it added but for the fact that both Nintendo and Menzies had eventually cooperated with the inquiry. However, it noted that Menzies had initially tried to mislead it as to the seriousness of the scam and said that was "an aggravating factor".
The price-fixing concerned the Nintendo 64  games consoles and the pocket versions called Game
Boy together with the accompanying  games cartridges. The  cartel existed, it added, from 1991 until
1998.
"Every year millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on  video games," said Mario
Monti, the EU competition commissioner.

"They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."

The commission found that the UK market was actually one of the cheapest in  Europe but that Nintendo and Menzies colluded to ensure that cheap UK products were not re-exported to continental Europe where prices could be up to 66% dearer.

It said that a subsidiary of Menzies called The  Games had deliberately conspired to prevent Nintendo products being exported from the UK at low prices. It also took the unusual step of reprinting internal Menzies memos in which the firm tells Nintendo it is doing all it can to keep prices high in continental Europe.

"I can tell you that a significant amount of activity has been undertaken by The Games ...with a view to stopping the grey exporting of products from the UK into the continental European market," the memo reads.

"Our major activities in this regard have been either to shut off supplies completely or to really control/restrict the supply of product in the UK marketplace to certain questionable retailers."

However Menzies insisted yesterday that the  commission fine was far too high and hinted it too would appeal.

"Menzies considers this totally disproportionate in the light of the company's involvement in and the duration of the offence and the company's high level of co-operation with the authorities," it said in a statement.

* Quite why bank tellers have to wear uniforms is one thing - but now the newly-merged HBOS is forcing staff at Halifax General Insurance to don corporate colours. Which colours, though? Murmurs of a dispute between managing director Howard Posner and members of his team centre on the colours to be worn by the team of insurance adjusters - the investigators who come around when you make a claim, to check if you really did have an antique heirloom and not just an Ikea kitchen table. According to Post Magazine ("insurance information for insurance professionals"), the split is between those who want the adjusters in blue - the merged Halifax and Bank of Scotland's corporate colour - and those favouring green, the branding scheme of the insurance arm. Surely the two camps could compromise on the most appropriate garb for insurance adjusters: a flowing black hooded cape offset by a charming silver scythe.

* Video games maker Nintendo has just been whacked by the Europeancommission for price-fixing - with a fine that was much bigger than Nintendo expected. We know this, because the press release Nintento sent out after the decision yesterday included a poorly-disguised draft, packed with quotes marked "If  fine over euros 50m" and "Alternative/additional quote if the fine exceeds euros 75m" - which seems like the company's worst case scenario. In the event, Nintendo's fine was euros 150m. Game over.

* For several months, lawyers from our old friend Ryanair deluged Stelios Haji-Ioannou's EasyGroup with threatening letters over its EasyValue shopping website. The letters accused EasyValue of various crimes for including Ryanair in its airfare price comparisons. Suddenly, the letters stopped. Until last week, when an odd one from EireO'Flot's solicitors arrived. "Our client no longer intends to issue legal proceedings against EasyValue.com," it said, "but will be initiating an advertising campaign highlighting the fact that
the EasyValue website consistently confirms that Ryanair offers lower fares than EasyJet." Cue shoulder-shrugging at EasyGroup. "If Ryanair wants to spend money promoting our website, that's  fine by us," was one response.

* WorldCom, like Enron, is a name that's now synonymous with all that was bad about US companies in the last decade - and was the world's biggest bankrupt when it filed for protection owing $40bn. Believe it or not, the company is still staggering along. On Wednesday it won court approval to distribute bonuses worth $25m to "key employees". Let's hope the auditors put it all in the right place this time, and not book it as $3bn in capital spending.

* The dotcom bubble having expanded and popped, even the most successful websites are looking for revenue wherever they can find it. In the case of the ultra-groovy satire site The Onion, the hunt for hard cash includes this ad for Classic Conservatories - "Is there a better value quality PVC conservatory?
Look! Only £1,995". Is it a spoof? It doesn't look like one - although how many Onion readers want to buy
PVC conservatories?

* Why settle for a conservatory - when you can get a free breakfast from George Wimpey? Yes, the builder is offering to send round a free breakfast for the first Sunday after you move into an apartment in one of its new Manchester developments. "A beautifully presented, mouth watering breakfast in bed is the perfect way to start life mortgaged up to your eyeballs for the next 25 years," says the press release. OK, so substitute the "mortgaged up to your eyeballs for the next 25 years" line with something like "in your luxury apartment" - but you get the general idea.

JAPANESE VIDEO games maker Nintendo and seven of its European distributors, including John Menzies, have been fined a total of EUR167.8m (£106m) by the European Commission for rigging the market to keep prices high.

Nintendo said that while it accepted the finding it was surprised at the size of the  fine, which it said it would appeal. The  fine is the fifth largest ever imposed by the  Commission for any anti-trust breach of EU rules.

TD
The Commission determined the company and its distributors acted as a  cartel between 1991 and
1998 to keep prices artificially high, and to keep out cheaper imports from other countries, in breach of
EU rules.

Nintendo was fined EUR149m, while John Menzies was  fined EUR8.64m - which it said it would also appeal.

Distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were also part of the  cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo  video games from cheaper sources.

The European Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, said: "Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on videogames. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer, and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially

But the Consumers' Association said the investigation showed that "the single market isn't working", and added that rather than the  fines being paid to the EU, they should be paid to the individual consumers who had suffered by being forced to pay more.

Surprisingly, UK prices for the  games and products were generally far lower - by up to 65 per cent - than in other EU countries. That tempted traders into re-exporting goods from the UK to markets where the price was higher.

But Nintendo told its distributors in the UK that they were responsible for preventing such "grey" marketing, on the pain of receiving smaller shipments or being cut off from supplies altogether.

The commission revealed a memo written by John Menzies for Nintendo in April 1996 outlining its prices strategy. It said: "I am sure that we can, by working closely together, better control the situation on grey imports and find a much better way of isolating our products and our prices to within the shores of the UK, thus reducing the impact that this differential pricing has on mainland  Europe."

A subsequent letter from the company described how it had either shut off supplies of cheaper imports completely or restricted the supply of products into the UK marketplace to "certain questionable retailers".

Nintendo, the Japanese maker of video games and games-consoles, was hit yesterday with a  fine of EUR149 million for running an illegal cartel to keep prices high and restrict the free flow of its products throughout the  European Union.

Mr Mario Monti, the powerful European Commissioner for Competition, despite being dubbed Super Mario after a character in the Nintendo games, exhibited no sympathy for his namesake and handed down the fourth-highest  cartel fine ever imposed by the Commission on an individual company. European consumers had, he said, "the right to buy games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high".

TD
In a statement, Nintendo said it would appeal against the size of the fine to the European Court of Justice. The  Commission also imposed a further EUR18.8 million in fines on seven of Nintendo's distributors, including John Menzies which has held the distribution rights in Ireland and Britain since
1995.

John Menzies was fined EUR8.64 million, and said it too might appeal. The total of EUR167.8 million in fines was the fifth-highest  fine ever imposed by the Commission on a cartel.

The Commission concluded that between 1991 and 1998 Nintendo and its distributors colluded to maintain differences in price between the various EU countries.

COMPUTER  games company Nintendo has been fined almost €150 million for selling  games and console machines at illegally high prices across Europe.

TD
The Japanese company was before the  European Commission yesterday for  price fixing  and inflating prices in some countries by as much as 65%.

Nintendo's official distributor in Ireland John Menzies was also  fined in the hard-hitting judgement handed down by the EU competition authority.

The company and seven of its  European distributors were  fined a total of 167.8 million for keeping prices in some European markets high by illegally limiting cross-border sales during the 1990s.

The fine on Nintendo, makers of such popular  games as Super Mario, was the fourth largest ever handed down by the EU authorities on a company for a single offence.
The commission said the heavy fine reflected Nintendo's size in the market and its role as the
"driving force behind the illicit behaviour".

The commission said the company prevented distributors selling its goods from cheaper EU countries, such as Britain, to those like Germany and the Netherlands where products were 65% more expensive. The  commission said Nintendo and the distributors collaborated to block traders who made price-cutting cross-border sales.
These traders were punished by being given smaller shipments or by being boycotted altogether. The collusion continued from 1991 to 1998, even after Nintendo knew it was under investigation.
Irish and British prices were the lowest and this tempted outside traders into re-exporting cheap goods into high-price markets.

The most striking price differences were spotted early in 1996 when certain Nintendo  games and products were up to 65% cheaper here and in Britain than in the Netherlands and Germany.

At one point Nintendo goods on the Spanish market were 67% more expensive than here and in Britain. John Menzies distributors yesterday hit out at the scale of the  fine, calling it "totally disproportionate".

Chief executive of the group David Mackay said: "We feel that the EC has not fully recognised, in the level of this  fine, their earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression."

A spokesperson for research company Chart Track, which monitors the sale of  games, said: "Prices of Nintendo  games used to average 80 but now it's fallen to around 55, we have found."

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission fined Japanese computer game maker Nintendo and seven of its European distributors a combined $165 million U.S. yesterday for violating antitrust rules on pricing in the 1990s.

TD
Nintendo Co. Ltd. and seven of its European distributors were  fined a total of 167.8 million  euros ($258.8 million) for keeping prices in some European markets high by illegally collaborating to limit cross-border sales.

The fine on Nintendo was 149 million  euros ($229.8 million) and was fourth-largest ever handed down by the European Union's antitrust authorities on an individual company for a single offence.
In a statement, the  commission said the fine reflected Nintendo's size in the market and its role as the
"driving force behind the illicit behaviour."

In Japan, a company spokesman said Nintendo did not contest the charges but intended to appeal against the size of its  fine, claiming the case against it was based on information voluntarily submitted by the company.

The commission said the company prevented distributors selling its goods from EU countries such Britain where prices were cheaper to those like Germany and the Netherlands, where they were up to 65 per cent more expensive.

"Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer," said EU competition commissioner Mario Monti.
"We will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."

The commission said Nintendo and the distributors "intensively collaborated" to uncover traders who made price-cutting cross-border sales. Such traders were "punished by being given smaller shipments or by being boycotted altogether," the  Commission said.
Other companies  fined were John Menzies PLC, Nintendo's official distributor in Britain;
Concentra-Produtos para criancas S.A. of Portugal; Linea GIG SpA in Italy; Bergsala AB from Sweden;
the Greek unit of Japan's Itochu Corp.; Nortec AE of Greece, and the Belgian unit of Germany's
CD-Contact Data GmbH.

The collusion continued from 1991 to 1998, the  commission said, even after Nintendo knew it was under investigation.

THERE was a trolley dash in Britain's super-market sector this week as the Co-Operative snapped up Alldays for 131 million pounds to become the country's largest convenience store group. Two days later, leading supermarket operator Tesco bought budget outfit T&S Stores for #377m, giving it a five per cent share of the convenience market.

Consignia chairman Allan Leighton was rumoured to have teamed up with Royal Bank of Scotland to table a #3 billion bid for Safeway, but the supermarket chain's trading director Jack Sinclair later dismissed the reports as mere speculation as he unveiled a new #2m marketing campaign.

Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of crippled nuclear power firm British Energy, looked set to leave the East Kilbride-based company - which has seen its shares plunge 95 per cent this year - after it emerged headhunters had been appointed to find his replacement.

Chris Fishwick, the disgraced former head of global closed end funds at Aberdeen Asset Management who denies he is the "unacceptable face of capitalism", told the Treasury Select Committee that 35 controversial split capital investment trusts face collapse.

John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based distributor and baggage handler, was  fined #5.4m by European competition authorities for its involvement in a  cartel organised by Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker, which was itself  fined #94m for keeping prices artificially high outside the UK.

EU commissioners also slapped a #13m  fine on auction house Sotheby's for a  price-fixing scam that defrauded art sellers out of #290m by inflating  commission fees, but rival Christie's, which colluded in the affair, escaped penalty because it provided the damning evidence.

Perth-based bus and train operator Stagecoach looked set to see its 20-year South West Trains franchise cut to seven years by rail regulators after a string of profit warnings, credit rating cuts and an increased commitment for cash from its troubled US subsidiary.

Industrial and public services firm Serco confirmed it had teamed up with Dutch Railways to bid for the seven-year Scot-Rail franchise when it comes up in March.

The Forum of Private Business said 38.8 per cent of SMEs north of the Border reported growth in the second quarter - the highest rate in almost six years and just 1.4 points behind the rest of the UK, which traditionally outperforms Scotland.

Policyholders who lost money with troubled insurer Equitable Life demanded #4bn in compensation from the Government, claiming it failed to adequately regulate the firm.

Figures showed HBOS more than doubled the amount of loans provided for  European buyouts to #7.3bn, filling the gap created by rivals as they scaled back investments.

Aberdeen oil and gas services firm Wood Group saw its shares fall to their lowest level since its #1bn flotation in May, as BP and Shell unveiled lower third-quarter profits.
Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed the economy will grow at a slower rate than the
Government is forecasting, but said there was no need for Chancellor Gordon Brown to raise taxes.

HD   COMPETITION - COMMISSION HITS NINTENDO WITH EURO 149 MILLION FINE FOR CARTEL BEHAVIOUR.
BY    By (BEP).
WC  597 words

LP
The European Commission has decided to impose, on October 30, a  fine of Euro 149 million on Japanese video games maker Nintendo for anti-competitive practices in the 1990s. The  Commission also levied a fine of Euro 18.8 million on seven of the company's official distributors for the role that they played in the cartel which had colluded for years to fix prices for consoles and  video games.

According to evidence uncovered by the  Commission, Nintendo and its distributors colluded to maintain artificially high price differentials in the EU between January 1991 and 1998. Under these arrangements, each distributor was obliged to prevent parallel trade from its territory (in other words, exports from one country to another via unofficial distribution channels). Traders that did not agree to this were punished by being given smaller shipments or by being boycotted altogether.

TD
The amount of  fine for each company can be broken down as follows:
- Nintendo Corporation and Nintendo of  Europe GmbH (jointly liable):  Euro 149.128 million
- John Menzies plc: Euro 8.64 million
- Itochu Corporation:  Euro 4.5 million
- Nortec A.E.:  Euro 1.0 million
- CD-Contact Data GmbH:  Euro 1.0 million
- Linea GIG S.p.A.:  Euro 1.5 million
- Bergsala AB:  Euro 1.25 million
- Concentra - Produtos para criancas S.A.:  Euro 0.825 million

The substantial  fine levied against Nintendo, the fifth largest that the EU has ever imposed for an anti-trust infringement, reflects the fact that it was the driving force behind the illicit behaviour. Both UK retailer John Menzies and Nintendo carried on with their anti-competitive behaviour after the Commission had started its investigation, something which was taken into account when fixing the level of fines. John Menzies also deliberately tried to mislead the  Commission about the real scope of the infringement. However, after
December 1997, both John Menzies and Nintendo co-operated with the Commission, and their help in the case led to a sizeable reduction in the amount they have to pay.The Commission's investigation showed that, during the seven-year period of collusion, price differences in the European Economic Area (EEA) for consoles and video games were both frequent and significant, with the UK usually having the lowest prices. For example, in early 1996, Nintendo products were up to 65% cheaper in the UK than in the Netherlands and Germany. The difference narrowed down but remained significant in 1997, when the UK price for all N64 game consoles and game cartridges was one-third lower than everywhere else in the EEA.Commenting on the decision, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on  video games. They have the right to buy the  games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer and we will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high."

Fine too big?

Nintendo says that it has now modified its distribution practice to comply with EU competition rules. The company has now instigated "a thorough and far-reaching compliance programme" that enables the free flow of product across  Europe. The Commission says it is satisfied with the corrective action taken by Nintendo.

A statement by Nintendo says that it had anticipated the  Commission's fine, so there will be no impact on its business and financial performance this financial year. However, Nintendo is alarmed by the size of the fine, and says it will lodge an appeal to reduce the amount.

THE MORAL meltdown in business continues, with no sign of abating.

In the past week or so alone, Garth Drabinsky, the former theatre impresario, was charged with defrauding investors in Livent Inc. of half a billion dollars over a nine-year period.

TD
Three major U.S. power companies have fired energy traders who fed phony pricing data to industry publications, as part of an alleged price-manipulation scheme that triggered California's power crisis last year.

Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drug maker, has agreed to pay $49 million (U.S.) to settle charges of overcharging the U.S. government health-insurance program for its bestselling cholesterol drug, Lipitor. European regulators have fined auctioneer Sotheby's $20 million over its seven-year
price-fixing conspiracy with rival Christie's, and finedvideogame-maker Nintendo $147 million for price collusion with its distributors that went on for seven years.

Sandy Weill, CEO of Citigroup Inc. and the world's top banker, is under investigation for allegedly pressuring a Citi securities analyst to tout AT&T Corp. shares to Citi's clients in hopes of garnering AT&T's lucrative underwriting business. On Thursday, Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer of Enron Corp., was indicted on 78 counts of fraud and other improprieties related to the collapse of Enron last December.

And Harvey Pitt's resignation as head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission is expected after the revelation Wednesday that his candidate to head a new accounting industry oversight body, centrepiece of U.S. measures to clean up Wall Street, turns out to be the target of an inquiry into his own role as head of the audit committee at a troubled firm under investigation for fraud.
Everywhere you look, business is still behaving badly.

Gwyn Morgan concedes the point. But in an absurd essay in the current issue of Time, the CEO of Calgary's EnCana Corp., the biggest independent oil producer in Canada, attempts to find a moral equivalency between outrages in business and far less damaging transgressions in politics.

The intended effect is to cut the crisis in business down to size and somehow diminish its enormity by yoking it with comparatively trivial malfeasance in government. Watch for this campaign to gather strength in weeks to come.

This month, a small group of academics and businesspeople will meet at Toronto's National Club to ponder a supposed crisis in government ethics. Sponsored by folks associated with the Public Policy Forum, a talking shop for business, government and labour leaders, this new group is under the impression that in the aftermath of the destruction of $8 trillion (U.S.) in shareholder value by greedy,


Page 85 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
inept CEOs in the private sector, the most pressing issue of the moment is cupidity in the public sector.

Yet without denying evidence of periodic tomfoolery in government, it's clear that the scandals that cut short the political careers of Lawrence Mac-Aulay, Art Eggleton and former B.C. premier Glen Clark were penny-ante stuff, having scant impact either on public policy or the public purse. In the telecom industry alone, by contrast, the avarice of get-rich-quick CEOs has erased $2 trillion of shareholder wealth and rendered half a million people jobless.

Morgan doesn't see that imbalance. In his Time essay, he deftly weaves the failings of tycoons with those of politicians.

"The misleading bookkeeping and unethical behaviour of a few business leaders (has) compromised the integrity of the securities-market system," Morgan allows. But "in national politics, institutionalized discrimination and dependency has failed our aboriginal people."

Do you see the parallel? Organized theft by corporate crooks equals selfless, well-intentioned but admittedly unsuccessful public policy.

"In the corporate sector," Morgan admits, "we have seen the wreck of a great 'telecom-media bandwidth convergence' paradigm, which turned out to be an enthusiasm rather than a strategy." But then again, "in government, Canada is promising ratification of the Kyoto protocol without adequate examination of whether it would actually help the environment and how much it would hurt our economy."

See the parallel there? In pursuit of massive stock-option winnings, John Roth at Nortel Networks Corp. and his telecom peers misallocated hundreds of billions of dollars that could have been put to far better use in the economy. Somehow that's in the same league as politicians with no prospect of personal financial gain debating the merits of a plan to save the global environment.

Kyoto undermines Morgan's familiar complaint that in politics, "leaders often carry out mandates by reacting to day-to-day events. The result is leadership that muddles through, rather than pursuing a strategic vision." Actually, that seems an apt description of the deal-a-day "vision" of three CEOs eased out of their firms this year: Jean Monty at BCE Inc., Jean-Marie Messier at Vivendi Universal SA and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco International Ltd.

While its merits are certainly debatable, Kyoto is nothing if not a long-term strategy that, as Morgan says in praise of long-term visions, "may mean short-term sacrifice."

Bringing Kyoto into a discussion on corporate ethics is like dragging an elephant to an astronomers' symposium. So, why do it? Because oilman Morgan rejects the short-term sacrifice that Kyoto could mean for EnCana if it is forced to make dramatic reductions in cardon dioxide emissions.

Morgan is not your average self-interested tycoon. Arguably the most dynamic CEO in the oil patch, he transformed Alberta Energy Corp., the former provincial crown corporation, into a global energy powerhouse, and finds time to raise funds for hospitals, the YMCA, Olympic athletes and think-tanks (the right-wing Fraser Institute, the centrist Public Policy Forum). Morgan is a credible advocate of diverse causes both in Calgary and on the national stage.

It's painful when a nuanced executive indulges in such half-baked sophistry. Why does he do it? Cosseted by an oak-panelled world of corporate jets, fawning subordinates and a comfortable $7.3 million in annual pay, Morgan, like his CEO peers, is hopelessly out of touch with Main Street angst over suddenly depleted retirement nest eggs and widespread grassroots agitation for meaningful progress on environmental protection.

With no trace of irony, Morgan proposes to solve the leadership problem in both business and politics with "a kind of national truth-and-vision test to be carried out by shareholders, employee associations, members of political parties and voters of every stripe as they face would-be leaders at shareholders meetings or political rallies."

Surely Morgan knows that no CEO, accustomed to the handful of petitioners who are easily ruled out of order at a shareholders meeting, would submit to the gruelling accountability of an MP's town hall gathering or an all-candidates meeting, where there is no protection from the angry mob armed with rotting produce.

Two years into the corporate ethics crisis, we still have business leaders who discern a rough equivalency between Nortel's loss of $33 billion (U.S.) over the past 11 quarters and a bit of political pork-barrelling in P.E.I. involving a few thousand dollars.

Page 86 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And who, craving similar perks for themselves, withhold criticism of the General Electric
Co.-subsidized lifestyle of former CEO Jack Welch - although they might possibly marvel at last
week's disclosure in Welch's divorce proceedings that Jack consumes $8,982 (U.S.) worth of food
and drink each month. That's the annual per capita income in Mexico.

And who are inclined to side with Jim Buckee, CEO of Calgary oil producer Talisman Energy Inc., who said that his company's withdrawal from Sudan has no moral implications.

Talisman didn't have an ethical dilemma co-operating with a Sudanese government waging a civil war that has cost an estimated 2 million lives. It had a PR problem. Talisman stock needed to be liberated from bad press, Buckee explained on Wednesday. "Every newspaper mention of Talisman was qualified under 'involved in Sudan.' We hope to move on from that instant association."

With a more focused call for governance reform, including demands for a national securities regulator and tougher accounting standards for companies, public-spirited CEOs like Morgan could join the vanguard for genuine change. It is led, for now, by people outside the oak-panelled bubble. It is no exaggeration to observe that those outsiders tend to view many business leaders as refugees from the sewers.

"If we don't do it, who the hell can?" asked an impatient Stephen Jarislowsky in a speech last week. The Montreal money manager with $33 billion worth of investments in his control has co-founded a group of 20 institutional investors to press companies to rid themselves of cronyism, excessive pay and other abuses of minority shareholders.

This new class of agitators lacks confidence in CEOs to reform themselves. Nor do they have much faith in recent market-reform legislation, which they expect will be easily circumvented by executives hell-bent on easy wealth and self-glorification. Explaining to Report On Business Magazine his sense of urgency, Jarislowsky noted with disgust an unnamed company where management is skimming profits from an affiliate it controls, and "the board claps every time the major shareholder steals more."

Occasional lapses by underpaid, overworked politicians and bureaucrats bear no comparison to the unprecedented grasping, mendacity and incompetence of boom-era CEOs and their enablers at accounting, law and consulting firms. Imagine if the Japanese economy, the world's second-largest, shut down for two years. That's how much capital they destroyed.

You get the sense from Morgan and other CEOs that the crisis in corporate ethics will blow over if they can just change the subject. If they can obscure the magnitude of the recent folly with platitudes and obfuscation. But the damage to investor confidence is already too great, even as the revelations of unseemly corporate behaviour continue. There is simply no market for the diversionary bunk Morgan is trying to sell.

Europe's Court of First Instance overruled, in June and October,  Commission decisions prohibiting a series of mergers between  European companies. For the general public, the judgments paint a picture of a poorly organised merger review process, where evidence was not carefully gathered and decisions
were hastily put together without sufficient factual basis. These annulments have been seen as a serious setback for Commissioner Mario Monti, and  European competition law enforcement in general. However, far more important than the sensationalism surrounding the annulments are two challenges they pose for the future of competition enforcement.

The first challenge is reform of merger review procedures. The second is to maintain the vigorous enforcement of competition law. In confronting these challenges, Mr Monti must demonstrate that, while learning from past mistakes, the  Commission will not allow public criticism to distract it from protecting European consumers.

TD
The merger review process is clearlybroken and needs fixing. The primary source of concern has been the lack of checks and balances on the Merger Task Force's case teams. Last week Mr Monti announced the first reform proposals, including the appointment of a chief economist and a peer review team to test the MTF's case before a final decision is reached.

These proposals head in the right direction. However, no check can be effective without three critical ingredients: access to the facts of the case, access to the parties, and the authority to influence the case team's decision. Those currently doing the checking either lack the power to challenge the MTF or familiarity with the facts of these extraordinarily complex cases. This must change in order to restore public faith in the  Commission's review of mergers.

The second and more important challenge is for Mr Monti and his staff to persevere in the rigorous enforcement of EC competition rules. Annulments are a fact of life in a just and effective regulatory regime. They are the ultimate check and balance upon which the EU system relies. Indeed, the occasional error, remedied by effective judicial review, is far less damaging for the  European consumer and the Commission's credibility than a general retreat from antitrust enforcement.

Unfortunately, many have interpreted the  Commission's unconditional clearance of the Carnival/P&O Princess merger - after it initially voiced strong reservations - as evidence that it was backing away from its enforcement responsibilities for fear of further censure. Were this true, it would be a far more serious criticism of the  Commission than any number of annulments.

The Commission will shortly conclude a number of investigations - most prominently, one into Microsoft's alleged abuse of its dominant position in personal computer operating systems. The recent court judgments should not unsettle the  Commission. They do not question the theoretical foundation of its case against Microsoft. Indeed, in the Tetra Laval/Sidel case, the court explicitly backed the leveraging theory, where competitive harm can be inflicted if a company uses its dominant position in one market as a lever to gain dominance in a second. While rejecting the  Commission's speculative application of theory, the court made clear that if Tetra Laval engaged in leveraging in the future, such behaviour would be illegal and the  Commission would be expected to use its powers to prevent it.

The way forward in the Microsoft case must be a scrupulous review of the facts and Microsoft's alleged leveraging behaviour to determine whether a violation of  European competition rules has occurred. The

Page 88 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
US appeal court's approval of the Microsoft settlement in no way prejudged the  Commission's case under European law. Indeed, the  European case addresses an entirely different set of facts. In the end, the Commission must take a decision that is proportionate to the antitrust violation, not one designed to avoid criticism.

Competition law is a cornerstone of the  European Union's political and economic framework. Its enforcement is undoubtedly one of the EU's greatest success stories. Competition commissioners rank among the EU's most respected figures.

Mr Monti should continue his dogged pursuit of consumer interests. The recent decision to impose hefty fines on Nintendo and some of its distributors for operating an illegal distribution  cartel for video games, and confirmation that he will continue the cases against Microsoft and others, are encouraging signs.

The European Commission fined Nintendo 149 million ($151 million) the other day after the competition commissioner, Mario Monti, concluded that the company and seven of its distributors had ripped off consumers by colluding to keep the prices of Game Boy consoles and cartridges artificially high in some countries during the 1990s. The distributors were  fined an additional 18 million for good measure.

This caught my attention because of the size of the  fine one of the largest the  commission has ever imposed and because it reminded me again of the high price of virtually all electronic equipment in Europe compared with the United States. Savvy people who live in  Europe and travel to the New World make sure to stock up on electronic stuff there because they know that almost everything is much cheaper than in Europe.

TD
Some people note that the price differential on electronic items used to be even greater and has narrowed in recent years, at least on some things. But even allowing for the fact that the price in France includes a value-added tax of 19.6 percent, many electronic toys particularly the most popular ones still cost significantly more on one side of the Atlantic than on the other.

So when Super Mario Monti fined Nintendo for  price-fixing, I wondered again about the high prices for all electronic devices in Europe. I did some comparison shopping last week, and here's what I found:

At Darty, an iMac G4 computer with a 17-inch screen was selling for 2,630, the same price being charged by the large FNAC chain in France. In the United States, the list price for that computer is
$1,995, about $650 less

If you're in the market for a digital camera, the Nikon Coolpix 4500 was selling for 759 at Darty last week, and it cost 999 at FNAC. In the States, you can buy it for $430 from Infinity Cameras (www.infinitycameras.com). The Canon Powershot G2 was 1,199 at Darty. But it costs $524 at dBuys in the States (www.dbuys.com)
Would you like a personal digital assistant? The top-of-the-line Casio E200 costs 839 at FNAC. It is
$538 at Amazon.com. A more- modest Palm 105 costs 211 at FNAC. In the United States it's $99 at
Tech Depot (www.techdepot.com) with free shipping.
Printers? A Canon S750 is 245 at FNAC. You can buy it for $126 at Amazon.com or $130 at Gateway
(accessories.gateway.com).

A DVD player, perhaps? The Sony DVP-NS700 costs 349 at Darty. It's available for $160 at B&D Electronics (www.bndonline.com) in the United States.

These are not isolated cases. Not all of the price differences are as dramatic, but you'd have to look long and hard to find any electronic device that doesn't cost more in France than it does in the United States even allowing for the valued-added tax and the pattern appears to be the same throughout  Europe.

Last week, amid much fanfare, Microsoft Corp. introduced its Tablet PC software, which lets you write with a special electromagnetic pen on a notebook-size computer rather than using a keyboard.
At the product's introduction in New York, Microsoft said that these gizmos would sell for $1,700 to
$2,400 in the United States, depending on which manufacturer's model you bought and how it was
configured. At the introduction in Paris, Alexis Oger, the product manager here for Microsoft, said the
Tablet PCs would sell for 2,000 to 3,000.

There are online "discount" stores in France see  www.acheter- moins-cher.com and fr.kelkoo.com but the discounts are frequently negligible and rarely come close to making up the price difference with the States. The lowest price I could find for the Nikon Coolpix 4500 camera was 743 at clust.com, which also had the best price for the Canon Powershot G2 camera (947) and the Palm 105 handheld (172).

So when I saw that the competition commission had taken action against Nintendo for  price-fixing, I wondered whether the European Commission was looking more broadly into the question of pricing in Europe. Why are the same products sold much more cheaply in the United States than they are in Europe, and can or should the regulators do anything about it?
The short answer is that this situation does not violate any law.

Amelia Torres, Monti's spokeswoman in Brussels, said that companies are free to charge whatever prices they want and that if they decide to charge different prices in different countries, it's O.K. as long as there is no collusion involved.

What Nintendo did wrong was to lean on its distributors in low- priced countries (such as Britain) to prevent them from selling Nintendo computer  games in higher-priced countries (such as Germany and the Netherlands, where, the  commission found, the prices were kept as much as 65 percent higher than in Britain). Price gouging itself is not a crime; collusion is.

"You definitely have to show that there is collusion," Torres said. "The mere fact that there is a price difference no matter how big it is while it is regrettable for the consumer, as far as the  European competition regulators are concerned, they would need to prove there was collusion between the company and its distributors, that they conspired to keep the prices high in one market vis-a-vis the other."
For its part, Nintendo concedes that it engaged in illegal conduct but said that, "in view of the size of the
fine," it planned to appeal. The company also said it had reformed its practices.

In the absence of collusion, in a free market, manufacturers can charge whatever the market will bear. And when it comes to electronics,  European consumers are apparently willing to pay much more than consumers in America.

Europe's Court of First Instance overruled, in June and October,  Commission decisions prohibiting a series of mergers between  European companies. For the general public, the judgments paint a picture of a poorly organised merger review process, where evidence was not carefully gathered and decisions
were hastily put together without sufficient factual basis. These annulments have been seen as a serious setback for Commissioner Mario Monti, and  European competition law enforcement in general. However, far more important than the sensationalism surrounding the annulments are two challenges they pose for the future of competition enforcement.

The first challenge is reform of merger review procedures. The second is to maintain the vigorous enforcement of competition law. In confronting these challenges, Mr Monti must demonstrate that, while learning from past mistakes, the  Commission will not allow public criticism to distract it from protecting European consumers.

TD
The merger review process is clearlybroken and needs fixing. The primary source of concern has been the lack of checks and balances on the Merger Task Force's case teams. Last week Mr Monti announced the first reform proposals, including the appointment of a chief economist and a peer review team to test the MTF's case before a final decision is reached.

These proposals head in the right direction. However, no check can be effective without three critical ingredients: access to the facts of the case, access to the parties, and the authority to influence the case team's decision. Those currently doing the checking either lack the power to challenge the MTF or familiarity with the facts of these extraordinarily complex cases. This must change in order to restore public faith in the  Commission's review of mergers.

The second and more important challenge is for Mr Monti and his staff to persevere in the rigorous enforcement of EC competition rules. Annulments are a fact of life in a just and effective regulatory regime. They are the ultimate check and balance upon which the EU system relies. Indeed, the occasional error, remedied by effective judicial review, is far less damaging for the  European consumer and the Commission's credibility than a general retreat from antitrust enforcement.

Unfortunately, many have interpreted the  Commission's unconditional clearance of the Carnival/P&O Princess merger - after it initially voiced strong reservations - as evidence that it was backing away from its enforcement responsibilities for fear of further censure. Were this true, it would be a far more serious criticism of the  Commission than any number of annulments.

The Commission will shortly conclude a number of investigations - most prominently, one into Microsoft's alleged abuse of its dominant position in personal computer operating systems. The recent court judgments should not unsettle the  Commission. They do not question the theoretical foundation of its case against Microsoft. Indeed, in the Tetra Laval/Sidel case, the court explicitly backed the leveraging theory, where competitive harm can be inflicted if a company uses its dominant position in one market as a lever to gain dominance in a second. While rejecting the  Commission's speculative application of theory, the court made clear that if Tetra Laval engaged in leveraging in the future, such behaviour would be illegal and the  Commission would be expected to use its powers to prevent it.


Page 92 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The way forward in the Microsoft case must be a scrupulous review of the facts and Microsoft's alleged leveraging behaviour to determine whether a violation of  European competition rules has occurred. The US appeal court's approval of the Microsoft settlement in no way prejudged the  Commission's case under European law. Indeed, the  European case addresses an entirely different set of facts. In the end, the Commission must take a decision that is proportionate to the antitrust violation, not one designed to avoid criticism.

Competition law is a cornerstone of the  European Union's political and economic framework. Its enforcement is undoubtedly one of the EU's greatest success stories. Competition commissioners rank among the EU's most respected figures.

Mr Monti should continue his dogged pursuit of consumer interests. The recent decision to impose hefty fines on Nintendo and some of its distributors for operating an illegal distribution  cartel for video games, and confirmation that he will continue the cases against Microsoft and others, are encouraging signs.

HD        FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES &MARKETS - EU watchdog is set to fine BPB in price-fixing probe.

BPB, the building materials group, is facing a  fine from European regulators for taking part in a conspiracy to fix the price of products used in the construction of walls and ceilings.

Lafarge, the French building materials group, and Germany's Knauf could also receive penalties for participating in the  cartel covering the market for plasterboard and other gypsum-based materials. Other companies could also be facing  fines.

TD
The European Commission declined to comment yesterday but people close to the case said Lafarge could be fined Euros 100m ( £64m) or even more. That would be one of the largest penalties levied by the Brussels authorities. The biggest -  Euros 462m - was imposed on the Swiss chemical group Roche last year for fixing the price of vitamins.

The exact size of the  fines will be determined next week by a meeting of senior  Commission officials and will depend upon the seriousness of the offence and whether the companies co-operated with the investigation, as BPB is understood to have done.

Lafarge, which had sales of  Euros 13.7bn last year, and BPB, whose 2002 turnover was £1.6bn, declined to comment yesterday. However, Knauf said: "Our lawyer informed us today that we will be fined next week."

The Commission has the power to  fine companies up to 10 per cent of their world-wide turnover, but it rarely opts to impose the full penalty.

A four-year investigation by  European competition commissioner Mario Monti's department is understood to have found evidence of a  cartel of European firms to fix the price of plasterboard, a widely used construction material.

As part of the probe, in 1998 the Brussels investigators raided the offices of Lafarge, BPB and Knauf in search of documents. At the time, BPB said it was "co-operating fully" with the probe. Plasterboard accounts for nearly half of the UK group's sales.

BPB reports first-half results next week, with analysts expecting to see a 33 per cent rise in first-half underlying profits to about £95m. Sales are expected to approach £1bn from £830.7m for the same period last year.
Knauf - which is a family-owned group - also relies on plasterboard sales for a significant part of its
Euros 2.5bn turnover.

By contrast, Lafarge derives only about 8 per cent of its annual sales from trade in gypsum-based products.

The decision comes less than a month after Mr Monti imposed a  fine of Euros 149m - the fourth-largest yet - on the Japanese computer maker Nintendo for a conspiracy to prevent exports of its  video-game consoles.

HD           EU to vote on Tuesday on new antitrust rules. BY            By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) -  Europe's antitrust control is set for a radical makeover that will change the way firms, courts and countries do business across the 15-nation  European Union.

The new rules affecting cartels and abuse of dominance will be voted on by EU ministers when they meet on Tuesday.

TD
It is a sensitive area that includes probes into Microsoft Corp's alleged abuse of power, and
price-fixing conspiracies which have prompted  fines of hundreds of millions of  euros.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will complement the new rules by voting on December 11 on a separate package of reforms overhauling the merger process in  Europe. The two packages are unconnected.

At present, companies file notices with the  Commission to make certain their partnerships with rivals and others are within antitrust law. The new rules do away with such reviews.

At the same time the new approach gives the bloc's member states and their courts a big role in enforcing community antitrust law.

The new rules also clarify the authority of the  Commission to break up a company, if that is necessary to remedy violations of antitrust law. That has not happened yet in  Europe.

And it gives authorities the right to raid private homes, with the permission of a national judge, in order to find materials in antitrust investigations.

Commission officials say the changes are long overdue. The old  cartel rules of 1962 were designed to meet the needs of the then six members.

The Commission has got bogged down with the rules and matters would become worse in a European Union that will expand to 25 members in 2004. The  Commission wants to give up responsibility for reviewing company agreements.
"It has led to thousands of notifications," said one  Commission official. "We can't do our job. HARD-CORE CARTELS
The changes are designed to give the  Commission more time to crack down on hard-core cartels which fix prices and divide up territory to the detriment of consumers.

The Commission sees its main job as prosecuting cartels that cost consumers serious money, such as the vitamin price-fixing conspiracy that led to  fines totalling $855 million in November, 2001, against a group of firms led by Roche of Switzerland.

Many other duties will be looked after by member states. They will enforce EU rules that until now were only handled in Brussels. In return, the member states will give up the right to enforce national antitrust rules which differ from EU law.

Page 96 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The relevant agencies will be able to  fine companies and order them to stop violating EU law. They will get their cases from tips and complaints, as do other police agencies.

Courts in each country will also have a new role, with the duty to enforce EU antitrust law. Firms will have the right to sue in the state courts and win damages.

The Commission is well aware of the risk of 15 or 25 different court systems - each with its own language, traditions and precedents - going in different directions.

So the system includes an elaborate plan for coordination through a new body, the  European Competition Network, which will be woven together by everything from  video conferencing and high-tech Internet communications to face-to-face meetings.
Even with the coordination, if a case becomes big enough Brussels has the right to take it over. A few problems remain to be settled on Tuesday.
In one controversial section, the  Commission would have had sweeping new powers to write exemptions to antitrust law.

Some countries had doubts about that. Last week the section was removed, so the  Commission will have to seek permission from the ministers for any new power to write block exemptions.

Block exemptions, issued by the  Commission or the Council of Ministers, exempt groups of agreements from antitrust rules. The EU issues such exemptions when there is a benefit to consumers.
The Commission ruffled the feathers of Germany earlier this year by approving car block rules
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder feared would damage his country's car industry.

HD           UPDATE 2-EU ministers overhaul  40-year-old antitrust rules. BY            By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, Nov 26 (Reuters) -  European Union government ministers voted on Tuesday to cut bureaucratic red tape so they can redouble their efforts to combat  price-fixing cartels.

Their decision to overhaul a 40-year-old regime that for decades revolved around Brussels will cede responsibilities to companies, countries and national courts.

TD
Antitrust rules are designed to help rein in corporations that abuse monopoly power, and has led to such investigations as that nearing completion into Microsoft Corp.
They also are aimed at punishing companies which conspire to fix prices - the  Commission has fined
firms hundreds of millions of  euros.

But these days the EU body is bogged down with thousands of applications for waivers from companies seeking approval of their partnerships with rivals.

"We need to modernise these rules", said Danish Economic Affairs Minister Bendt Bendtsen, who chaired the meeting where EU ministers approved the reforms by a unanimous vote. "Member states have fully endorsed this."

Once the new antitrust rules take effect, in May, 2004, companies will abruptly stop notifying the Commission of their plans to set up partnerships with rivals. And that will free the  Commission's time.

"The new regulation cuts back this bureaucracy and allows the  Commission to focus its attention on those cartel and price-fixing agreements that are truly harmful to competition," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters.
Such cases can be big. In November 2001, the  Commission fined companies led by Roche a total of
$855 million for conspiring to fix prices on vitamins.

The Commission will consider a different set of reforms on December 11, which will modify its merger regulations. The two packages are not connected.
MEMBER STATE ROLE

The new approach gives the bloc's member states and their courts a big role in enforcing community antitrust law.

The rules also clarify the authority of the  Commission to break up a company, if that is necessary to remedy violations of antitrust law. That has not happened yet in  Europe.

They also give authorities the right to raid private homes, with the permission of a national judge, in order to find evidence in antitrust investigations.




Page 98 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Much of the enforcement will be in the hands of national authorities, which will have power to enforce EU rules and fine those who break the law. But they give up the right to enforce national antitrust rules that contradict EU law - the  European rules take precedence.

National courts will also have new work to do. They will be called on to settle private cases when one firm sues another under EU law.

The new system takes effect on the same day that 10 new nations are due to join the  European Union. The  Commission is taking steps to deal with the problems of 25 different agencies and court systems going off in different directions.

Monti expressed confidence that the jurisdictions will be able to coordinate, overcoming differences of language and legal tradition.

He said that the new members of the  European Union have already demonstrated their abilities to run efficient competition agencies.

Monti said the agencies will be tied together through the new  European Competition Network. The network will be connected through a private Intranet,  video conferencing and face-to-face meetings.

But if a case presents novel questions and no one is quite sure how to handle it, Brussels will take over.

HD     EU competition guardian  back on the offensive

BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (AFP) - The EU's embattled competition watchdog, Mario Monti, underlined his reputation for vigour Wednesday with near-record  fines against a European building industry  cartel including the world's largest cement firm.

French cement giant Lafarge and three other companies from Belgium, Britain and Germany were  fined a total of 478.3 million  euros (475 million dollars) for fixing prices of plasterboard -- a key component for
do-it-yourself enthusiasts.

TD
The total was second only to 855.23 million  euros slapped last year against a group of pharmaceutical giants accused of running a  cartel in vitamin pills.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Monti, the  European Union's commissioner for competition issues, who has suffered a string of stinging legal setbacks.
Last month Monti's department  fined Japanese company Nintendo and seven European distributors
167.8 million euros for rigging distribution of computer consoles and  games in Europe, the fifth- largest
ever levied by the commission.
Lafarge, like Nintendo, vowed to appeal.

Lafarge said that in Britain and Germany, "plasterboard prices are today, as they were in 1998, lower than before 1990."

"These facts run counter to any notion that the plasterboard unit might have been involved in an understanding on prices and quantities since 1992," the French company said in a statement.
The Italian commissioner, however, vowed to remain on the offensive.

"The commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers," he said.

Last year the  commission fined nearly 50 companies a record 1.8 billion  euros for abuse of market power, and looks set to surpass the figure this year.

Monti is intensifying his crackdown after the EU agreed on Tuesday to beef up the  commission's powers to investigate suspect corporate activity, as part of the first reform of antitrust rules in 40 years.

Commission investigators will be empowered to search company managers' homes for the first time to look for incriminating documents taken from offices.

But firms will no longer have to notify business agreements to Brussels, in a bid by the EU to cut swelling bureaucracy and legal costs to companies while allowing the  commission to concentrate on the worst cartel cases.

The regulation sets up a "European Competition Network" of  commission and national inspectors, a move that Monti said would lead to "stronger enforcement of EU law".


Page 100 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The new rules are due to come into force on May 1, 2004, on the same day the EU plans to welcome 10 new members from eastern  Europe and the Mediterranean.

The commission fears its antitrust watchdogs will become too stretched after enlargement and so need to work hand-in-hand with national inspectors.

"We will now turn our energy to completing the reform of the rules and processes in the area of merger and state aids control," added the commissioner, whose department has seen three recent vetoes of mergers overturned by EU judges.

The European Court of Justice in June overturned the  commission's veto of a merger between travel companies Airtours and First Choice.

Then last month it overturned a veto of French firm Schneider's acquisition of Legrand as well as a decision to block Swedish Tetra Laval's purchase of Sidel of France.

Monti vowed to broaden the scope of a planned reform of EU merger rules after the legal setbacks, which commentators warned could deal a fatal blow to the authority of his Brussels watchdog if it does not change.

SHIRE Pharmaceuticals was top of the blue-chip sicklist as investors took fright at a rival hyperactivity treatment getting faster-than-expected approval from US regulators.

The expected January launch of US drugs giant Eli Lilly's Strattera therapy following FDA consent about three months ahead of forecasts was seen as putting increased pressure on Shire's Adderall product.

TD
Shares in Shire fell 66p to a three-year low of 444p as some analysts described the move as a blow to sentiment, despite a general view that it will have a limited impact on Shire.
Broker Merrill Lynch said:

"We expect the news of Strattera approval to unsettle the Shire price, but given it is already factored into our forecasts we would consider any price weakness to be a buying opportunity."
The diagnosis of the wider market's prospects was brighter as upbeat economic news from across
the Atlantic, including a fall in jobless claims and a rise in durable goods orders, eased fears over the
health of the world's largest economy.

Leading shares were already well advanced by the time Chancellor Gordon Brown delivered his pre-Budget statement and the FTSE 100 Index closed 73.2 points ahead at 4144.2.

Engineer Invensys led the charge, 5 fp stronger at 58 fp, after chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite's bullish outlook on sales prospects in Asia.

Bargain-hunters moved into Scottish &Newcastle, 16p ahead at 470p, despite broker WestLB Panmure's downgrade from neutral to underperform ahead of next week's interim figures.

But Diageo was left with a 3p hangover at 682p after legendary US investor Warren Buffett was reported to have denied interest in the group's Burger King chain.

ICI dipped 6 bp to 248 fpwhen the chemicals giant was downgraded from outperform to neutral by broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney which cut its target price from 340p to 290p on concerns over growth at its flavour and fragrance operation.

Mining group Xstrata was warned by Australian coal miners it faced possible industrial action over an alleged aggressive anti-union strategy.

Shares in the company, which was also knocked by an underperform rating from Goldman Sachs due to its exposure to South Africa and perceived over-reliance on energy coal, gave up 4 dp to
590p.

Boardroom buying left fashion retailer New Look in 2 dpbetter shape at 258 dp, while biotech outfit Axis Shield perked up 11p to 145p on positive findings of a new study which analysts said boded well for future demand for its technologies for diagnosing cardiovascular risk.
