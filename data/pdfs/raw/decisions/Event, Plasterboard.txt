WRITTEN QUESTION E-3191/02

TD
by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the  Commission
(8 November 2002)
Subject: Investigation into a cartel of  plasterboard manufacturers

In his reply to question E-0929/02(1), Commissioner Monti repeats virtually verbatim the text of MEMO/01/149. Very recently, the Belgian construction materials manufacturer Etex announced that it was selling its 52,94 % holding in Gyproc Benelux NV to the British company BPB. The latter already held 46,1
% of the shares. At the same time it was announced that British  Plasterboard intended to sell its shares in Polish and German branches of Gyproc to the French company Lafarge. Although the  Commission is not officially prepared to divulge their names, the four companies were named in articles in the press in April 2001 in connection with a cartel investigation by the  Commission.

Is the Commission aware of these by no means insignificant changes in the  plasterboard industry, and does it consider them to be in accordance with economic legislation within the EU?

Has the formal hearing referred to in MEMO/01/149 and the answer to question E-0929/02 already taken place? If so, can the  Commission provide a progress report on the investigation?
(1) OJ C 28 E, 6.2.2003, p. 59.
Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the  Commission
(7 January 2003)

To date, the  Commission has not been informed formally or informally of any of the transactions referred to in the Honourable Member's question.

As regards the investigation into the companies mentioned by the Honourable Member, the  Commission adopted on 27 November 2002 a decision imposing  fines of EUR 249,6 million on Lafarge SA, EUR 138,6 million on BPB plc, EUR 85,8 million on Gebrüder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG and EUR 4,32 million on Gyproc Benelux SA/NV, making a total of EUR 478,32 million(1). Following its in-depth investigation, the Commission concluded that between 1992 and 1998 these companies had taken part
in a cartel on the plasterboard markets in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries, whereby they had agreed to restrict competition on these markets in line with their interests, exchanged information on sales volumes and informed one another of price increases on the German and UK markets. Lafarge, BPB and Knauf were involved

in the cartel from 1992 to 1998 and were joined in 1996 by Gyproc Benelux. Their complex and long-term agreement constituted by its nature a very serious infringement of Article 81 of the EC Treaty, lasting as it did more than six and a half years in total, hence the heavy  fines. The fines on Lafarge and BPB were

Page 4 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
particularly large owing to the aggravating circumstance of this being their second infringement of Article
81. Only BPB and Gyproc cooperated with the  Commission.

BPB, the building materials group, is facing a  fine from European regulators for taking part in a conspiracy to fix the price of products used in the construction of walls and ceilings.

Lafarge, the French building materials group, and Germany's Knauf could also receive penalties for participating in the cartel covering the market for  plasterboard and other gypsum-based materials. Other companies could also be facing  fines.

TD
The European Commission declined to comment yesterday but people close to the case said Lafarge could be fined Euros 100m ( £64m) or even more. That would be one of the largest penalties levied by the Brussels authorities. The biggest -  Euros 462m - was imposed on the Swiss chemical group Roche last year for fixing the price of vitamins.

The exact size of the  fines will be determined next week by a meeting of senior  Commission officials and will depend upon the seriousness of the offence and whether the companies co-operated with the investigation, as BPB is understood to have done.

Lafarge, which had sales of  Euros 13.7bn last year, and BPB, whose 2002 turnover was £1.6bn, declined to comment yesterday. However, Knauf said: "Our lawyer informed us today that we will be fined next week."

The Commission has the power to  fine companies up to 10 per cent of their world-wide turnover, but it rarely opts to impose the full penalty.

A four-year investigation by  European competition commissioner Mario Monti's department is understood to have found evidence of a cartel of  European firms to fix the price of  plasterboard, a widely used construction material.

As part of the probe, in 1998 the Brussels investigators raided the offices of Lafarge, BPB and Knauf in search of documents. At the time, BPB said it was "co-operating fully" with the probe.  Plasterboard accounts for nearly half of the UK group's sales.

BPB reports first-half results next week, with analysts expecting to see a 33 per cent rise in first-half underlying profits to about £95m. Sales are expected to approach £1bn from £830.7m for the same period last year.
Knauf - which is a family-owned group - also relies on  plasterboard sales for a significant part of its
Euros 2.5bn turnover.

By contrast, Lafarge derives only about 8 per cent of its annual sales from trade in gypsum-based products.

The decision comes less than a month after Mr Monti imposed a  fine of Euros 149m - the fourth-largest yet - on the Japanese computer maker Nintendo for a conspiracy to prevent exports of its video-game consoles.

LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Lafarge , the French building materials group, is poised to receive a heavy fine from European regulators for taking part in an alleged scheme to fix the price of products used in the construction of walls and ceilings, according to the Financial Times.

British building materials maker BPB Plc and privately held German industrial group Knauf could also receive penalties for participating in the cartel covering the market for  plasterboard and other gypsum-based materials, the newspaper reported on Thursday.

TD
Other companies could also be facing  fines from Brussels, the newspaper said.
The European Commission declined to comment to the FT but people close to the case said that
Lafarge could be fined 100 million euros or even more, the FT reported.

That would be one of the largest penalties levied by the Brussels authorities. The biggest - 462 million euros ($463.5 million) - was imposed on the Swiss chemical group Roche last year for fixing the price of vitamins.

Commission officials and spokespeople for Lafarge, BPB and Knauf were not immediately available to comment on the FT report.

The size of the  fines will be determined next week by a meeting of senior  Commission officials and will depend upon both the seriousness of the offence and on whether the companies have co-operated with the investigation, the FT reported.
Lafarge, with sales of 13.7 billion  euros ($13.75 billion) last year, and BPB whose 2002 turnover was
1.6 billion (2.5 billion  euros), declined to comment to the FT. However, a Knauf spokesman told the
newspaper: "Our lawyer informed me today that we will be  fined next week," the FT reported.

BPB, the building materials group, is expected to be given a heavy fine next week by Brussels regulators in connection with a price-fixing conspiracy. The European Commission launched an investigation into price-fixing in the  plasterboard industry in Novemebr 1998, raiding the offices of BPB, Lafarge of France and Germany's Knauf. In theory, BPB faces a  fine of up to 10 per cent of its turnover, although the fact that it has co-operated with the investigation will count in its favour.

BPB, the  plasterboard group, could be fined next week after investigations into an alleged price-fixing cartel in the building material. The European Commission is to announce the result of two price-fixing inquiries, one of which concerns gypsum-based materials used in construction.

In 1998 the  Commission raided the offices of BPB and two other large  European plasterboard makers, France's Lafarge and Knauf, of Germany. The investigation cast a shadow over the company and BPB announced that its chief executive at the time, Jean-Pierre Cuny, was taking early retirement "in the light of the investigation into the alleged infringement of article 85 of the Treaty of Rome".

TD
Richard Cousins is now the company's chief executive.

The size of any  fine could be as high as 10 per cent of the company's worldwide turnover of £1.6 billion. BPB shares suffered an initial fall of 3 per cent but recovered to end the day at 260p, down 4p. Analysts said a fine was unlikely to be severe and that any penalty would be based not on total revenues but on the turnover in  plasterboard, suggesting a maximum of £80 million. Moreover, penalties imposed by
the EU's anti-cartel unit vary greatly, according to the extent to which the accused company co-operates.

The Commission said yesterday that it had begun investigating a suspected cartel in carbon black, a material used in making tyres. Investigators from the anti-cartel unit have raided six companies, including Degussa, of Germany, and Cabot, of America, seeking evidence of price collusion.

Plasterboard giant BPB, owner of the 200-year-old Mugiemoss Mill in Aberdeen, will try to brush aside worries over a European Commission inquiry next Thursday when directors unwrap news of a hefty profits turnaround and fatter dividend payments.

Analysts say the success of a major US acquisition will help directors to report a 25% rise in plasterboard volumes and a 33% jump in profits to at least (pounds) 95 million for the opening half-year. There should also be an increase in the interim dividend.

TD
The prospect of good news contrasts sharply with the performance of the shares which have crumpled from a year's high of 440p to a current level of around 270p as investors await further news on the EC inquiry into the  European gypsum industry which began back in November 1998.

At the current level, the shares offer an historic dividend yield of more than 6% which could increase as brokers expect profits to rise from (pounds) 153m to at least (pounds) 195m this year.

"The shares are suffering from a credibility gap. The EC is set to report its findings any day now over allegations of price fixing in the  European gypsum industry under Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome," said one adviser.

"The stock market has decided BPB has been found guilty and will be liable to a  fine equal to 10% of turnover, which would work out at (pounds) 190m.

"But that is by no means certain and the Brussels  eurocrats have a history of being quite lenient in any case.
"BPB will certainly appeal against any censure but it could comfortably afford a  fine of, say (pounds)
75m, without any harm to the business because of its strong cash flow."

BPB was always a strong candidate for investigation into alleged abuses because of its dominant international position in its market where it now sells more than one billion square metres of plasterboard annually, roughly one-in-five of all the product acquired by the construction industry for partitions and sound controls.

Its plants in Mugiemoss Road in Aberdeen and in nearby Abertay, which employ more than 400 between them, are largely used to convert recycled newspapers which are used to provide paper coatings for  plasterboard and other purposes.

Directors are expected to warn of continuing tough trading conditions in Scotland because of a recent recovery in prices for recycled paper. Part of BPB's defence against EC allegations into the gypsum industry is that it has no control over an international market which saw US wallboard prices tumble to a
20-year low of around $65 per thousand square metres last April, down by $110 on their December
1999 peak.

The major factor behind next week's profits performance is likely to be a sharp increase in margins across the Atlantic following rationalisation and the integration of the (pounds) 245m James Hardie

business - the American operation is expected to produce profits of around (pounds) 12m compared with the (pounds) 16.7m losses declared a year ago.

Past losses from America will also help reduce the group's tax bill, enhancing earnings per share. Restructuring costs are likely to work out at around (pounds) 10m and there will be a further charge of around (pounds) 3m at the half year stage to bolster BPB's pension fund.

Lafarge vigorously challenges the decision of the
European  Commission and
will bring the case before the Court of First Instance

Lafarge has just been officially informed of the  European Commission's decision to  fine the Group on the grounds that it allegedly participated in a collusion on market shares and prices with its competitors between 1992 and 1998 for  plasterboard in the UK and Germany. On that basis, the EuropeanCommission has ordered the Group to pay a  fine of e250 million.
Lafarge vigorously challenges this decision and will immediately bring the case before the Court of First
Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg, which has jurisdiction over such matters.

Lafarge underlines that: - the amount of the fine ordered by the EuropeanCommission is practically equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of plasterboard in the two countries concerned.
- its Gypsum business - exclusively carried out in France until 1990 - only started to develop from that
date onwards in practically all  European countries, in the face of powerful, solidly established competitors
with a long-standing presence in these countries, at the cost of considerable investments and at a time
marked by major prices drops.
To this date, the Gypsum Division currently holds approximately 22% of the UK market and 15% of the
German one.
In both of these countries, today as in 1998, the sales prices of  plasterboard are lower than before 1990. These facts conflict with the very idea of the participation of the Gypsum Division in a hypothetical existing
collusion over prices or quantities since 1992.

Bringing the case before the CFI, the Group places all its confidence in the authority that will be ruling on both the respect of the procedure and the substance of the matter.

Lafarge is one of the world's leading producers of building materials. The Group holds top-ranking positions in each of its four divisions: Cement, Aggregates and Concrete, Roofing and Gypsum. With a workforce of 83,000 people, the Group is present in 75 countries. In 2001, Group sales amounted to e13.7 billion. For additional information, visit the group's website;  www.lafarge.com

Announcement for immediate release, Wednesday 27 November 2002
BPB TO APPEAL AGAINST
EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE
The European Commission today announced that it had decided to  fine BPB e138.6 million (£88.8 million) out of a total European gypsum industry fine of e478.3 million (£306.6 million) for alleged breaches of competition law under Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome.

BPB has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of its  fine, which is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high. None of the  Commission's findings relate to any of the group's on-going activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any finding of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past. In short, BPB believes that the  Commission's case lacks the evidence necessary to substantiate its claims.

The group has been actively co-operating with the  Commission throughout its four-year investigation and is disappointed that it has rejected, without justification, much of what BPB has said to it. The Commission's general allegation that BPB participated in a long-running cartel in the principal EU plasterboard markets are based upon supposition and contrived explanations unsupported by the facts. It has not taken into account the wealth of economic evidence of vigorous price competition for market share which is inconsistent with the  Commission's findings, nor the lack of any tangible effect
of the supposed infringements on the markets concerned. Throughout the 1990's European                 
plasterboard prices to customers in fact fell substantially in real terms.

While there was within the industry, on an irregular basis, a general exchange of straightforward, highly aggregated and historical sales volume data for certain markets, this was against the background of the absence of any statistics on market size for the industry as a whole. The industry objective was simply
to have some data on the overall size and rate of growth in the markets concerned.

BPB is also disappointed that the  Commission has seen fit to take into account as an aggravating factor the imposition of a  fine on one of its former Dutch subsidiaries, BPB De Eendracht, for a
previous infringement in the cartonboard sector in 1994. The subsidiary concerned played no role in the infringing activities other than being a member of the trade association concerned. Moreover, the  fine
of e1.75 million was reduced on appeal to e0.75 million (£0.5 million).

The total amount of the group's  fine will be charged as an exceptional item in the accounts for the six months to 30 September 2002, pending the outcome of any appeal.
Commenting on the decision, Allan Gormly, BPB Chairman, said:

"None of the findings affect BPB's on-going business practices. The group has not participated in any cartel and the evidence is simply not consistent with any agreement to collude over prices or market share, however vaguely the  Commission expresses its case. In fact, the  European plasterboard
Page 18 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
industry has always been and continues to be characterised by vigorous price competition for market share." Notes to editors


-    BPB will tomorrow announce its interim results and dividend for the six months to 30 September 2002.
-    BPB is the world leader in the supply of
plasterboard and gypsum plasters,
and a major supplier of insulation, ceiling tiles and related products for internal linings, serving growing markets for building systems in over 50 countries.

The European Commission imposed the fines on four companies which it ruled had affected 80 per cent of customers in the European Union. Following a detailed investigation in 1998 the  Commission has
ruled that the firms operated a  European wide cartel including the United Kingdon, Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Lafarge and BPB were hit by the biggest  fines of 159.8 million (249.6) and 88.78 million (138.6 million ) respectively. Both were committing a second offence following previous  fines in
1994. German firm Knauf was  fine 54.96 million (85.8 million) and Belgian operation Gyproc Benelux, which is now owned by BPB, was hit for 2.77 million (4.32 million). The substantial  fines reflect the size of the market and the impact on it of the illicit agreements. Related links: Today's Top Stories.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators fined four companies a total of 478 million
euros ($455 million) Wednesday for fixing the prices of plasterboard and other building materials.

The fines were imposed on France's Lafarge SA, Germany's Knauf GmbH, Belgium's Gyproc and Britain's BPB PLC. They were the second-highest ever imposed by the  European Commission, following 2001 levies against a vitamin cartel.

TD
"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies," said Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner.

In a separate decision, the  commission also fined German-French drugs maker Aventis 2.85 million euros ($2.83 million) for operating a price-fixing agreement with Germany's Merck KgaA on a chemical used in x-rays.
Merck escaped a fine under immunity rules because it informed EU regulators of the cartel.
After a four-year antitrust investigation into the  plasterboard market, the  commission fined BPB
138.6 million euros ($137.7 million) and Lafarge 249.6 million  euros ($248 million). The two
companies had been previously  fined for similar offenses in 1994.
Knauf must pay 85.8 million  euros ($85.2 million) and Gyproc 4.32 million  euros ($4.29 million).

In a statement, the  commission said the cartel operated from 1992 to 1998 and covered 80 percent of consumers in an EU market worth 1.2 billion  euros ($1.19 billion).

The companies met in London to end a price war that had driven down prices and subsequently set up a secret information exchange system to monitor market trends and avoid over aggressive competition, the  Commission said.
Under EU rules, the companies have three months to pay the  fines.

Monti has made tackling price fixing arrangements a priority. On Tuesday, EU governments approved reforms to give his office more powers to fight cartels.

"The commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers, as is the case here," he said.

Lafarge spokesman Denis Boulet declined to comment, saying he had not yet been informed officially of the decision.

The commission said two Aventis units and Merck had collaborated to control prices of methylglucamine between 1990 and 1999. Under EU rules, companies that inform trustbusters of a cartel can claim immunity from  fines.

HD            UPDATE 4-Lafarge faces big fine as EU punishes price-fixing. BY            By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday fined Lafarge and three other companies 478 million  euros ($475 million) for conspiring to fix the price of plasterboard, a building material used in homes and businesses.
The Commission said it imposed the huge  fine, its second largest ever, because the cartel affected
80 percent of European consumers in what is a 1.2 billion  euro market.

TD
"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement about the case involving the ubiquitous paper-covered plaster.

The Commission came down hardest on France's Lafarge, fining the company 249.6 million euros. It also fined Britain's BPB 138.6 million  euros, Germany's privately held Knauf 85.8 million euros and Belgium's Gyproc 4.32 million  euros.

The Commission said it wanted to be sure its  fine against Lafarge, the world's largest maker of cement and far bigger than the other companies, had "a real deterrent effect."

However, Lafarge vowed to fight the EU decision, saying the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of plasterboard in the British and German markets.
"Lafarge vigorously challenges this decision and will immediately bring the case before the Court of
First Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg, which has jurisdiction over such matters," it said.
"For us the  fine reflects an arbitrary decision without an economic basis," a Lafarge spokesman said. Lafarge will decide whether it needs to make a provision for the  fine this year after studying details
from the Commission and discussing with lawyers and auditors, he added.
Investors drew little comfort from the company's comments, driving Lafarge shares lower. By 1542
GMT, Lafarge stood 1.08 percent down at 77.90  euros, with one analyst saying he had expected a
fine of only 80 million  euros for the company.
BPB shares were flat in London at 262p.

An industry analyst said the potential impact of the  fine was less significant for Lafarge - though it was bigger - than for BPB, as  European plasterboard represented around six percent of group sales.

That could knock off up to 25 percent of 2003 net income while BPB could see its net income wiped away in the current year, the industry analyst said.

"Investors have tended to look at cartel  fines as of a one-off, exceptional nautre. This is now a closed chapter and the industry can move on."
SECOND OFFENCE



Page 26 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Making matters worse in the  Commission's eyes, it was a repeat offence by Lafarge. In 1994 the French company paid a  fine in a cement cartel case. The EU executive said it also failed to cooperate in the plasterboard investigation.
BPB, through a subsidiary, was also  fined in 1994, for participating in a cartonboard cartel.

The Commission said the latest cartel began in London in 1992 where BPB and Knauf decided to end what they described as a price war in the German, French, British and Benelux markets. Lafarge joined later in 1992 and Gyproc in 1996, it said.

Representatives of the companies held one of their meetings in 1996 in the French town of Versailles, near a trade association congress, to prevent a new price war in the face of imports from Eastern Europe, the Commission said.

The cartel lasted throughout 1997, when the value of the market hit the 1.2 billion  euro figure, and into 1998.

The Commission investigation started in November, 1998, with raids on the companies. Eventually, BPB and Gyproc cooperated.
The Commission sent notices to the four companies and to Etex SA, a Belgian financing company, in
April 2001. The case against Etex was closed without a  fine on Wednesday.

Etex owns 54 percent of Gyproc and BKPB 46 percent. But the  Commission said there was not enough evidence that the Belgian company participated in the conspiracy.

The fine imposed on Wednesday is only exceeded by the  fine of 855 million euros it imposed in 2002 against vitamin firms.
The next largest was against makers of carbonless paper in 2001, of 314 million  euros.

LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Britain's BPB Plc, the world's biggest plasterboard firm, said on Wednesday it would appeal against a 138.6 million  euro ($138 million) fine for price fixing, saying the amount was disproportionately high.

The European Commission earlier fined four makers of the basic building material  plasterboard a total of 478 million euros for price fixing.

PARIS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - French stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday after a welter of robust data reassured investors an economic recovery was under way and that recent strong gains could be extended into a year-end rally.

France Telecom was the day's standout, soaring 13.1 percent as the French state was reported to be ready to pump nine billion  euros into the debt-laden group, delaying a risky capital increase until next year.

TD
The blue chip CAC-40 index ended 3.07 percent higher at 3,313.76 points, underperforming Frankfurt but outperforming London.

Volume traded on the CAC-40 was a hefty 9.4 billion  euros, bolstered by cross trades tied to the expiry of futures contracts.

Investors were cheered by a string of U.S. data that showed perky consumers and a brigher labour situation would support a recovery in the global economy and corporate profits.
"All elements supporting a year-end rally to 3,600 points are now in place," said Jacques Antoine
Bretteil, head of International Capital Gestion.

"We had very good economic data all pointing in the same direction while the horizon is clearing up for the market's most symbolic stocks France Telecom and Vivendi," he added.

France Telecom ended at 16.70  euros, recapturing its August 22 level. The shares have now rebounded 147 percent from their historical low of 6.75  euros on September 24 but are still down 60 percent this year.

France Telecom rallied on talk of a cash injection and was also helped by news Vodafone agreed to buy France Telecom's 10.85 percent stake in Greek mobile operator Vodafone Panafon.

"The solution on France Telecom is near. The only negative remains the rights issue but it looks like it's not going to happen right away, which is good news given current market conditions," said one trader.

Vivendi Universal, which is as yet one of the year's worst CAC-40 performers, added 5.1 percent as investors applauded news its cash crisis was over and that it had built enough fire power to launch a challenge for control of lucrative telecoms unit Cegetel.

Elsewhere Credit Lyonnais climbed 6.5 percent amid speculation a bidding war for control of France's fourth largest listed bank was looming.
This was after BNP Paribas grabbed the state's 10.9 percent stake in Lyonnais over the wekend. "Everyone believes that Societe Generale and BNP are buying Lyonnais shares on the market," said
one trader.

Page 39 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Societe Generale ended up 0.81 percent and BNP Paribas added 1.35 percent.

Cement group Lafarge bucked the strong market trend, ending down 0.51 percent after the  European Commission fined the group and three other companies 478 million  euros ($475 million) for conspiring to fix the price of  plasterboard, a building material used in homes and businesses.

LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Britain's BPB Plc, the world's biggest plasterboard firm, said on Wednesday it would appeal against a 138.6 million  euro ($138 million) fine for price fixing, saying the amount was disproportionately high.

The European Commission earlier fined four makers of the basic building material a total of 478 million euros for price fixing.

TD
BPB said the EC's case lacked the necessary evidence to back up its claims.

"BPB has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of its  fine, which is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high," the firm said in a statement.
In addition to BPB, the EC  fined France's Lafarge 249.6 million  euros, Germany's privately held Knauf
85.8 million euros and Belgium's Gyproc 4.32 million  euros.

Lafarge earlier vowed to fight the decision, saying the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of plasterboard in the British and German markets.

"While there was within the industry, on an irregular basis, a general exchange of straightforward, highly aggregated and historical sales volume data for certain markets, this was against the background of the absence of any statistics on market size for the industry as a whole," BPB said.

"The industry objective was simply to have some data on the overall size and rate of growth in the markets concerned."

BPB said none of the  Commission's findings related to any of its on-going activities or business practices.

The company said it would charge the amount of the  fine as an exceptional item in its accounts for the six months to end-September 2002, pending the outcome of any appeal.
Shares in BPB closed 1.7 percent higher at 267 pence.
Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Hake said he was not surprised that BPB had decided to appeal.

He said the market had not reacted badly to news of the  fine because it was lower than had been rumoured and smaller than Lafarge's  fine. He added that a sense of relief that the outcome of the investigation was clear had also helped to support the stock.
"It's the end of the chapter now, because at least...there's a hard number you can identify," he said. "Given the fact that the BPB business is bigger, one would have thought their  fine would have been
significantly more than they've been  fined, given what Lafarge is being  fined."
Hake said the fine amounted to one year's net profit.

"It is only a year's profit. It's the end of it now, and they can move on."

The French plasterboard maker Lafarge is to be  fined over 100 million euros ($99.2 million) by the European Commission today, for participating in a price-fixing cartel along with BPB of Britain and Knauf of Germany, according to people close to the case. The  fine will be one of the largest meted out by the European Union competition authority. Knauf also expects to be  fined, while BPB is hoping for a reduced fine in return for having cooperated with the inquiry. The largest cartel  fine by the commission, 462 million euros, was served on the Swiss chemicals group Hoffmann-La Roche last year for its role in a cartel in the vitamins market.

LP
BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (AFP) - The European Commission Wednesday fined four firms 478.3 million euros (475 million dollars) for operating a cartel in the plasterboard business, the second-highest such fine ever.

The total was second only to 855.23 million  euros slapped last year against a group of pharmaceutical giants accused of running a cartel in vitamin pills.

TD
French cement giant Lafarge was  fined 249.6 million euros, British firm BPB 138.6 million  euros, German group Knauf 85.8 million and Gyproc Benelux of Belgium 4.32 million.

The EU executive pointed out that the cartel affected 80 percent of consumers in the  European Union, since plasterboard is a product widely used in the building industry and by people doing DIY.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, adding that the  commission "is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well- being of consumers."

"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies," he said.

The plasterboard industry had an annual turnover of 1.2 billion  euros in 1997, the last year of the infringement.

Monti noted that two of the four countries fined Wednesday, Lafarge and BPB, were committing their second breach of EU law, having been fined already in 1994.
The Commission found that the cartel started at a meeting held in London in early 1992 at which BPB
and Knauf agreed to end a "price war," which had been benefitting consumers, said a statement.

A secret information exchange system was subsequently set up to avoid over-aggressive competition in the market and to bolster prices for  plasterboard, used as a prefabricated construction material.

The announcement came a day after the EU agreed to beef up the  commission's powers to investigate suspect corporate activity, as part of the first reform of antitrust rules in 40 years.

The European Commission will be empowered to search company managers' homes for the first time under the changes, to look for incriminating documents smuggled out of offices.

The new rules are due to come into force on May 1, 2004, on the same day the EU plans to welcome 10 new members from eastern  Europe and the Mediterranean.

HD     Lafarge to contest  EU fine, lodge appeal

PARIS, Nov 27 (AFP) - French cement giant Lafarge said Wednesday it would vigorously contest the European Commission's decision to  fine the company 249.6 million  euros (247.8 million dollars) for price fixing and that it planned to lodge an appeal immediately.

The commission said earlier it had imposed  fines totalling 478.3 million  euros -- the second-highest such fine ever -- on a group of companies it had accused of operating a cartel in the  plasterboard market.

TD
The other companies were BPB Industries of Britain, Knauf of Germany and Gyproc Benelux of Belgium.

Lafarge, which operates widely in  Europe, said its plasterboard unit currently has a 22 percent market share in Britain and 15 percent in Germany.

"In these two countries," it added, "plasterboard prices are today, as they were in 1998, lower than before 1990."

"These facts run counter to any notion that the  plasterboard unit might have been involved in an understanding on prices and quantities since 1992."
The Commission alleged that the cartel had gotten underway at a meeting held in London in early 1992. ppy-lt/nh

CORRECTION: ATTENTION -- ADDS Lafarge reaction

LP
BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (AFP) - The European Commission Wednesday fined four firms 478.3 million euros (475 million dollars) for operating a cartel in the plasterboard business, the second-highest such fine ever.

The total was second only to 855.23 million  euros slapped last year against a group of pharmaceutical giants accused of running a cartel in vitamin pills.

TD
French cement giant Lafarge was  fined 249.6 million euros, British firm BPB 138.6 million  euros, German group Knauf 85.8 million and Gyproc Benelux of Belgium 4.32 million.

The EU executive pointed out that the cartel affected 80 percent of consumers in the  European Union, since plasterboard is a product widely used in the building industry and by people doing DIY.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, adding that the  commission "is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well- being of consumers."

"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies," he said.

The plasterboard industry had an annual turnover of 1.2 billion  euros in 1997, the last year of the infringement.

Monti noted that two of the four countries fined Wednesday, Lafarge and BPB, were committing their second breach of EU law, having been fined already in 1994.

The Commission said it had determined that the cartel started at a meeting held in London in early 1992 at which BPB and Knauf agreed to end a "price war" that had been benefitting consumers.

A secret information exchange system was subsequently set up to avoid over-aggressive competition in the market and to bolster prices for  plasterboard, used as a prefabricated construction material, according to the  Commission.

In Paris, Lafarge vowed to vigorously contest the Commision decision and said it planned to lodge an appeal immediately.

Lafarge, which operates widely in  Europe, said its plasterboard unit currently has a 22 percent market share in Britain and 15 percent in Germany.
"In these two countries," it added, "plasterboard prices are today, as they were in 1998, lower than before
1990."

"These facts run counter to any notion that the  plasterboard unit might have been involved in an understanding on prices and quantities since 1992."

The Commission's announcement came a day after the EU agreed to beef up the  commission's powers to investigate suspect corporate activity, as part of the first reform of antitrust rules in 40 years.

The panel will be empowered to search company managers' homes for the first time under the changes to look for incriminating documents smuggled out of offices.

The new rules are due to come into force on May 1, 2004, on the same day the EU plans to welcome 10 new members from eastern  Europe and the Mediterranean.

HD     EU competition guardian  back on the offensive

BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (AFP) - The EU's embattled competition watchdog, Mario Monti, underlined his reputation for vigour Wednesday with near-record  fines against a European building industry cartel including the world's largest cement firm.

French cement giant Lafarge and three other companies from Belgium, Britain and Germany were  fined a total of 478.3 million  euros (475 million dollars) for fixing prices of  plasterboard -- a key component for
do-it-yourself enthusiasts.

TD
The total was second only to 855.23 million  euros slapped last year against a group of pharmaceutical giants accused of running a cartel in vitamin pills.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Monti, the  European Union's commissioner for competition issues, who has suffered a string of stinging legal setbacks.
Last month Monti's department  fined Japanese company Nintendo and seven European distributors
167.8 million euros for rigging distribution of computer consoles and games in Europe, the fifth- largest
ever levied by the commission.
Lafarge, like Nintendo, vowed to appeal.

Lafarge said that in Britain and Germany, "plasterboard prices are today, as they were in 1998, lower than before 1990."

"These facts run counter to any notion that the  plasterboard unit might have been involved in an understanding on prices and quantities since 1992," the French company said in a statement.
The Italian commissioner, however, vowed to remain on the offensive.

"The commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers," he said.

Last year the  commission fined nearly 50 companies a record 1.8 billion  euros for abuse of market power, and looks set to surpass the figure this year.

Monti is intensifying his crackdown after the EU agreed on Tuesday to beef up the  commission's powers to investigate suspect corporate activity, as part of the first reform of antitrust rules in 40 years.

Commission investigators will be empowered to search company managers' homes for the first time to look for incriminating documents taken from offices.

But firms will no longer have to notify business agreements to Brussels, in a bid by the EU to cut swelling bureaucracy and legal costs to companies while allowing the  commission to concentrate on the worst cartel cases.

The regulation sets up a "European Competition Network" of  commission and national inspectors, a move that Monti said would lead to "stronger enforcement of EU law".

The new rules are due to come into force on May 1, 2004, on the same day the EU plans to welcome 10 new members from eastern  Europe and the Mediterranean.

The commission fears its antitrust watchdogs will become too stretched after enlargement and so need to work hand-in-hand with national inspectors.

"We will now turn our energy to completing the reform of the rules and processes in the area of merger and state aids control," added the commissioner, whose department has seen three recent vetoes of mergers overturned by EU judges.

The European Court of Justice in June overturned the  commission's veto of a merger between travel companies Airtours and First Choice.

Then last month it overturned a veto of French firm Schneider's acquisition of Legrand as well as a decision to block Swedish Tetra Laval's purchase of Sidel of France.

Monti vowed to broaden the scope of a planned reform of EU merger rules after the legal setbacks, which commentators warned could deal a fatal blow to the authority of his Brussels watchdog if it does not change.

HD    EU fines companies 478 million euro for running plasterboard cartel; Aventis  punished for chemical  price-fixing

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators fined four companies a total of 478 million  euro
(US$455 million) Wednesday for fixing the prices of plasterboard and other building materials.

The fines were imposed on France's Lafarge SA, Germany's Knauf GmbH, Belgium's Gyproc and Britain's BPB PLC. They were the second-highest ever imposed by the  European Commission, following 2001 levies against a vitamin cartel.

TD
"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies," said Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner.
In a separate decision, the  commission also fined German-French drugs maker Aventis 2.85 million  euro
(US$2.83 million) for operating a price-fixing agreement with Germany's Merck KgaA on a chemical used
in x-rays.
Merck escaped a fine under immunity rules because it informed EU regulators of the cartel.

After a four-year antitrust investigation into the plasterboard market, the  commission fined BPB 138.6 million euro (US$137.7 million) and Lafarge 249.6 million euro (US$248 million). The two companies had been previously fined for similar offenses in 1994.
Knauf must pay 85.8 million  euro (US$85.2 million) and Gyproc 4.32 million  euro (US$4.29 million).

In a statement, the  commission said the cartel operated from 1992 to 1998 and covered 80 percent of consumers in an EU market worth 1.2 billion  euro (US$1.19 billion).

The companies met in London to end a price war that had driven down prices and subsequently set up a secret information exchange system to monitor market trends and avoid over aggressive competition, the Commission said.
Under EU rules, the companies have 3 months to pay the  fines.

Monti has made tackling price fixing arrangements a priority. On Tuesday, EU governments approved reforms to give his office more powers to fight cartels.

"The commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers, as is the case here," he said.

Lafarge spokesman Denis Boulet declined to comment, saying he had not yet been informed officially of the decision.

The commission said two Aventis units and Merck had collaborated to control prices of methylglucamine between 1990 and 1999. Under EU rules, companies that inform trustbusters of a cartel can claim immunity from  fines.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission Wednesday fined four companies a total of EUR478 million for fixing the prices of key building materials.
France's Lafarge SA (LR), Germany's Knauf GmbH (G.KNF), Belgium's Gyproc and the U.K.'s BPB
PLC (U.BPB) specialize in making  plasterboard and other gypsum-based materials used in many walls
and ceilings.

The E.U.  fined BPB EUR138.6 million and Lafarge EUR249.6 million after investigating the sector for four years. The two companies had been previously  fined for similar offenses in 1994. Germany's Knauf GmbH (G.KNF) must pay EUR85.8 million and Gyproc EUR4.32 million.

"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies," said E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

Lafarge spokesman Denis Boulet declined to comment, saying he hadn't yet been informed officially of the E.U.'s decision.

The Commission said the fines on the four companies were its second highest ever following 2001 levies against companies accused of price fixing in the vitamin market.

The fines are some of the highest ever imposed by E.U. trustbusters.  Europe's antitrust chief Mario Monti is taking tough measures to bust the continent's deeply entrenched cartels. The building material price-fixing involves a market with about EUR1.2 billion in annual sales, a  Commission statement said.

Since taking office in 1999, Monti has established a second specialized cartel-busting unit. He is also doing more to encourage price-fixers to come forward with information and authorized intrusive "dawn raids" on executives' homes.

The plasterboard cartel began in 1992 with a meeting in London, the  Commission said. BPB and Knauf agreed to put an end to a price war. They agreed to reduce competition since the price of plasterboard had fallen sharply in previous years.

The companies then set up a secret information-exchange system to monitor the market and avoid competition. Lafarge joined the system in 1992 and Gyproc began participating in 1996.

Top company officials met at a hotel in Versailles in 1996 and then on the margins of a trade association congress to prevent a new price war.
Maximum fines in E.U. cartel probes run as high as 10% of an offender's worldwide annual turnover. Companies can win immunity from  fines by coming forward first with information that helps break open
a price-fixing ring. Companies that are found breaking the law for several years or refusing to share
information with investigators will receive much tougher financial penalties.

The E.U. broke up 10 price-fixing rings last year, levying EUR1.8 billion in  fines on 50 companies.

Just last month, the E.U. launched surprise raids on German chemicals powerhouse Bayer AG (BAY) and oil giants BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XON) and Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (RD) on suspicion of fixing bitumen prices.

HD             Lafarge To Appeal EU Court's  EUR250M Cartel Fine

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French construction materials company Lafarge SA (LR) said Wednesday that it will appeal the EUR250 million  fine imposed by the European Union Commission for fixing the prices of key building materials.

In a statement, Lafarge said it "vigorously challenges" the decision and will "immediately" bring the case before the E.U.'s Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

TD
The EU Commission fined Lafarge and three other building material suppliers a total of EUR478 million for running a cartel to control prices and share in the  plasterboard market in the U.K. and Germany.
In a statement, Lafarge said the  fine is practically equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of
plasterboard in the two countries.

Lafarge also said "in both these countries, today as in 1998, the sales prices of  plasterboard are lower than before 1990," the year Lafarge began expanding that business outside of France.

"These facts conflict with the very idea of the participation of the Gypsum Division in a hypothetical existing collusion over prices or quantities since 1992," Lafarge said.

Lafarge said that in its appeal to the Court of First Instance it "places all its confidence in the authority that will be ruling on both the respect of the procedure and the substance of the matter."

The E.U. also  fined Germany's Knauf GmbH (G.KNF) EUR85.8 million, Belgium's Gyproc EUR4.32 million, and the U.K.'s BPB PLC (U.BPB) EUR138.6 million for participating in the cartel.

The Commission said the fines on the four companies were its second highest ever after 2001 levies against companies accused of price fixing in the vitamin market.

HD            Lafarge: Fine "Out Of Proportion" To Plasterboard Sales

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- The EUR250 million  fine for price-fixing levied Wednesday by the  European Union Commission on Lafarge (LR) is "out of proportion" to the sales made in the markets concerned, a spokesman for the French building materials company said.

In 2001 Lafarge's plasterboard sales totaled EUR109 million in the U.K. and Germany, the spokesman said, making the fine about 2.5 times the amount of its annual sales in these two countries.

TD
"The amount of the  fine is out of proportion to the sales we made in these countries," the spokesman said, "Lafarge considers this an arbitrary decision without any economic foundation."

Lafarge will bring a case immediately to the  European Court of First Instance to challenge the  fine, the spokesman said.
"We will do our utmost to convince the court that no significant wrongdoing took place," he added. Lafarge will dispute the accusation that it colluded on market share and prices for  plasterboard with
competitors, as well as challenging the size of the  fine, the spokesman said.

Lafarge will also challenge the E.U.  Commission's procedural handling of the case, the spokesman said. He declined to specify the procedural errors that Lafarge believes the  Commission made in the case.

The spokesman said Lafarge doesn't expect to have to pay the  fine until its case at the CFI is finished, which could take several years.

The E.U.  fined Lafarge and three other building materials suppliers a total of EUR478 million for fixing the prices of key building materials.
BPB PLC (U.BPB) was  fined EUR138.6 million, Germany's Knauf GmbH (G.KNF) was  fined
EUR85.8 million, and Belgium's Gyproc was  fined EUR4.32 million.

"The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer, and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies, E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

This is the second time the E.U. has fined Lafarge for operating a cartel. In 1994, the E.U. ruled that Lafarge, along with 42 other European cement companies, had operated a cement cartel. Lafarge was fined EUR23.9 million, but the CFI cut that to EUR14.25 million in 2000.

HD         BPB To Appeal Against  EU EUR138.6 Mln Fine
WC        410 words
PD         27 November 2002

Edited Press Release

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- BPB said Wednesday it has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of European Commissionfine, which it said is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high.

TD
The European Commission Wednesday said it had decided to  fine BPB EUR138.6 million (GBP88.8 million) out of a total European gypsum industry fine of EUR478.3 million (GBP306.6 million) for alleged breaches of competition law under Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome.

BPB said none of the  commission's findings relate to any of the group's on-going activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any finding of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past.

In short, BPB believes that the  commission's case lacks the evidence necessary to substantiate its claims.

The group has been actively co-operating with the  commission throughout its four-year investigation and is disappointed that it has rejected, without justification, much of what BPB has said to it.

The company said Wednesday that the commission's general allegation that BPB participated in a long-running cartel in the principal E.U. plasterboard markets are based upon supposition and contrived explanations unsupported by the facts.

While there was within the industry, on an irregular basis, a general exchange of straightforward, highly aggregated and historical sales volume data for certain markets, this was against the background of the absence of any statistics on market size for the industry as a whole. The industry objective was simply
to have some data on the overall size and rate of growth in the markets concerned.
BPB is also disappointed that the  commission has seen fit to take into account as an aggravating
factor the imposition of a  fine on one of its former Dutch subsidiaries, BPB De Eendracht, for a previous
infringement in the cartonboard sector in 1994. The subsidiary concerned played no role in the
infringing activities other than being a member of the trade association concerned. Moreover, the  fine of
EUR1.75 million was reduced on appeal to EUR0.75 million (GBP0.5 million).

The total amount of the group's  fine will be charged as an exceptional item in the accounts for the six months to 30 September 2002, pending the outcome of any appeal.
BPB will tomorrow announce its interim results and dividend for the six months to 30 September 2002.

HD         EU Shows Resolve To Fight Cartels With EUR500M In Fines

Of Dow Jones Newswires

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  European Union regulators Wednesday imposed  fines of almost EUR500 million against five companies for fixing prices of building materials and a drug additive, underlining their determination to crack down on cartels.

TD
France's Lafarge SA (LR) took the biggest single hit, EUR249.5 million for manipulating prices of plasterboard used in walls and ceilings. Lafarge said it "vigorously challenges" the decision and will "immediately" bring the case before the E.U.'s Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. But regulators said the French company was signaled out for special punishment because it was  fined for similar offenses in 1994.

"This is a serious warning to companies not to repeat such an offense," said E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. The high  fines have "rather shocked the corporate culture in many countries."

The U.K.'s BPB PLC (U.BPB), Germany's Knauf GmbH (G.KNF) and Belgium's Gyproc received smaller fines in the plasterboard case - EUR138.6 million, EUR85.8 million and EUR4.32 million, respectively.

Separately, regulators  fined Aventis SA (F.AVE) EUR2.85 million for fixing the price of a substance called methyglucamine used for radiology. The low  fine reflected that the size of the market involved - a little more than EUR3.1 million annually compared with EUR1.2 billion in the building material,
according to the  Commission.

Taken together, analysts said the fine shows how regulators are determined to root out cartels, which have been treated lightly in Europe compared with the U.S. While executives face criminal charges for price fixing in the U.S., only their companies can be  fined in most E.U. countries. The  fines also suggest that recent court decisions overturning E.U. regulatory decisions hasn't put them completely on the defensive.

"The regulators slipped up in the merger cases because they were working under a strict time restriction, while in cartels, they can work to a higher standard, pursuing the investigations for three, four or five years," said Ken Daly, an antitrust expert at the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Since taking office in 1999, Monti has established a second specialized cartel-busting unit. He is also doing more to encourage price-fixers to come forward with information and authorized intrusive "dawn raids" on executives' homes.

The plasterboard cartel began in 1992 with a meeting in London, the  Commission said. BPB and Knauf agreed to put an end to a price war and reduce competition since the price of  plasterboard had fallen sharply in previous years, it said.

The companies then set up a secret information-exchange system to monitor the market and avoid competition. Lafarge joined the system in 1992 and Gyproc began participating in 1996.

Top company officials met at a hotel in Versailles in 1996 and then on the margins of a trade association congress to prevent a new price war, the E.U. said.

In the drug additive case, regulators began their investigation after Germany's Merck KgaA revealed the cartel's existence in September 2000. Brussels' antitrust investigators then carried out inspections
at Aventis in January 2001. Merck avoided  fines by its action and Aventis was granted a 40% reduction in its fine for cooperating, the regulators said.

Aventis stopped producing the product in April. Production costs were high and margins were weak, a spokesman said.

HD          EU fines four companies for price fixing. BY           By JOSEPHINE CUMBO IN LONDON.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined four construction companies a total of EUR478m
($474m) for their role in a long-running price fixing cartel in the market for  plasterboard.
Lafarge, the French company, received the largest  fine of EUR250m. For Lafarge and BPB, a UK
group, this was the second time the companies were penalised for breaching EU competition rules.

TD
Shortly after the  fines were announced, Lafarge said it would "vigorously challenge" the decision and would apply to bring the case before the Court of First Instance.
BPB, which is set to reports its first-half results on Thursday, was  fined EUR138m.

Knauf, a German family-owned group, was  fined EUR85m. Gyproc Benelux, of Belgium, received the smallest penalty of EUR4.3m.

The fines followed a four-year investigation by the  Commission, which concluded that BPB, Lafarge and Knauf had taken part in the cartel in the UK, France, Germany and the Benelux countries between
1992 and 1998.
Gyproc Benelux was found to have joined the cartel in 1996.

The Commission said the fines, which were the second highest for a cartel-related investigation, reflected the sizes of the plasterboard market, which had a turnover of EUR1.2bn in 1997, the last full year of the infringement.
The Commission estimated that the cartel affected 80 per cent of consumers in the EU, who bought
plasterboard, a product used in the construction of walls and ceilings.
Shares in Lafarge fell 2 per cent to EUR76.95 in Paris, with BPB losing 2 per cent to stand at 2563/4p.

U.S. credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) has maintained its "BBB" long-term credit rating with stable outlook on French cement maker Lafarge after the  European Commission (EC) fined the company 250 mln euro ($247.6 mln), the agency said on November 28, 2002.

The EC fined Lafarge and three other building material companies a total of 478 mln euro ($473.4 mln) for their role in a long-running price-fixing cartel in the  plasterboard market. The high fine will decrease the ability of Lafarge to decrease its debts, but the company should not change its targets for 2003, the agency said. Lafarge said that the  fine was double its annual  plasterboard sales in the UK and Germany.

Blair to flesh out Britain's EU blueprint

LONDON - Prime Minister Tony Blair will spell out on Thursday Britain's vision of the  European Union's future - one based firmly on the primacy of nation states.

In a keynote speech in the Welsh capital Cardiff, aides said Blair will not stray from the government's long-held policy on euro entry. It will assess the economic case for joining the single currency by
mid-2003 and proceed from there.

But he will crystallise his thoughts on the convention headed by former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, which is drafting a constitution for an enlarged EU.

Schroeder urges EU encouragement to Turkey

BERLIN - Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Wednesday Germany would push for the  European Union to send Turkey a strong signal of encouragement on its bid to join the bloc at next month's EU summit.
"The real question now is to decide a date, not for Turkey's accession to the EU, but for the start of
entry talks," Schroeder said at a joint news conference after talks with Turkey's President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer.

"We have made clear that Germany will push for a signal at the Copenhagen summit which goes beyond the decisions made in Brussels in October," he said.

EU backs aid for UK nuclear firm, OKs loan growth

BRUSSELS/LONDON - Britain won  European Commission approval for its state bail-out of troubled nuclear firm British Energy on Wednesday along with the right to almost double the loan to 1.17 billion pounds ($1.81 billion) under certain conditions.

"The aid was warranted on the grounds that there is a risk of disruption in the supply of electricity in the United Kingdom and to ensure nuclear safety," the  Commission said in its role as the  European Union's industry regulator.

The aid was granted on the condition that a full restructuring is in place by March 9, 2003. The provider of a fifth of the UK's power ran into trouble earlier this year when wholesale electricity prices dropped below the production cost.

Top telecom firms make case to EU on tough market

BRUSSELS - Leading telecoms firms held talks with the  European Commision on Wednesday, pleading their case at a time of a serious market downturn.

The companies included British Telecom, Telefonica and Telecom Italia, and they met  European Commissioner Erkki Liiakenen, who is responsible for telecoms markets, as well as senior EU competition official Philip Lowe.

A source at the  European Commission said the companies were not calling openly for state aid, but rather for increased investment in research and development.
The firms had also highlighted the difficulties they face in current market conditions.

EU's Solana to push for death of Yugoslavia deal

BELGRADE -  European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana travels to Belgrade on Thursday to prompt Serbia and Montenegro to finalise a deal on reshaping the Yugoslav federation into a loose union.

"The message is that Mr Solana is coming to give a final impulse (for an agreement)," Solana's spokeswoman Cristina Gallach told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday.

Under pressure from Brussels, the two remaining Yugoslav republics after a decade of Balkan bloodshed reached a framework deal in March on ditching the federation. But they have wrangled ever since on the details of the union to take its place.

Western officials have urged them to reach an agreement soon, warning failure to do so would delay closer ties with the rest of  Europe.

EU parliament calls for full rail liberalisation
BRUSSELS - The  European Parliament's transport committee voted on Wednesday to throw open the
EU's railways, including domestic passenger services, to competition by 2008.

The committee's amendments to a draft law could enable any EU rail firm to operate trains in other EU states, in theory pitting national railways such as France's SNCF and Germany's Deutsche Bahn against each other in their home territories.

The vote goes much further than an original bill which only envisaged liberalising rail freight and it is sure to encounter stiff opposition from public sector unions and governments that are reluctant to disrupt their state-owned railways.

Danes walk knife-edge to get EU enlargement deal

BRUSSELS -  European Union president Denmark is walking a tightrope as it races to wrap up talks on the 15-nation bloc's historic eastward enlargement in the next two weeks.

Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has won high marks from his EU peers and candidate countries for his skill in driving the bloc and the 10 leading aspirants single-mindedly towards a landmark deal in Copenhagen next month.

His unusual presidency style combines transparency in making public usually secret negotiating documents, with the ruthless pursuit of a deliberately narrow agenda.

But he faces fierce last-minute pressures from both sides in the endgame, gambling that neither tight-fisted member states nor over-demanding candidates will ultimately derail a deal.

UK's Brown has little good to say about  Europe

Page 76 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LONDON - British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown played to the home crowd on Wednesday, using a set-piece speech to parliament to lay into the pitfalls of  European-style economics.

While Brown was careful to stick to the script on joining the  euro - he is not considered too keen - he poured scorn on Europe's economic record compared to Britain's. "Britain's monetary and fiscal framework is meeting the challenges," he told parliament. "We will tolerate nothing that will put our hard-won stability at risk."

EU takes tough line on debt in budget rule revamp

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission set out proposals for better enforcement of EU budget rules on Wednesday that would give Brussels greater power to make member states reduce high debt levels and reward low-debt countries.

The plan came after months of pressure from governments and others to make budget rules more growth-friendly.

Commission President Romano Prodi said it aims to inject greater intelligence, flexibility, and authority into the way the  European Union applies limits on budget deficits.

EU Commission faces pressure over illegal migrants

BRUSSELS - The European Commission is doing too little to ensure illegal immigrants can be sent home, despite pressure from European Union states to act tough on unwanted migrants, diplomats said on Wednesday.

France and other EU members are accusing the bloc's executive body of being too soft on non-EU countries and failing to clinch agreements to make sure any nationals that enter the  European Union illegally are allowed to return home.

So-called "readmission agreements" with countries such as Russia and Morocco, which set out conditions for repatriating illegal immigrants, are seen as central to efforts to minimise the flow of unwanted migrants.

Eichel says backs EU plans for budget rule revamp

BERLIN - German Finance Minister Hans Eichel voiced support on Wednesday for a  European             Commission proposal to take more account of public debt when assessing the health of countries' budgets.

"I think it's right that the total public debt has to be taken into account," Eichel told reporters after budget talks with the finance ministers of Germany's 16 federal states.

Eichel declined to comment in detail on the rest of the  Commission's proposals but said a suggestion that low debt countries should be able to invest more was "worthy of discussion".

Czechs, Hungary sense Euro assembly seats victory

PRAGUE - The Czech Republic and Hungary, two leading European Union candidates, said on Wednesday they had been offered extra seats in the European Parliament, putting them on a par with similarly sized EU states.
The offer was made in a package of sweeteners put to 10 mainly ex-communist candidate countries by
EU president Denmark earlier this week.

The two central  European powers, both with populations of around 10 million, had lobbied hard for more seats in the directly-elected assembly after the EU's Nice Treaty gave them fewer than EU members Belgium and Portugal, both of a similar size.

ECB members say inflation safe, room to cut rates

FRANKFURT -  European Central Bank officials voiced unusually high confidence on Wednesday that inflation was under control, sending a strong signal that they may lower interest rates next week.

The bank has already said it discussed cutting rates at its November 7 policy meeting, when it left its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, and financial markets almost fully price in a 50 basis points cut on December 5.

European Central Bank Vice-President Lucas Papademos gave the clearest indication on Wednesday that the bank was ready to act, saying the improved inflation outlook gave more room for a rate cut.

Denmark warns EU candidates to show realism

BRUSSELS/WARSAW - EU president Denmark warned Poland and other candidates on Wednesday not to push unrealistic demands in the endgame of accession talks, but the applicants cautiously welcomed the Danes' improved offer.
Denmark's new package, presented to the 10 leading candidates on Tuesday, includes 1.3 billion
euros of new cash, additional money for farmers, higher agricultural production quotas and more funds
for nuclear safety and border controls.

Stung by demands from some candidates for still more money, a senior Danish presidency source noted that barely two weeks remain before a summit in Copenhagen where the 15-nation EU hopes to conclude the long and complex negotiations.

"Some countries have shown little understanding of where we stand in the negotiating process," the source said.

EU keeps pressure on Swiss in tax row,approves US

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission will tell EU ministers next week Switzerland has not gone all the way to help the bloc in its fight against tax evasion, but will give the thumbs up to the United States,
a report showed.
A report, to be presented to finance ministers on December 3, sums up the outcome of tax talks with
Switzerland, the United States, Monaco, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Andorra.

The 15-nation bloc wants to adopt by year-end a law that would require its members to automatically share data on savings held abroad by EU residents in order to clamp down on tax evasion.

Lafarge faces big  fine as EU punishes price-fixing
BRUSSELS - The  European Commission on Wednesday fined Lafarge and three other companies
478 million euros ($475 million) for conspiring to fix the price of plasterboard, a building material used
in homes and businesses.

The Commission said it imposed the huge  fine, its second largest ever, because the cartel affected 80 percent of European consumers in what is a 1.2 billion  euro market.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement about the case involving the ubiquitous paper-covered plaster.

The Commission came down hardest on France's Lafarge, fining the company 249.6 million euros. It also fined Britain's BPB 138.6 million  euros, Germany's privately held Knauf 85.8 million euros and Belgium's Gyproc 4.32 million  euros.

Swedish c.banker says crown to firm if join  euro

STOCKHOLM - Swedish deputy central bank governor Kristina Persson reiterated on Wednesday the central bank's view that the crown could be tied to the  euro in a range of 8.2 to a little over nine crowns if Sweden adopted the  euro.
Page 78 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Persson, who is not related to Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, said in a prepared speech that the crown would appreciate further before it is locked in the Exchange Rate Mechanism 2, a view already voiced by deputy central bank governor Lars Heikensten.

"All models and forecasts at the Riksbank's disposal now suggest that the real exchange rate will appreciate in the coming years," Persson said.

"The question is by how much. The different models give a wide range of estimates for the real appreciation, ranging from a few per cent up to 10 per cent from the current level."

EU urges drastic fishing cuts to halt cod crisis

BRUSSELS - The  European Union, its cod stocks on the brink of collapse after years of overfishing, called on Wednesday for drastic cuts in catches and in the time fishermen spend at sea in a bid to cope with the crisis.

An action plan set out by Fisheries Commissioner Franz Fischler demanded cuts of 80 percent in cod and haddock catches and 75 percent for whiting in EU fishing areas, until scientists indicated that a minimum level of mature fish had been reached.

Scientists say an outright ban is the only way to avoid the collapse of whitefish stocks, but the EU executive, the  European Commission, rejected this, saying it had a social duty to protect communities dependent on fishing for their livelihood.

Schroeder backs looser EU budget "corset" - paper
BERLIN - German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was quoted on Wednesday voicing support for
European Commission efforts to make  European Union rules on budget deficits more flexible.

"There is an interesting debate about whether its appropriate to take the deficit as the only criteria," Schroeder told Die Zeit newspaper, according to an advance copy of an interview due to be published on Thursday.

"One could also ask whether absolute debt, inflation and unemployment should also play a role in judging what is or is not economically sensible," he added.

"I think this and not the softening or scrapping of the (EU Stability and Growth Pact) is the right discussion," Schroeder was quoted as saying.

EU welcomes release of Syria dissident, urges more

DAMASCUS - The  European Union welcomed on Wednesday the release of a leading Syrian dissident earlier this month and urged Syrian authorities to follow up the move by freeing all political prisoners.
"The European Union welcomes the release from prison of Riad al-Turk," said a statement from the
Damascus embassy of Denmark, the current holder of the EU revolving presidency.

"The European Union urges the Syrian government to let this positive decision be followed by the release of all political prisoners including the remaining nine prominent members of civil society arrested in Autumn 2001 for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of speech," it said.

- Turnover up 15%, due to US wallboard acquisition and continued volume growth in  Europe -
Plasterboard and plaster volumes up 26% and 5% respectively, like-for-like sales increasing 5% and 3%
- Underlying profit before tax up 33% to £95.6 million, driven by higher US selling prices and further
efficiencies in North America - Underlying operating profit increased £25.6 million to £110.0 million,
despite restructuring charges up £5.1 million at £12.1 million, as North America achieved a turnaround
from a £16.7 million loss to an £11.9 million profit. Group return on sales up from 10.2% to 11.5% -
European underlying operating profit of £94.3 million (£96.6 million) after £14.0 million increase in input
costs - Worldwide cost savings from on-going businesses equivalent to more than 1.5% of group
turnover, with $50 million of North American annualised savings in place ahead of schedule - Underlying
earnings per share up 39%, including the benefit from a lower tax charge - Stronger cash generation,
with operating cash flow up £26.7 million to £146.1 million - BPB will appeal against the wholly
inappropriate and disproportionately high  European Commission fine of e138.6 million (£88.8 million)
for alleged breaches of competition law between 1992 and 1998 - Interim dividend up 3.3% to 4.65p per
share. Richard Cousins, BPB chief executive, said:

"BPB continues to build a sound business base for future growth, delivering substantially better underlying earnings in the first half by significantly improving the scale, profitability and cash generation of North American operations, further reducing the group's cost base, and strengthening the core European businesses."
BPB'S FIRST HALF PROGRESS

The group's underlying pre-tax profit of £95.6 million was 33% up on the corresponding period as the North American business moved from loss into profit, as a result of higher US selling prices on continuing good demand, further operating cost efficiencies and five months trading from the newly acquired James Hardie wallboard business. This was BPB's third successive half-year of underlying profit growth, continuing the group's recovery trend first reported last November.

In last year's annual report management identified several key business priorities for the immediate future, progress on which has included:
- Integration of the US wallboard acquisition (which is now well underway), efficiency improvements in
North



American operations, and closure of the US paper mill at Quincy.

-Further restructuring in Germany in response to a worsening trading situation. - Overall cost savings from BPB's on-going businesses equivalent to more than 1.5% of group sales, with $50



million of North American annualised cost savings in place by the period end - six months ahead of the
original March 2003 target.
-Stronger first half cash generation resulting in operating cash flow up £26.7 million to £146.1 million. BPB recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations to acquire control of Gyproc Benelux
NV, subject to regulatory approvals, which will secure leadership of the Belgian and Dutch markets for
plasterboard and plasters. Comprising a net cash consideration of e30.5 million (£19.1 million) and
approximately e25 million (£15.5 million) of debt, the acquisition is expected to be completed by next
Spring and be earnings enhancing in 2003/04. GROUP FIRST HALF RESULTS

Group sales were up by 15% to £953.3 million, with the James Hardie acquisition contributing two-thirds of the increase. The balance came largely from further volume growth in  Europe and acquired specialist distribution businesses in Spain. Like-for-like group  plasterboard and plaster volumes grew 5% and 3% respectively, with overall volumes up 26% and 5%.

Underlying operating profit increased £25.6 million to £110.0 million as North America achieved a profit of £11.9 million against a corresponding loss of £16.7 million. Although  European profit of £94.3 million was marginally down on last year (£96.6 million) this was after booking an additional £3.0 million charge for UK pensions, and German restructuring costing £2.0 million. Groupwide restructuring and redundancy charges taken against operating profit were £12.1 million (£7.0 million). Group return on sales improved from 10.2% to 11.5%.


Page 81 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Underlying earnings per share rose 39% to 13.1p, reflecting the first half growth in profit and a fall in the effective tax rate to 32% from an abnormally high 39% in the corresponding period (caused by unrelieved US losses). Reported pre-tax profit of £1.2 million (£69.1 million) was after charging the EC  fine of £88.8 million and the group's £1.3 million share of the Gyproc Benelux EC  fine, goodwill amortisation of £7.6 million (£4.9 million), and a net exceptional gain of £3.3 million (£2.2 million) which mainly related to UK property disposals.

Following the James Hardie acquisition, net debt increased to £561.7 million (£496.0 million). However the group interest charge of £14.7 million was only £0.3 million higher due to lower interest rates, with interest cover strengthening to 7.5 times earnings (5.9 times). The post-tax return on BPB's average capital invested increased by 1.8 percentage points on the corresponding period to 8.8%.

The interim dividend will increase by 3.3% (2.3%) to provide a payment of 4.65p per share for the six months ended 30 September 2002. REGIONAL TRADING PERFORMANCES

Europe

Volume growth in the western and southern regions continued to offset difficult trading conditions in other markets and, together with further overall cost savings, underpinned a solid  European performance.

Regional underlying operating profit of £94.3 million (£96.6 million) was after a £14.0 million increase in input costs (mostly recycled paper, insurance and pensions) and £2.0 million of German restructuring charges which were largely offset by core product sales growth of 6% and some £8 million of further cost savings.
North & Western  Europe

Plasterboard and building plaster sales grew by 7% and 3% respectively, driven by increased UK house building and strong renovation demand, and cost savings equal to nearly 1% of regional turnover were achieved. Additional plaster capacity was introduced in the UK to meet higher demand and results improved in Ireland despite slower growth.

However, overall underlying operating profit declined £3.9 million to £46.6 million due to a substantial increase in the cost of recycled waste paper and a further weakening in some Nordic markets. In addition, the triennial valuation of BPB's principal UK pension scheme resulted in a lower actuarial surplus and the need to increase the group pension charge by some £6 million per annum on an
on-going basis.
Southern  Europe

The strong growth in  plasterboard volumes experienced in the second half of last year continued into the current year, driving regional operating profit up by 14% to £41.5 million. Overall sales of plasterboard increased by 7%, with progress in Spain, Italy and the key French market benefiting from strong renovation demand. Plaster volumes in the important Iberian market grew by a robust 5%, helped by the commissioning of additional capacity following the recent capital investment programme in Spain.

In Italy additional capacity came on-stream from the new £40 million combined plasterboard and plaster plant at Termoli. This contributed to the efficiency of BPB's European plasterboard supply chain and was in time to meet increasing Italian demand, mainly from a stronger renovation market. Sales of building plasters also grew well. Central & Eastern  Europe

Trading conditions in German building material markets continued to be difficult as construction activity worsened, and led to a lower regional operating profit of £6.2 million (£9.7 million). This result included the additional restructuring cost in Germany arising from an 18% reduction in the workforce.

Plasterboard sales volume in Germany was lower than the corresponding period, albeit the rate of contraction was less than the 10% annual decline experienced over the two previous fiscal years. By contrast, further strong profitable growth was achieved in the Czech Republic, Romania and Greece. Regional plaster sales grew over 20%, reflecting strong demand in eastern  Europe and BPB's acquisition in Turkey.
North America

Average realised wallboard selling prices in the US increased by 28% over the corresponding period, underpinning the £28.6 million turnaround in regional performance to record a profit of £11.9 million despite restructuring charges which exceeded the contribution from five months of post acquisition trading by James Hardie.


Page 82 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Volumes advanced 2% on a like-for-like basis and including acquired sales rose 67%, doubling BPB's regional market share to around 16%. Before restructuring charges the enlarged North American wallboard business generated a return on sales of around 10%, with US selling prices sustained over the half-year at the level reached last March of about $90 per 1,000 square feet.

Restructuring charges were £8.6 million (£4.4 million) and mostly related to the closure of the Quincy paper mill following the negotiation of a new third-party supply contract for wallboard liner. BPB's
like-for-like US manning levels are now 40% below those of two years ago. Although the commercial market remained depressed, further operating efficiencies led to ceiling tile losses being substantially reduced. Integration of the Hardie business is progressing to plan, with delivery of at least $10 million of annualised cost savings expected by September 2003. Rest of the World

BPB's businesses in developing geographic markets continued to experience challenging trading conditions but, at constant exchange rates, overall profits were maintained. Reported operating profit was £3.8 million (£4.5 million) although the overall return on sales remained in excess of 8%. In South
America, Brazilian volumes increased but the Argentinian market collapsed. Southern Africa's profitability was affected by higher input costs. Plaster sales in Egypt remained buoyant and Asia achieved good results from volume growth.
OTHER ISSUES

The European Commission yesterday announced that it had decided to  fine BPB e138.6 million (£88.8 million) out of a total European gypsum industry fine of e478.3 million (£306.6 million) for alleged breaches of competition law under Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome.

BPB has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of its  fine, which is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high. None of the  Commission's findings relate to any of the group's on-going activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any finding of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past. In short, BPB believes that the  Commission's case lacks the evidence necessary to substantiate its claims.

The group has been actively co-operating with the  Commission throughout its four-year investigation and is disappointed that it has rejected, without justification, much of what BPB has said to it. The Commission's general allegation that BPB participated in a long-running cartel in the principal EU plasterboard markets is based upon supposition and contrived explanations unsupported by the facts. It has not taken into account the wealth of economic evidence of vigorous price competition for market share which is inconsistent with the  Commission's findings, nor the lack of any tangible effect of the supposed infringements on the markets concerned. Throughout the 1990's  European plasterboard prices to customers in fact fell substantially in real terms.

There has been much comment recently in the press and from some of BPB's peer group with regard to US asbestos exposure. BPB, which acquired the Celotex and James Hardie Gypsum US wallboard businesses during the last two years, believes it has no potential liability in North America. It is not actively defending any asbestos claims in the US nor has it ever settled any claims there in the past. Outside of North America there have been a small number of individual claims settled (fewer than 10 in over 20 years) and these have all been dealt with by insurers for modest sums.
CURRENT YEAR OUTLOOK

BPB continues to build a sound business base for future growth, delivering substantially better underlying earnings in the first half by significantly improving the scale, profitability and cash generation of North American operations, further reducing the group's cost base, and strengthening the core  European businesses.


There is, however, on-going global uncertainty with growth forecasts in most major economies being steadily downgraded. An element of caution
is therefore appropriate in assessing future prospects. Notwithstanding this, the group's positive trading momentum has continued into the second half and performance has been in line with expectations. Accordingly, the Board remains confident that 2002/03 will be a year of progress for BPB.

=====         =====

Tax has been calculated on the basis of an estimated annual effective rate on underlying profit before tax using current rates of taxation in the principal countries in which the group operates. The actual tax charge of £31.5 million includes the tax effects of the exceptional items disclosed in the profit and loss account.



3        Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share figure is calculated on loss after tax and minority interests of £31.1 million (2001 profit of £39.8 million; 2001/02 profit of £88.4 million) and on the weighted average of 490.0 million (2001 456.8 million; 2001/02 458.1 million) ordinary shares in issue during the period, after excluding the investment in the company's own shares.

The diluted earnings per share figure is based on the same (loss) / profit as the basic earnings per share figure but on 494.0 million (2001 459.0 million; 2001/02 460.4 million) ordinary shares calculated as shown in the table below.


The underlying earnings per share figure is based on (loss) / profit adjusted for goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and on the same weighted average number of shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation above. The directors consider that this measure provides an additional indicator of underlying performance of the group.

8        Acquisitions

On 25 April 2002 BPB acquired all of the issued share capital of James Hardie Gypsum, Inc and Western Mining and Minerals, Inc (together "James Hardie Gypsum ") for a cash consideration of $345 million. Excluding overdrafts acquired of £4.0 million, the total acquisition cost was £244.9 million. A £12.0 million prepayment on a forward contract was made in the last financial year and the balance was paid on completion in April 2002. The provisional goodwill on acquisition was £107.5 million, but the
determination of the fair value of assets acquired will not be finalised until later in the year.

Consideration for other group acquisitions including purchase costs was £12.1 million, of which £7.9 million was paid in the period, with the balance due in later years. Initial calculations indicate that goodwill of £11.1 million arose on these acquisitions. Payments in the period for acquisitions made in prior years totalled £2.0 million.

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The following UK stocks may be affected by newspaper reports and other factors on Thursday:

TD
INVENSYS

U.S. engineering firm Tecumseh Products said late on Wednesday it had reached an agreement to buy the electric motors operations of Invensys for $415 million. The Telegraph market report cited comments from Invensys' chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite that sales in Asia will be "undoubtedly a lot bigger" in three years time.
VODAFONE

The mobile phone operator said late on Wednesday it had no current plan to raise its bid for French telecoms firm Cegetel after the Financial Times reported the UK firm had held talks with its advisers about increasing the offer.

Vodafone announced late on Wednesday the purchase of stakes in its Dutch and Greek units, together worth around 500 million  euros ($496 million), in a move to buy up outstanding equity in listed subsidiaries.
MYTRAVEL

The stricken tour firm has reached a loan deal with its banks that will give it financial breathing space, and said it booked a full-year pretax loss and confirmed it will omit a final dividend.
DAILY MAIL & GENERAL

The media company said it was having an encouraging first quarter but it was "very difficult to predict advertising performance beyond Christmas".
HILTON GROUP

The Times' 'rumour of the day' column reported talk the hotels and gaming firm has withdrawn from the auction to buy Germany's Steigenberger Hotels and Resorts. The newspaper said there were fears Hilton would overpay for the German firm.
BPB

The world's biggest  plasterboard firm reported higher first-half profits, adding it was confident of progress in the full year, despite some caution over global economies. BPB was among four firms the European Commission on Wednesday fined for conspiring to fix the price of  plasterboard.
JOHNSON MATTHEY

Metals and chemicals firm Johnson Matthey reported a first half profit in line with expectations, saying it is making progress despite a weaker U.S. dollar and lower palladium and rhodium prices.

ISOFT
Page 103 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The healthcare software firm said first-half profits before tax and goodwill had ballooned by 60 percent from the year-ago period to 8.2 million pounds ($12.7 million).
FTSE 100

Financial bookmakers are calling the UK benchmark index up around 20-30 points after Wall Street rallied amid signs of an economic recovery. But turnover is likely to be thin as U.S. markets will shut for Thanksgiving holiday.
DATA

On the economic front, the release of GfK consumer confidence report for November at 1030 GMT will attract attention.

HD          FTSE set to climb - Vodafone,Dixons feature. WC         449 words
PD          28 November 2002
ET           09:12 AM
SN          Reuters News

CY          (c) 2002 Reuters Limited

LP
LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Britain's shares are set to climb on Thursday, taking inspiration from an overnight surge on Wall Street, with mobile giant Vodafone a feature after saying it had no plans to raise its offer for France's Cegetel.

Electronics retailer Dixons will also be in focus. It said planned reforms of taxes on sales of extended warranties would add about 20 million pounds to its annual tax bill.

TD
Financial bookmakers at City Index said they expected the FTSE 100 benchmark index to open up 30 points at 4,174, just below where it started the week. Dealers at IG Index and online spreadbetting firm deal4free.com forecast a 20-point gain on the FTSE.

But with the United States closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, market watchers said volume was expected to be slight.

"The Dow had another 50-point rally after the FTSE closed so we'll move up today on the back of that but volume is going to be exceptionally thin. I can't see anyone coming out from under the covers," said Dave Gibbs of IG Index.
VODAFONE FOCUS

Among individual stocks, Vodafone will feature after the mobile phone giant said it had no current plan to raise its bid for French telecoms firm Cegetel. The Financial Times reported Vodafone had held talks with its advisers about raising the offer.

Separately, Vodafone also said on Thursday it said it had purchased stakes in its Dutch and Greek units, together worth around 500 million  euros, pressing ahead with a plan to mop up outstanding equity in listed subsidiaries.

Investors are also expected to pore over results from a series of mid-cap stocks, including final figures from troubled tour operator MyTravel.

Known for its Airtours and Going Places brands, MyTravel said it had made a year loss of 72.8 million pounds and was not paying a final dividend. But it said current bookings were encouraging and added its banks had agreed to extend its 250 million pound credit facility.

Plasterboard maker BPB was also in focus. It reported underlying pre-tax profits of 95.6 million pounds, near the top end of forecasts. The results come one day after BPB was  fined 138.6 million euros by the European Commission for price fixing, but said it would appeal because the amount was disproportionately high.

Media firm Daily Mail & General Trust was another company to report. The publisher of the Daily Mail newspaper reported a final pre-tax profit, before exceptionals, of 182.5 million pounds. The group said its first quarter was encouraging but added it was difficult to predict advertising performance beyond Christmas.

HD           UPDATE 2-Fine takes shine off plasterboard firm BPB's results. BY            By Victoria Cutler

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Britain's BPB Plc, the world's biggest  plasterboard firm, reported higher underlying first-half profit on Thursday, a day after it was slapped with a $138 million  fine for price fixing.

BPB, which has vowed to fight the  European Commission fine, said price rises, cost cutting and a strong U.S. housing market had boosted underlying profit by a third, though it voiced caution amid uncertainty over the global economic outlook.

TD
BPB said pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the six months to the end of September rose to 95.6 million pounds ($147.9 million) from 71.8 million a year earlier, compared to analyst forecasts of between 94 million and 96 million.

BPB took an exceptional charge of 88.8 million pounds ($138 million) for the  fine in the half year, leading to a net loss of 31.1 million pounds.

The company, which was founded in 1915 and makes ceiling tiles and insulation materials, said volume growth in western and southern  Europe had offset difficult trading elsewhere in the region.

Its performance so far in the second half was in line with expectations and Chief Executive Richard Cousins said analyst forecasts for full-year pre-tax profit of about 196 million pounds were not unreasonable.
He said the firm had no specific economic concerns.

"We are doing well. We do expect to make further progress, but we just don't want to get too cocky. If there is a war in Iraq, or a major economic correction in the next year, then BPB, along with virtually every other company, will notice that."

He said the firm had 16 percent of the North American market, where 17 players had become eight over the last 12 years, and he suspected there would be a little more consolidation in the market in the next five years.

"Yes, we would like to get bigger, but we've got no plans to do it in the very short term. We'll see what happens," he said.

Shares in BPB were up 1.1 percent at 270 pence by 1225 GMT. They have lost 11 percent of their value so far this year, slightly outperforming a wider index of construction sector companies.

The firm has vowed to appeal against the price-fixing  fine, rejecting the  European Commission's finding that it had been part of a cartel involving three other  European companies. BPB says the
138.6 million-euro fine was disproportionately high.

France's Lafarge, which was  fined 249.6 million euros, has also announced plans to challenge the decision.


Page 107 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Analyst David Taylor, of brokerage Teather & Greenwood, said the results were in line with BPB's mid-September forecast for first-half underlying profit of around 95 million pounds.
He said the firm had no choice but to expense the EC's  fine against profits, as a provision.

"The EU thing is all very upsetting, but it really is a sideshow in the sense that it's six months' profit lost and gone and life moves on. It doesn't threaten the stability of the group," he said. He kept a "hold" rating on the stock.

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Britain's BPB Plc, the world's biggest  plasterboard firm, reported higher underlying first-half profits on Thursday and said it was confident for the full year despite caution over global economies.

BPB, which has vowed to fight the  European Commission over a 138.6-million-euro ($137.6-million) price-fixing fine announced a day earlier, said price rises, cost cuts and a strong U.S. housing market boosted underlying profits by a third.

TD
BPB said underlying pre-tax profits in the six months to end-September rose to 95.6 million pounds
($147.9 million) from 71.8 million a year earlier, against analysts' forecasts of 94-96 million.

BPB took an exceptional charge of 88.8 million pounds ($138 million) for the  fine in the half year, leading to a net loss of 31.1 million pounds.

The company, which was founded in 1915 and also makes ceiling tiles and insulation materials, said volume growth in western and southern  Europe had continued to offset difficult trading elsewhere in the region.

Its performance in the second half so far was in line with expectations and Chief Executive Richard Cousins said analysts' forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits of about 196 million pounds were not unreasonable.
He said the firm had no specific economic concerns.

"We are doing well, we do expect to make further progress, but we just don't want to get too cocky. If there is a war in Iraq, or a major economic correction in the next year, then BPB along with virtually every other company will notice that."

Shares in BPB were up 0.4 percent at 268 pence in early trade on Thursday. They have lost 11 percent of their value so far this year.

The firm said on Wednesday it would appeal against the price-fixing  fine, rejecting the  European        Commission's finding that it had been part of a cartel involving three other  European companies. BPB also said the  fine was disproportionately high.

France's Lafarge was  fined 249.6 million euros by the Commission. Lafarge has also announced plans to challenge the decision.
($1=.6464 Pound) ($1=1.007  Euro).

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - Commission imposes  heavy penalties  on plasterboard cartel. WC  586 words

CY   (c) 2002 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .

LP
Brussels, 27/11/2002 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has imposed heavy fines on a
long-running cartel on the market for plasterboard ("gyproc" in Belgium and "placoplatre" in France). The
fine, on the four members of the cartel (BPC, Knauf, Lafarge SA and Gyproc Benelux) amounts to a total of
EUR 478 million. This is the second highest  fine ever imposed by the Commission after the "vitamin cartel
case" in December 2001 (EUR 855.23 million). The  fine on Lafarge is also the third largest imposed on a
single company in any case. This particularly high amount reflects the size of the market (over 1.2 billion
turnover in 1997, the last full year of infringement), the impact of the agreement on the consumer (the
product is largely used in construction, also by private individuals), its duration (over six and a half years)
and the repeated behaviour of two of the companies (Lafarge and BPB).

TD
The investigation had begun in 1998 with unannounced inspections on the premises of the companies concerned. Information gathered allowed the  Commission to establish that, between 1992 and 1998, British BPB PLC, German Gebruder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG and French Societe Lafarge SA had formed a cartel in  plasterboard in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and the Benelux countries,
joined by Belgian Gyproc Benelux SA/NV in 1996. The arrangement was all the more harmful to consumers as these companies together produced nearly all  plasterboard in the countries concerned. The origin of
the cartel was a meeting early 1992, during which BPB and Knauf representatives decided to put an end to the price war and expressed a common desire to reduce competition on the German, French, British, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg markets. A secret system of information exchange had therefore been set in place to monitor market developments and to prevent over-fierce competition. Lafarge, and then Gyproc, signed up to the system, in mid 1992 and June 1996 respectively. The  Commission was able to acquire evidence that, on the British market, BPB, Knauf and Lafarge repeatedly, through high level contacts, exchanged information on their sales volumes so as to provide mutual reassurance that the price war had ended. Top representatives met in 1996 in order to avoid a new price war in Germany in the mid nineties, a meeting followed by two others in 1997 and 1998 with a view to sharing out or at least stabilising market shares in Germany. These meetings gave rise to repeated concerted action between the four companies
on application of price rises on the German market between 1996 and 1998. In April 2001, the
Commission sent a letter of objection to the companies followed, today, by imposition of a  fine of EUR
249.6 million on Lafarge, the leading cement company worldwide which is far larger than the other
companies. Lower fines were imposed on BPB (EUR 138.6 million), Knauf (EUR 85.8 million) and Gyproc
Benelux (EUR 4.32 million). Lafarge and BPB were more heavily  fined as they have repeatedly given each
other advance warning of price increases (Lafarge had already been sanctioned in 1994 for a cement cartel
and BPB, also in 1994, for a cartonboard cartel). No factor was able to attenuate the amount of the  fine
imposed on Knauf and Lafarge which, unlike BPB and Gyproc, did not cooperate in the investigation. The
companies involved have three months in which to pay the  fine, to the Community budget.

LP
LONDON -(Dow Jones)- BPB PLC (U.BPB) Thursday reported first-half results in line with expectations and said the second half of the year has started well, despite receiving a EUR138.6 million  fine from
the European Commission Wednesday.

The company, a global producer of  plasterboard and plaster products, reported underlying pretax profit before exceptional items and goodwill charges of GBP95.6 million in the first half of 2002, a 33% rise from last year after a turnaround in U.S. operations.

TD
At 1022 GMT, BPB shares were higher at 273 pence, a 2.2% rise from Wednesday's closing price of
267 pence.
Thursday's results were described as "bang in line" by Kate Moy, an analyst at ING Barings
Charterhouse. The profit and sales figures had been well flagged to the market in September.

BPB finance director, Paul Hollingworth, told Dow Jones Newswires that the company is planning to appeal the European Commission's decision to  fine it, a process which could take three years. The Commission's ruling stated BPB engaged in price fixing over  plasterboard sales in France, the U.K., Germany and the Benelux region over a six-year period.
BPB has been living in the shadow of the  European Commission investigation for the last four years,
a situation that has created uncertainty for investors and has weighed on BPB shares. Analysts say the
uncertainty has now lifted, despite the company's decision to appeal.

"It just wiped out first half profit", says David Taylor, an analyst for Teather & Greenwood. There shouldn't be any further repercussions from the  fine as the amount is now known to investors and BPB has taken the charge in its first-half results, he said.

BPB's 33% rise in underlying pretax profit, to GBP95.6 million, was almost entirely due to an improvement in North American operations which moved to a GBP11.9 million profit from a GBP16.7 million loss during the period.

Hollingworth said the U.S. improvement was achieved though higher selling prices and restructuring actions at U.S. unit Celotex.

He said comparable U.S. staffing levels are now 40% below what they were two years ago. The U.S. division was also boosted with the inclusion of five months trading from newly acquired unit, James Hardie.

Hollingworth doesn't see further major restructuring action in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. But cost reduction measures are always ongoing due to the low-cost nature of the business and the second half would see "some charges", he added.

Cost savings in the U.S. are ahead of plan, BPB said in a statement, with $50 million annualized savings now in place.

Underlying operating profit for the company's  European operations fell slightly to GBP94.3 million in the first half, from GBP96.6 million last year. BPB blamed this on a GBP14 million hike in input costs relating to recycled paper, insurance and pensions.


Volume growth in western and southern
Europe offset difficult
conditions in other European operations. The company took GBP2 million of restructuring charges in Germany to attempt to remedy difficult trading conditions.

Both BPB and Lafarge "vigorously challenge" the decision and plan to bring the case before the Court of First Instance to have the size of the  fine reduced. Analysts had not expected BPB to be fined more than Eu100m.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "The  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies." Lafarge and BPB have breached EU law in the past.

BPB chairman Allan Gormley said: "None of the findings affect BPB's ongoing business practices. The group has not participated in any cartel. In short BPB believes the  Commission lacks the evidence to substantiate the claims."
BPB shares rose 4 1/2 to 267p.

HD    City round-up - Baird gives in to Jacques Vert offer. BY    GARETH MACKIE.

CLOTHING group William Baird today caved in to a 17.8 million pounds offer from retailer Jacques Vert, despite having originally attacked the bid for being too low.

Jacques Vert first proposed the deal last month, but Baird's board claimed the offer undervalued the business, and the two entered into talks about a possible improved bid.

TD
But two weeks ago Jacques Vert said it had received acceptances for its original offer representing 51.82 per cent of the share capital, and today said the boards of both companies had agreed to the deal, which values Baird at #17.8m.

Under the deal, which actually values Baird at #100,000 less than the original bid, Baird's shareholders will own 70 per cent of the issued share capital of Jacques Vert.

Baird chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale said: "We are pleased to have secured a better deal for our shareholders who will now have a larger share of the combined group.

"There is commercial logic in a combination of the two companies and shareholders should benefit from the synergies arising."

Jacques Vert chairman Bill Reid also welcomed the deal, which he said reflects "fair value for shareholders of both William Baird and Jacques Vert".

Baird sold its Lowe Alpine outdoor clothing division to rival Aspen for #13.5m earlier this month to concentrate on its core womenswear brands of Planet Windsmoor and Precis Petite.
The firm, which has 18 stores across Britain, will combine its womenswear business with that of Jacques
Vert, which has a chain of 168 outlets and employs around 400 people.

Baird has around 1500 staff, and was forced to lay off 4500 workers three years ago after Marks & Spencer cancelled a long-running supply contract.

It has since sought to rebuild itself but last month issued a disappointing trading update showing wider losses.
BP wins at the double

OIL giant BP was celebrating today after it was named Britain's most admired company, with chief executive Lord Browne taking the title of best business leader.

It is the first time in the 13-year history of the Management Today awards that one company has scooped the two top prizes.

Lord Browne, who courted controversy following his 58 per cent pay rise, beat Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy to first place.
Somerfield in sales boost

SOMERFIELD, the nation's fifth-biggest food retailer, said today that sales at its refitted stores are showing an initial sales uplift of 22 per cent after their launch.

Page 125 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The firm said in a statement the refitted stores were showing like-for-like increases of ten per cent in the second year.

Last month the firm announced that its chief executive was stepping down. The news of Alan Smith's departure was accompanied by a warning that the company was not going to meet expectations for this year's profits.

Wal-Mart's purchase of Asda and the competition between Sainsbury's and Tesco has left Somerfield struggling, with a share price hovering below #1 much of the past two years. Chairman John von Spreckelsen has taken over the running of the firm.
The right chemistry

BRITISH metals and chemicals firm Johnson Matthey today reported a three per cent rise in pre-tax, pre-exceptional first-half profits to #95 million in the half to September 30.
The firm, which owns city-based opiate maker Meconic, said its Catalysts and Chemicals division and its
Pharmaceutical Materials division both posted strong growth.

Catalysts and Chemicals division profit rose to #48.3m, while the Pharmaceutical Materials division was up to #19m.
BPB profits up to #95m

BPB, the world's biggest  plasterboard firm, today reporting higher first-half profits and said it was confident of progress in the full year.

Underlying pre-tax profits in the six months to end-September rose to #95.6 million from #71.8m a year earlier, against analysts' forecasts of #94-96m, as it added it was setting aside funds to pay a  European regulatory fine for price-fixing.
BPB plans to appeal the  European Commission decision. Napster sells off its patents
FAILED online music-swapping service Napster's patents and brand name have been sold to CD-burning software firm Roxio for around #3.5 million in cash and shares.

As part of the deal, Roxio will be insulated from any future litigation against Napster, which has now been stripped to the bone.

Napster's remaining assets, which consist of hardware such as servers, routers, and computers, will be auctioned off on December 11.

HD    UK firm is fined 88m pounds  for building price cartel. WC   421 words

LP
A BRITISH company is among four firms  fined a total of 306 million pounds by  European regulators for fixing the prices of  plasterboard and other building materials.
The fines, following a four-year investigation, were imposed on BPB, which is based in Berkshire, France's
Lafarge, Germany's Knauf and Belgium's Gyproc.

TD
They were the second-highest ever imposed by the  European Commission, following 2001 levies against a vitamin cartel.
"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner. He added: "The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit
agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the
companies."
BPB, which through a subsidiary was  fined in 1994 for participating in a cartonboard cartel, was  fined
#88.8m this time.
The Commission came down hardest on France's Lafarge, fining the company #160m.

In 1994, Lafarge had also paid a fine in a cement cartel case. The EU executive added that the company had failed to co-operate in the plasterboard investigation.

It said it wanted to be sure its  fine against Lafarge, the world's largest maker of cement and far bigger than the other conspirators, had "a real deterrent effect".

However, Lafarge said it would challenge the EU decision in court, complaining that the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of  plasterboard in the British and German markets.
The Commission said the cartel operated from 1992 to 1998 and covered 80 per cent of consumers in an
EU market worth #770m.
The companies met in London to end a price war that had driven down prices and they subsequently set
up a secret information exchange system to monitor market trends and avoid over-aggressive competition,
the Commission said.
Under EU rules, the companies have three months to pay the  fines.

Mr Monti has made tackling price-fixing arrangements a priority. On Tuesday, EU governments approved reforms to give his office more powers to fight cartels.

"The commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers, as is the case here," he said.

The fine on the companies is only exceeded by the  fine of #546m the  Commission imposed in 2002 against vitamin firms found to be operating a price-fixing scam.

SWITZERLAND has not done enough to help the EU in its fight against tax evasion, according to a European Commission report to be presented to finance ministers on 3 December. It sums up the outcome of tax talks with Switzerland, the United States, Monaco, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Andorra.

FOUR makers of the basic building material plasterboard - France's Lafarge, the UK's BPB, Germany's Knauf and Belgium's Gyproc - have been fined a total of Ä478 million by the  Commission for price-fixing. It is the executive's second-largest anti-trust  fine.

TD
IN A bid to redouble efforts to combat price-fixing cartels, industry ministers decided to overhaul a
40-year-old anti-trust regime, a move that will cede responsibilities to companies, countries and
national courts.

GERMAN Chancellor Gerhard Schröder supports  Commission efforts to make EU rules on budget deficits more flexible. The deficit should not necessarily be "the only criteria," he told Die Zeit. "One could also ask whether absolute debt, inflation and unemployment should also play a role in judging what is or is not economically sensible."

THE Commission said that the quality of budget statistics needed to be improved as poor data could impact the entire EU policy-making process. It called for  eurozone statistics to be upgraded and a code of best practice to be adopted.
THE Commission won cross-party support from the  European Parliament for its plan to make EU
states reduce high debt levels and reward low-debt countries.

THE Commission said Italy and Greece had debt levels that "give most cause for concern" as they "remain well above 100% of GDP and very little progress has been made in the past four years to reduce debt levels towards the 60% of GDP reference value".

THE Court of First Instance on Tuesday (26 November) overturned a  Commission ban on amphetamine-like anti-obesity drugs, saying the EU executive had failed to provide new evidence that they may not work.
THE Commission fined Aventis and Rhone-Poulenc Ä2.85 million for a cartel in chemicals. IT HAS also approved UK government aid to privatised nuclear electricity firm British Energy,
providing certain conditions were met, including "a comprehensive restructuring" to be presented to
the Commission within six months.

Easily the worst performer in the FTSE 100 index was Shire Pharmaceutical, down 66 at 444p after its US peer Eli Lilly received approval from the Food &Drug Administration for its Strattera hyperactivity drug, a rival to Shire's best-selling Adderall treatment.

Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that Strattera's advantage is that it is a non-scheduled drug, so prescribing and dispensing is more straightforward.

TD
But he added that he expected the drug's impact on Adderall to be muted. "Opinion leaders firmly believe Strattera's efficacy is significantly lower than Adderall," he said.

Troubled insurer Royal &Sun Alliance was prominent amongst gainers on speculation that it is close to filling its long-standing vacancy for a chief executive.

RSA added 8 at 134 3/4p, with Chris Rathbone of Williams de Broe saying: "There is a whisper that they are on the brink of solving their chief executive problem."

In addition there were reports that billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway vehicle may be closing in on Global Aviation Underwriting Managers, 28 per cent owned by RSA.

Aviva, which also holds a 28 per cent cent stake in GAUM, reversed losses to add 8 at 531p. The market also responded warmly to the announcement of a joint venture between Aviva's French subsidiary, CGU France, and Gallic peer Mederic.
Mortgage bank Abbey National rose despite warning the market it will make its first loss since
de-mutualisation next year, as well as cutting its dividend and making substantial write-downs on its
wholesale banking business.

The shares strengthened 28 1/2 at 667 1/2p, amid suggestions that once the write-downs are out of the way, Abbey's shares, which have fallen 43 per cent since May, may start to look cheap.

"Value funds are looking through 2002 for sustainable earnings. For 2003 it looks cheap. If it is going to make 75-80p of earnings (per share), then 630p is cheap," said Mark Thomas of Fox-Pitt, Kelton.
Abbey 'attractive'

The Croesus team at Charles Stanley said that even if the dividend is cut by 25 per cent, Abbey will still yield an "attractive" 6.5 per cent, and will be a "more focused, less accident prone bank" if it withdraws from wholesale banking.

Anglo Irish Bank bounced 27 to 431 1/2p after revealing above expectation earnings growth and lower than expected bad debts. In FPK's view Anglo's valuation is "compelling", with upside potential of 61 per cent.
Mobile telephone operator MMO added 4 at 52p, partially reversing Tuesday's profit taking-induced 5
1/2p fall. MMO is continuing a series of meetings with institutional investors, and word is the company is

making a favourable impression. Vodafone, also hit by profit taking on Tuesday, recovered 2 1/2 at 120
1/2p.

A number of the worst performing stocks of recent months enjoyed a good day as the bouncing markets heralded a ray of optimism. Engineering group Invensys added 5 3/4 at 58 3/4p to top blue-chip risers, steelmaker Corus firmed 2 at 32p and Brambles Industries was marked up 7 1/2 at 155 1/2p.

Second-liner Aberdeen Asset Management ticked up 6 at 56 1/2p, clocking up a 100 per cent rise from its October low.

But ICI was a major blue-chip faller after Schroder Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on the stock. The shares closed 6 1/4 lower at 248 3/4p.

Oil stocks gained ground after industry data showed declining US fuel stockpiles against a backdrop of possible war in Iraq.

Crude oil stocks fell by 3.9m barrels in the week to last Friday, leaving them 9 per cent down from the same time last year.

Meanwhile, JP Morgan said it believed that BP's share price underperformance had fully discounted recent disappointments and that it expected the company to start rebuilding investor confidence by focusing on broader measures of value creation.
BP shares rose 17 to 417p, while Shell Transport climbed 12 1/2 to 413 1/2p.
Adding to the sector's firmer tone was confirmation by chancellor Gordon Brown that royalty taxes on
North Sea oil and gas would be abolished from January.
Granada Group, the television broadcaster, rose 4 to 89p despite reporting a fall in full-year revenues. The company said there were signs of a recovery in the advertising market, echoing Tuesday's
comments by Carlton Communications, its potential merger partner.
Carlton up
Carlton, whose shares are effectively tied to Granada's, rose 5 to 150p.

Advertising agency WPP Group added 30 at 505p as it said it had bought Italian rival Media Club for an undisclosed sum.
Capita Group, the outsourcing specialist, said it had won contracts worth £1.1bn this year, up from
£774m in 2001. However, there was some disappointment that the company did not announce any new
deals, and the shares fell 16 to 247p.

British Land, the UK's second-largest property company, reported an unexpectedly large rise in its first-half net asset value.

It also named two new independent non-executive directors, although it kept quiet about a number of other matters raised by shareholders, notably share buybacks. The stock rose 11 1/2 to 426 1/2p.

Waste management companies came under pressure as Gordon Brown, the chancellor, said he would consult on a £3 per tonne increase in the landfill tax from 2005. Shanks Group fell 5 to 86 1/2p, while Waste Recycling eased 8 1/2 to 172 1/2p.

BPB, the former British Plasterboard, rallied in late trade to close 4 1/2 higher at 267p after being  fined a less-than-expected Euros 138.6m ( £88m) by the European Commission for price fixing. BPB was one of four European plasterboard manufacturers fined following a four-year investigation into the industry. "Enough to get the attention, but no life threatening" was the view of Teather &Greenwood. After the close BPB said it would appeal the ruling.

Troubled nuclear power generator British Energy continued its recent rally, adding 0.37 at 16.88p on the day and 116 per cent in a week. Yesterday the company was buoyed by the news that the  European      Commission has approved the UK government's rescue package, including a loan of up to £899m, plus
£276m for "identified contingencies".

AWG, the water utility, rose 45 to 399p after it said it was selling its international arm and pledged to maintain its dividend in real terms until at least 2005.

Brussels antitrust regulators yesterday  fined four building materials companies, including Lafarge and BPB, a total of  Euros 478m ( $473m) for a six-year conspiracy to fix the price of a widely-used construction product.

France's Lafarge was hardest-hit, receiving a  fine of Euros 250m - the third-largest penalty ever levied by the Brussels authorities on a single company - with its UK rival BPB getting a penalty of  Euros
139m.

TD
The German group Knauf has been ordered to pay  Euros 86m, while Gyproc of Belgium was  fined      Euros 4m.
A four-year inquiry concluded the companies conspired to fix the price of  plasterboard in France, the
UK, Germany and the Benelux region by agreeing to stop a price war.

The total penalties for the  plasterboard cartel rank second only to last year's  Euros 855m fines on eight chemicals companies for fixing the price of vitamins.

The decision to impose heavy  fines - first reported in the FT last week - highlights the  European          Commission's determination to crack down on price-fixing conspiracies.

However, Lafarge and BPB said they would appeal against the decision in  Europe's second-highest court, denying the arrangements were illegal and saying the  fines were disproportionate.
Lafarge said the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of plasterboard in the UK and
Germany - the only two markets it had been asked about by the Commission.

It added  plasterboard prices in the two countries were lower in 1998 than when Lafarge entered the market.

Mario Monti, competition commissioner, said the heavy  fines showed the Commission had a "zero tolerance" policy against price-fixing agreements.

He said the cartel focused on a market worth Euros 1.2bn at the time of the cartel and affected the vast majority of  Europe's 370m, consumers as plasterboard was widely used in do-it-yourself and construction.

HD        WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Enel denies Union Fenosa move.
BY        By BILL DICKSON - EDITOR, DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALEX SKORECKI.

Shares in Union Fenosa were suspended yesterday morning after the stock rose 10 per cent on rumours that Italy's Enel would bid for a stake in the Spanish utility.

Enel denied rumours that it was considering a bid for the 20 per cent stake held in the power company by Santander Central Hispano, although analysts say it is well known the Italian operator is looking to expand outside Italy.

TD
A Spanish web site had reported the Italian company would pay more than  Euros 20 a share for the stake - a big premium over Union Fenosa's recent price which was  Euros 13.13 a share before trading was stopped - its highest level since October. The market was reopened later and the shares held on to most of their gains at  Euros 12.81.

Europe's big power companies have been eyeing the Spanish market for the last couple of years as they consolidate ahead of the liberalisation of the  European Union's energy market. Ministers agreed this week to open up the sector to full competition by 2007.

Analysts say the Spanish market is a prize worth winning since it is not too competitive, prices are reasonable and it has a relatively benign regulatory environment. It is fairly difficult to build a new power station in Spain, which means one of the only entry points is through acquisition.

Hydro Cantabrico, another Spanish utility, attracted interest from eight companies when it went under the hammer last year.

The prospect of more consolidation in the sector boosted other utilities with Germany's two large operators seeing their shares up by more than 5 per cent. Eon rose to  Euros 44.82 and RWE was up at Euros 29.46. Enel was up 1 per cent at  Euros 5.03. Endesa, Spain's leading utility, rose by just over 2 per cent to  Euros 11.86.

The oil sector was stronger after some move up in the crude price and following the announcement by Gordon Brown, the British chancellor, in yesterday's pre-Budget statement, that he would abolish royalty taxes on North Sea oil and gas profits from January.

Crude oil was 44 cents higher in London at $25.29 a barrel, buoyed by data from the US showing a bigger-than-expected draw on stocks. BP was up over 4 per cent at 417p, Royal Dutch Shell rose by over 2 per cent to  Euros 44.13 with Shell Transport, the London-quoted part of the group, 3.4 per cent higher at 414p. TotalFinaElf was up more than 2 per cent at  Euros 136.50.

Petroleum Geo-Services, the Norwegian oil services group, soared 15 per cent to NKr3.31 on speculation ahead of its results and stronger crude oil prices.

The telecommunications Regular world stock markets updates at  www.ft.com/markets Focus on French privatisations at  www.ft.com/marketfocus sector was dominated by the fightback in France Telecom's shares after media reports that the group would receive a Euros 9bn cash injection from the French government. The shares rose by more than 13 per cent to Euros 16.70.

The company, which said its refinancing plan was not yet finalised, saw its shares fall 10 per cent earlier in the week on rumours that it was preparing a rights issue.

Deutsche Telekom, which weakened in early trading, was up 4.7 per cent at  Euros 11.83 after third quarter results. Telecom Italia and Telefonica both rose by nearly 4 per cent. Shares in Cesky Telecom, the top Czech operator, rose 8.8 per cent to Kcs288.50 after the government backed away from a privatisation deal.

The European Commission's imposition of large fines on plasterboard makers for fixing prices hit shares in the construction sector. The Commission levied the second largest  fine ever imposed on France's Lafarge, which had to pay Euros 249m, pushing shares down over 2 per cent to  Euros 77. It also fined the UK's BPB, Germany's privately-held Knauf and Belgium's Gyproc.

ABB, the indebted engineering group, saw a small rise in its shares to SFr4.44 after it announced it had agreed a $1.5bn credit facility with its banks. The shares hit a low of SFr1.41 in October.

Bank stocks were led higher by Capitalia, the Italian bank, on talk that outside investors were buying shares. A newspaper report said Brescia-based investor Emilio Gnutti had amassed a 6 per cent stake. Turnover was three times as high as the recent daily average.
Capitalia shed some of its gains but still ended 7.1 per cent up at  Euros 1.65, having been as high as
Euros 1.75.

Credit Lyonnais continued rising following the weekend government auction of a 10.9 per cent stake which BNP Paribas bought at  Euros 58 a share. Credit Lyonnais added 6.5 per cent to  Euros 49.95.

Vestas, the world's biggest maker of wind turbines, lost more than a third of its market value after its second profit warning in three months. The Danish company said lack of new incentives for renewable energy in the US had prompted its customers to postpone orders.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, which downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold", said: "With the
overall profitability coming down further people will question why the industry should trade on a premium
to engineering multiples."

Vestas shares, which hit a peak of DKr500 two years ago, lost 32 per cent to DKr68. Vestas' main rival NEG Micon said it was sticking with its forecasts for the US market, to which it is less exposed than Vestas. Nevertheless, NEG shares fell 12 per cent to DKr140.

THE European Commission yesterday fined Lafarge and three other companies e478m ((pounds)
304.5m) for conspiring to fix the price of plasterboard, a material used in building construction and DIY.
The commission said it imposed the huge fine, its second largest ever, because the cartel affected
80% of European consumers in what is a e1.2bn ((pounds) 756m) market. "The building industry is the
pulse of the economy," said Mario Monti, competition commissioner, in a statement. The commission
came down hardest on France's Lafarge, fining the company e249.6m ((pounds) 157.2m). It fined
Britain's BPB e138.6m ((pounds) 87.3m), Germany's privately-held Knauf e85.8m ((pounds) 54m) and
Belgium's Gyproc e4.32m ((pounds) 2.7m). The  commission said it wanted to be sure its  fine against
Lafarge, the world's largest maker of cement and far bigger than the other companies, had "a real
deterrent effect".

TD
Lafarge vowed to fight the EU decision, saying the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of
plasterboard in the British and German markets. BPB shares closed up 4.5p at 267p. - Reuters.

HD         EU fines plasterboard cartel £300m. BY          By Andrew Osborn in Brussels.

Plasterboard manufacturer BPB and three of its  European rivals were yesterday fined £300m for operating an illegal price-fixing cartel for most of the 1990s. It is the second highest fine the Europeancommission has ever levied.

Of the four companies hit yesterday BPB came off worse than all but one - Lafarge of France. Lafarge, the world's largest cement manufacturer, was  fined £156m, BPB £87m and Knauf of Germany £54m. Gyproc, which operates in the Benelux countries, escaped with a  fine of just £2.7m.

TD
The commission imposed the fines after an investigation lasting four-and-a-half years and opted for such high fines because, it said, the cartel affected 80% of consumers in the countries concerned in the £750m-a-year market.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," said Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner.
Both BPB and Lafarge have been caught breaking the rules before, albeit in different sectors, and were
fined by the commission in 1994.
That, Brussels said yesterday, was "an aggravating circumstance".

Brussels said a price-fixing agreement was struck at a meeting in London in 1992 and claimed the cartel lasted until 1998. "[The companies] decided to end what they called 'the price war' which was then taking place and expressed the common desire to reduce competition to a level that suited their interests in the German, French, UK and Benelux markets," the  commission said.

The price of  plasterboard had fallen sharply in previous years because of unbridled competition, and the companies concerned were anxious to reverse that trend.

Brussels described how the four set up a secret information-sharing system designed to stamp out competition which extended to passing on sales information, giving each other advance warning of any price increases and even sharing specific instructions given to sales teams.

BPB eventually agreed to co-operate with the commission investigation as did Gyproc, and the British firm was rewarded with a 30% reduction in its fine as a result.

BPB denied any involvement in a price-fixing cartel and said it would appeal against the  fine, which it described as "wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high".

Lafarge said it would challenge the EU decision in court, complaining that the  fine was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of  plasterboard in Britain and Germany.

HD        BPB fined EUR139m for its part in plasterboard cartel. BY        By Saeed Shah.

BPB WAS yesterday hit by a EUR139m (£89m) fine from the EuropeanCommission as it imposed a EUR478m penalty on four manufacturers of plasterboard for conspiring to fix the building material's price.
It was the second-highest penalty ever imposed on a cartel by the  Commission, behind last year's
EUR855m punishment for companies involved in fixing the vitamins market.

TD
Lafarge, the French group that bought Britain's Blue Circle Industries in 2000, was  fined EUR250m, the largest part of the total  fine, reflecting its higher turnover. Germany's Knauf and Belgium's Gyproc were also fined for their part in the cartel. In 1997, the  plasterboard market was worth EUR1.2bn in  Europe.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy. The substantial amount of the  fine reflects the size of the market, the impact of the illicit agreement on the consumer and the repeated infringement of the competition rules by two of the companies [BPB and Lafarge]," said Mario Monti, EU competition commissioner.

The size of the  fine for BPB, a  plasterboard manufacturer, was higher than expected but the Commission said it would have been 30 per cent higher still had the company not co-operated with the inquiry. The cartel operated between 1992 and 1998, when the  Commission carried out a surprise raid on the companies.

The cartel was formed at a meeting in London in early 1992 at which representatives of BPB and Knauf decided to end what they called the "price war" that was then taking place and "expressed the common desire to reduce competition to a level that suited their interests" in the German, French, UK and Benelux markets, the  Commission said. Lafarge joined the group in mid-1992 and Gyproc followed in
1996.

In years prior to 1992, the price of  plasterboard had fallen sharply as a result of fierce competition, which "had directly benefited consumers".

"Following the London meeting, a secret information-exchange system was set up to monitor market trends and avoid over-aggressive competition," the Brussels watchdog said.

Lafarge reacted furiously to the fines, pointing out that the size of its penalty was equivalent to 2.5 times its annual sales of plasterboard in the two countries concerned. The French group announced that it would take the case to appeal before the  European court.

EUROPE'S construction industry was yesterday  fined almost Euro 500 million ( £318 million) as the European Commission sentenced four companies, including Britain's BPB and France's Lafarge, for operating a cartel which fixed the price of  plasterboard.

BPB and Lafarge expressed outrage at the sentence, which is the second largest penalty imposed by the Commission. The fine is equivalent to almost half of the entire  European plasterboard market - currently worth about Euro 1.2 billion in terms of annual turnover.

TD
The two companies promised to appeal to the  European Court of Justice. Lafarge, which was subjected to the biggest fine of Euro 249 million, complained that the  fine was two-and-a-half times the size of its plasterboard business in the UK and Germany.

BPB's  fine of Euro 138 million was described by Allan Gormly, the company's chairman, as "wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high". Knauf of Germany was  fined Euro 85 million and Gyproc of Belgium  Euro 4 million.

The higher than expected penalties reflect the  Commission's policy of both punishing repeat offenders and penalising companies that refuse to co-operate with investigations.
Mario Monti, the Competition Commissioner, said the cartel affected 80 per cent of consumers in the
EU, principally France, the UK, Germany and the Benelux countries.

"The building industry is the pulse of the economy," he said. "The  Commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the wellbeing of consumers."

BPB yesterday took issue with the crux of the  Commission's allegation that BPB and Knauf conspired at a meeting in London in early 1992 to end a price war. According to the  Commission, they set up "a secret information exchange system" to monitor market trends and avoid
over-aggressive competition.

Lafarge and Gyproc later joined the network, the  Commission said, exchanging information on sales volumes and giving each other advance warning of price increases.

The London meeting was followed in 1996 by a meeting of top company representatives in Versailles in order to prevent a price war in Germany, and subsequent meetings in Brussels in 1997 and The Hague in 1998. The investigation followed anonymous tip-offs to the  Commission.

Mr Gormley yesterday said: "The conclusion is not based on the facts. There was a general exchange of straightforward, highly aggregated and historical sales volume data. We did not fix prices."
Lafarge said the  fine was arbitrary and without economic basis, but the  Commission said the size of
Lafarge's penalty was "to ensure that the  fine has a real deterrent effect".

The UK economy steamed ahead at its fastest pace for more than two years in the third quarter, with growth of 0.8 per cent, revised up from an initial estimate of 0.7 per cent, the latest data showed.

SHIRE Pharmaceuticals was top of the blue-chip sicklist as investors took fright at a rival hyperactivity treatment getting faster-than-expected approval from US regulators.

The expected January launch of US drugs giant Eli Lilly's Strattera therapy following FDA consent about three months ahead of forecasts was seen as putting increased pressure on Shire's Adderall product.

TD
Shares in Shire fell 66p to a three-year low of 444p as some analysts described the move as a blow to sentiment, despite a general view that it will have a limited impact on Shire.
Broker Merrill Lynch said:

"We expect the news of Strattera approval to unsettle the Shire price, but given it is already factored into our forecasts we would consider any price weakness to be a buying opportunity."
The diagnosis of the wider market's prospects was brighter as upbeat economic news from across
the Atlantic, including a fall in jobless claims and a rise in durable goods orders, eased fears over the
health of the world's largest economy.

Leading shares were already well advanced by the time Chancellor Gordon Brown delivered his pre-Budget statement and the FTSE 100 Index closed 73.2 points ahead at 4144.2.

Engineer Invensys led the charge, 5 fp stronger at 58 fp, after chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite's bullish outlook on sales prospects in Asia.

Bargain-hunters moved into Scottish &Newcastle, 16p ahead at 470p, despite broker WestLB Panmure's downgrade from neutral to underperform ahead of next week's interim figures.

But Diageo was left with a 3p hangover at 682p after legendary US investor Warren Buffett was reported to have denied interest in the group's Burger King chain.

ICI dipped 6 bp to 248 fpwhen the chemicals giant was downgraded from outperform to neutral by broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney which cut its target price from 340p to 290p on concerns over growth at its flavour and fragrance operation.

Mining group Xstrata was warned by Australian coal miners it faced possible industrial action over an alleged aggressive anti-union strategy.

Shares in the company, which was also knocked by an underperform rating from Goldman Sachs due to its exposure to South Africa and perceived over-reliance on energy coal, gave up 4 dp to
590p.

Boardroom buying left fashion retailer New Look in 2 dpbetter shape at 258 dp, while biotech outfit Axis Shield perked up 11p to 145p on positive findings of a new study which analysts said boded well for future demand for its technologies for diagnosing cardiovascular risk.

BPB added 4 dp to 267p as the building materials group said it would appeal against an £88million fine imposed by the European Commission for allegedly working in a cartel to fix the price of plasterboard.

Aero Inventory flew 25p higher to 450p following a bullish trading update from the aerospace e-procurement company and speculation of new contracts in the pipeline.

Rumours of a stock overhang being cleared helped car dealer Lookers move up a gear, 18 dp higher at 166p on heavy turnover.

Speculators piled into LTG Technologies, up 2 dp to 7 dp as about 6million shares changed hands, on vague rumours of a deal for the graphic brand management company.

Motion Media was also heavily traded, up bp to 4 dp, as the market welcomed the videophone technology group's refinancing. It also plans to move down from the official list to the Alternative Investment Market.

Engineer Halma's revival continued, up 3p to 120p, on rumoured institutional buying in response to an upturn in trading conditions.

Shares in support services group Interserve fell 4p to a 178p low as nervous investors sold on fears over the company's business model.

A gloomy trading update from health clubs operator LA Fitness knocked its shares 20 dp out of shape to 110 dp, with rival Fitness First pulling an 8p muscle to 133 dp in sympathy.

HD      European Union - War on Cartels Continues as Commission Fines Four Companies

WMRC       Perspective Significance            The Commission's latest cartel-bust has
resulted in the second-highest fine to date.

TD

Implications            Two of the companies have appeared before the

Commission on similar charges before and been fined. The fact that the previous fines did not provide sufficient disincentive to indulge in illegal practices again is something that should worry the Commission if it is serious about its fight against cartels.
Outlook                 It is unclear where the Competition Commission will go from here; undoubtedly though the stance must get tougher if the war is to be won.

As expected, the  European Commission imposed record-breaking fines on the members of the latest cartel to be busted by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and his colleagues (see  European Union:
21 November 2001: Gypsum Cartel Faces Heavy  Fines from EuropeanCommission). However, whether Monti's hard-hitting  fines are working is in doubt, with two of the four companies in this case facing their second fine for anti-competitive behaviour.

Between 1992 and 1998, UK-based BPB plc, Gebrueder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG of Germany and the French company Societe Lafarge SA undertook to work together, calling a halt to an ongoing
price war that was driving down retail prices. They were joined in 1996 by Gyproc Benelux SA/NV of Belgium. The four rival companies produce nearly all the  plasterboard manufactured in the four countries in a market valued at (Pounds)750 million (US$1.2bn) per year. At the initial meeting, a system of secret and regular information exchange was established so that advance warning of price rises could be passed on, as well as details of sales volumes. Evidence of the cartel came to light following a lengthy Commission investigation that began in 1998, which was based, amongst other things, on information garnered from surprise inspections and evidence put forward by BPB and Gyproc.

In response to the unearthing of this cartel, which it is estimated affected 80% of consumers with the European Union (EU), the  Commission decided to fine the colluders a total of 478.32 million  euro, which breaks down as follows:
Lafarge: 249.60 million  euro. BPB: 138.60 million  euro. Knauf; 85.80 million  euro. Gyproc: 4.32 million
euro.

The fines imposed on Lafarge and BPB are significantly higher than the rest because they have already fallen foul of the EU competition rules once before, something the Commission has treated as an aggravating factor. However, both BPB and Gyproc co-operated with the Commission in uncovering the cartel, a wise decision that allowed them to benefit from the 1996 leniency provisions with a 30% and 40% reduction in fines respectively.
Outlook and Implications

The BPB and Lafarge cases should worry the  Commission. Not only have they both been  fined before, but they were in the midst of the current cartel when they were investigated previously. Whilst yesterday's fines may make companies think twice before indulging in such illegal practices again, they may not be a sufficient deterrent compared with the benefits which could be accrued from illicit price-fixing practices.
This case is surely going to force a rethink in a number of areas:

Leniency Provisions: BPB and Lafarge did not consider the 1996 leniency provisions a sufficient incentive to blow the whistle on their cartel colleagues and chose instead to risk punishment at the hands of the Commission. These provisions have since been improved upon (see  European Union: 25 July 2001: Whistleblowers to be Rewarded for Informing on Cartels), but it remains to be seen if these are any more persuasive than the previous legislation. A Second Bite of the Cherry: BPB has got off lightly. Even though it had been caught before, it still got a reduced sentence for handing over useful information to the Commission. Surely companies that have been caught red-handed once should not be entitled to such generous reductions in their  fines.

BPB has already indicated that it will be appealing against the  fine, indicating somewhat bizarrely that it was not involved in the price-fixing cartel. It will be joined by Lafarge, which also openly criticised what it considered to be an excessive  fine. What is clear is that there is still a long way to go if Monti really does want to rid the economy of what he has labelled these 'cancerous' cartels.

HD        BPB reports  profits after pricing fine. BY        By John Duckers.

BPB, the world's biggest plasterboard firm, yesterday reported higher underlying firsthalf profit, a day after it was slapped with a £90 million fine for price fixing. The company, which has vowed to fight the EuropeanCommission fine, said price rises,cost cutting and a strong US housing market had boosted underlying profit by a third, though it voiced caution amid uncertainty over the global economic outlook.
Pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the six months to the end of
September rose to £95.6 million from £71.8 million a year earlier.

TD
BPB took an exceptional charge of £88.8 million for the  fine in the half year, leading to a net loss of
£31.1 million.

The company, which was founded in 1915 and makes ceiling tiles and insulation materials, said volume growth in western and southern  Europe had offset difficult trading elsewhere in the region.
Its performance so far in the second half was in line with expectations and chief executive Richard
Cousins said analyst forecasts for full-year pre-tax profit of about £196 million were not unreasonable.
He said the firm had no specific economic concerns.
'We are doing well. We do expect to make further progress, but we don't want to get too cocky.

'If there is a war in Iraq, or a major economic correction in the next year, then BPB, along with virtually every other company, will notice that.'

He said the firm had 16 per cent of the North American market, where 17 players had become eight over the last 12 years, and he suspected there would be a little more consolidation in the next five years.

'Yes, we would like to get bigger, but we have no plans to do it in the short term. We will see what happens,' he said.

The firm has vowed to appeal against the price-fixing  fine, rejecting the  European Commission's finding that it had been part of a cartel involving three other  European companies. BPB says the  fine was disproportionately high. France's Lafarge, owner of Blue Circle Industries in the UK, which was fined £160 million, has also announced plans to challenge the decision.

Analyst David Taylor, of brokerage Teather & Greenwood, said the results were in line with BPB's mid-September forecast for first-half underlying profit of around £95 million.
He said the firm had no choice but to expense the EC's  fine against profits, as a provision.

'The EU thing is all very upsetting, but it really is a sideshow in the sense that it's six months' profit lost and gone and life moves on. It doesn't threaten the stability of the group,' he said.
The EU fine on BPB, Lafarge, and three other companies totalled £306 million.

The Commission said it imposed the huge penalty - its second largest - because the cartel in the £770 million market affected 80 per cent of  European consumers.
'The building industry is the pulse of the economy,' said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. Germany's privately held Knauf was  fined £55 million and Belgium's Gyproc hit for £2.7 million.
The Commission said it wanted to be sure its  fine against Lafarge, the world's largest maker of cement and far bigger than the other conspirators, had 'a real deterrent effect'.

Making matters worse in the  Commission's eyes, it was a repeat offence by Lafarge. In 1994 the French company paid a  fine in a cement cartel case. The EU said it also failed to cooperate in the plasterboard investigation.
BPB, through a subsidiary, was also  fined in 1994, for participating in a cartonboard cartel.

Bpb of Britain was among four companies  fined a total of £316m.
BPB owns quarrying firm British Gypsum which has sites near East Leake and Newark, along with
Artex-Blue at Ruddington.

TD
Lafarge, a second company with interests in the East Midlands, was  fined £150m - the largest amount.
The firm has quarries at Kegworth and Besthorpe.
The EC said the four groups were  fined for operating a cartel which fixed the price of  plasterboard. Its investigation lasted four years.
Mario Monti, EC competition commissioner, said the heavy  fines showed the EC had a 'zero tolerance' policy against price-fixing agreements.

Commenting on the decision, BPB chairman Allan Gormly said none of the EC's findings would have any affect on BPB's current business practices.

He added: "The group has not participated in any cartel and the evidence is simply not consistent with any agreement to collude over prices or market share, however vaguely the  Commission expresses its case.

"In fact, the  European plasterboard industry has always been and continues to be characterised by vigorous price competition for market share." BPB is the world leader in the supply of  plasterboard and gypsum plasters, and a major supplier of insulation, ceiling tiles and related products for internal linings.
It serves growing markets for building systems in over 50 countries.

Confirming its intention to appeal, BPB condemned its £88.8m  fine as "wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high".

A company statement said: "None of the  Commission's findings relate to any of the group's on-going activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any finding of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past. In short, BPB believes that the Commission's case lacks the evidence necessary to substantiate its claims." BPB said it actively co-operated with the Commission throughout its four-year investigation.
The company said it was disappointed the investigation rejected "without justification" much of what BPB
has said to it.

"The Commission's general allegation that BPB participated in a long-running cartel in the principal EU plasterboard markets are based upon supposition and contrived explanations unsupported by the facts," the company's statement added.

"It has not taken into account the wealth of economic evidence of vigorous price competition for market share which is inconsistent with the  Commission"s findings nor the lack of a tangible effect of the supposed infringements on the markets." BPB said throughout the 1990s Europeanplasterboard prices

to customers in fact fell substantially in real terms. It added: "While there was within the industry, on an irregular basis, a general exchange of straightforward, highly aggregated and historical sales volume data for certain markets, this was against the background of the absence of any statistics on market size for the industry as a whole.

"The industry objective was simply to have some data on the overall size and rate of growth in the markets concerned."

HD              City - BPB fine knocks  98pc hole in profits. BY              By Helena Keers.

LP
RICHARD Cousins, chief executive of BPB, the world's biggest  plasterboard maker, was upbeat about the future yesterday, despite acknowledging that a  fine for price-fixing had slashed opening half profits by 98pc.
"We have just under 20pc of the global market and  plasterboard is a expanding market, growing at
3pc-5pc in mature markets," he said.

TD
He was speaking after BPB unveiled a slump in profits from £69.1m to £1.2m pre-tax. The setback follows a provision against a Eu138.6m ( £88.8m)  fine imposed by the European Commission this week.
"We will be aggressively appealing against the decision and hope to get a massive deduction," said
Mr Cousins. An appeal is expected to take three years.
The group also reported £12.1m of exceptional restructuring costs during the period.

However, excluding these exceptional charges and goodwill amortisation, the group reported strong underlying profits. Operating profits were £110m, up from £84.4m and in line with expectations.
This improvement reflected a turnaround in the North America operations, which changed a loss of
£16.7m to profits of £11.9m. Post restructuring, the US is expected to deliver $50m of savings each
year.

In Europe, underlying profits slipped from £96.6m to £94.3m, as input costs from insurance, recycled paper and pensions increased by £14m. Germany also incurred a £2m restructuring charge. Mr Cousins said: "Sweden and Poland were also patchy."

In emerging markets, the group has pulled out of Argentina, incurring a £300,000 cost. China also continued to lose money but at a lesser rate.
Group turnover was up 15pc to £953m, after the £245m acquisition of US wallboard company James
Hardie. An interim dividend, up 3.3pc to 4.65p, is payable on January 24. The shares ended up 3 at
270p.

RICHARD Cousins, chief executive of the world's biggest  plasterboard maker BPB (formerly known as, you guessed it, British  Plasterboard), yesterday said he wasn't going to get "cocky" about the future of the economy.
And well he shouldn't. If house prices fall, renovations are also likely to dwindle and  plasterboard
isn't exactly an essential commodity.

TD
The company, which operates in 50 countries, suffered in the past half-year from its exposure in Germany and Argentina. Mr Cousins also said Sweden and Poland were patchy and that China was losing money.

Even worse for the group was Wednesday's  fine by the European Commission for alleged price fixing, which wiped Eu138.6m ( £88.8m) from its interim profits. Mr Cousins is appealing the decision but that will take three years.

After that list of woes, those still reading will be pleased to hear that otherwise the company is performing very well in difficult markets.

Yesterday's interim results showed that underlying operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £110m, up from £84.4m.

A £12.1m charge for restructuring included 1,070 jobs cut in the US and Germany. North America is expected to deliver $50m of savings and broke into the black with profits of £11.9m.

Plasterboard prices in the US, although rising slower than expected, also reassured investors as they reached $90 per 1,000 sq ft. Prices are expected to rise to $105 by March 2004.

BPB shares have been very volatile but, trading at 10 times earnings and yielding an attractive 5pc, they look cheap.

The world's biggest maker of  plasterboard, BPB, yesterday posted an impressive hike in first half pre-tax profits - only to see them all but wiped out on the bottom line because of provisions for its massive fine from the European Commission, announced on Wednesday.

The firm, which employs 400 in Aberdeen at Davidson's paper mill and Abertay paper sacks, saw underlying pre-tax profits up from £71.8million to £95.6million in the year to September 30 on turnover that rose from £830.7million to £953.3million. But the £88.8million  fine plus a £1.3million share of the fine of Belgian group Gyproc, which BPB is in the process of acquiring, cut bottom-line pre-tax profits to just £1.2million.

TD
The company has vowed to fight the fines which related to claims it was part of a four-company cartel which controlled European plasterboard prices in the 1990s.

Chief executive Richard Cousins said yesterday: "BPB has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of its  fine, which is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high. None of the commission's findings relate to any of the group's ongoing activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any findings of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past." Turning to the results, he said BPB was doing well and that analysts' forecasts that it would earn pre-tax profits for the full year were not unreasonable, but added: "There is global uncertainty, with growth forecasts in most major economies being steadily downgraded." BPB shares rose 2p at 270p.

BPB, the plasterboard manufacturer, has had to dip into reserves to pay a dividend after this week's
fine from the European commission wiped out interim profits.

BPB is to contest the £88.8m  fine imposed on Wednesday for its part in a price fixing cartel with three of its European competitors.

TD
Richard Cousins, BPB's chief executive, hit out at the ruling as he revealed that reported pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30, after deducting the  fine, had slumped to £1.2m.
"We are upset by this ruling because there was no cartel," Mr Cousins said.

"The EC chose to ignore everything we told them and we feel they have been completely unreasonable. But on appeal we think there is a good chance the  fine will be reduced significantly."

However, Mr Cousins believes that now the EC has made its ruling the company can draw a line under the affair which has dogged BPB for the four-and-a-half years.

Ignoring the  fine, which the company chose to include as part of its interim results along with a smaller fine for an associate company, BPB reported a 33% increase in underlying pre-tax profits to
£95.6m. The interim dividend has been raised by 3.3% to 4.65p a share.

Despite general economic nervousness around the world, BPB reported solid progress as a much better performance in the US more than offset difficulties in  Europe.

"The key for us is that in the areas we can control we are doing very well, but we do not want people to lose sight of the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty out there," Mr Cousins said.
Analysts are already pencilling in underlying profits of around £195m for the full year.
The company has responded swiftly to the downturn in Germany and the restructuring - which cost
BPB £2m in the first half - will continue in the second.

However, it was in the US where BPB showed the greatest progress. Its operations there moved from a £16.7m loss to an £11.9m profit, despite incurring significant rationalisation costs.

Wallboard prices advanced by 28% to an average $90 per 1,000sq ft.That price is still well below trend and is expected to rise by another 15% when the US economy improves.

That will provide a significant boost to BPB's wallboard margins which are already running at 10%. BPB, which has a 16% share of the North American market, will be a major beneficiary of any strengthening in wallboard prices.

BPB, the  plasterboard group, saw its first-half profits all but wiped out yesterday after it was hit with a Euro 138 million ( £89 million) fine from the European Commission for its alleged involvement in a price-fixing cartel.

The group said it would appeal against the "wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high"  fine, announced on Wednesday, but it still provided for the full amount in its half-year accounts.

TD
The provision cut pre-tax profits to just £1.2 million for the six months to September 30, down from
£69.1 million last time.

The fine, which was significantly higher than the £40 million to £80 million predicted by analysts, overshadowed interim figures that were otherwise in line with expectations.

Pre-tax profits before exceptional items and goodwill rose by a third to £95.6 million, boosted by price rises, cost-cutting and a swing into profit by BPB's US operation.The  Commission imposed fines totalling almost Euro 500 million on BPB and other companies for allegedly conspiring to fix the price of plasterboard between 1992 and 1998. The  fine is the Commission's second largest to date.

The other companies were Lafarge of France, Germany's Knauf and Gyproc of Belgium.BPB yesterday also took an exceptional charge of £1.3 million for its share in Gyproc's  Euro 4 million fine. An appeal against the  fines could take up to three years.
Shares in BPB edged 1 per cent higher to 270p yesterday. The interim dividend rises by 3.3 per cent to
4.65p.

HD    CONSTRUCTION - FOUR PLASTERBOARD FIRMS HIT WITH SECOND HIGHEST CARTEL FINE. BY    By (BEP).

The European Commission has slapped four manufacturers of plasterboard, a material widely used in the building industry, with the second largest  fine in EU antitrust history. The fine, which was imposed on November 27, totalled  Euro 478 million, and pertained to anti-competitive behaviour that lasted between
1992 and 1998. The four firms involved in today's decision are the UK's BPB, Germany's Knauf, France's Lafarge and Belgium's Gyproc. The substantive penalty on the companies reflects both the size of the plasterboard market and the length of the infringement - more than six-and-a-half years. The  fines break down as follows: Lafarge (Euro 249.60 million), BPB (Euro 138.60 million), Knauf (Euro 85.80 million), and Gyproc (Euro 4.32 million).

TD
According to the  Commission's investigation, the cartel began initially in 1992, when BPB and Knauf held a meeting in London to end what they called a "price war". The companies agreed to set up a secret information-exchange system to monitor market trends and avoid over-aggressive competition. Lafarge, a French group, joined the cartel shortly afterwards, and Gyproc (Belgium) came on board in June 1996. The Commission looked into whether Etex, a Belgian financing company that has a 54% stake in Gyproc, participated in the cartel, but said that there was not enough evidence to conclude that it did.The participants in the cartel shared information on their sales volumes so as to provide mutual reassurance
that the price war had ended, and repeatedly gave each other advance warning of price increases.

The cartel came about because of the competitive nature of the  plasterboard industry, which caused a sharp drop in the price on the market for the building material. Mario Monti, Competition Commissioner, notes the importance of the plasterboard market in Europe, which had a turnover of more than  Euro 1.2 billion in 1997, shortly before the Commission began investigations, and is the largest sector ever to have been covered by an EU antitrust decision. "The  Commission is focusing its drive to stamp out cartels on the key sectors of the  European economy, where its action can directly improve the well-being of consumers", said Mr Monti. The cartel affected 80% of the  plasterboard market, mainly in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.Lafarge and BPB were already  fined for a similar infringement in 1994, and this repeated breach of EU competition rules is reflected in the significantly higher fines. The Commission also took into consideration the much greater size of Lafarge, which is the biggest cement company in the world, with a turnover five times that of BPB or Knauf.

In calculating the  fines, the Commission granted a reduction of 30% for BPB and 40% for Gyproc, because both firms co-operated with the investigations, and provided additional information to the Commission prior to the statement of objections being sent. Knauf and Lafarge, on the other hand, did not co-operate and therefore could not qualify for leniency.
The companies now have three months in which to pay the  fines.
The largest ever  fine that the  Commission levied on a cartel was in November 2001, a total of  Euro
855.22 million on eight pharmaceutical companies for fixing the price of vitamins.

On that basis, the  European Commission has ordered the Company to pay a  fine of € 250 million. Lafarge vigorously challenges this decision and will immediately bring the case before the

HD   (EU) EP/COMPETITION - Commissioner Monti presents  content  of reforms  to MEPs. WC  820 words
PD   3 December 2002
SN   Agence Europe
SC   AGEU

CY   (c) 2002 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .

LP
Brussels, 02/12/2002 (Agence  Europe) - The day after adoption by the Council (EUROPE of 27 November, p.10, 25/26 November, p.15), Competition Commissioner Mario Monti presented to the EP's Economic and Monetary Committee the essential elements of reform initiated in connection to competition. He gave his assurance that the task would relieve them of "the daily management of competition", and cited the major decisions taken that same day as an example, namely the imposition of fines relating to a merger in the plasterboard sector and another in the methylglucamine sector (EUROPE of 28 November, p.13). Mr
Monti stressed that the reform of Articles 81 and 82 would show that the idea often "put about" that the
Commission is jealous of its powers and reticent about any form of decentralisation is unfounded.

TD
Such reform is a "Commission initiative (...) No-one had asked it to give up its powers, and it was even difficult to convince the Member States!" (Ed.: Reform of Articles 81 and 82 of Regulation 4064/89 provides for decentralisation towards national competition authorities when implementing these articles). This "revolution" should result in a "cooperation culture" between the national and Community authorities, Mr Monti said, while assuring that reforms will not result in re-nationalisation of the  European regulations on competition. Concerning the recent cancellations of the  Commission's decisions by the Court of First Instance (CFI), Mr Monti declared that his services were closely studying the rulings to see if there was cause for appeal and to "draw the consequences for the future". "These rulings (Ed.: Airtours/First Choice) are not made on ground that has never been touched by reform. The result will be the presentation of radical reform on 11 December", he continued, adding that one should not lose sight, however, of the advantages of the  European system characterised by its rapidity. "The trouble is, there is sometimes a nervous frenzy between the parties concerned. I do not, therefore, wish to reduce these delays, but rather bring in more flexibility". From the jurisdictional point of view, the Court's decisions show that "the Court of Justice has meticulous and rigorous basic control, but must be more effective. As far as time limits are concerned, there is still room for improvement", was the view expressed by Professor Monti, who said he was "ready to give strong support to the granting of new resources to the Court of Justice" in order to achieve a still swifter and more transparent system, in order to "make the best system in the world".

The Commissioner then submitted to questions put by MEPs. Giorgios Katiforus (Socialist, Greece) placed emphasis on the "attacks made by a certain section of the press", reflecting the interests of large companies. He stressed the "counter-productive effect" of mergers (salary freezing, restructuring and job losses). "When times are hard, the behaviour of companies and of governments coincides" in calling for "broader" use of State aid, Mr Monti noted. Hence, he said, such reforms are needed in order to have irrefutable rules in order to defend the economic system as a whole. Mr Philippe Herzog (United Left, France) expressed concern about the risk of destabilising competition policy, the rules of which are difficult to combine with corporate concerns. He asked Mr Monti how one can guarantee "coherence". In reply, Mr Monti said that one of the elements of reform would consist in giving companies the possibility of highlighting the advantages resulting from their merger.  Commission President Christa Randzio-Plath (Social Democrat, Germany) regretted that mergers are synonymous with job losses: "Is it compatible with the objectives of Lisbon with regards jobs", she asked. Mr Monti recognised that mergers "are not always successful", with growth ambitions often taking the place of other aims, and the consequences on employment are a "major and tricky" problem. French Socialist Pervenche Beres questioned Mr Monti on the contradiction that exists, she says, between the very short times for analysis, which are detrimental to the rights of the defence, and those of justice, which are "excessively long". Mr Monti said he was aware of how difficult it was for the Court to have a sufficient number of judges, while considering that expedited
procedure was an improvement. "We shall introduce more flexibility in the 'timing' and strengthen the role of advisers-auditors", he added, while admitting that the parties hoped to be kept better informed of the complaints filed by their rivals. Luis Berenguer-Fuster (Socialist, Spain) welcomed the Council's approval of

reform, but asked whether, in anti-cartel action, fines are an adequate deterrent. In his view, "structural reforms would perhaps be more dissuasive than fines". The Commissioner recalled that there were
well-defined criteria governing the amount of fines, such as the seriousness of the infringement, the market share and the size of the company involved.

The government supports Qantas' plans to take a 22.5% stake in Air New Zealand. Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson told The Australian Financial Review consumers' interests should not override Australia's need for a strong national carrier as increased pressures on the aviation sector reduced the number of players globally.

Australia will ask the World Trade Organisation for an aggressive reduction in tariffs on manufactured goods and is expected to call on industrialised nations to eliminate them by 2010.

The Australian Taxation Office's impostion of withholding taxes on ship lease payments will damage the struggling industry more than maritime unions have done in 50 years, the shipping industry says. The new tax will increase shipping costs by more than 30%.

The government is likely to give the Securities and Investments  Commission (ASIC) new powers to  fine companies that mislead investors. Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Ian Campbell, said the ASIC should have power to issue infringement notices and  fine companies which fail to disclose material information. Business groups have opposed the plan.

Federal judges gained a 17% pay rise and their state counterparts are likely to receive the same. The pay rises, to be staggered over three years, give top judge Murray Gleeson a salary of more than $A300,000.

The ongoing drought has caused an estimated 17% slump in farm production and will cut 0.75% from economic growth in 2002/03. The drought will reduce exports already affected by weak external demand. The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook report released by Treasurer Peter Costello shows growth slowing to 3% this financial year, compared with earlier forecasts of 3.75%. Growth is expected to rise to
4% next financial year.

The federal and NSW state governments have been accused of hatching coercive and draconian security powers as unease grows over Australia's anti-terrorism response. Sydney's Muslim community has
added its voice to those warning proposed Australian Security Intelligence Organisation powers of detention and interrogation would transform the agency into secret police.

The sale of the government's 50.1% Telstra stake has been put on hold because the telco's share price is too low, says Prime Minister John Howard. The news caused Telstra's shares to fall further, to $A4.38, their lowest price since December 1997.

The three-way merger of CSR, Hanson and Queensland Cement to establish the biggest cement company in Australia will come under close scrutiny by regulators. The group would have 40% of the market. The Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission will look at the deal under the Trade Practices Act.

The Bush administration announced plans to end all tariffs on industrial and consumer goods by 2015. The administration will submit a proposal to the World Trade Organisation to phase out $US18 billion in annual tariffs on manufactured products including clothing and textiles, still heavily protected in the US.

The US economy grew at a brisk 4% annual rate during the northern summer, a stronger performance than the government expected. Latest GDP figures for the third quarter indicate growth may exceed a Commerce Department estimate one month ago of 3.1%.

Worldwide semiconductor sales rose by 1.8% to $US12.52 billion in October, representing a 20% rise from 2001, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

The Bush administration proposed to give managers of 155 national forests more discretion to approve logging and commercial activities with less evaluation of environmental effects, The New York Times reports.

WorldCom settled with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) over a $US9 billion civil fraud case it faced. The company may now avoid a  fine. The settlement, criticised in some quarters as too lenient, requires WorldCom to refrain from breaking securities laws. The SEC can request a  fine in the future, whether or not WorldCom breaks the terms of the agreement.

A small Manhattan bank which allegedly accepted duffel bags full of cash without questioning their origin will pay a $US4 million  fine for violating federal money-laundering rules. Broadway National Bank pleaded guilty to felony charges for failing to file suspicious activity reports on $US123 million in cash deposits. The US Customs Service said Broadway had become "the bank of choice for criminal organisations because it didn't ask questions and didn't want to know where the money came from."

President George W Bush eased a 20-year-old limitation on Mexican trucks which had restricted them to a 20-mile-wide zone along the US-Mexican border. The move was largely in response to a ruling by an international trade panel that the ban violated the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Defence contractor Northrop Grumman received draft consent from the Justice Department to complete its $US6.6 billion takeover of TRW. Northrop's purchase of the space electronics and electronics business will put Northrop in direct competition with Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) denied accusations contained in a complaint filed by the state of Massachusetts that it had used investment advice and new shares issued by clients to reward companies and their executives for hiring the firm. The state cited email messages and other documents gathered from CSFB in support of the complaint and seeks $2 million in  fines and separation of investment
banking and research departments.

Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, was named by president George W Bush to head a commission to investigate the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington. The 10-member commission will conduct an 18-month investigation into events leading up to the attacks and possible shortcomings in US security services.

London investment banks are paying Christmas bonuses in Turkish lira - one of the world's most worthless currencies - as an ingenious, but legal, tax avoidance ruse, The Australian says. Banks grant staff "loans" in lira and then switch the money into sterling so when the lira tumbles, the recipients can repay the "loan" cheaply and come out in profit.

A commercial poking fun at George W Bush was banned by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre. The commercial, for animated comedy series 2DTV, depicts a cartooned Bush putting a videotape into a toaster, can be shown only with the president's permission.

The government appointed Mervyn King to head the Bank of England from mid-2003, when Sir Edward George retires. King's appointment, combined with reports the government must borrow more money, pushed 10-year bond yields from 4.61% to 4.67%. King, now Sir Edward's deputy, joined the bank as an economist in 1991.

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French building-materials company Lafarge SA (LR) Wednesday said it hasn't yet been notified of the outcome of an investigation into price-fixing among cement companies by Germany's cartel office.
"We're not going to speculate" on any aspect of the investigation by the German cartel office, a
Lafarge spokesman said.

TD
Lafarge, the world's No. 1 cement producer, and five other cement makers are reportedly facing
fines totaling EUR1 billion by the cartel office for fixing cement prices.
Lafarge's share of the  fine is about EUR100 million, French daily Les Echos reported.

The other companies being investigated are Heidelbergcement AG (G.HEI), Dyckerhoff AG (G.DYK), Holcim Ltd. (Z.HOL), unlisted Schwenk and the German subsidiary of the U.K.'s Readymix PLC (U.RMX).

A spokesperson for Germany's cartel office declined to name the companies being investigated, but said it plans to wrap up its investigation in early 2003.

Tuesday, Heidelbergcement denied it would incur a  fine of more than EUR400 million from the cartel office.
Dyckerhoff has already booked a provision of EUR95 million in anticipation of a  fine of this size. Last week, Lafarge and three other companies were slapped with EUR478 million in  fines by
European Union Commission competition authorities for operating a cartel to fix prices for
plasterboard.

Lafarge was fined EUR250 million for its part in the plasterboard cartel. It has already been  fined for a similar offense in 1994. Lafarge is contesting last week's fine at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
Lafarge is unaware of any other price fixing investigations against it, the spokesman said. Company Web site:  http://www.lafarge.com

HD   BPB to appeal against fine. BY    By laura.hailstone@rbi.co.uk.

n Plasterboard manufacturer says  European Commission lacks evidence to impose penalty.

Plasterboard manufacturer BPB is to appeal against the European Commission's #88.8m  fine for allegedly participating in a cartel, claiming the Commission's case "lacks the evidence necessary to substantiate its claims".

TD
"BPB has not participated in any cartel and intends to appeal against the level of its  fine, which is wholly inappropriate and disproportionately high. None of the  Commission's findings relate to any of the group's ongoing activities or business practices, nor do the facts support any finding of BPB's participation in any cartel in the past," said BPB chairman Allan Gormly.

After a four-year investigation, the Commission last week fined BPB and three of its European rivals for operating a cartel that fixed the price of plasterboard. Lafarge was subjected to the biggest fine, #159.8m, and also intends to appeal, Knauf of Germany was fined #54.96m and Belgian firm Gyproc #2.77m.

BPB said it actively co-operated with the  Commission throughout its four-year investigation and is disappointed that it has rejected, without justification, much of what BPB said.

"It has not taken into account the wealth of economic evidence of vigorous price competition for market share which is inconsistent with the  Commission's findings, nor the lack of any tangible effect of the supposed infringements on the markets concerned.
"Throughout the 1990s  European plasterboard prices to customers fell substantially in real terms," said
BPB finance director Paul Hollingworth.

"The important thing is that it hasn't affected BPB's on-going business practices," he said, pointing out a rise of 15% in group sales to #953.3m for the group's half-year results to 30 September, announced last week.

"The total amount of the  fine has been charged as an exceptional item in BPB's interim accounts and will certainly not dent our pockets - we are large enough to take such a hit," said Hollingworth.

BPB's appeal may take three years to reach the  European Court of First Instance, but the company feels it has a "strong case".

HD          Anger at WWF (pounds)  3.5m deal with firm behind superquarry bid. BY          By Rob Edwards Environment Editor.

WWF, one of the world's leading environmental organisations, is under fierce attack for a (pounds) 3.5 million deal with Lafarge, the French multinational mining giant behind controversial plans for a superquarry on the isle of Harris.

In an argument which has split the environmental movement, WWF is accused of selling the credibility of its world-famous panda logo to a company that typifies corporate irresponsibility. This is strongly denied by WWF.

TD
Lafarge is giving WWF International (pounds) 700,000 a year for five years to help restore natural forests. But at the same time the company is refusing to abandon its plans for a superquarry at Lingerbay in south Harris, which environmental groups, including WWF, are bitterly opposed to.

Now Friends of the Earth has demanded that WWF pull out of the partnership. "If Lafarge was only intent on improving its environmental performance it would hire technical consultants to do so," said Kevin Dunion, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland.

"The reality is that Lafarge is paying for the added corporate PR value of the partnership photographs with WWF International, and its panda logo."

WWF's panda is featured in Lafarge's latest annual accounts and in its report on sustainable development.

Lafarge is the world's biggest producer of building materials and employs 83,000 people in 75 countries. Its headquarters are in Paris, and sales last year totalled (pounds) 8.8 billion.

It owns 800 quarries all over the world and last year bought British cement company Blue Circle, which runs the kiln at Dunbar in East Lothian. In 1997 Lafarge bought Redland Aggregates, the company that originally proposed the Harris superquarry.

WWF UK chief executive Robert Napier used to head up Redland Aggregates before it was taken over by Lafarge. When he was with Redland he had doubts about the super-quarry but is now opposed to it.
Lafarge took the Scottish Executive to court for refusing planning permission for the superquarry in
2000, forcing ministers to withdraw their decision and reconsider. The company is also challenging the
Executive's refusal to reactivate a 1965 planning consent, and the case is due before the Court of
Session next year.

Two years ago WWF threatened to end its relationship with Lafarge over the superquarry. Last week it stressed it still strongly opposed the superquarry and "reserves the right" to withdraw from any business relationship.

"WWF International's stance is absolutely astonishing," said Dave Morris, director of Ramblers' Association Scotland. "The whole credibility of WWF's arrangement with Lafarge has been undermined by the company's determination to prolong the agony in Harris."


Page 178 of 182 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ten days ago Lafarge was fined (pounds) 160m by the European Commission for its part in an illegal cartel to fix the price of plasterboard.

It is the second time it has been  fined for breaking competition rules, though it is appealing the decision.

For Dunion, this reinforces the dangers of environmental groups "getting into bed" with multinationals. "WWF International shouldn't assume other environmental groups who disagree have to maintain a polite silence," he said.

WWF, however, argued that it has used its influence with Lafarge to improve its policies. "Lafarge hasn't bought the logo," said WWF Scotland's spokesman, George Baxter. "They have signed an explicit agreement to rethink every aspect of their business."

Lafarge is tied to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide by 10%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2010. As it emits about twice as much as Switzerland, this is a huge reduction, say WWF.

Lafarge has also developed guidelines for the ecological rehabilitation of quarries that are being implemented in its operations worldwide. "WWF's approach is to get into the boardroom and influence the company's environmental impact," said Baxter.

On the superquarry, Baxter said: "We strongly dispute Lafarge's claim that there is any case for pursuing this unjustified development."

Lafarge told the Sunday Herald the quarry was needed to help maintain the supply of aggregates to the construction industry. "We feel the case for developing this site remains as strong as ever, environmentally, socially and economically," said a spokesman.

Monti and the ayatollahs

So Italy's Mario Monti, zealous  European competition commissioner, was off on Wednesday launching his ideas for new (legal challenge-proof) ways to crack down on monopolies.

TD
Observer hears softly spoken Monti is also looking to break the monopoly held by his department's "merger task force" over the scrutiny of takeovers that come to Brussels. And the word is that task force members - known as the "ayatollahs" because of their strength of conviction - are less than keen to see some of "their" mergers go to sectoral experts in the department.

Apart from anything else, Monti's proposals would reduce the size and influence of the all-powerful task force. It would also raise a question mark over the future of Goetz Drauz, the highly respected German (even softer spoken than Monti) who has headed the task force for the past few years. It could prove harder to crack than the usual  plasterboard or chemical cartels.
Well placed

European Union historians do not cite dates but summit venues - Nice, Maastricht and so on. So today is Copenhagen, where EU leaders discuss the union's historic enlargement.

At least this time voters should know what everyone is talking about. A "Eurobarometer" survey on Wednesday by the European Commission revealed 82 per cent were aware of the great enlargement project - more than had heard of the European Commission.

Interestingly, awareness (but not opposition) was highest in Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands - where rightwing populist politicians have had strong followings - and Ireland, which has just had a referendum on the Nice treaty.

But which country was best known as a EU candidate? Er, Turkey, for which the EU has not yet agreed a date (or venue) for membership talks.
Telia tales

A senior Swedish Social Democrat who was once forced to apologise to the entire Norwegian people for describing Norway as the "last Soviet state", would never leave government peacefully.

A few months after stepping down as industry minister, mischievous Bjorn Rosengren, 60, is in hot water again for accepting a job as adviser to the Stenbeck business group, which includes Tele2, arch-rival of the telecommunications group, Telia.

Parliament is demanding to know how a man responsible for the state's majority stake in Telia can move seamlessly to its main competitor when he has barely emptied his drawers at the ministry. Even urbane Urban Backstrom, central bank governor, has joined in the argument, pointing out he will be in quarantine for a year when he leaves his post in January. Not envious, surely?
And Fazio too?

Wim Duisenberg,  European Central Bank president, won a  European business leader's award last week. The Bank of France's Jean-Claude Trichet is caught up in the battle for Credit Lyonnais. So of course Antonio Fazio, Italy's central bank governor, wanted to get involved in the Fiat fiasco.

That is one explanation for an unexpected intervention by Fazio, usually regarded as tutto casa e chiesa (boringly correct). In talks with Paolo Fresco, Fiat chairman, this week Fazio wanted to know about possible strategic changes and what it meant for jobs.

Observer's man on Rome's Via Nazionale offers some alternative theories. The normally tight-lipped Fazio, 66, wanted to reassure creditor banks he was looking after their interests - feeling he should do something positive after just banging on about the need for Italy's banks to increase reserves.
Or maybe Fazio, a life-long economist, fancied flirting with politics. Or maybe he has strong views on
Fiat, like everyone else in Italy.
Paris match

Not just central bankers are falling over themselves to get involved in top deals - business is so thin these days. Even so, investment bank Lazard's role in the BNP Paribas versus Credit Agricole tussle over Credit Lyonnais is raising eyebrows.

After all, Lazard and Agricole share a joint venture in structured finance - and the French bank has an indirect stake in Lazard. Yet instead of acting for Agricole, Lazard - namely top bankers Bruno Roger and Georges Ralli - have teamed up with Lehman Brothers to advise BNP Paribas, which it advised on its privatisation in 1993. A case of heads I win, tails you lose?
Banana line

The European Commission's slapped a EUR194m ($194m)  fine on Olympic Airways, which could face bankruptcy, but never mind: Christos Verelis, Greece's transport minister, says a new airline will arise phoenix-like, ensuring everyone gets to the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Indeed, Athens has just received two firm bids for a majority stake in the new airline that will inherit ageing aircraft and airport slots - but
not Olympic's debts. Frontrunner is Golden Aviation, a consortium led by Stamatis Restis, from a shipowning family with interests ranging from transporting bananas and iron ore to running Athens' only golf club.

Alas, the Restis family record is not spotless. Like other Greek shipowners who raised funds to finance fleet renewals in the 1990s through high-yield bonds, a family company defaulted last year on a junk bond issue, leaving investors - mainly US pension funds - scrambling to recover at least some of their money. But dwelling on that would not be in the Olympic spirit.
Santa clause

A warning to anyone who plans to attend the EU Copenhagen summit with, say, a long white beard and ruddy face. Police point out that under Danish law demonstrating is  fine, but not behind masks. Kai Vittrup, chief criminal inspector, says even Santa faces jail if caught in an illegal disguise.
