BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission is expected to tell  MasterCard Inc. (MA) Wednesday that the  fees it charges stores for international credit card purchases are illegal under European Union rules, finally winding up a 15-year investigation into the company's charging practices.

The decision on Wednesday is anticipated to pave the way for a similar crackdown on  fees charged by rival Visa International and other credit-card issuing banks which have also come in for commission criticism.

TD
People familiar with the case are expecting the ruling will go against  MasterCard, but friends and foes alike will be watching for any specific changes the regulator will call for.

Interchange  fees are paid by the banks that process purchases on behalf of stores, to banks that issue credit cards to consumers. The  fees are ultimately passed on to shopkeepers who have long complained they are too high and aren't transparent.

Retailers, who have been the main opponents to the interchange  fees, are expecting Wednesday's decision to result in lower and more transparent  fees.

Although they do not expect the  fee to disappear, they hope that following Wednesday's decision the structure of the  fee is going to be different, said Paul Skehan, the director of European Retail Roundtable, a lobby group representing all major European retailers such as IKEA and Carrefour SA (12017.FR).

Retailers want the  fee to be transparent so they can see what services they are paying for. "There should also be some demonstrable competition amongst the card providers," Skehan said.

In the commission's 2006 sector review into payment cards, E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes accused banks issuing credit and debit cards of colluding to keep prices artificially high and restricting competitors.

The MasterCard investigation is part of a larger push by E.U. regulators to boost competition in European financial markets and coincides with the introduction of the Single  Euro Payment Area, or SEPA, from the beginning of 2008.
SEPA aims to ensure that all payment services from debit cards to direct debits are accepted across
Europe, replacing the country-by-country systems now in place.
Banks are required to be compliant with the pan-European Union payment-card-processing network by
2010.

Commissioner Kroes has been especially worried that leaving the interchange  fee untouched before the onset of SEPA might lead to a "European monopoly or - at best - duopoly," in payment cards, something that she is not willing to let happen, Kroes said.

A MasterCard spokeswoman said, "Interchange is a small  fee paid by the merchant's bank to the consumer's bank to balance the cash and benefits to the different parties in a payment system."

"In Australia, where the government regulated interchange fees, consumers have seen a significant increase in the cost of using their payment cards," the MasterCard spokeswoman said. She declined, however, to comment on the E.U.'s approaching decision.

E.U. regulators have been looking into MasterCard's interchange  fees since 1992, when the credit card company initially notified the commission on its practices.

First official  charges were launched in 2003. The probe was escalated in 2006, with the  commission accusing the company of restricting competition between banks by setting artificially high interchange fees through "predetermining a minimum price retailers must pay for accepting  MasterCard and Maestro branded payment cards."

The second set of formal  charges came after a sector inquiry into interchange  fee agreements, where Kroes also found that companies such as Visa and  MasterCard Inc. were making "outrageous" profits and operating a "closed shop."
As the investigation stems from  MasterCard's own notification, the E.U. is not expected to impose a
fine on the company, but is seen issuing a set of guidelines for the way forward.

Visa has until now enjoyed an exemption from the  commission's charges due to a 2002 deal, when the company agreed to reduce the  fees borne by retailers and their banks by about 20%. However, that exemption is expiring by the end of the year, and the credit card company is expecting to have to change its practices.

A Visa Europe spokesman said: "The  Commission approved Visa Europe's interchange fees five years ago in a separate decision. We expect to continue our own dialogue with the Commission in the coming months. In the meantime it is business as usual."
A commission spokesman would not comment on the expected  MasterCard decision.

US Fed's New Rules On Mortgages Draw Hostility
Concerns about the U.S. mortgage crisis and turmoil in global credit markets is intensifying, with U.S. policy makers seeking to clamp down on the practices that created the crisis and Europe's central bank pouring an unprecedented half-trillion dollars into an effort to soothe markets. However Federal Reserve's new lending rules draw a lukewarm reaction from lawmakers and other critics, who are calling for more-aggressive action.

By Annelena Lobb
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley presented investors Wednesday morning with a series of billion-dollar announcements.

TD
Morgan took a $9.4 billion mortgage-related write-down, which contributed to an overall quarterly loss of
$3.59 billion. At the same time, the company announced a $5 billion infusion from China's sovereign
wealth fund. Chairman and Chief Executive John Mack, saying he would forgo his 2007 bonus, called
the write-down "deeply disappointing." But Morgan's shares rallied, an apparent vote of confidence from
investors in the Chinese investment plan, despite the bath of red ink. (Shares of rival Goldman Sachs
fell Tuesday after the company posted a fourth-quarter profit of $3.2 billion. Go figure.) Morgan sold a
9.9% stake to China Investment Corp., but executives said it was in no way an act of desperation. "We
don't need more," finance chief Colm Kelleher said, in an interview after the announcement. Sovereign
wealth funds have stepped into the spotlight amid the subprime debacle. Citigroup received $7.5 billion
from the government of Abu Dhabi's investment arm, and Swiss bank UBS sold a 10.8% stake to an
investment arm of the Singapore government, as well as an unnamed Middle Eastern investor, among
other deals. The White House declined to comment on the CIC- Morgan Stanley deal. "Of course we
welcome foreign investment in the United States, but we can't comment on individual transactions,"
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.

As for Morgan's financial prospects, some analysts noted that its exposure to subprime and CDO holdings shrank after Wednesday's hit. The "sizeable  charge cleans up a lot of risk," wrote Roger Freeman of Lehman Brothers. That is the bull case. The bear case, according to David Trone, of
Fox-Pitt Kelton, plays out if the magnitude of Wednesday's losses undermines investor confidence. At midday, the stock was up about 3%. There is also the matter of risk. "Mack's strategy is to be aggressive and use the balance sheet to support businesses that he's expanding," said Dick Bove, financial strategist at Punk Ziegel & Company. "It is not working, and management turnover is excessive."

Though shares of Wall Street's big five investment banks rallied in midmorning trade, indexes on the whole looked weaker, as Standard & Poor's downgraded bond insurer ACA and gave both MBIA and Ambac a negative outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.63 to 13197.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 3.33 to 2592.70. The S&P 500 index fell 4.48 to 1450.50. Treasury securities moved lower after the Fed announced the results of its first term auction; the 10-year yield moved to
4.14%. Oil gained 97 cents to $91.05 a barrel. The dollar rose against the  euro, but fell against the yen. European stocks traded lower, while Asian stocks finished mixed.
* * *
Fed Feeds Liquidity
The Federal Reserve's first term auction produced promising results, as the central bank said it awarded
$20 billion in 28-day credit with an interest rate of 4.65% and cited strong demand. The central bank
unveiled the term-auction facility last week as part of a coordinated effort with other central banks to

Page 31 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
inject liquidity into global financial markets suffering fallout from the subprime debacle in the U.S. A
second Fed auction is scheduled for Thursday, and two more auctions are scheduled for January.
* * *
EU Confronts  MasterCard

The European Union ordered  MasterCard to stop charging  fees for cross-border credit-card purchases. Fees must be dropped within six months or MasterCard will face massive daily  fines. Fines would amount to 3.5% of daily global revenue. The charges aren't compatible with antitrust rules, the commission said.
* * *
Energy Measure Becomes Law

President Bush signed into law energy legislation that mandates the first increase in automobile fuel economy in 32 years. The measure boosts the required average mileage by 40% to 35 miles per gallon. To spur increased demand for nonfossil fuels, it also requires a sixfold increase in ethanol use to 36 billion gallons a year by 2022, surely welcome news to farmers. It also requires new energy efficiency standards for a wide variety of appliances, lighting, commercial and government buildings. The president called it a "major step" toward energy independence and easing global warming.
* * *
Easing Air Traffic

The government is stepping in again to try to ease chronic nationwide air-travel delays by limiting flights at all three major New York-area airports, where backups usually begin. LaGuardia, which already limits its number of scheduled flights, as well as John F. Kennedy Airport and Newark Liberty Airport have the worst on-time record in the country. Officials are expected on Wednesday to announce details of the plan to ease congestion at the airports. A committee advising the Transportation Department has also recommended the appointment of a "czar" to oversee the troubled New York air space.
* * *
Zell Puts More In Pot

Tribune Co. announced Sam Zell will increase his investment as part of the company's leveraged buyout and said Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons will step down when the $8.2 billion deal closes. The investment disclosure came hours after the Chicago Tribune reported banks remained reluctant to fund the deal's final debt portion because market conditions have deteriorated since they pledged the loans earlier this year. Also, The Wall Street Journal reported that radio executive Randy Michaels is expected to join the company once the acquisition goes through.
* * *
Fire On White House Compound
In Washington, a fire blazed at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, in the White House
compound. The fire appeared to be located near the ceremonial office of Vice President Dick Cheney on
the second floor of the building. The vice president was across the street in his office in the West Wing
of the White House.
* * *
South Korea Elects New President

Lee Myung Bak, former head of Hyundai, claimed victory in South Korea's presidential election, as voters overlooked fraud allegations in hopes he will revive the economy. The National Election Commission said Lee had 47.6% of the vote and liberal Chung Dong Young was a distant second at
27.1% with 73.6% of ballots counted. Lee, of the conservative Grand National Party, promised that "according to the people's wishes, I will save the nation's economy that faces a crisis." Lee's victory ends a decade of liberal rule in the South, during which the country embarked on unprecedented reconciliation with rival North Korea that has led to restored trade and travel across the heavily armed frontier dividing the peninsula.

Time Picks Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin is Time magazine's "Person of the Year," beating the likes of Al Gore and J.K. Rowling for the prize. Putin won because of his "extraordinary feat of leadership in taking a country that was in chaos and bringing it stability," said Richard Stengel, Time's managing editor. The pick is in many ways a controversial one. Said Stengel: "He's the new czar of Russia, and he's dangerous in the sense that he doesn't care about civil liberties, he doesn't care about free speech." Putin recently indicated he would serve as prime minister if his handpicked successor wins the presidency.

MORGAN STANLEY GETS $5B CHINA INFUSION, POSTS 4Q LOSS

Financial services firm is shoring up its capital by selling a 9.9% stake to China for $5 billion.

Write-down is a blow to CEO John Mack, who says firm will 'dial back' a bit on taking big risk positions and he won't accept a bonus for
2007. Shares gain 4%.

European Central Bank steps on the gas, giving banks almost half a trillion dollars to tide their liquidity needs over into the new year. The ECB says it allocated  euro 46.6 billion in its main refinancing operation, which has a 16-day duration. [ 12-19-07 1542ET ]

(Adds MasterCard reaction)

BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - MasterCard has six months to change its  fee structure for international card transactions or face daily fines, according to an EU ruling that retailers said would save consumers billions of euros a year.

TD
The European Union's executive European  Commission said that for 15 years MasterCard's multilateral interchange  fee (MIF) on cross-border payment card transactions using MasterCard and Maestro cards violated EU rules on fair competition.

"Multilateral interchange  fee agreements such as MasterCard's inflate the cost of card acceptance by retailers," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Consumers foot the bill, as they risk paying twice for payment cards: once through annual  fees to their bank and a second time through inflated retail prices paid not only by card users but also by customers paying cash," Kroes said.

MasterCard said it would appeal the decision to European Union courts and had "strong grounds" to challenge the decision.

The company said its decision to appeal was "based on its firm conviction that market forces, not regulation, should drive key decisions such as the setting of interchange  fees".

EuroCommerce, which complained to Brussels about  MasterCard's fees, said consumers will enjoy lower prices.

"At this stage it only applies to cross border payments but there is little doubt every consumer in every country will demand their governments institute the same steps in weeks," EuroCommerce President Feargal Quinn told Reuters.

The lobby group estimates that 10 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in MasterCardfees should be saved by consumers annually.

The ruling will also apply to domestic credit card transactions within eight EU states -- Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Greece -- as they peg their rates to that set internationally by  MasterCard.
It will also affect how national watchdogs elsewhere in the EU, such as in Britain, view domestic card
fees.

"Tesco pays about 100 million pounds in  fees to the banks for processing credit and debit cards -- that's 100 million that we haven't been able to invest in price, range or service for our customers," Terry Leahy, chief executive of the UK grocer, said in a statement.
Retailers expect the ruling also to affect  MasterCard's archrival Visa Europe.

Page 37 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The ruling may create some uncertainty over the launch of the single  euro payments area in January as banks wanted legal clarity over  fees before deciding whether to launch rival international card schemes.
PENALTY THREATENED

The Commission said interchange fees were "not illegal as such" but gave  MasterCard six months to comply with the executive's order to withdraw the  charges.

"If  MasterCard fails to comply, the  Commission may impose daily penalty payments of 3.5 percent of its daily global turnover in the preceding business year," the  Commission said.
Kroes cited Australia as a jurisdiction that successfully limited  charge card fees.

MasterCard President Javier Perez said in a statement that the decision "ignored the experience in
Australia where regulators forced down interchange  fees, resulting in higher cardholder  charges".

But a Commission spokesman said a report by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the nation's central bank, had found competition appeared to have improved and prices had gone down.
About 45 percent of all payment cards in the EU and nearby states such as Norway either bear a
MasterCard or a Maestro logo, the  Commission said.

Shops and other providers pay  fees to their banks for each  MasterCard purchase. The U.S. card firm sets many fees, which together average around 1 percent of the purchase price.
The seller's bank then pays the "interchange"  fee to the cardholder's bank.

Visa Europe has a multi-year exemption from EU competition rules in return for capping its interchange fee at 0.7 percent.

"The exemption, however, expires on 31 December 2007 and Visa will from that moment on be responsible to ensure that its system is in full compliance with EU competition rules," the Commission said.

Visa said the ruling "does not legally apply to Visa Europe's interchange ... We will continue the dialogue we are having with the  Commission on how our rates are set in future."

But Kroes said a new case on Visa may be opened next year and she will also rule on  MasterCard's commercial card fees soon, saying they were a "burden".

MasterCard has said it should keep the principle of setting its own  fees and that the EU executive had no power to cap them.

International transactions account for 3 percent of card usage but this is expected to grow. (Additional reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton/Richard Hubbard)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Credit card company  MasterCard Inc. (MA) must drop the fees it charges stores for cross-border credit card purchases within six months or face massive daily fines, the European Commission ruled Wednesday.

TD
The charges are incompatible with European Union antitrust rules, the  commission said.

The fees charged on payments customers make abroad with  MasterCard credit cards or Maestro debit cards inflate the cost of card acceptance for retailers, said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Consumers foot the bill, as they risk paying twice for payment cards: once through annual  fees to their bank and a second time through inflated retail prices paid not only by card users but also by customers paying cash," she said.

MasterCard will have six months to withdraw the  fees or face daily fines of 3.5% of daily global revenues.

The commission said fees of that kind would be acceptable only if they can be seen to encourage innovation, step up security or have some other benefit for consumers.

Interchange  fees are paid by the banks that process purchases on behalf of stores, to banks that issue credit cards to consumers. The  fees are ultimately passed on to shopkeepers - who have long complained they are too high.

In the E.U., over 23 billion payments, exceeding a value of EUR1.35 trillion, are made every year with payment cards, according to the  commission.

E.U. regulators have been looking into MasterCard's so called "interchange"  fees since 1992, when the credit card company initially notified the commission on its practices.

The MasterCard investigation is part of a larger push by E.U. regulators to boost competition in European financial markets and coincides with the introduction of the Single  Euro Payment Area, or SEPA, from the beginning of 2008.
SEPA aims to ensure that all payment services from debit cards to direct debits are accepted across
Europe, replacing the country-by-country systems now in place.

Banks are required to be compliant with the pan-European Union payment-card-processing network by 2010.

(Adds MasterCard, retailers' comment.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--  MasterCard Inc. (MA) must drop the fees it charges for cross-border credit card purchases within six months or face massive daily fines, the European  Commission ruled Wednesday.

TD
The fees added to payments made with  MasterCard credit cards or Maestro debit cards inflate costs for retailers which are then passed on to consumers, said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Consumers foot the bill, as they risk paying twice for payment cards: once through annual  fees to their bank and a second time through inflated retail prices paid not only by card users but also by customers paying cash," she said.

Kroes said Visa International will also have to adhere to the ruling once a waiver expires at the end of the year. The waiver dates back to a 2002 deal, when the company agreed to reduce the  fees borne by retailers and their banks by about 20%.

MasterCard will have six months to withdraw its  fees or face daily fines of 3.5% of daily global revenue. MasterCard's annual revenue last year totaled $3.3 billion.
The company said it would challenge the ruling in the E.U. courts.

"We are disappointed that after years of review...the  commission failed to appreciate that without a mechanism to fairly share costs among all the participants in a payment system that functions across Europe and around the globe, consumers will be hurt," said  MasterCard Europe President Javier Perez.

The commission said what's known as "interchange"  fees charged by MasterCard and its peers are only acceptable if companies can prove the  fees encourage innovation, step up security or have some other benefit for consumers.

In the E.U., more than 23 billion payments, exceeding EUR1.35 trillion, are made every year with payment cards, according to the  commission.

MasterCard's cross-border fees are among the highest in Europe, set at more than 0.5% for debit card payments and more than 1% for credit card payments. The  fees are twice as high as those it imposes in other continents such as Australia, the  commission said.

The same fees are also charged on credit card purchases made internally in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Greece.
Retailers welcomed the decision.

"This is great news for all consumers in Europe: it will mean lower prices," said Senator Feargal Quinn, President of EuroCommerce, a body that groups 6 million small and large stores across Europe.
He reckoned the decision would save retailers and consumers more than EUR10 billion a year.

OVERVIEW

MA reported that on 12/19/07, the EU  Commission issued its decision on cross-border interchange  fees where it requires MA to repeal the Intra-EEA fallback interchange  fees for consumer credit cards and SEPA debit interchange  fees within the next six months.
PRESENTATION SUMMARY

S1. Cross-Border Interchange  Fees (J.P.) 1. EU  Commission Decision: 1. On 12/19/07, the EU Commission issued their decision on cross-border interchange  fees. 2. Commission's order requires MA to repeal its Intra-EEA fallback interchange  fees for consumer credit cards and SEPA debit interchange fees within the next six months. 2. Challenge EU  Commission's Decision: 1. Plans to challenge this decision on belief that MA has strong grounds for appeal. 2. In the interim, MA will comply with the Commission's ruling. 3. Prepared to take action so that MA's payment products in EU region remain competitive. 4. Expects the competitors who operate global four-party systems will have to [symphysis] based on the Commission's ruling on 12/19/07. 1. Therefore Co. would expect that MA shouldn't be disadvantaged relative to those systems. 2. Disappointed that the  Commission has failed to appreciate that without a mechanism to share cost among all participants in a payment system that functions across Europe and around the world where consumers will be hurt. 5. Decision does not provide the payments industry with clarity about what interchange  fees the commission will allow. 6. Firmly convinced that market forces, not regulation, should drive interchange key decisions in four-party systems. 7. In Australia, the only other jurisdiction in the world to regulate interchange  fees, consumers ended up paying higher
fees for credit cards while receiving fewer benefits and less choice. 1. There is no evidence that consumers benefited from lower merchant prices as the Australian regulators predicted. 8. Given that the EU Commission is apparently calling for an even greater reduction in interchange  fees than occurred in Australia, the adverse effects on European consumers could be even more severe. 3. Impact of Ruling: 1. Could delay implementation, at the same time, as [fans] are facing the need to make large investments in new technologies to support setback compliance. 1. Issuers' revenue from interchange is being cut as a result of 12/19/07's decision. 2. SEPA encourages financial institutions to expand into new markets in order to create more competition. 1. Reductions in interchange revenue could also reduce incentives for further expansion into domestic European payment markets, since lower revenues could result in less funding available for expansion efforts. 3. Will support SEPA model driven by market forces rather than regulation
to accomplish aforementioned goals. 1. By removing incentives for banks to expand and innovate, this could make electronic payment systems less attractive and undermine the concept of making Europe one of the most efficient and dynamic economies in the world. 4. There will still continue to be banks that will
want to prepare for set-up and expand their business. 1. For them, MA will continue to be well positioned to offer them set-up compliant products. 4. Summary: 1. Since MA Europe does not receive any revenue from interchange, it does not anticipates any significant near-term financial impact from 12/19/07's decision. 2. Needs to wait until MA has analyzed the full details of the decision to see what changes may need to be

Page 43 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
made to the way it does business under the new environment defined by the EU  Commission. 3. Decision only affects cross-border transactions in European economic area, which currently represents less than 5% of MA's Europe total purchase transactions and purchase volume.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY

OPERATOR: (OPERATORS INSTRUCTIONS) And your first question comes from the line of Anurag Rana of Keybanc. Please proceed
ANURAG RANA, ANALYST, KEYBANC: Good morning. Could you please remind us the history in
Australia and where the current status is and how consumers are faring today?

JAVIER PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF  MASTERCARD EUROPE,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Okay. Let me -- perhaps I'll do a very overall kind of conceptual summary of Australia, and then I'm going to ask Carl to compliment my response because he was directly involved in it. What happened in Australia is a very logical result of intervention. When you try to artificially shift costs from the merchant to the retailer to the consumer, well, that's exactly what you're doing.

Therefore, what you can expect is that the consumer will end up paying more because when you squeeze out of the system, or you try to squeeze out of the system some costs overnight, that is not how the system works. You need to allow the market competition and so on to reduce costs over time. As cost is reduced, everybody benefits. When you intervene in the market, cost does not go away. You're simply moving costs.

There's two partners in the question, the retailers and the consumers. And these people in between who do a job. So, by intervening you're simply shifting costs from the retailer to the consumer. Now, we think that's unfair. It is unfair because we think that payments do have certain advantages for the retailers and we have discussed these in the past many times, such as things like lower costs than cash, such as easier to manage than cash, such as et cetera, et cetera. I won't bore you with all the details of why payments are better -- payments by cards are better than cash. So what happened, in a nutshell, was just that. It was the switching or the moving or the shifting of costs from one side to the other, and, Carl, perhaps you are much closer to us. If you want to elaborate on that.

CARL MUNSON,  MASTERCARD ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNCIL,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Yes. I guess what I'd like to do is I would refer you to our website where you will find some information that does describe in more detail what happened in Australia, but a couple of things that I would mention is, there was -- there were increases in the costs of using credit cards to consumers. There were reductions in some of the benefits, loyalty programs, for example, reduction in benefits to cardholders. There was a slowdown in innovation. For example, the industry was prepared to roll out chip cards five years ago or so and that was put on hold.

There was a slowdown in the growth of the use of credit cards. So there were a number of real consequences, measurable consequences, and what the RBA was basing their decision on is a hope that these savings to merchants, as Javier explains, would somehow be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. There is no evidence that that happened.

Unfortunately, the European  Commission seems to be betting on the same thing. But if you look at the experience in Australia, it would appear that the main effect was that Australian consumers ended up paying more and getting very little, if any, benefit from the change.
ANURAG RANA: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch of UBS.

ADAM FRISCH, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for doing the call. Javier, this only affects the interchange  fees, from what we can understand from the commentary from the EC, but will this affect other payment players along the value chain, whether it be networks, card or merchant processors, for that matter, going forward or is this just the  fee to the banks that has been ruled on?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes, let me -- first let's explain exactly what the decision. Exactly what the decision covers right now is a subset of European countries what we call the EEA countries which are covered by the decision, and it's only cross-border, and it's only commercial cards -- consumer cards I'm sorry. Corporate cards are not included. So that is the extent of the decision today. If you look at the decision itself, it's very convoluted at this point in time. It's very difficult to make, frankly, may sound a bit negative, but it's very
hard to really understand what they're trying to do with this. This let's leave it at that because, like I told you, we haven't seen yet the 250 pages.

So the concern, and as I was telling you before, so why are we kind of annoyed by this? You could argue, we don't make any money off the change, it doesn't affect our P&L directly, so why are you an annoyed

Page 44 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
with this? Well, we are annoyed with this because if this were to migrate to the remaining 95% of the transactions, i.e. to the member states in the EU, all these impacts, which are very negative, will happen. Right now, with less than 5%, it's not likely to happen. So you're not going to see in the immediate future a reduction or a slowdown. Why? Because this is only 5% of the transactions. But our concern is if it does indeed go to the member states, that will slow down the growth of the economy -- sorry, the growth of the industry as well as SEPA happening.

Now, at the same time, as I was saying before, SEPA will continue to happen at the bank level. The big banks will continue to invest and will continue to make choices. And we will continue to be well placed to take advantage of those choices. So, I guess I'm sorry for a long answer to your question. There is nothing in that order that would suggest that this has to migrate anywhere. But our concern is (inaudible). Carl, you may want to perhaps elaborate a little bit on the legal aspect of that.

CARL MUNSON: No. I think that one of the main messages for today is that until we see the decision -- all we've seen so far is a three-page order which is the last three pages of the decision, and until we see the full decision and probably have a chance to talk to the  Commission, we're really not in a position to say much more than what we've already said.
ADAM FRISCH: Okay. Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Calyon. Please proceed.

CRAIG MAURER, ANALYST, CALYON: Yes. Hi. Thanks for holding the call. I find it hard to believe that the EC arrived at this decision in a vacuum and did not take into account what happened in Australia. So my question is, is the EC going to have some kind of mechanism in place to force some kind of discount or reduction at the point of sale? Because would it seem to be rather naive to assume that merchants won't view this as free lunch and an improvement of margin rather than an opportunity to improve their pricing for the consumer. So it's counterintuitive, but then again, legislators never actually -- don't always use rational thought to arrive at a decision. I was wondering if you could comment on the possibility that there might be some kind of forced pricing action at the point of sale.

JAVIER PEREZ: Right now, I think that they have gone ahead and done this because, remember this is only 5% of cross-border transactions. So actually, the banks exist in domestic market, that's the first thing. When you're a customer of bank, you do travel, but you are at home as well. So 95% of the transactions of that customer of the bank will not be affected. So, my opinion, and this is just my opinion because we have no grounds in the literature we've seen thus far, this may change when we see the 200 pages. So, therefore, this is my opinion of why they've done this.

They want to send a signal to everybody and say we don't like interchange and we expect you, at domestic level, member states, in Europe, to take note of us saying we don't like interchange and, therefore, accelerate your actions in the member countries. We -- this is my interpretation. Carl, you're a lawyer. You may want to have a legal interpretation. This is my commercial interpretation of why they've done what they've done.
CARL MUNSON: As a lawyer, I choose not to interpret it until I read the decision. CRAIG MAURER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Grausam of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

ELIZABETH GRAUSAM, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: First, just wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand the  fee that MasterCard receives on the 5% that are cross-border versus the 95% that are
in-country in Europe, so we can understand the revenue streams that are coming to the company on these types of transactions and understanding the difference in what  fees you actually can assess on those two different types of transactions.
JAVIER PEREZ: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.

BARBARA GASPER, HEAD OF IR,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Are you talking from a speakerphone, Liz, because you're breaking up?
ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: I'm sorry, I'm on a cell phone. Can you hear me now? JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. Why don't you go ahead and repeat it. We'll hear you better.
ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Just want to get an understanding of  MasterCard's fee revenue from the two different types of transactions, the cross-border transactions in Europe and what  fees are occurring to

Page 45 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MasterCard on those cross-border transactions versus the domestic transactions so we can understand the difference in revenue streams that you see in those different types of transactions.

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. I think the most important -- let me answer by telling you that we don't expect the number of transactions to change. That is because, like I was saying before, you're a bank, you issue a card to a consumer, consumer uses this card 95% domestic, 5% cross-border. Even if the banks were not to make a penny, in terms of interchange,  MasterCard does, but even if the banks were not to make a penny on those transactions, because 95% of the transactions are not affected by this decision, the banks are not going to pull that card on the consumer.

The consumer will continue to have that card. These are generally people who have -- I mean, the people that travel, there is a certain overlap with people who have strong positions in the bank, strong relationships, so on and so forth. So, as I was saying before, I do not expect any change in terms of the
number of transactions going away. They will not go away. The concern is, if the path that the  Commission has started moves on to domestic, and then attacks the 95 remaining transactions, then the banks will have to do something, and then is when you're going to have the Australian case where the consumer is going to pay the bill.

ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Okay. But just in the context of if the banks are starting -- are going come to under pressure on the interchange revenue that they're receiving on a per-transaction basis, and I know
you said there's not a near-term financial impact to  MasterCard, but are the banks and are you talking with your bank customers, if you could give us some perspective of the conversations you're having with them, of how they think about the  fees they're paying to  MasterCard in this situation where their revenue stream is getting challenged and understand the pricing dynamics, the conversations you're having with your customers in a situation where their revenue stream is coming under pressure?

JAVIER PEREZ: First, let me tell you there is nothing new on this one. We've been discussing that one with our customers for the last -- well, I was going to say 20 years, but maybe a little less. They were not so surgical at the time. This is really nothing new. So let me first say that. The second thing I would like to say is that don't forget Europe. Europe, it's a complex environment.

Every market, every -- the  Commission has no authority, no direct authority over the member states. The member states have existing proceedings, existing agreements, existing different ways of interpreting the position of the EU, and they may wish to follow or not follow. I guess my point is, if the 0, which would be the worst case scenario, which is not what the order specifically says, if 0 were to happen, the migration of
0 to the domestic markets will take time. It's not going to happen overnight.

So I guess my point to you is, we are into a process that will take time and, by the way, some member states have already said that they're very happy with the system they have today in place and they don't intend to change it.
ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Thank you.

OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Charlie Murphy of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

CHARLIE MURPHY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks, Javier. Could you expand on that point? Could you tell us what you're hearing from your conversations with the individual government authorities like the OFT in the United Kingdom about domestic interchange and what effect this ruling might have on their perception of domestic interchange?

JAVIER PEREZ: Let me perhaps -- actually, Carl, why don't you -- we just received some information from the OFT. So, Carl, why don't you answer that and then we will probably tell it to (inaudible) as well.

CARL MUNSON: Yes. You're probably aware that the OFT actually rendered a decision involving MasterCard's U.K. interchange  fees a couple years ago. That decision was set aside by the competition appeals tribunal after the OFT asked to withdraw it. Subsequent to that, the OFT commenced a new investigation of  MasterCard and Visa interchange  fees, we understand. Obviously, I can't go into the specific procedural details of that, but I can tell you that that is an ongoing investigation and the OFT is proceeding to gather evidence.
We've not really had any serious discussions with the OFT nor have they told us yet exactly what their
views are, though I certainly would expect that their views probably are not materially different from those of
the Commission and, therefore, we do have an expectation that that -- that they may proceed with that
investigation and may take it to the next level in the next few months or so, which would involve the issuing
of a statement of objections and then ultimately some kind of a decision.


Page 46 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But to say more than that, to say what that decision might be or exactly how closely they might follow the Commission I think would be speculation and premature. I think the main point is that, yes, there is an ongoing investigation in the U.K. We are cooperating with the OFT. We'll just have to wait and see what position the OFT takes.

JAVIER PEREZ: Let me add, to continue with a very fast tour of the countries in Europe. France, for example, the governor of the bank of France about a few months ago he made a public -- he commented that the French system is safe and sound and they do not need assistance to run their payments in France. The Spaniards, for example, to pick another relevant country, they have recently reached an agreement
with the merchants on that interchange transition, i.e., a reduction of interchange over next three years. In Germany, for example, the merchant has a choice between a 0 interchange payment, but no bank guarantee, and a Maestro transition at around 30 basis points at the point of sale, in terms of cost to the merchant.

So, I guess my point is it's going to vary by country. We have different things in different countries. I think it's safe to say that the position of the  Commission will accelerate and encourage the domestic authorities to look into it further, but I guess it is difficult, to your question, it's difficult to give you an estimate or how long is it going to take, what is it exactly that it is going to has. It is very hard to say.
CHARLIE MURPHY: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Burton of Citi. Please proceed.

PAT BURTON, ANALYST, CITI: Hi. Thank you. My question relates to the appeal process time line. To the extent possible could you just lay out how that's going to work?

CARL MUNSON: Yes. We have, I believe, it's 70 days to file our appeal, and I think Javier mentioned at the outset, but I would re-emphasize that we do intend to appeal the decision. We have 70 days from the day of the order, which is today, to file our appeal. Following that, the  Commission will have an opportunity to respond and I believe we'll have an opportunity to reply, and then basically the process can take two,
maybe even three years before we get a decision from the court of first instance. That would be a decision on both the facts and the law.
From there, it is possible that the losing party in that appeal could appeal further on a matter of law only,
and that could take additional time. So, the time line is that an appeal will be filed and fairly quickly and after
that, the appeals process is going to take some number of years before the matter is finally settled.
PAT BURTON: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.

MOSHE ORENBUCH, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. First, a clarification. Javier, you mentioned a number of countries, but aren't there a number that actually peg their rates to the cross-border rate? The cross-border interchange rate? So wouldn't it be more than that 5%?

JAVIER PEREZ: The answer -- I'm sorry, if I could answer that first, that was true in the past, but recently, and I could be wrong, maybe in one country, but if I am, please let me know. But they have all moved on from there. In the past, some countries theoretically, when they couldn't reach an agreement domestically, they would revert back to the  MasterCard rates. That has since evolved and, to the best of my knowledge, now every single European country has paid defined domestic rates.

MOSHE ORENBUCH: Okay. And then just separately, it seems that -- forget the 200 pages for a second, that the -- kind of the scope of this is that they want to be more consumer friendly. Do you have a sense as to what they mean? Obviously, they're not asking you for 0 because they're not, but do you have a sense as to what that could mean from that standpoint?

JAVIER PEREZ: To be totally honest with you, no. No. What we've got so far is so convoluted. We've also heard through the press conference that we -- we heard all kinds of messages, in my opinion quite frankly a bit conflicting. The example of Australia being used, it's great for the consumer when it was exactly the opposite. So very honestly, I can't really -- I don't know.
MOSHE ORENBUCH: Okay. Thank you.
OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please proceed. SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KBW: Hi. My question was along the lines of appeal process. Does
MasterCard complying mean that you will repeal the cross-border interchange  fees in the interim?

Page 47 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JAVIER PEREZ: Go ahead, Carl.

CARL MUNSON: As Javier said at the outset, we're not going to make any comments today on specific steps we will take other than it is our intention to appeal and it is also our intention to comply with the decision pending the appeal to comply with our legal obligation. Let me put that it way. We will comply with our legal obligations. Until we read the decision and perhaps have an opportunity to talk to the Commission further about exactly what they have in mind, we're not really in a position to speculate as to what exact steps we will decide to take.
SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mammone of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Please proceed.

CHRIS MAMMONE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. A question on the  fine aspect of this. Does the EC have authority to fineMasterCard based on global revenues?

CARL MUNSON: Yes. Understand first of all that this decision does not provide for any  fines for past conduct. In other words, the  Commission decided that even though they think that what we had done in the past was not complying with the law, they are not fining us for that. They did say in the order today that if we fail to comply with the order in the time allotted and, by way, there's an indication that that time could be extended at the Commission's discretion, if we fail to comply, then they have made it very clear that they do intend to fine us. So we can avoid  fines by complying with the decision.
BARBARA GASPER: Next question, please.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of Wachovia Bank. Please proceed. DAN PERLIN, ANALYST, WACHOVIA BANK: Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us some
perspective about the growth or the  fee increases on the fall-back rates relative to the domestic interchange
race over the past five years or any other time frame you'd be willing to share?

JAVIER PEREZ: Well, the rates have been -- let's put it this way. Throughout Europe, pretty much everywhere, and it's hard to say everywhere, but pretty much everywhere, to the best of my knowledge, if you take the last three to five years, rates have been coming down. I mean, you can't argue that there is no competition and that there's no transparency. There are lots of (inaudible). Lots of issuers. The truth of the matter is that the cost to the merchant over the last few years has been coming down an average, pretty substantially. I still remember when there were merchants paying 6, 7, 8% in Europe not so long ago. This
is long gone. So, the system is working.

The system is working and the system is squeezing out -- sorry, achieving efficiencies over time, and these efficiencies so far have been translated into the marketplace. Furthermore, if you consider the debit in general, it's at much lower interchange than credit, and debit years back was not such a big factor as it is today. The actual cost to the merchant has been reduced substantially. So I would suggest to you that the system is working.

DAN PERLIN: One quick follow-up. Does the ruling today preclude you in any way from actually processing domestic SEPA transactions that you were not otherwise previously allowed to process?

JAVIER PEREZ: Not at all, no. We can continue to process domestic and international transactions as we do today.
DAN PERLIN: Thank you.

OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Sproule of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.

MARK SPROULE, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: Thanks. I guess understanding that the EU is looking at Australia rather wrongly as sort of a base case, what was your experience since the Australia implementation on a -- on transaction  fees that you're getting as associated with those bank partners down there, and has that been under pressure more than you would have -- or at an increasing rate because of the push back that the Australian authorities have put on overall interchange?
JAVIER PEREZ: Let me ask Carl who has been closer to the Australia case, to answer that.
CARL MUNSON: If the question is -- your question is  MasterCard's fees, what have  MasterCard's fees
done since the regulation?


Page 48 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MARK SPROULE: Yes, I guess I'm trying to -- understanding that it's not a good situation, but if the EU is using that as a corollary, how have the Australian  fees gone?

CARL MUNSON: Honestly, I do not know what -- how our  fees have changed over that time. I do know that, in fact, that the -- one of the consequences, I could have mentioned this before, I suppose, one of the consequences of the RBA's action, their regulation of interchange was that the banks -- it used to be in Australia that there were three credit card systems operating,  MasterCard, Visa, and a local system called Bank Card, and the banks, which operated the Bank Card business after the decision, and I believe in part related to that decision, decided to close down the Bank Card business, and Bank Card cards were converted either to  MasterCard or Visa, and it is my understanding that we got a very substantial share of that business and then, in fact, our business actually grew as a result of that decision. That doesn't mean that the whole industry benefited, but, in fact, we were quite successful in capturing new business. So I think if you would look at it you would probably see that our revenues, in fact, increased. But I'm a lawyer. I don't keep our  fee schedule in my head, and I certainly don't know exactly what we did with our  fees in Australia.

MARK SPROULE: That's fair. I guess as a quick follow-up, and just correct me if I'm wrong, but understanding that this ruling applies exclusively to the cross-border issues, but it  feels like, and from your comments, I think it the's fairly implicit that the expectation is that this is the EU trying to -- sort of a step one to force you to make the changes that they don't want to -- or push to you make changes that they
don't want to force you to make, as far as on the localized base on the country specifically. Is that a fair sort of read through? Thanks.

CARL MUNSON: Well, as Javier has said, this decision only applies to cross-border transactions and any fees which would default to cross-border but as he indicated, we no longer have any fees in Europe that default to cross-border. In her press conference, Ms. Kroes made the point that the Commission is in contact, regular contact with the domestic regulators. We know that that's true. They have a network. So I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure I would say that she is expecting us to make the changes at the domestic level, but I think it's probably fair to surmise that she would expect the local regulators, as Javier said, to follow up and accelerate their investigation of interchange  fees. I think it is fair to conclude from this that the
European Commission is unhappy with current levels of interchange and would like to see those  fees lower, but as Javier also indicated, based upon what we have seen so far, we're really not in a position to judge what, if any, level of interchange would be acceptable to the  Commission at this point. And that goes for both cross-border and domestic.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. REGGIE, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Good morning. It's actually Reggie filling in for Tien-Tsin Huang. Two
quick questions. First, how do your cross-border interchange rates compare to the intra-country rates? By
that, are they 30 basis points higher, on average than the intra-country rates and I guess the extension of
that question would be, if the  Commission is comfortable with intra-country rates, is it unreasonable to
assume that they would be comfortable with a similar rate on cross-border transactions? And I have one
follow-up after. Thank you.

JAVIER PEREZ: Today, roughly, let's say the  MasterCard cross-border rates are 1.1 and 0.6 for credit and debit respectively, on average. Now, it varies by country. You have countries where they have a flat rate for debit and credit. Say, for example, France. And that rate is a lower rate. If my memory serves me right, 40 something -- close to 50 basis points. You have Germany, for example, where you have different payment instruments going on at the same time. You have nonguaranteed cards at 0 plus, but there are some  fees
to the merchant. But from an interchange perspective, it's 0.

You have EC Maestro at 30 and you have credit around 1.3 or something like that. So, then, you have Spain where they have an agreement, and I'm talking out of memory here, where there is an agreement to go from 1.2 or 3 to about 60 for credit, and there's some special arrangements for large merchants included into that. So you do have a pretty different spectrum of approaches throughout the whole member states, and that's why -- and at the same time as the  Commission was mentioning in their report, there are some countries at 0 interchange. That doesn't mean 0 cost to the merchant. There are other costs that the merchant takes which serve to compensate the system but they're not called interchange.

That's the case with Belgium, the case of the Netherlands, for example. And this is pretty much the dilemma that in a way the  Commission is facing because how can they set up a single interchange that it does not -- because you've got places at 0 and places at 1.2 or 3. So that's the dilemma they're facing. This is a very difficult decision, so they have to, therefore, relay that to the member states and say, listen, we tonight like interchange, we don't think it's a good thing. You guys better go and do something because, again, they are very aware of the fact that this is a minimal number of transactions and, therefore, it's not going to have an impact on the system as it is today.


Page 49 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
REGGIE: All right. And if I can get one more question in. You guys kind of carved out, I think you said it was about 5% of GDV this would apply to. Just to kind of clarify, am I right in assuming that?
BARBARA GASPER: It's purchase volume GDV, Reggie, not total GDV for Europe.

REGGIE: Just to be clear, the net revenue yield on that 5% of purchase volume is substantially higher than the remaining, I guess 95% of the European volume?
JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. Let me revert back to what I've said before, because I think it's relevant. First, I
cannot give you that number, but don't forget the following. Don't forget that the transactions will continue to
happen. Nobody's going to pull the plug on a good customer because their card is getting, assuming there
is no interchange, assuming that interchange were to be 0 at the end of this process, whatever it may take
or how long it may be, nobody is going to pull the plug on a customer for 5% of the transactions. So the
transactions will continue to happen, and that's why I said at the beginning that this has no impact on the
P&L of  MasterCard Europe, but we think it's the wrong thing to do. We think it's bad for the consumer and
we think it will have an impact over time if the member states were to follow.

BARBARA GASPER: We've run way over our 30-minute allotment but we'll take one more question. Operator.

OPERATOR: And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.

ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Hi. Good morning. Javier, in listening to this discussion, I can't help but think that any change in European interchange construct which creates more of a level playing field, by that I mean conformity between domestic rates and cross-border rates, ultimately moves us or creates catalyst for an accelerated move toward SEPA in as much as it makes it easier for banks to ascertain what their economics might be. Your press release implied or stated maybe that you
disagree with that view. Could you just talk about how you see SEPA conversions proceeding and what you think the key foundation or preconditions will be to accelerate a move to SEPA compliance and what that might mean for  MasterCard's growth in Europe?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. I think the last time we met I already mentioned to you that you should not expect a big bang. SEPA is nothing that is going to happen one day, magical day, boom, all the restrictions to competition, all the barriers of entry that exist in the different markets, all the investments that are needed are going to happen overnight. That will not happen. But what is happening, and what will continue to happen is the fact that there is no way back. The banks, particularly the big guys, the big banks, understand that Europe has to become a single market one way or another. And they're making moves toward that effect. Moves that frankly find  MasterCard very well positioned, very well positioned because we have a fantastic product for debit, and we have a fantastic product for credit. And the choice, thus far, and I expect that to continue, will continue to be  MasterCard.

So while we, of course, support Europe, what you said is absolutely right, it is in the interest of  MasterCard for SEPA to happen. The more SEPA happens, the better position we are in and the more we'll be able to benefit from that. But at the same time, it's not going to happen overnight. You've seen the complexity of
the interchange stuff, the way it's playing out. We talked about the different countries, the different positions of all the players, but the banks, our customers, will continue to make their moves. You will continue to see mergers. You will you continue to see consolidation and choices of one scheme, one product, a single approach. Think about it.

If you're a European bank and you're operationally in nine countries across Europe do you think you want to have nine different platforms, technical platforms, nine different relationships with nine different local authorities, nine different products that you need to manage differently? You don't. Therefore, they will continue to make the choice of those products that are present in all countries and are better suited for that. So we are, again, well positioned. We continue to be, and we will continue to service our customers just like we have. And Carl, you've got it.

CARL MUNSON: I just want to -- if I heard the question correctly, if you -- what you were saying was does MasterCard disagree with the ambition of having consistent interchange  fees across the Euro zone and for SEPA, the answer is quite the opposite. In fact, a year and a half ago or so we were the first and only to actually announce and attempt to implement a true SEPA European SEPA interchange  fees for debit for Maestro. Unfortunately, we met with very strong resistance from certain segments of the merchant community.

We also met with opposition from some rather important regulators and, therefore, we were compelled for business reasons to back off that position. But it has always been a stated goal of  MasterCard to support SEPA in all of its forms, including the eventual achievement of our harmonious interchange system across Europe just as we have within the United States and that continues to be our goal. We just -- our
Page 50 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
disagreement with we just think that SEPA interchange  fee system should not be required by the regulators to be set at 0 or some artificially low level.

ANDREW JEFFREY: All right. But it seems that the EU went out of its way to say we don't fundamentally oppose interchange. It almost seems all they're saying is we don't want a de facto duopoly in Europe. We want to clear the way for a potential third network to emerge. Is that completely off base, in terms of an interpretation?

JAVIER PEREZ: Well, it is an interpretation, indeed. I think they have made public many times that they would like to see a European-only scheme to exist, which is, of course,  fine. It goes back to what we talked about the last time. If you were a consumer and you had to choose between a card that can only be used in a subset of European countries and you need an instruction book to carry, or you can get a global card that works everywhere around the world, which one would you choose? So, yes, it's great.

We all love -- I was going to say, we're all European. We're all European on this end of the call. But there are certain things which are global. The customers of the banks are global. The banks themselves are global. They need global products.

So while to have European aspirations is a good thing, unfortunately it's a difficult thing because the consumer demands a global product. There's no way around that. And that is our strategy. That is the bank's strategy, and that's what I believe is making  MasterCard successful.

BARBARA GASPER: I'm afraid that's all the time we have for Q and A but before we sign off, Javier, couple of closing comments you might like to offer?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. In closing I just wanted to reiterate a couple of points. While we are disappointed with the EU Commission's decision, we believe we have strong grounds to appeal. If left unchallenged, this decision has negative implications not only for the consumer but also could result in the slower implementation of the SEPA initiative which we believe is an important step to keeping Europe a
competitive and dynamic global market.

Since we have not yet had the chance to review the  Commission's full decision, I am not able to comment on what actions we may take in the future, but I can assure you that  MasterCard is committed and will remain competitive in the marketplace. With that, thank you very much. Thanks for all of you to participate in this call. Thanks for your questions, and thanks for your continued support.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

LONDON (MarketWatch) -- The European Commission ruled Wednesday that chargesMasterCard imposes on retailers are illegal, though the commission stopped short of imposing an immediate fine and gave the company six months to find a new arrangement.

The E.C., which rules on antitrust policy throughout European Union member countries, said MasterCard's (MA, US) "interchange  fees" are illegal. Visa has an exemption that runs through the end of the year.

TD
MasterCardcharges merchants a payment -- 5  euro cents plus between 0.4% and 1.05% of the transaction value for debit cards, and between 0.8% and 1.2% for credit card payments.
The fee applies on virtually all cross-border payments in Europe, as well to domestic payments in
Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Greece.

Such fees aren't inherently illegal, the  commission said, but they are when they don't contribute "to technical and economic progress" and benefit consumers. The E.C. will fineMasterCard 3.5% of daily global revenue in six months if the  fees aren't withdrawn.  MasterCard recorded $3.3 billion of
revenue last year.

MasterCard said even though it doesn't receive the interchange  fees - issuers get them -- it would challenge the ruling.

"Market forces, not regulation, should drive key decisions such as the setting of interchange fees and retailers' choices over which forms of payment to accept," it said.  MasterCard insisted the fees are necessary to share costs for all participants in a payment system.

"Europe wants to reduce reliance on cash in favor of electronic payments, which are safer, cheaper, more secure and more convenient for consumers and merchants alike," it said.
Retailers didn't share that view.
Retailers argue that  MasterCard should charge per transaction and not take a cut of the overall sale. "The sooner  MasterCard accepts this ruling the sooner customers will benefit from these cost
reductions. We are now urging the Commission to ensure card companies do not try to wriggle round
the effect of the decision by pushing up other charges or introducing new ones," said Kevin Hawkins,
director general of the British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing U.K. retailers.

MasterCard shares rose over $6, or 3%, in early trading.

Analysts said a similar ruling in Australia showed that card issuers, rather than credit-card firms, took a greater hit.

"In Australia, American Express was a significant beneficiary of mandated interchange reductions as its market share and profits rose significantly," said David Hochstim, a Bear Stearns analyst.

RF            LONDON (MarketWatch) -- The European Commission ruled Wednesday that charges MasterCard imposes on retailers are illegal, though the commission stopped short of imposing an immediate fine and gave the company six months to find a new arrangement.|103

HD      The Afternoon Report: Morgan's  Muddle

Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley presented investors this morning with a series of billion-dollar announcements.

TD
Morgan took a $9.4 billion mortgage-related write-down, which contributed to an overall quarterly loss of
$3.59 billion. At the same time, the company announced a $5 billion infusion from China's sovereign
wealth fund. Chairman and CEO John Mack, saying he would forgo his 2007 bonus, called the
write-down "deeply disappointing." But Morgan's shares rallied, an apparent vote of confidence from
investors in the Chinese investment plan, despite the bath of red ink. (Shares of rival Goldman Sachs fell
yesterday after the company posted a fourth-quarter profit of $3.2 billion. Go figure.) Morgan sold a 9.9%
stake to China Investment Corp., but executives said it was in no way an act of desperation. "We don't
need more," finance chief Colm Kelleher said, in an interview after the announcement. Sovereign wealth
funds have stepped into the spotlight amid the subprime debacle. Citigroup received $7.5 billion from the
government of Abu Dhabi's investment arm, and Swiss bank UBS sold a 10.8% stake to an investment
arm of the Singapore government, as well as an unnamed Middle Eastern investor, among other deals.
The White House declined to comment on the CIC- Morgan Stanley deal. "Of course we welcome foreign
investment in the United States, but we can't comment on individual transactions," White House
spokesman Tony Fratto said.

As for Morgan's financial prospects, some analysts noted that its exposure to subprime and CDO holdings shrank after today's hit. The "sizeable  charge cleans up a lot of risk," wrote Roger Freeman of Lehman Brothers. That's the bull case. The bear case, according to David Trone, of Fox-Pitt Kelton,
plays out if the magnitude of today's losses undermines investor confidence. At midday, the stock was up about 3%. There's also the matter of risk. "Mack's strategy is to be aggressive and use the balance sheet to support businesses that he's expanding," said Dick Bove, financial strategist at Punk Ziegel & Company. "It is not working, and management turnover is excessive."

Though shares of Wall Street's big five investment banks rallied in midmorning trade, indexes on the whole looked weaker, as Standard & Poor's downgraded bond insurer ACA and gave both MBIA and Ambac a negative outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.63 to 13197.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 3.33 to 2592.70. The S&P 500 index fell 4.48 to 1450.50. Treasurys moved lower after the Fed announced the results of its first term auction; the 10-year yield moved to 4.14%. Oil gained
97 cents to $91.05 a barrel. The dollar rose against the  euro, but fell against the yen. European stocks traded lower, while Asian stocks finished mixed.

Fed Feeds Liquidity

The Federal Reserve's first term auction produced promising results, as the central bank said that it awarded $20 billion in 28-day credit with an interest rate of 4.65% and cited strong demand. The central bank unveiled the term auction facility last week as part of a coordinated effort with other central banks to inject liquidity into global financial market suffering fallout from the subprime debacle in the U.S. A
second Fed auction is scheduled for Thursday, and two more auctions are scheduled for January.

EU Confronts  MasterCard
Page 55 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Union ordered  MasterCard to stop charging  fees for cross-border credit-card purchases. Fees must be dropped within six months or MasterCard will face massive daily  fines. Fines would amount to 3.5% of daily global revenues. The charges are incompatible with European Union antitrust rules, the  commission said.

Energy Measure Becomes Law

President Bush signed into law energy legislation that mandates the first increase in automobile fuel economy in 32 years. The measure boosts the required average mileage by 40% to 35 miles per gallon. To spur increased demand for nonfossil fuels, it also requires a sixfold increase in ethanol use to 36 billion gallons a year by 2022, surely welcome news to farmers. It also requires new energy efficiency standards for a wide variety of appliances, lighting, commercial and government buildings. The president called it a "major step" toward energy independence and easing global warming.

Easing Air Traffic

The government is stepping in again to try to ease chronic nationwide air-travel delays by limiting flights at all three major New York-area airports, where backups usually begin. LaGuardia, which already limits its number of scheduled flights, as well as John F. Kennedy Airport and Newark Liberty Airport have the worst on-time record in the country. Officials are expected on Wednesday to announce details of the plan to ease congestion at the airports. A committee advising the Transportation Department has also recommended the appointment of a "czar" to oversee the troubled New York air space.
---
Tribune in Transition

Tribune Co. announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons will step down upon completion of the pending $8.2 billion buyout of the media company. Also, The Wall Street Journal reported that radio executive Randy Michaels is expected to join the company. He has a history with Sam Zell, the real-estate magnate who is putting $315 million into Tribune, an increase from the amount he committed last spring when the buyout was broached. Tribune shares slumped today after the Chicago Tribune reported banks remained reluctant to fund the deal's final debt portion because market
conditions have deteriorated since they pledged the loans earlier this year.

Fire on White House Compound

In Washington, a fire blazed at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, in the White House compound. The fire appeared to be located near the ceremonial office of Vice President Dick Cheney on the second floor of the building. The vice president was across the street in his office in the West Wing of the White House.

South Korea Elects New President

Lee Myung Bak, former head of Hyundai, claimed victory in South Korea's presidential election, as voters overlooked fraud allegations in hopes he will revive the economy. The National Election  Commission said Mr. Lee had 47.6% of the vote and liberal Chung Dong Young was a distant second at 27.1% with
73.6% of ballots counted. Mr. Lee, of the conservative Grand National Party, promised that "according to the people's wishes, I will save the nation's economy that faces a crisis." Mr. Lee's victory ends a decade of liberal rule in the South, during which the country embarked on unprecedented reconciliation with rival North Korea that has led to restored trade and travel across the heavily armed frontier dividing the peninsula.

Time Picks Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin is Time magazine's "Person of the Year," beating the likes of Al Gore and J.K. Rowling for the prize. Mr. Putin won because of his "extraordinary feat of leadership in taking a country that was in chaos and bringing it stability," said Richard Stengel, Time's managing editor. The pick is in many ways a controversial one. Said Mr. Stengel: "He's the new czar of Russia, and he's
Page 56 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
dangerous in the sense that he doesn't care about civil liberties, he doesn't care about free speech." Mr. Putin recently indicated he would serve as prime minister if his handpicked successor wins the presidency.

Congress is checking bills off its Christmas list, and President Bush seems to be getting mostly what he wants.

TD
A measure shielding millions of middle-class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax cleared the House this afternoon and is on its way to the Oval Office. The House, in a 352-64 vote, passed the tax fix without imposing other taxes to generate the $50 billion the so-called patch now costs. The legislation in its current form was opposed by the "Blue Dogs," a group of fiscally conservative Democrats who
contend that the House shouldn't bend on its "pay-as-you-go" principle, which requires that all tax cuts or spending increases be offset by the same amount to keep the federal deficit from rising. Earlier efforts to make up the money by taxing elsewhere pitted the Dems against President Bush, who said he would
veto any tax increase. They had hoped to generate the $50 billion by closing a loophole on offshore tax havens -- but in addition to opposition from the president, Senate Republicans blocked their chamber from taking up any legislation that involved a tax increase. "For the life of me, I don't understand why the
Republicans in the Senate continue to choose tax cheats," said Arkansas Rep. Mike Ross, a "Blue Dogs" leader, referring to those avoiding taxes through offshore tax havens, "when they ought to be standing with 21 million families." Regardless, passing the AMT patch has become something of an annual congressional ritual. The tax itself is now four decades old and was originally targeted at the super-rich -- but now affects millions of middle- and upper-middle income households too, as it hasn't been adjusted
for inflation.
Meanwhile, a larger matter -- a $555 billion spending bill -- cleared the House of Representatives after
$70 billion of Iraq war funding was tacked on in the Senate. The budget bill finances all federal agencies
save for the Pentagon. Democrats had twice led efforts to peg the war funding to troop withdrawals, and
twice failed. Last night, the bill passed the Senate without any withdrawal stipulation, and the House
considered it today. Mr. Bush has indicated he will sign if the House passes it, which would end months
of budget gridlock. Earlier this afternoon, Mr. Bush signed into law an energy bill that passed yesterday,
which requires auto makers to increase fuel efficiency by 40% to an industry average of 35 miles per
gallon by 2020 and calls for the blending of 36 billion gallons a year of alternative fuels like ethanol into
motor fuels by 2022. Mr. Bush said he would veto the original legislation passed by the House because it
included $21 billion in taxes, and the tax provisions were dropped. Congress did deliver the legislation to
the White House in a gas-hybrid sedan.

Markets Retreat
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 25.20 lower at 13207.27, the Nasdaq Composite Index added
4.98 to 2601.01, and the S&P 500 shed 1.98 to 1453. Treasurys rallied on credit worries, with the yield on
the 10-year note at 4.03%. Oil settled up $1.16, or 1.3%, at $91.24 a barrel. The dollar rose against the
euro and fell against the yen. European indexes fell, and Asian indexes finished mixed.

Investors Punish Sallie

Sallie Mae's shares took a nosedive after a contentious conference call, in which the chief executive said the student lender may have to cut a dividend next year to boost its finances, recently hurt by rising loan defaults and borrowing costs. The nation's largest student lender, formally known as SLM Corp., slashed its 2008 profit forecast last week in the wake of a failed $25 billion buyout, saying it needed to hold more cash to offset bad student loans. CEO Albert Lord said the company plans to "look at the dividend in the second half of the year," as it tries to raise capital and lower its borrowing costs. But analysts were far from satisfied. "We're trying to figure out what your stock is going to be worth and you've got to give us some guidance," one analyst said. "You've got to give some numbers." Shares of Sallie fell nearly 21% today.

Barclays Sues Bear

A disgruntled Barclays is suing Bear Stearns, claiming Bear wasn't forthcoming about the risks of two highly leveraged funds that collapsed earlier this year. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York, Barclays alleges that Bear, its money-management unit, Bear Stearns Asset Management and two senior BSAM executives defrauded Barclays in seeking and investing borrowed capital. They managed the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund, whose collapse wiped out $1.6 billion in investor capital. As the funds faltered, alleges the Barclays complaint, their desperate state was concealed from bank officials, whose calls and
e-mails were dodged.

Oracle Scores Big

Oracle's fiscal second-quarter net income leapt, helped by surging new software license sales for both its legacy database and more recently acquired business applications. The business-software maker, which recently withdrew a $6.7 billion bid for BEA Systems, reported net income of $1.3 billion, or 25 cents a share, for the quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with $967 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier.
"We exceeded our guidance and our best case forecast with strong revenue growth across all product lines and geographies," said President and Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz in a press release.

Tech Trio to Pay Gambling  Fine

Google, Microsoft and Yahoo agreed to pay $31.5 million in  fines to resolve claims they had promoted illegal gambling. The Department of Justice said the penalty was for "corporate conduct the government found in violation of the Federal Wire Wager Act, federal wagering excise tax laws, and various states' statutes and municipal laws prohibiting gambling." Microsoft is set to pony up $21 million, $9 million of which will be used in an online, public-service campaign to inform the public that online gambling enterprises are illegal. Yahoo will pay $7.5 million for allegedly receiving payments over 10 years from online-gambling companies for advertising their Web sites. As part of the settlements, none of the three companies admit or contest their culpability.

Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

Hoarding contraceptives and the like was par for the course among the characters on long-running sitcom "Seinfeld." Fans may remember an episode in which Elaine took to stocking up on "Today" sponges, scouring New York pharmacies to buy them when the contraceptive sponges were subject to a

recall -- which mimicked the state of affairs in the real world, where the sponge, a birth-control favorite among women at the time, had been pulled from shelves because of manufacturing deficiencies. Now Pennsylvania-based Synova Healthcare Group, which owns the sponge's real-world manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy. This year, Synova had bought a company that began selling the "Today" sponge in
2005. It seems conceivable the sponge could be gone for good.

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the  MasterCard conference call. My name is Michelle. I will be your coordinator for today. (OPERATORS INSTRUCTIONS) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

And I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.

TD
BARBARA GASPER, HEAD OF IR,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning or good afternoon to everyone, depending on where you're located. And thank you for joining us today on relatively short notice, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about the press release we issued earlier today regarding the EU  Commission's decision on MasterCard's cross border interchange fees for both credit and debit transactions in Europe. With me on the call today are Javier Perez, President of MasterCard Europe, and Carl Munson,  MasterCard Associate General Council.

Following some brief comments by Javier, we will open the call for your questions. In total, we expect the call will last approximately 30 minutes. For your reference, today's press release can be found on the investor relations section of our website,  mastercard.com. Finally, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements. Actual outcomes could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the risk factors that could impact our business is summarized at the end of today's press release as well as in our most recent SEC filings. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Javier Perez. Javier --

JAVIER PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF  MASTERCARD EUROPE,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Okay. Thank you very much, Barbara. I'll start by reading a prepared a statement that's going to sound a bit boring, so I beg your patience. I'll read this to you before we open the session for questions. This morning, the EU Commission issued their decision on cross-border interchange  fees. Basically the  Commission's
order requires us to repeal our intra-European economic area fallback interchange  fees for consumer credit cards as well as our SEPA debit interchange  fees within the next six months. We plan to challenge this decision and believe that we have strong grounds for appeal. In the interim, we will comply with the Commission's ruling. However, we are prepared to take action so that  MasterCard's payments products in the EU region remain competitive.

Additionally, we expect our competitors, who operate global four-party systems, will have to self-assess based on the Commission's ruling today. Therefore, we would expect that MasterCard shouldn't be disadvantaged relative to those systems. We are disappointed that the Commission has failed to appreciate that without a mechanism to share costs among all participants in a payment system, that functions across Europe and around the world, consumers will likely be hurt. Also, today's decision does not provide the payment industry with clarity about what interchange  fees the Commission will allow. We're firmly convinced that market forces, not regulation, should drive interchange fee decisions in
four-party systems. Look at what happened in Australia, the only other jurisdiction in the world to regulate interchange fees. Consumers ended up paying higher  fees for credit cards while receiving fewer benefits and less choice. And there is no evidence that consumers benefited from lower merchant prices as the Australian regulators predicted.

Given that the EU  Commission is apparently calling for an even greater reduction in interchange  fees than occurred in Australia, the adverse effects on European consumers could be even more severe. The potential impact of this ruling on the SEPA initiative is two-fold. First, this ruling could delay implementation at the same time as banks are facing the need to make large investments in new technologies to support SEPA compliance. Interest revenue from interchange is being cut as a result of today's decision. Second,

Page 62 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SEPA encourages financial institutions to expand into new markets in order to create more competition. Reductions in interchange revenue could also reduce incentives for further expansion into domestic European payment markets since lower revenues could result in less funding available for expansion efforts.

We support a SEPA model driven by market forces rather than regulation to accomplish these goals. By removing incentives for banks to expand and innovate, this could make electronic payment systems less attractive and undermine the concept of making Europe one of the most efficient and dynamic economies in the world. That said, there will still continue to be banks who will want to prepare for SEPA and expand their business. For them, we will continue to be well positioned to offer them SEPA-compliant products. As
we have not yet received a copy of the  Commission's full decision, which we understand will take -- or will be a couple of hundred pages long, I'm not in a position to discuss with you today any actions that we may choose to take in order to remain competitive.

What I can tell you is that since  MasterCard Europe does not receive any revenue from interchange, we do not anticipate any significant near-term financial impact from today's decision. We need to wait until we
have analyzed the full details of the decision to see what changes may need to be made to the way we do business under the new environment defined by the EU  Commission. Keep in mind that this decision only affects cross-boarder transactions in the European economic area which currently represents less than 5% of both MasterCard Europe's total purchase transactions and total purchase volume. That concludes the remarks I wanted to make, and I am now very happy to take your questions. Barbara, please.

BARBARA GASPER: We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question with one follow-up on the subject of today's announcement. Operator, let's begin.

OPERATOR: (OPERATORS INSTRUCTIONS) And your first question comes from the line of Anurag Rana of Keybanc. Please proceed
ANURAG RANA, ANALYST, KEYBANC: Good morning. Could you please remind us the history in
Australia and where the current status is and how consumers are faring today?

JAVIER PEREZ: Okay. Let me -- perhaps I'll do a very overall kind of conceptual summary of Australia, and then I'm going to ask Carl to compliment my response because he was directly involved in it. What happened in Australia is a very logical result of intervention. When you try to artificially shift costs from the merchant to the retailer to the consumer, well, that's exactly what you're doing.

Therefore, what you can expect is that the consumer will end up paying more because when you squeeze out of the system, or you try to squeeze out of the system some costs overnight, that is not how the system works. You need to allow the market competition and so on to reduce costs over time. As cost is reduced, everybody benefits. When you intervene in the market, cost does not go away. You're simply moving costs.

There's two partners in the question, the retailers and the consumers. And these people in between who do a job. So, by intervening you're simply shifting costs from the retailer to the consumer. Now, we think that's unfair. It is unfair because we think that payments do have certain advantages for the retailers and we have discussed these in the past many times, such as things like lower costs than cash, such as easier to manage than cash, such as et cetera, et cetera. I won't bore you with all the details of why payments are better -- payments by cards are better than cash. So what happened, in a nutshell, was just that. It was the switching or the moving or the shifting of costs from one side to the other, and, Carl, perhaps you are much closer to us. If you want to elaborate on that.

CARL MUNSON,  MASTERCARD ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNCIL,  MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Yes. I guess what I'd like to do is I would refer you to our website where you will find some information that does describe in more detail what happened in Australia, but a couple of things that I would mention is, there was -- there were increases in the costs of using credit cards to consumers. There were reductions in some of the benefits, loyalty programs, for example, reduction in benefits to cardholders. There was a slowdown in innovation. For example, the industry was prepared to roll out chip cards five years ago or so and that was put on hold.

There was a slowdown in the growth of the use of credit cards. So there were a number of real consequences, measurable consequences, and what the RBA was basing their decision on is a hope that these savings to merchants, as Javier explains, would somehow be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. There is no evidence that that happened.

Unfortunately, the European  Commission seems to be betting on the same thing. But if you look at the experience in Australia, it would appear that the main effect was that Australian consumers ended up paying more and getting very little, if any, benefit from the change.

ANURAG RANA: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch of UBS.

ADAM FRISCH, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for doing the call. Javier, this only affects the interchange  fees, from what we can understand from the commentary from the EC, but will this affect other payment players along the value chain, whether it be networks, card or merchant processors, for that matter, going forward or is this just the  fee to the banks that has been ruled on?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes, let me -- first let's explain exactly what the decision. Exactly what the decision covers right now is a subset of European countries what we call the EEA countries which are covered by the decision, and it's only cross-border, and it's only commercial cards -- consumer cards I'm sorry. Corporate cards are not included. So that is the extent of the decision today. If you look at the decision itself, it's very convoluted at this point in time. It's very difficult to make, frankly, may sound a bit negative, but it's very
hard to really understand what they're trying to do with this. This let's leave it at that because, like I told you, we haven't seen yet the 250 pages.

So the concern, and as I was telling you before, so why are we kind of annoyed by this? You could argue, we don't make any money off the change, it doesn't affect our P&L directly, so why are you an annoyed with this? Well, we are annoyed with this because if this were to migrate to the remaining 95% of the transactions, i.e. to the member states in the EU, all these impacts, which are very negative, will happen. Right now, with less than 5%, it's not likely to happen. So you're not going to see in the immediate future a reduction or a slowdown. Why? Because this is only 5% of the transactions. But our concern is if it does indeed go to the member states, that will slow down the growth of the economy -- sorry, the growth of the industry as well as SEPA happening.

Now, at the same time, as I was saying before, SEPA will continue to happen at the bank level. The big banks will continue to invest and will continue to make choices. And we will continue to be well placed to take advantage of those choices. So, I guess I'm sorry for a long answer to your question. There is nothing in that order that would suggest that this has to migrate anywhere. But our concern is (inaudible). Carl, you may want to perhaps elaborate a little bit on the legal aspect of that.

CARL MUNSON: No. I think that one of the main messages for today is that until we see the decision -- all we've seen so far is a three-page order which is the last three pages of the decision, and until we see the full decision and probably have a chance to talk to the  Commission, we're really not in a position to say much more than what we've already said.
ADAM FRISCH: Okay. Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Calyon. Please proceed.

CRAIG MAURER, ANALYST, CALYON: Yes. Hi. Thanks for holding the call. I find it hard to believe that the EC arrived at this decision in a vacuum and did not take into account what happened in Australia. So my question is, is the EC going to have some kind of mechanism in place to force some kind of discount or reduction at the point of sale? Because would it seem to be rather naive to assume that merchants won't view this as free lunch and an improvement of margin rather than an opportunity to improve their pricing for the consumer. So it's counterintuitive, but then again, legislators never actually -- don't always use rational thought to arrive at a decision. I was wondering if you could comment on the possibility that there might be some kind of forced pricing action at the point of sale.

JAVIER PEREZ: Right now, I think that they have gone ahead and done this because, remember this is only 5% of cross-border transactions. So actually, the banks exist in domestic market, that's the first thing. When you're a customer of bank, you do travel, but you are at home as well. So 95% of the transactions of that customer of the bank will not be affected. So, my opinion, and this is just my opinion because we have no grounds in the literature we've seen thus far, this may change when we see the 200 pages. So, therefore, this is my opinion of why they've done this.

They want to send a signal to everybody and say we don't like interchange and we expect you, at domestic level, member states, in Europe, to take note of us saying we don't like interchange and, therefore, accelerate your actions in the member countries. We -- this is my interpretation. Carl, you're a lawyer. You may want to have a legal interpretation. This is my commercial interpretation of why they've done what they've done.
CARL MUNSON: As a lawyer, I choose not to interpret it until I read the decision. CRAIG MAURER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Grausam of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

ELIZABETH GRAUSAM, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: First, just wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand the  fee that MasterCard receives on the 5% that are cross-border versus the 95% that are
in-country in Europe, so we can understand the revenue streams that are coming to the company on these types of transactions and understanding the difference in what  fees you actually can assess on those two different types of transactions.
JAVIER PEREZ: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.
BARBARA GASPER: Are you talking from a speakerphone, Liz, because you're breaking up? ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: I'm sorry, I'm on a cell phone. Can you hear me now?
JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. Why don't you go ahead and repeat it. We'll hear you better.

ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Just want to get an understanding of  MasterCard's fee revenue from the two different types of transactions, the cross-border transactions in Europe and what  fees are occurring to MasterCard on those cross-border transactions versus the domestic transactions so we can understand the difference in revenue streams that you see in those different types of transactions.

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. I think the most important -- let me answer by telling you that we don't expect the number of transactions to change. That is because, like I was saying before, you're a bank, you issue a card to a consumer, consumer uses this card 95% domestic, 5% cross-border. Even if the banks were not to make a penny, in terms of interchange,  MasterCard does, but even if the banks were not to make a penny on those transactions, because 95% of the transactions are not affected by this decision, the banks are not going to pull that card on the consumer.

The consumer will continue to have that card. These are generally people who have -- I mean, the people that travel, there is a certain overlap with people who have strong positions in the bank, strong relationships, so on and so forth. So, as I was saying before, I do not expect any change in terms of the number of transactions going away. They will not go away. The concern is, if the path that the Commission has started moves on to domestic, and then attacks the 95 remaining transactions, then the banks will have to do something, and then is when you're going to have the Australian case where the consumer is going to pay the bill.

ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Okay. But just in the context of if the banks are starting -- are going come to under pressure on the interchange revenue that they're receiving on a per-transaction basis, and I know
you said there's not a near-term financial impact to  MasterCard, but are the banks and are you talking with your bank customers, if you could give us some perspective of the conversations you're having with them, of how they think about the  fees they're paying to  MasterCard in this situation where their revenue stream is getting challenged and understand the pricing dynamics, the conversations you're having with your customers in a situation where their revenue stream is coming under pressure?

JAVIER PEREZ: First, let me tell you there is nothing new on this one. We've been discussing that one with our customers for the last -- well, I was going to say 20 years, but maybe a little less. They were not so surgical at the time. This is really nothing new. So let me first say that. The second thing I would like to say is that don't forget Europe. Europe, it's a complex environment.

Every market, every -- the  Commission has no authority, no direct authority over the member states. The member states have existing proceedings, existing agreements, existing different ways of interpreting the position of the EU, and they may wish to follow or not follow. I guess my point is, if the 0, which would be the worst case scenario, which is not what the order specifically says, if 0 were to happen, the migration of
0 to the domestic markets will take time. It's not going to happen overnight.

So I guess my point to you is, we are into a process that will take time and, by the way, some member states have already said that they're very happy with the system they have today in place and they don't intend to change it.
ELIZABETH GRAUSAM: Thank you.

OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Charlie Murphy of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

CHARLIE MURPHY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks, Javier. Could you expand on that point? Could you tell us what you're hearing from your conversations with the individual government authorities


Page 65 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
like the OFT in the United Kingdom about domestic interchange and what effect this ruling might have on their perception of domestic interchange?

JAVIER PEREZ: Let me perhaps -- actually, Carl, why don't you -- we just received some information from the OFT. So, Carl, why don't you answer that and then we will probably tell it to (inaudible) as well.

CARL MUNSON: Yes. You're probably aware that the OFT actually rendered a decision involving MasterCard's U.K. interchange  fees a couple years ago. That decision was set aside by the competition appeals tribunal after the OFT asked to withdraw it. Subsequent to that, the OFT commenced a new investigation of  MasterCard and Visa interchange  fees, we understand. Obviously, I can't go into the specific procedural details of that, but I can tell you that that is an ongoing investigation and the OFT is proceeding to gather evidence.
We've not really had any serious discussions with the OFT nor have they told us yet exactly what their
views are, though I certainly would expect that their views probably are not materially different from those of
the Commission and, therefore, we do have an expectation that that -- that they may proceed with that
investigation and may take it to the next level in the next few months or so, which would involve the issuing
of a statement of objections and then ultimately some kind of a decision.

But to say more than that, to say what that decision might be or exactly how closely they might follow the Commission I think would be speculation and premature. I think the main point is that, yes, there is an ongoing investigation in the U.K. We are cooperating with the OFT. We'll just have to wait and see what position the OFT takes.

JAVIER PEREZ: Let me add, to continue with a very fast tour of the countries in Europe. France, for example, the governor of the bank of France about a few months ago he made a public -- he commented that the French system is safe and sound and they do not need assistance to run their payments in France. The Spaniards, for example, to pick another relevant country, they have recently reached an agreement
with the merchants on that interchange transition, i.e., a reduction of interchange over next three years. In Germany, for example, the merchant has a choice between a 0 interchange payment, but no bank guarantee, and a Maestro transition at around 30 basis points at the point of sale, in terms of cost to the merchant.

So, I guess my point is it's going to vary by country. We have different things in different countries. I think it's safe to say that the position of the  Commission will accelerate and encourage the domestic authorities to look into it further, but I guess it is difficult, to your question, it's difficult to give you an estimate or how long is it going to take, what is it exactly that it is going to has. It is very hard to say.
CHARLIE MURPHY: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Burton of Citi. Please proceed.

PAT BURTON, ANALYST, CITI: Hi. Thank you. My question relates to the appeal process time line. To the extent possible could you just lay out how that's going to work?

CARL MUNSON: Yes. We have, I believe, it's 70 days to file our appeal, and I think Javier mentioned at the outset, but I would re-emphasize that we do intend to appeal the decision. We have 70 days from the day
of the order, which is today, to file our appeal. Following that, the  Commission will have an opportunity to respond and I believe we'll have an opportunity to reply, and then basically the process can take two, maybe even three years before we get a decision from the court of first instance. That would be a decision on both the facts and the law.

From there, it is possible that the losing party in that appeal could appeal further on a matter of law only, and that could take additional time. So, the time line is that an appeal will be filed and fairly quickly and after that, the appeals process is going to take some number of years before the matter is finally settled.
PAT BURTON: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.

MOSHE ORENBUCH, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. First, a clarification. Javier, you mentioned a number of countries, but aren't there a number that actually peg their rates to the cross-border rate? The cross-border interchange rate? So wouldn't it be more than that 5%?

JAVIER PEREZ: The answer -- I'm sorry, if I could answer that first, that was true in the past, but recently, and I could be wrong, maybe in one country, but if I am, please let me know. But they have all moved on from there. In the past, some countries theoretically, when they couldn't reach an agreement domestically,

Page 66 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
they would revert back to the  MasterCard rates. That has since evolved and, to the best of my knowledge, now every single European country has paid defined domestic rates.

MOSHE ORENBUCH: Okay. And then just separately, it seems that -- forget the 200 pages for a second, that the -- kind of the scope of this is that they want to be more consumer friendly. Do you have a sense as to what they mean? Obviously, they're not asking you for 0 because they're not, but do you have a sense as to what that could mean from that standpoint?

JAVIER PEREZ: To be totally honest with you, no. No. What we've got so far is so convoluted. We've also heard through the press conference that we -- we heard all kinds of messages, in my opinion quite frankly a bit conflicting. The example of Australia being used, it's great for the consumer when it was exactly the opposite. So very honestly, I can't really -- I don't know.
MOSHE ORENBUCH: Okay. Thank you.
OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please proceed. SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KBW: Hi. My question was along the lines of appeal process. Does
MasterCard complying mean that you will repeal the cross-border interchange  fees in the interim?
JAVIER PEREZ: Go ahead, Carl.

CARL MUNSON: As Javier said at the outset, we're not going to make any comments today on specific steps we will take other than it is our intention to appeal and it is also our intention to comply with the decision pending the appeal to comply with our legal obligation. Let me put that it way. We will comply with our legal obligations. Until we read the decision and perhaps have an opportunity to talk to the Commission further about exactly what they have in mind, we're not really in a position to speculate as to what exact steps we will decide to take.
SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mammone of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Please proceed.

CHRIS MAMMONE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. A question on the  fine aspect of this. Does the EC have authority to fineMasterCard based on global revenues?

CARL MUNSON: Yes. Understand first of all that this decision does not provide for any  fines for past conduct. In other words, the  Commission decided that even though they think that what we had done in the past was not complying with the law, they are not fining us for that. They did say in the order today that if we fail to comply with the order in the time allotted and, by way, there's an indication that that time could be extended at the Commission's discretion, if we fail to comply, then they have made it very clear that they do intend to fine us. So we can avoid  fines by complying with the decision.
BARBARA GASPER: Next question, please.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of Wachovia Bank. Please proceed. DAN PERLIN, ANALYST, WACHOVIA BANK: Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us some
perspective about the growth or the  fee increases on the fall-back rates relative to the domestic
interchange race over the past five years or any other time frame you'd be willing to share?

JAVIER PEREZ: Well, the rates have been -- let's put it this way. Throughout Europe, pretty much everywhere, and it's hard to say everywhere, but pretty much everywhere, to the best of my knowledge, if you take the last three to five years, rates have been coming down. I mean, you can't argue that there is no competition and that there's no transparency. There are lots of (inaudible). Lots of issuers. The truth of the matter is that the cost to the merchant over the last few years has been coming down an average, pretty substantially. I still remember when there were merchants paying 6, 7, 8% in Europe not so long ago. This
is long gone. So, the system is working.

The system is working and the system is squeezing out -- sorry, achieving efficiencies over time, and these efficiencies so far have been translated into the marketplace. Furthermore, if you consider the debit in general, it's at much lower interchange than credit, and debit years back was not such a big factor as it is today. The actual cost to the merchant has been reduced substantially. So I would suggest to you that the system is working.

DAN PERLIN: One quick follow-up. Does the ruling today preclude you in any way from actually processing domestic SEPA transactions that you were not otherwise previously allowed to process?

Page 67 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JAVIER PEREZ: Not at all, no. We can continue to process domestic and international transactions as we do today.
DAN PERLIN: Thank you.

OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Sproule of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.

MARK SPROULE, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: Thanks. I guess understanding that the EU is looking at Australia rather wrongly as sort of a base case, what was your experience since the Australia implementation on a -- on transaction  fees that you're getting as associated with those bank partners down there, and has that been under pressure more than you would have -- or at an increasing rate because of the push back that the Australian authorities have put on overall interchange?
JAVIER PEREZ: Let me ask Carl who has been closer to the Australia case, to answer that.
CARL MUNSON: If the question is -- your question is  MasterCard's fees, what have  MasterCard's fees
done since the regulation?

MARK SPROULE: Yes, I guess I'm trying to -- understanding that it's not a good situation, but if the EU is using that as a corollary, how have the Australian  fees gone?

CARL MUNSON: Honestly, I do not know what -- how our  fees have changed over that time. I do know that, in fact, that the -- one of the consequences, I could have mentioned this before, I suppose, one of the consequences of the RBA's action, their regulation of interchange was that the banks -- it used to be in Australia that there were three credit card systems operating,  MasterCard, Visa, and a local system called Bank Card, and the banks, which operated the Bank Card business after the decision, and I believe in part related to that decision, decided to close down the Bank Card business, and Bank Card cards were converted either to  MasterCard or Visa, and it is my understanding that we got a very substantial share of that business and then, in fact, our business actually grew as a result of that decision. That doesn't mean that the whole industry benefited, but, in fact, we were quite successful in capturing new business. So I think if you would look at it you would probably see that our revenues, in fact, increased. But I'm a lawyer. I don't keep our  fee schedule in my head, and I certainly don't know exactly what we did with our  fees in Australia.

MARK SPROULE: That's fair. I guess as a quick follow-up, and just correct me if I'm wrong, but understanding that this ruling applies exclusively to the cross-border issues, but it  feels like, and from your comments, I think it the's fairly implicit that the expectation is that this is the EU trying to -- sort of a step one to force you to make the changes that they don't want to -- or push to you make changes that they
don't want to force you to make, as far as on the localized base on the country specifically. Is that a fair sort of read through? Thanks.

CARL MUNSON: Well, as Javier has said, this decision only applies to cross-border transactions and any fees which would default to cross-border but as he indicated, we no longer have any fees in Europe that default to cross-border. In her press conference, Ms. Kroes made the point that the Commission is in contact, regular contact with the domestic regulators. We know that that's true. They have a network. So I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure I would say that she is expecting us to make the changes at the domestic level, but I think it's probably fair to surmise that she would expect the local regulators, as Javier said, to
follow up and accelerate their investigation of interchange  fees. I think it is fair to conclude from this that the European Commission is unhappy with current levels of interchange and would like to see those  fees lower, but as Javier also indicated, based upon what we have seen so far, we're really not in a position to judge what, if any, level of interchange would be acceptable to the  Commission at this point. And that
goes for both cross-border and domestic.
OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. REGGIE, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Good morning. It's actually Reggie filling in for Tien-Tsin Huang. Two
quick questions. First, how do your cross-border interchange rates compare to the intra-country rates? By
that, are they 30 basis points higher, on average than the intra-country rates and I guess the extension of
that question would be, if the  Commission is comfortable with intra-country rates, is it unreasonable to
assume that they would be comfortable with a similar rate on cross-border transactions? And I have one
follow-up after. Thank you.

JAVIER PEREZ: Today, roughly, let's say the  MasterCard cross-border rates are 1.1 and 0.6 for credit and debit respectively, on average. Now, it varies by country. You have countries where they have a flat rate for debit and credit. Say, for example, France. And that rate is a lower rate. If my memory serves me right, 40 something -- close to 50 basis points. You have Germany, for example, where you have different payment

Page 68 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
instruments going on at the same time. You have nonguaranteed cards at 0 plus, but there are some  fees
to the merchant. But from an interchange perspective, it's 0.

You have EC Maestro at 30 and you have credit around 1.3 or something like that. So, then, you have Spain where they have an agreement, and I'm talking out of memory here, where there is an agreement to go from 1.2 or 3 to about 60 for credit, and there's some special arrangements for large merchants included into that. So you do have a pretty different spectrum of approaches throughout the whole member states, and that's why -- and at the same time as the  Commission was mentioning in their report, there are some countries at 0 interchange. That doesn't mean 0 cost to the merchant. There are other costs that the merchant takes which serve to compensate the system but they're not called interchange.

That's the case with Belgium, the case of the Netherlands, for example. And this is pretty much the dilemma that in a way the  Commission is facing because how can they set up a single interchange that it does not -- because you've got places at 0 and places at 1.2 or 3. So that's the dilemma they're facing. This is a very difficult decision, so they have to, therefore, relay that to the member states and say, listen, we tonight like interchange, we don't think it's a good thing. You guys better go and do something because, again, they are very aware of the fact that this is a minimal number of transactions and, therefore, it's not going to have an impact on the system as it is today.

REGGIE: All right. And if I can get one more question in. You guys kind of carved out, I think you said it was about 5% of GDV this would apply to. Just to kind of clarify, am I right in assuming that?
BARBARA GASPER: It's purchase volume GDV, Reggie, not total GDV for Europe.

REGGIE: Just to be clear, the net revenue yield on that 5% of purchase volume is substantially higher than the remaining, I guess 95% of the European volume?
JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. Let me revert back to what I've said before, because I think it's relevant. First, I
cannot give you that number, but don't forget the following. Don't forget that the transactions will continue to
happen. Nobody's going to pull the plug on a good customer because their card is getting, assuming there
is no interchange, assuming that interchange were to be 0 at the end of this process, whatever it may take
or how long it may be, nobody is going to pull the plug on a customer for 5% of the transactions. So the
transactions will continue to happen, and that's why I said at the beginning that this has no impact on the
P&L of  MasterCard Europe, but we think it's the wrong thing to do. We think it's bad for the consumer and
we think it will have an impact over time if the member states were to follow.

BARBARA GASPER: We've run way over our 30-minute allotment but we'll take one more question. Operator.

OPERATOR: And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.

ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Hi. Good morning. Javier, in listening to this discussion, I can't help but think that any change in European interchange construct which creates more of a level playing field, by that I mean conformity between domestic rates and cross-border rates, ultimately moves us or creates catalyst for an accelerated move toward SEPA in as much as it makes it easier for banks to ascertain what their economics might be. Your press release implied or stated maybe that you
disagree with that view. Could you just talk about how you see SEPA conversions proceeding and what you think the key foundation or preconditions will be to accelerate a move to SEPA compliance and what that might mean for  MasterCard's growth in Europe?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. I think the last time we met I already mentioned to you that you should not expect a big bang. SEPA is nothing that is going to happen one day, magical day, boom, all the restrictions to competition, all the barriers of entry that exist in the different markets, all the investments that are needed are going to happen overnight. That will not happen. But what is happening, and what will continue to happen is the fact that there is no way back. The banks, particularly the big guys, the big banks, understand that Europe has to become a single market one way or another. And they're making moves toward that effect. Moves that frankly find  MasterCard very well positioned, very well positioned because we have a fantastic product for debit, and we have a fantastic product for credit. And the choice, thus far, and I expect that to continue, will continue to be  MasterCard. very well positioned, very well positioned because we have a fantastic product for debit, and we have a fantastic product for credit. And the choice, thus far, and I expect that to continue, will continue to be

So while we, of course, support Europe, what you said is absolutely right, it is in the interest of  MasterCard for SEPA to happen. The more SEPA happens, the better position we are in and the more we'll be able to benefit from that. But at the same time, it's not going to happen overnight. You've seen the complexity of
the interchange stuff, the way it's playing out. We talked about the different countries, the different positions of all the players, but the banks, our customers, will continue to make their moves. You will continue to see
Page 69 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
mergers. You will you continue to see consolidation and choices of one scheme, one product, a single approach. Think about it.

If you're a European bank and you're operationally in nine countries across Europe do you think you want to have nine different platforms, technical platforms, nine different relationships with nine different local authorities, nine different products that you need to manage differently? You don't. Therefore, they will continue to make the choice of those products that are present in all countries and are better suited for that. So we are, again, well positioned. We continue to be, and we will continue to service our customers just like we have. And Carl, you've got it.
CARL MUNSON: I just want to -- if I heard the question correctly, if you -- what you were saying was does
MasterCard disagree with the ambition of having consistent interchange  fees across the Euro zone and
for SEPA, the answer is quite the opposite. In fact, a year and a half ago or so we were the first and only to
actually announce and attempt to implement a true SEPA European SEPA interchange  fees for debit for
Maestro. Unfortunately, we met with very strong resistance from certain segments of the merchant
community.

We also met with opposition from some rather important regulators and, therefore, we were compelled for business reasons to back off that position. But it has always been a stated goal of  MasterCard to support SEPA in all of its forms, including the eventual achievement of our harmonious interchange system across Europe just as we have within the United States and that continues to be our goal. We just -- our disagreement with we just think that SEPA interchange  fee system should not be required by the regulators to be set at 0 or some artificially low level.

ANDREW JEFFREY: All right. But it seems that the EU went out of its way to say we don't fundamentally oppose interchange. It almost seems all they're saying is we don't want a de facto duopoly in Europe. We want to clear the way for a potential third network to emerge. Is that completely off base, in terms of an interpretation?

JAVIER PEREZ: Well, it is an interpretation, indeed. I think they have made public many times that they would like to see a European-only scheme to exist, which is, of course,  fine. It goes back to what we talked about the last time. If you were a consumer and you had to choose between a card that can only be used in a subset of European countries and you need an instruction book to carry, or you can get a global card that works everywhere around the world, which one would you choose? So, yes, it's great.

We all love -- I was going to say, we're all European. We're all European on this end of the call. But there are certain things which are global. The customers of the banks are global. The banks themselves are global. They need global products.

So while to have European aspirations is a good thing, unfortunately it's a difficult thing because the consumer demands a global product. There's no way around that. And that is our strategy. That is the bank's strategy, and that's what I believe is making  MasterCard successful.

BARBARA GASPER: I'm afraid that's all the time we have for Q and A but before we sign off, Javier, couple of closing comments you might like to offer?

JAVIER PEREZ: Yes. In closing I just wanted to reiterate a couple of points. While we are disappointed with the EU  Commission's decision, we believe we have strong grounds to appeal. If left unchallenged, this decision has negative implications not only for the consumer but also could result in the slower implementation of the SEPA initiative which we believe is an important step to keeping Europe a competitive and dynamic global market.

Since we have not yet had the chance to review the  Commission's full decision, I am not able to comment on what actions we may take in the future, but I can assure you that  MasterCard is committed and will remain competitive in the marketplace. With that, thank you very much. Thanks for all of you to participate in this call. Thanks for your questions, and thanks for your continued support.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

HD          EU Raps MasterCard Over Fees

BRUSSELS -- The European Union ordered  MasterCard Inc. to abolish certain  fees levied on credit- and debit-card transactions, setting the stage for a broader fight between European regulators and card companies over the  charges.

The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, ruled yesterday that  MasterCard acts as a cartel by setting the fees its member banks charge one another to move money between the accounts of shoppers and merchants. That, the commission said, unfairly raises consumers' retail prices. It ordered the fees stopped within six months, warning  MasterCard that it faces  fines of around
$350,000 a day if it fails to comply.

TD
MasterCard, which will appeal the ruling, says the  fees are necessary to encourage banks to issue more cards.

Retailers have long complained about these "interchange  fees," saying they eat into slim margins and raise prices for shoppers. Their EU lobbying group estimates that banks in Europe reap 10 billion euros ($14.4 billion) a year in such  fees.

The EU decision applies to only a small fraction of  MasterCard transactions, mostly cross-border payments. But retailers and the EU expect the decision to influence national regulators looking to cut fees on domestic transactions, too.

The fees work like this: A shopper buys 100 euros of groceries with a  MasterCard credit or debit card. The bank that issued that card sends 99 euros to the supermarket's bank after deducting a 1  euro "interchange  fee." The supermarket ends up with a bit less than 99 euros after a small processing  fee. MasterCard itself doesn't collect anything from interchange  fees. It makes its money through other fees.

Although banks are free to negotiate their own interchange  fees, they usually  charge the default  fee set by the card company, on average around 1%. Retailers say they are powerless to change that. Furniture titan Ikea says the percentage-based  fees mean it is more efficient for its stores to accept cash instead of cards. United Kingdom supermarket operator Tesco PLC says it pays GBP 100 million, or about $200 million, a year in card  fees.

EU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes called the decision a "Christmas present" for shoppers, predicting they will see lower prices at the register. Still, Mrs. Kroes left the door open for  MasterCard to lower its fees, but not end them. An interchange  fee, "in principle, is nothing to be against," she said. Under EU competition law,  MasterCard could apply for an exemption from the cartel rules if it demonstrates that the fees are necessary, and that consumers see benefits from them.

Indeed, Visa Europe has had such an exemption since 2002. Under an EU-approved plan, it has lowered its interchange  fees over time. But that exemption expires at the end of this month, and Mrs. Kroes promised to "reinvestigate Visa" after the new year. Visa Europe defended interchange  fees, but said the MasterCard case doesn't apply to its own practices.

In the U.S., Visa and  MasterCard have faced suits from retailers alleging the card networks violate American antitrust laws, but the cases haven't been resolved. Interchange  fees have been drawing scrutiny from the U.S. government, with congressional lawmakers holding hearings and the Justice Department's antitrust division investigating the  fees. The EU case doesn't affect American Express Co., which operates a so-called three-party system. Both cardholder and merchant deal directly with American Express without interchange  fees.

New front-month February crude settled $1.16 or 1.29 per cent higher at $91.24 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.

2005.
LONDON METAL EXCHANGE

Copper was capped in ranges on Wednesday as liquidity dried up ahead of the end-year holidays and as worries about future demand dampened sentiment.

Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange ended the day at $6,515 per tonne, from $6,380 at the close on Thursday.
Prices ticked up after earlier weakness, but market watchers believe the rise might not be sustainable. Copper and aluminium peaked in May last year, zinc and nickel are down over 50 per cent since their
record highs and lead has dropped some 35 per cent since its top in October.

One of the main reasons behind the falls has been an increase in LME stocks or the price, particularly zinc, has fallen in anticipation of a rise in mine production.
Chinese importers are reducing yearly bookings for refined copper for delivery in 2008 amid fears that
Beijing's economic tightening will crimp demand, traders said.
Worries over softer exports of copper tubes and pipes due to the weak property market in the United
States were also cutting term imports.

LME aluminium ticked up $17 to $2,428. The light metal, used in the automotive and packaging industries, has been seen as the laggard of the complex with upward potential as prices are trading just above the cost of production.
Zinc fell $7 to $2,308 after shedding 46 per cent this year.

Lead gained $71 to $2,526 and tin was untraded but quoted at $16,150/16,160 from $16,000/16,025.
Nickel, the key ingredient in stainless steel, was up $750 at $26,650.

LME nickel stocks have doubled since the end of August to 47,412 tonnes as stainless steel producers have cut demand.

As financial capitals around the globe increasingly soak up cash from sovereign-wealth funds, political capitals are fretting.

Prodded by the U.S. and Europe, multilateral institutions are writing guidelines for sovereign-wealth funds that would keep the money flowing from oil nations and export-rich Asian governments. But the codes aren't likely to directly address the biggest political issue surrounding the funds: whether they will be used for strategic purposes rather than commercial ones.

TD
The growing financial importance of the SWFs, as some have taken to calling the essentially government-owned investment vehicles, was demonstrated yesterday when China Investment Corp., with about $200 billion in assets, agreed to invest about $5 billion in Morgan Stanley, which has been reeling from the global credit crunch. That followed investments from the governments of Singapore and Saudi Arabia in UBS AG of Switzerland; Abu Dhabi in Citigroup Inc.; and China in Blackstone Group's initial public offering. In all of the cases, the foreign firms took minority stakes and said they wouldn't be active in management.

it fails to comply.

MasterCard, which will appeal the ruling, says the  fees are necessary to encourage banks to issue more cards.

Retailers have long complained about these "interchange  fees," saying they eat into slim margins and raise prices for shoppers. Their EU lobbying group estimates that banks in Europe reap <euro>10 billion ($14.4 billion) a year in such  fees.

EYE ON PRICES: Inflation remains a threat, warned European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, dismissing calls for the ECB to cut interest rates to help overcome the credit crisis. "We have to do our job, and our job is to deliver price stability," Mr. Trichet told the European Parliament's committee for economic and monetary affairs. Mr. Trichet said the ECB stands ready to counter inflation risks with interest-rate increases if higher prices for fuel and food result in excessive wage and industrial price spikes.

ONE-MAN FASHION SHOW: Roberto Cavalli single-handedly transformed a hand-painted knits business into one of the world's most famous fashion brands over the past four decades. But now, the designer's disdain for corporate culture is running up against a broader shift in Europe's fashion business. As juggernaut fashion conglomerates such as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton aggressively expand into new markets, the one-man shows that still make up a chunk of the Continent's fashion industry are struggling to compete.

Mr. Cavalli has been looking for an outside investor to ensure his company's survival, and he's finding it hard to let go. He recently rejected a Saudi fund's offer for a majority stake in his fashion house even though the price was far above market levels. "The offer was not worthy of my name," the designer scoffs.

Two years ago, Mr. Cavalli hired a former Calvin Klein executive to clean up the fashion house's operations. But Roberto Jorio Fili left after 13 months because Mr. Cavalli wouldn't let him make strategic decisions. Mr. Jorio Fili compares his tenure to a marriage that "was never consummated."

HD          Consumers to save Pounds 7bn a year as EU orders end of credit card fee

European consumers could save more than Pounds 7 billion a year after  MasterCard was ordered to scrap charges on cross-border credit and debit card transactions.

Describing yesterday's decision as "a nice Christmas present for all consumers in Europe", Neelie Kroes, the European Competition Commissioner, gave the company six months to comply with EU rules or face hefty  fines.

TD
After a lengthy investigation, she found so-called interchange  fee of 1 to 2 per cent that retailers have to pay for each transaction -which they pass on to customers -inflated costs and brought no benefits.
The fee applies on nearly all cross-border payments in Europe, as well to domestic payments in
Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Greece.

MasterCard sets the fee but the money goes to the banks that issue the cards; Britain's biggest issuers include Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. More than 23 billion card payments are made in the EU every year, worth more than  Euro 1.35 trillion (Pounds 965 billion).

EuroCommerce, the umbrella organisation for the six million retailers that brought the original complaint ten years ago, welcomed the decision.

Feargal Quinn, the organisation's president, said: "This is great news for all consumers in Europe. The outcome could exceed  Euro 10 billion per annum in the years ahead."

Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco's chief executive, said: "Tesco pays about Pounds 100 million in  fees to the banks for processing credit and debit cards -that's Pounds 100 million we haven't been able to invest in price, range or service for customers."

MasterCard said it would comply with the order, but would appeal to Europe's second-highest court to have it annulled. Javier Perez, president of  Mastercard  Europe, said he was "disappointed the Commission had failed to appreciate that without a mechanism to fairly share costs, consumers will
be hurt".

The Commission also criticised the level of other fees charged by the card company, saying they were among the highest in Europe. Mrs Kroes warned MasterCard not to try to make consumers foot the bill in other ways and made it clear that Visa, the other major credit company, should take yesterday's decision into account when its interchange  fee exemption ends in ten days.

HD           MasterCard Appeals Europe Rate Ruling

The European Commission in December sent a message to international card networks: Be careful what you charge merchants to accept your plastic. It could cost you.
The commission on Dec. 19 ruled MasterCard Worldwide’s “multilateral interchange” rates violate
European antitrust rules. It gave the card network six months to reduce the rates or face daily  fines of
3.5% of daily global revenues.

TD
The rates apply to  MasterCard’s credit and Maestro debit payments made outside cardholders’ home countries and for domestic payments in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Greece.

The rates “inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers without leading to any advantage for consumers or retailers,” Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for competition, said in a statement.

MasterCard said in a statement it will comply with the ruling while it appeals the decision to the
European Court of First Instance.
“Market forces, not regulation, should drive key decisions such as the setting of interchange (rates)
and retailers’ choices over which forms of payment to accept,” the statement says.
The decision, Kroes said, “does not mean all (multilateral interchange rates) are illegal.”  MasterCard
Europe sets its rate at more than 0.5% for debit and more than 1% for credit cards, Kroes said.

During a conference call Dec. 19, Javier Perez,  MasterCard Europe president, said the commission’s decision “does not provide the payment industry with clarity about what interchange fees the commission would allow.”

Visa Europe, whose antitrust exemption for multilateral interchange rates was set to expire Dec. 31, also faces scrutiny from European regulators.

Kroes called the rates a “tax on consumption” and a way to the make customers “risk paying twice for payment cards,” the first method being annual  fees and the second being the higher prices merchants charge to cover their interchange costs contained in the discount rate.

In a statement, Visa Europe said it sees “no evidence that Visa Europe’s interchange has acted as a tax on consumption or has caused consumers to pay twice.”

Gwenn Bézard, research director for U.S.-based Aite Group LLC, says the  commission’s decision on MasterCard’s rates “spells trouble for both Visa and  MasterCard, but I’d say probably even more for Visa because in its previous deal it has de facto recognized that there was something wrong with the interchange (because) it agreed to reduce it.”

Bézard says the decision could impede the ambition behind the Single  Euro Payments Area, a
cross-border payment scheme that was scheduled to begin Jan. 1. “In effect, it creates a disincentive
for banks to embrace pan-European networks,” he says.

The ruling won praise from EuroCommerce, a Belgium-based industry group for retailers. A reduction in interchange likely would drive more small and medium-sized businesses to accept cards, says Xavier Durieu, the group’s CEO.
The National Retail Federation, which represents U.S. retailers, expressed a similar view.

“European authorities say  MasterCard is double-dipping in Europe, and that’s exactly what we think both MasterCard and Visa are doing here in the U.S.,” Mallory Duncan, the federation’s general counsel, said in a statement. “These  fees drive up the cost of merchandise for shoppers while delivering little, if any, benefit commensurate with the billions  charged.” (c) 2008 Cards&Payments and SourceMedia, Inc.

HD         Politics, Corporate  Shifts Could Drive Change In 2008

The worldwide payments industry in 2008 is facing a year of unprecedented growth opportunities and possible upheavals, as economic and political pressures converge with new technological and competitive developments in key markets.

The competitive landscape for payment companies is undergoing a major shift. Visa soon will join MasterCard Worldwide, American Express Co. and Discover Financial Services LLC as an independent, public entity. Moreover, several key mandates for new payment standards and technologies kick in this year, promising to melt borders around the globe.

TD
Hot topics for the year are likely to include downward pressure on interchange  fees, legal and regulatory pressures, and the spread of new payment technologies.
Cards&Payments takes a look at some issues that likely will affect the global payments industry in
2008:
Shifting Allegiances

The biggest competitive development of 2008 likely will be Visa Inc.’s initial public offering, which Visa expects will occur during the first quarter. And card networks that already are public are expected to have a busy year as well.

“I expect Visa to be more aggressive in cutting deals with new partners when it finishes its IPO because its agenda will shift from satisfying its member banks to pleasing its shareholders,” says Judson Murchie, an analyst with the Boston-based financial research firm Aite Group.

Analysts also are bullish on  MasterCard’s prospects this year, especially in Europe. “  MasterCard is well-positioned for growth in 2008 because it derives more than half its revenues from outside the U.S., which will help shield it against a recession there. And it is well-situated to boost its share of transactions on its Maestro network in Europe, as [the Single  Euro Payments Area] unfolds,” says Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with New York-based Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Discover Financial Services LLC, after writing off steep losses last year from its Goldfish card operation, forecasts a turnaround in the United Kingdom-based unit. But its weak stock price and vulnerability in a recession could set it up for takeover, analysts say.

AmEx may consider entering the debit market this year or next year, predicts Gwenn Bézard, an Aite Group analyst. “There is a huge generational shift by younger card users to debit, and I don’t see AmEx shying away from it forever,” he says. AmEx denies any plans to enter the debit market.
Interchange
The worldwide battle over interchange is expected to heat up throughout the year. Some countries’
governments are considering regulating rates. In some cases, they already have done so. In the U.S.,

merchants are lobbying the government get involved by capping or regulating rates, which continue to rise incrementally.

The Merchant Payments Coalition, which represents several major U.S. retailer groups including the National Retail Federation, claims that U.S. card issuers are collecting as much as $36 billion per year in interchange fees, an amount merchants say is excessive. Banks and payment companies disagree with the estimate but say revenue from interchange, which equates to just less than 2% of each sale, is necessary to manage risk and to support the card-payment system and infrastructure.

A resolution this year in the U.S. merchant class-action litigation that alleges Visa,  MasterCard and some of their member banks colluded in setting interchange rates could go a long way toward deciding the future of interchange in the U.S., says K. Craig Wildfang, lead counsel for the plaintiffs and a partner with Minneapolis-based Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi LLP.

The fact-discovery phase of the case should be completed in June, and lawyers close to the case speculate that the defendants may settle this year. If not, the case likely would go to trial next year in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

In Europe, merchants gripe that the interchange rates Visa and MasterCard set (about 1% of the sale there) are superfluous, while the payment networks warn that fees are essential to maintaining the integrity of the payment networks. In November, top executives from 14 European retail groups sent a letter to the European  Commission urging it to fix a “malfunctioning credit card system” by abolishing interchange rates “in their current form.”

The commission ruled in late December that  MasterCard’s European cross-border interchange rates violate antitrust rules.  MasterCard must decrease its interchange rates for cross-border credit and Maestro debit transactions in the European Zone by June or face  fines. MasterCard said it will comply while it appeals the ruling, acknowledging that the appeals process could take years.

Although the  commission’s ruling affects only 5% of  MasterCard’s transaction volume in Europe, it sets an alarming precedent for government intervention in interchange, says Javier Perez, president of MasterCard Europe. During a conference call with analysts last month, Perez said he fears issuers’ loss of interchange revenue caused by the ruling could reduce incentives for financial institutions to invest in implementing SEPA, an initiative to unite up to 31 countries in a single  euro payments area and standardize cross-border  euro payments among nations in the European Union.

“We are disappointed that the  commission has failed to appreciate that, without a mechanism to share costs among all participants in a payment system that functions across Europe and around the world, consumers will likely be hurt," he said.

All eyes also are watching to see how the struggle over interchange plays out Down Under, where the Reserve Bank of Australia in 2003 ordered interchange rates to be cut nearly in half, from 0.95% of the sale to 0.55%.

In April, the Reserve Bank expects to release a highly anticipated review of its payment-system reforms, which will include input from issuers and merchants.

“Indications so far suggest that the government’s move to slash interchange rates in Australia did not result in disaster, as some had predicted,” says Alan Frankel, senior vice president with Lexecon, a Chicago-based consultancy, who spoke on the topic at a recent conference in Australia. “Visa and MasterCard had used extreme rhetoric to warn of a ‘death spiral’ in Australia’s payments infrastructure if interchange  fees were cut. But that didn’t happen, and the marketplace is working just  fine.”

MasterCard and Visa declined to comment on interchange issues. But Bruce Harting, an analyst for New York-based Lehman Brothers, noted in a report late in 2007 that interchange rates are flat or are declining in every major country in the world except the U.S.

Because acquirers pay issuers interchange, slashing interchange rates would affect issuers more than card networks, which generate much of their revenue from switch  fees. “Interchange may represent more than 10% of an issuer’s card-related  fee income,” Harting wrote. “Regulating interchange may also have an indirect impact on networks’ revenues depending on the impact on issuers and cardholders.”
Political, Legal Pressures

In the U.S., a presidential election year like this one means candidates will latch onto hot-button topics such as credit card-industry practices, which were the subject of several congressional investigations and hearings in 2007.

Page 87 of 89 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
On the campaign trail, Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama is advocating passage of a Credit Card Bill of Rights, which would crack down on a host of issuer practices, including making rate changes to existing agreements and charging interest on transaction  fees.

Former Sen. John Edwards, another Democratic candidate for president, is touting a proposed Borrower’s Security Act, which would ban various issuer practices including universal default. Edwards also wants to create a Family Savings and Credit  Commission to ensure financial-services providers treat consumers fairly.

Legal issues simmering for U.S. issuers this year include Visa Inc.’s $2.25 billion settlement late last year with American Express Co. in an antitrust lawsuit dating from 2004 that could trigger additional settlements this year in related disputes.

AmEx filed its antitrust suit against Visa and  MasterCard after the U.S. Department of Justice won its antitrust case that found that the card brands illegally banned their members from issuing AmEx and Discover cards. Discover filed its own, similar suit, which is pending. Now that a benchmark for damages has been established,  MasterCard soon may settle with AmEx, and both Visa and MasterCard also may settle with Discover, legal experts say.
New Technology

A plethora of new technologies is changing the physical processes of payments, and that trend could gain momentum this year around the globe.

Coinciding with the adoption of SEPA, many European countries will adopt the chip-and-PIN EMV standard for payment cards. By 2010 nearly all consumers’  MasterCard and Visa cards in Europe and Canada are expected to comply with the standard, according to a report by Montreal-based KPMG LLP.

Contactless-payment technology also has become increasingly widespread and is gradually gaining acceptance with consumers. In a recent survey conducted by KRC Research on behalf of  MasterCard,
49% of the world’s consumers said they likely would use a contactless card if their financial institution provides it.

Mobile banking also is on the rise, as more consumers are using their cell phones to check their bank accounts. A small, but growing, number of consumers in Asia, Europe and the U.S. use mobile phones to initiate and receive payments. But widespread adoption of mobile payments is still four or five years away, says Red Gillen, an analyst with Boston-based Celent.

From a base of about 1 million mobile-banking customers at the end of 2007, Gillen expects the U.S. mobile-banking market to expand to double-digit millions this year on its path to reaching 17 million U.S. households by 2010.

“Europe and Asia are far ahead of the U.S. in testing mobile payments, but as mobile banking spreads in every market, development of mobile payments will follow. And I expect within four or five years it will be widespread globally,” Gillen says.

Regardless of the way the economic and political winds shift, this year will bring significant change and opportunity for many payment companies. (c) 2008 Cards&Payments and SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights Reserved. http://www.cardforum.com http://www.sourcemedia.com
