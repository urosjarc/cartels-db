Brussels (dpa) - The European Union slapped multi-million euro fines on three leading world banks on
Tuesday for operating two cartels on financial market derivatives, in breach of EU competition law.

In one case, the European CommissionfinedJP Morgan 61.6 million euros (81 million dollars) for colluding with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to rig the Libor interest rate benchmark for the  Swiss franc between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
RBS blew the whistle on the  cartel, avoiding a fine.

Suspicions about rate-rigging date back to the 2008 financial crisis. The Libor benchmark serves as a reference for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

In December last year, six financial institutions were  fined an overall 1.7 billion euros for manipulating interest-rate benchmarks.

In a separate case Tuesday, the EU's executive found that RBS, JP Morgan, UBS and Credit Suisse had colluded over another rate influencing the price of  derivatives traded in Swiss francs.
The fine was again waived for RBS. The other three banks face a joint penalty of 32.3 million euros.

The commission found that the four banks were manipulating the so-called bid-ask spread for the  Swiss franc. This is the difference between the prices at which traders are willing to buy and sell a given product.

"The aim of the agreement was to lower the [banks'] own transaction costs ... while trying to impose wider spreads on third parties," the commission wrote.

In both cases, the financial institutions settled with the EU's executive, avoiding potentially higher penalties.

By Tom Fairless
BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan was  fined more than EUR72 million by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate  cartel in derivatives linked to the  Swiss franc.
Two other banks, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG, were also  fined by the EU for operating a
cartel for Swiss franc derivatives.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group was involved in both cartels but escaped  fines because it revealed their existence to the  European Commission, the EU's central antitrust regulator, the Commission said.

The fines represent the latest stage of a series of probes by the EU into alleged market abuse by financial institutions.
"We have imposed total  fines of about EUR94 million on four major international banks who violated EU
antitrust rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.

The fines are small in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion  fine against six financial companies handed down in December by the EU, which accused them of operating cartels to rig the yen London interbank offered rate and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.

Market Talk:
Unipetrol to Swing into Profit in 3Q on Solid Sales

1412 GMT Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) is expected to swing into net profit of 790 million koruna ($36.5 million) in 3Q from a net loss of CZK130M a year earlier, according to four analysts polled by Wall Street Journal. The rebound is due to higher sales and profit margins in its crude refining unit Ceska Rafinerska. Earlier this year the company bought out a minority stake in the refiner from Royal Dutch Shell. 3Q revenue is seen up 29% on the year at CZK32.10B. "We expect sales volumes both in the refining and petrochemical segments grew due to an increase in operating capacity after the acquisition of Shell's stake in Ceska Rafinerska," says Bohumil Trampota, analyst at J&T Bank
Credit Suisse Downgrades N Brown to Neutral

1348 GMT Positive signs are needed from N Brown Group (BWNG.LN) says Credit Suisse, following the clothing catalog firm's weak guidance at the 1H results earlier this month. Credit Suisse downgrades N Brown to neutral from outperform and slashes the price target to 330p from 518p. The brokerage drops its 2015 sales growth forecast down to 1.6% from 5.9% and 2015 EPS forecast is cut to 24.6p from
28.4p. Sees N Brown trading at a 5% discount to its retail peers. Warns that 2H forecasts remain demanding. The company's investment plans for the year are on track says Credit Suisse--pressure to start showing benefits from these are mounting. Shares are 1.2% higher at 314p.
Quindell's New Insurance Deal Cheers Investors

1215 GMT Good news for investors in professional services and digital solutions provider Quindell PLC (QPP.LN) as the shares jump on news of an exclusive five-year contract with one of Canada's top three insurers. The un-named insurer represents over 3 million customers, 1,700 brokers and has a significant market share of the Canadian automobile insurance market. "Quindell continues to trade on an undemanding multiple of 2.5x FY14 earnings, a significant discount to other software participants in the market. We reiterate our buy recommendation with a 700p target price," say analysts at Daniel Stewart & Co. House broker Canaccord Genuity believes the insurer is Aviva PLC's (AV.LN) Canadian arm. Quindell shares trade 10.3% higher at 155p.
Tesco Mkt Share Keeps Dropping,but More Slowly
1155 GMT [Dow Jones]--Troubled U.K. retail giant Tesco (TSCO.LN) got what passes for good news
Tuesday, as Kantar Worldpanel reported the grocer's U.K. sales fell a steep 3.6% year-over-year in the
12 weeks ended Oct. 12. The good part: That was Tesco's slowest rate of decline since June, Kantar
said. Tesco's still-leading U.K. market share fell to 28.8% in the period from 30.1% a year earlier. The
high-low squeeze confronting the company stayed in place, with upscale grocer Waitrose and
discounters Aldi and Lidl all turning in strong market-share gains. Tesco reports its delayed
fiscal-first-half results Thursday, when it also plans to update investors on the investigation into its
GBP250 million ($403.7 million) overstatement of its forecast profit for that period. Shares were up 2.1%
to 183 pence in midday London trading.
Investors Finally Getting Excited About Buying RBS Stakes

1128 GMT Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS.LN) is being fawned over. The U.K. 80% state-owned lender was bailed out with GBP45.5 billion in tax payer money in 2008. Now UKFI, the government group expected to orchestrate its re-privatization, says investors are (finally) getting excited about buying
stakes in the lender. Oliver Holbourn, head of capital markets at UKFI told lawmakers that his team had met with JPMorgan's advisors five times last month. However he noted several uncertainties still hang over the bank, mainly over the cost of conduct issues and how well the bank's corporate and institutional business holds up. Also there is the share price: RBS trades at 360p. The government breakeven is at around 500p.

Royal Bank of Scotland has avoided a  fine from the European Commission after it blew the whistle on a cartel to rig the  Swiss franc Libor rate.
The bank admitted it acted alongside JP Morgan in distorting the pricing of interest rate  derivatives
between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
They have agreed to settle the case with the Commission, resulting in a  fine of 61.7 million euros (£48.6 million) for JP Morgan but immunity for RBS as it had revealed the existence of the  cartel. The penalty for the taxpayer-backed bank would have been 110 million euros (£87 million).

The Commission also imposed  fines of 32.3 million euros (£25.5 million) on JP Morgan, UBS and Credit Suisse after the banks and RBS were found to have agreed an element of the pricing on certain Swiss franc derivatives.
The Commission said this allowed the banks to flout the market at their competitors' expense.

In December, RBS was among eight banks to agree penalties with the  European Commission over allegations they formed cartels to fix two key benchmark interest rates.
It paid 391 million euros (£325 million) for its role in the attempted rigging of the Yen Libor and Euribor
- the Tokyo and euro area equivalents of the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
In February 2013 RBS agreed settlements worth £391 million with regulators in the UK and United
States over its role in the Libor rate-rigging scandal.

Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said today's settlement was the third case where the Commission has identified a  cartel related to the manipulation of a financial benchmark in which major banks colluded instead of competing with each other.

He added: "Our economy needs a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced."

The bank said: "RBS condemn the behaviour by a small number of employees identified in today's announcement by the  European Commission.

"These offences were unacceptable and have no place in the RBS we are building. Once they were uncovered management took swift action to notify our European competition regulator with the aim of quickly resolving this matter."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - JPMorgan <JPM.N>, UBS <UBSN.VX> and Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> were fined a total of 94 million euros ($120 million) by the  European Commission for taking part in cartels in the financial sector.

The Commission handed JPMorgan a 61.7-million-euro  fine for rigging the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009. It was also fined 10.5 million euros for participating in a  cartel on Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives.

TD
UBS' penalty in the  derivatives cartel came to 12.7 million euros and that of Credit Suisse was 9.2 million euros. Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> alerted the Commission about both cartels and escaped total  fines of 115 million euros.

The penalties are the latest by the European Commission, which along with authorities around the world, has handed down billions of euros in fines against top banks for rate-rigging, breaking trade sanctions and other misbehavior.

"Acting against financial cartels is one of our top priorities, given the importance of a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector for the entire economy," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

The EU competition watchdog said the banks in the interest rate  derivatives cartel agreed to collectively fix a pricing element which should have been determined by the market, between May and September 2007 with the aim of preventing rivals from competing on the same terms.
All the banks admitted wrongdoing in return for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines.

HD     4 Banks Fined For Swiss Franc Interest Rate Derivatives Cartel

(RTTNews) - The European Commission has found that four international banks, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse, operated a cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives in the European Economic Area (EEA).

The Commission imposed  fines worth a total of EUR32,355,000 on these banks. RBS received immunity from fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. UBS and JPMorgan received reductions of their respective  fines for cooperating with the investigation under the Commission's 2006
Leniency Notice. All four banks received a 10 percent reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the
Commission.

TD
EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy, Joaquín Almunia, said: "Unlike in previous cartels we found in the financial sector, this one did not involve any collusion on a benchmark. Rather, the four banks agreed on an element of the price of certain financial  derivatives. This way, the banks involved could flout the market at their competitors' expense. Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not
be tolerated."

Interest rate  derivatives are financial products that are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. The so-called "bid-ask spread" is the difference between the price at which a market maker is willing to sell and to buy a given product.

The Commission's investigation disclosed that between May and September 2007, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse agreed to quote to all third parties wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of short term over-the-counter  Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives, whilst maintaining narrower spreads for trades amongst themselves. The aim of the agreement was to lower the parties' own transaction costs
and maintain liquidity between them whilst seeking to impose wider spreads on third parties. Another objective of the collusion was to prevent other market players from competing on the same terms as these four major players in the  Swiss franc derivatives market.

HD      1ST LEAD EU fines large investment banks for collusion By Helen Maguire, dpa

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union slapped multi-million euro fines on three leading world banks on
Tuesday for operating two cartels on financial market derivatives, in breach of EU competition law.

In one case, the European CommissionfinedJP Morgan 61.6 million euros (81 million dollars) for colluding with the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to rig the Libor interest rate benchmark for the  Swiss     franc between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
RBS blew the whistle on the  cartel, avoiding a fine.
Suspicions about rate-rigging date back to the 2008 financial crisis.
The Libor benchmark serves as a reference for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

In December last year, six financial institutions were  fined an overall 1.7 billion euros for manipulating interest-rate benchmarks.

In a separate case Tuesday, the EU's executive found that RBS, JP Morgan, UBS and Credit Suisse had colluded over another rate influencing the price of  derivatives traded in Swiss francs.
The fine was again waived for RBS. The other three banks face a joint penalty of 32.3 million euros. "Following consultations with the  European Commission, Credit Suisse decided to resolve this matter in
a settlement in order to avoid protracted legal proceedings," the bank said.
UBS did not comment on the  fine.

The commission found that the four banks were manipulating the so-called bid-ask spread for the  Swiss franc. This is the difference between the prices at which traders are willing to buy and sell a given product.

"The aim of the agreement was to lower the [banks'] own transaction costs ... while trying to impose wider spreads on third parties," the commission wrote.

In both cases, the financial institutions settled with the EU's executive, avoiding potentially higher penalties.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined a total of more than EUR72 million ($92 million) by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss     Franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks-- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG--had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest rate derivatives between May and September 2007. UBS was  fined EUR12.7 million for participating in the cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay EUR9.2 million.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective
fines, the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," Mr. Almunia said. RBS avoided  fines of around EUR115 million because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms' Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss Franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank had decided to settle the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have levied some EUR6 billion in  fines against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

Tuesday's  fines pales in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December, for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Société Générale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd, a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. Last year the commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives. The bloc is also investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

Royal Bank of Scotland to fix the Libor benchmark rate for the  Swiss franc.

Libor, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, is the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans.

The EU executive also found that JP Morgan operated a  cartel with RBS and Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse to influence  derivatives on financial markets. Together the banks - excluding RBS, which got off scot free for alerting the Commission to the scams - face a joint penalty of 32.3 million euros.
EU chasing banks hard on misdeeds
The European Commission has been coming down hard on banks which have cheated markets.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia slammed the lenders as one more example of major banks colluding with each other "instead of competing."

He said antitrust regulations had to be strictly enforced in the financial sector because the economy needs it to be "healthy and transparent."

The Royal Bank of Scotland, which was a part of the schemes, would have faced charges of 110 million euros had it not blown the whistle on the  cartel.

JP Morgan's  fine was reduced for cooperating with the investigation. It is not the bank's first penalty: only a year ago it reached a $13 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in the sub-prime mortgage disaster, which precipitated the global financial crisis in 2008.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined a total of more than EUR72 million ($92 million) by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss     Franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks-- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG--had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest rate derivatives between May and September 2007. UBS was  fined EUR12.7 million for participating in the cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay EUR9.2 million.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective
fines, the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," Mr. Almunia said. RBS avoided  fines of around EUR115 million because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms' Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss Franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank had decided to settle the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have levied some EUR6 billion in  fines against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

Tuesday's  fines pales in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December, for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Société Générale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd, a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. Last year the commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives. The bloc is also investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

(RTTNews) - The  European Commission on Tuesday finedJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co (JPM) a total of about 72 million euros for its involvement in rigging an international financial benchmark and for participating in a  cartel for Swiss franc derivative.

The Commission finedJ.P. Morgan 61.7 million euros on charges that the bank and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS, RBS.L) together manipulated the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
The Commission also said four international bank - J.P. Morgan, RBS, UBS (UBS), and Crédit Suisse (CS) - operated a  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate derivatives in the European Economic Area between May and September 2007. The Commission imposed fines worth a total of 32.4 million euros on this account; J.P. Morgan was  fined 10.5 million euros, UBS 12.7 million euros, and Credit Suisse 9.2 million euros.

The aim of banks involved in the  cartel was to lower the parties' own transaction costs and maintain liquidity between them while seeking to impose wider spreads on third parties.

Another objective of the collusion was to prevent other market players from competing on the same terms as these four major players in the  Swiss franc derivatives market.
RBS avoided  fines of 115 million euros because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines. JPM is trading at $57.73, up $1.10 or 1.94%, on a volume of 6 million shares on the NYSE.

Opinion: Banks that err, regulators that miss and fall short

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Tuesday offered a good lesson in the dysfunction of Wall Street regulation both here and abroad.

TD
First, the European Commissionannounced a $92 million fine against J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM, US) for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate  cartel for Swiss franc        derivatives. It’s a probe that’s already ensnared Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS, US) , Credit Suisse Group (CS, US) and UBS AG (UBS, US) .

Then a federal inspector found that the embattled New York Federal Reserve Bank failed to properly investigate the unit responsible from the “London whale” trading fiasco in 2012. That debacle has led to roughly $6 billion in losses for J.P. Morgan, and well over $1 billion in  fines and legal expenses at the country’s biggest bank by assets.

The EU case is notable because while there is a financial penalty, J.P. Morgan is able to argue it isn’t guilty of rigging. A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal, the settlement “makes no finding” that the bank’s management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, “or that the trader’s actions had any impact on the firms’  Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published Swiss Franc Libor rates.”
In essence, J.P. Morgan is just paying the  fine to move on and avoid litigation.

If that’s so, it’s like paying a parking ticket, except that the alleged behavior is a serious breach of market fair play and the law.

The federal inspector’s “whale” findings are just depressing. The  report offers a raft of excuses: a reorganization the previous year, too many regulatory demands, improper planning — to name a few. Yes, it’s tough being a regulator.

That J.P. Morgan is at the center of these actions isn’t to single them out. Regulators have missed mortgage securities fraud, overlooked risk — heck, they even missed Bernie Madoff for more than a decade.
For banks and their regulators some lessons are never learned.

HD            4 Banks, Including JPMorgan,  Fined in Europe Over ‘Cartel’ Behavior

LONDON – The  European Commission on Tuesday fined four major financial institutions 93.9 million euros, or about $120 million, over two types of activity that it deemed as  cartel behavior.

In one case, the European Commissionfined JPMorgan Chase €61.7 million euros for manipulating the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate in an “illegal bilateral cartel” with the Royal Bank of Scotland. R.B.S., however, was granted immunity and avoided a fine of €110 million after it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.

TD
“Anti-cartel enforcement is a top priority for the commission and no sector is exempt, including the financial sector,” the European Union said in a statement.

Interest-rate  derivatives – such as forward rate agreements, swaps, futures and options – are financial products intended to help manage interest-rate fluctuations. In December 2013, the European Unionfined several global financial institutions a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.

JPMorgan received a 40 percent reduction in its  fine for cooperating with the investigation, as well as a 10 percent reduction for agreeing to settle the case. Regulators accused R.B.S. and JPMorgan of trying to distort the process used to price interest rate  derivatives that were in francs from March
2008 through July 2009.

They discussed future rate submissions for Libor tied to the franc and, at times, exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices, regulators said.
JPMorgan said it had cooperated fully with the  European Commission throughout the investigation. “The settlement makes no finding that JPMorgan Chase management, or any other JPMorgan Chase
employee, had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue, or that the trader’s actions had
any impact on the firms’  Swiss franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss franc Libor rates,”
the bank said in a statement.

In a separate  settlement also announced on Tuesday, the European Commission said R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, operated a  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest-rate derivatives, imposing fines worth a total of €32.4 million. R.B.S. avoided fines of €5 million on this case for bringing the activity to the commission’s attention.

European regulators said that from May to September 2007, R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse agreed to quote to clients wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of franc interest-rate  derivatives. The banks maintained narrower spreads for trades among themselves.

The aim was to lower the banks’ transaction costs and continue the flow of trades between themselves while preventing others from participating on the same terms in the franc  derivatives market. Unlike in previous cartels in the financial sector, this one was not about colluding to set a

benchmark but rather about the banks agreeing on a wider bid-ask spread for the price of a particular financial derivative.

“Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated,” said Joaquín Almunia, the commission vice president in charge of competition policy.

In the second case, UBS paid the largest fine of €12.7 million, while JPMorgan paid a  fine of €10.5 million. Credit Suisse paid a €9.2 million fine. UBS’s  fines were reduced by 30 percent after it cooperated in the case, while JPMorgan’s fines were cut 25 percent and Credit Suisse did not get a reduction. All the banks got a 10 percent discount for settling with the commission.

UBS declined to comment on Tuesday. Credit Suisse said it decided to settle the case “in order to avoid lengthy legal proceedings.”

Global financial institutions have paid more than $6 billion in  fines over manipulating benchmark rates.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined a total of more than EUR72 million ($92 million) by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss     Franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks-- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG--had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest rate derivatives between May and September 2007. UBS was  fined EUR12.7 million for participating in the cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay EUR9.2 million.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective
fines, the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," Mr. Almunia said. RBS avoided  fines of around EUR115 million because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms'  Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss Franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank had decided to settle the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have levied some EUR6 billion in  fines against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

Tuesday's  fines pales in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December, for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Société Générale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd, a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. Last year the commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives. The bloc is also investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

HD        Brussels fines global banks €94m for their part in two cartels

LP
The European Commission has handed out another round of multimillion euro  fines on several global banks, which agreed to pay a total of €94m in penalties for participating in two distinct cartels involving interest rate products denominated in Swiss francs.

JPMorgan Chase was forced to pay the highest sum, €61.6m, for the first  cartel aimed at influencing the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
The second lender involved, Royal Bank of Scotland, received immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to Europe's top competition authority.

Tuesday's settlement is the EU's third  cartel probe into the rigging of interbank lending rates; the commission issued a record €1.7bn combined  fine in December last year to six banks for colluding to manipulate the Japan-focused Yen Libor benchmark and its European sister Euribor.

The EU's settlements raised the total tally for benchmark manipulation to more than $6bn, a sum that is expected to increase further as regulators conclude investigations and as private lawsuits - up to 50 in the US alone - stack up.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition chief, said: "Our economy needs a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced."

The second cartel uncovered by the commission colluded to set bid-ask spreads charged on  Swiss      franc interest rate  derivatives. Three banks paid a collective  fine of €32.3m, with UBS hit with €12.6m, JPMorgan €10.5m and Credit Suisse €9.2m. RBS again secured immunity after alerting the commission to the wrongdoing.

Mr Almunia said the  cartel involved agreeing on the element of the price of certain  derivatives, rather than manipulating a benchmark. "This way, the banks involved could flout the market at their competitors' expense. Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," he said.
The case is not connected to the Libor benchmark rigging allegations of the first  cartel.

Credit Suisse, which has in the past stressed that it does not expect a material impact from global regulatory investigations into Libor rigging, said: "Following discussions with the  EU Commission, Credit Suisse has decided to settle this case . . . in order to avoid lengthy legal proceedings."

RBS, the state-owned lender, is the only institution subject to every one of the commission's financial benchmark investigations. It has paid €391m for taking part in Euribor and Yen Libor cartels.

The Commission's two-year probe into Yen Libor and Euribor found up to 11 institutions were involved in the cartels. After holding out against a settlement, HSBC, JPMorgan and Crédit Agricole are defending themselves against Commission charges that they participated in a  cartel to manipulate the Euribor interest rate benchmark.

Tuesday's settlement comes as some of the largest banks globally are bracing themselves for the next round of costly  fines in a similar scandal involving benchmark-rigging allegations in the $5.3tn a day foreign exchange market.
The UK's financial regulator is already in talks with six banks over a possible total penalty of up to
£1.5bn, while the US Department of Justice is separately negotiating with UBS over a settlement.

The European Commission is also investigating the forex market but it has yet to launch a formal probe.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan was  fined more than EUR72 million by European Union regulators
Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate  cartel in derivatives linked to
the Swiss franc.
Two other banks, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG, were also  fined by the EU for operating a
cartel for Swiss franc derivatives.

TD
Royal Bank of Scotland Group was involved in both cartels but escaped  fines because it revealed their existence to the  European Commission, the EU's central antitrust regulator, the Commission said.

The fines represent the latest stage of a series of probes by the EU into alleged market abuse by financial institutions.
"We have imposed total  fines of about EUR94 million on four major international banks who violated
EU antitrust rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.

The fines are small in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion  fine against six financial companies handed down in December by the EU, which accused them of operating cartels to rig the yen London interbank offered rate and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined a total of more than EUR72 million ($92 million) by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss     Franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks-- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG--had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest rate derivatives between May and September 2007. UBS was  fined EUR12.7 million for participating in the cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay EUR9.2 million.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective
fines, the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," Mr. Almunia said. RBS avoided  fines of around EUR115 million because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms' Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss Franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank had decided to settle the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have levied some EUR6 billion in  fines against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

Tuesday's  fines pales in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December, for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Société Générale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd, a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. Last year the commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives. The bloc is also investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

BRUSSELS-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined a total of more than EUR72 million ($92 million) by European Union regulators Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss    Franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks-- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG--had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest rate derivatives between May and September 2007. UBS was  fined EUR12.7 million for participating in the cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay EUR9.2 million.
All banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective
fines, the EU's antitrust chief Joaqu&#237;n Almunia said in a statement.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," Mr. Almunia said. RBS avoided  fines of around EUR115 million because it revealed the existence of the cartels.
A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms'  Swiss Franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss Franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank had decided to settle the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have levied some EUR6 billion in  fines against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

Tuesday's  fines pales in comparison with the record EUR1.71 billion penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December, for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd, a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. Last year the commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives. The bloc is also investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

HD          RBS avoids Libor fixing fine, but JP Morgan hit for £48.6m

ROYAL Bank of Scotland has avoided a fine from the European Commission after blowing the whistle on a cartel to rig the Swiss franc Libor rate.

The Ulster Bank parent company bank admitted it acted alongside JP Morgan in distorting the pricing of interest rate  derivatives between 2008 and 2009.

TD
They have agreed to settle the case with the commission, resulting in a fine of €61.7m (£48.6m) for JP Morgan but immunity for RBS as it had revealed the existence of the cartel. The penalty for the taxpayer-backed bank would have been €110m (£87m).

The commission also imposed  fines of €32.3m (£25.5m) on JP Morgan, UBS and Credit Suisse after the banks and RBS were found to have agreed an element of the pricing on certain  Swiss franc          derivatives. The Commission said this allowed the banks to flout the market at competitors' expense.

In December, RBS was among eight banks to agree penalties with the  European Commission over allegations they formed cartels to fix two key benchmark interest rates.

It paid €391m (£325m) for its role in the attempted rigging of the Yen Libor and Euribor — the Tokyo and euro-area equivalents of the Libor rate.

In February 2013, RBS agreed settlements worth £391m with regulators in the UK and the US over its role in the Libor rate-rigging scandal.

Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said the settlement was the third case where the commission had identified a  cartel related to the manipulation of a financial benchmark in which major banks colluded instead of competing with each other.
He added: "Our economy needs a healthy, transparent, functioning financial sector. "This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced."
The bank said: "RBS condemns the behaviour by a small number of employees identified in the announcement by the  European Commission.
"These offences were unacceptable and have no place in the RBS we are building.

"Once they were uncovered, management took swift action to notify our European competition regulator with the aim of quickly resolving this matter."

£87m The amount RBS would have been  fined if it had not blown the whistle on the rate rigging scandal

HD        E.U. fines 4 big banks $120 million over cartels;  Penalties are for actions  on Swiss franc Libor and interest-rate derivatives

The European Commission on Tuesday fined four major financial institutions 93.9 million euros, or about $119.9 million, over two types of activity that it deemed  cartel behavior.

In one case, the European CommissionfinedJPMorgan €61.7 million for manipulating the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate in an ‘‘illegal bilateral  cartel’’ with the Royal Bank of Scotland. R.B.S., however, was granted immunity and avoided a  fine of €110 million after it revealed the existence of the cartel to the commission.

TD
‘‘Anti-cartel enforcement is a top priority for the commission and no sector is exempt, including the financial sector,’’ the commission said in a statement.

Interest-rate  derivatives — such as forward rate agreements, swaps, futures and options — are financial products used to manage interest-rate fluctuations. In December 2013, the  European               Commissionfined a group of global financial institutions a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.
JPMorgan received a 40 percent reduction in its  fine for cooperating with the investigation, as well as a
10 percent reduction for agreeing to settle the case. Regulators accused R.B.S. and JPMorgan of trying
to distort the process used to price interest-rate  derivatives that were in Swiss francs between March
2008 and July 2009.

They discussed future rate submissions for Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, that were tied to the Swiss franc and, at times, exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices, regulators said.
JPMorgan said it had cooperated fully with the  European Commission throughout the investigation.

‘‘The settlement makes no finding that JPMorgan Chase management, or any other JPMorgan Chase employee, had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue, or that the trader’s actions had any impact on the firms’  Swiss franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss franc Libor rates,’’ the bank said in a statement.

In a separate settlement also announced on Tuesday, the European Commission said R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had operated a  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest-rate derivatives, imposing fines totaling €32.4 million. R.B.S. avoided  fines of €5 million on this case for bringing the activity to the commission’s attention.

European regulators said that from May to September 2007, R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse agreed to quote to clients wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of  Swiss franc interest-rate derivatives. The banks maintained narrower spreads for trades among themselves.

The aim was to lower the banks’ own transaction costs and continue the flow of trades among themselves while preventing others from participating on the same terms in the  Swiss franc                   derivatives market.

Unlike in previous cartels in the financial sector, this one was not about colluding to set a benchmark but rather involved the banks agreeing on a wider bid-ask spread for the price of a particular financial derivative.

‘‘Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated,’’ said Joaquín Almunia, the commission vice president in charge of competition policy.

In the second case, UBS paid the largest fine, of €12.7 million, while JPMorgan paid a  fine of €10.5 million. Credit Suisse paid a €9.2 million fine. UBS’s  fines were reduced by 30 percent after it cooperated in the case, while JPMorgan’s fines were cut by 25 percent and Credit Suisse did not get a reduction. All the banks got a 10 percent discount for settling with the commission.

UBS declined to comment on Tuesday. Credit Suisse said it decided to settle the case ‘‘in order to avoid lengthy legal proceedings.’’

Global financial institutions have paid more than $6 billion in  fines related to manipulating benchmark rates.

HD         RBS escapes fine by whistle–blowing

ROYAL Bank of Scotland has escaped a £91m  fine after blowing the whistle on a price–fixing  ring involving three other banks.

European watchdogs yesterday  finedJP Morgan, UBS and Credit Suisse a combined €94m (£74m) for cartel behaviour in rigging the price of interest rate hedging products and a Libor interest rate benchmark. RBS was involved in the cartel but escaped a fine on both counts because it blew the whistle on the activity, which related to the Swiss franc. Had it not, RBS would have faced a penalty of
€115m. "RBS was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the [European] Commission's 2006
Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel," the regulator said.

TD
The four banks were found to have colluded to set interest rate  derivatives, which are used by investors and businesses to hedge against rate changes, while RBS and JPMorgan colluded over the Swiss franc Libor benchmark, which carried a much bigger penalty.

The penalties, which relate to activity between 2007 and 2009, underline how banks' past misconduct is continuing to drag on their bottom lines as they attempt to move on from the financial crisis. JP Morgan was handed a €61.7m penalty for Libor  fixing  and €10.5m for  derivatives manipulation, over which UBS and Credit Suisse were  fined €12.7m and €9.2m respectively.
All banks, aside from Credit Suisse, received heavy discounts for cooperation.
"Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated," said EU competition chief
Joaquin Almunia.

LONDON -- The  European Commission on Tuesday fined four major financial institutions 93.9 million euros, or about $119.9 million, over two types of activity that it deemed as  cartel behavior.

In one case, the European CommissionfinedJPMorgan 61.7 million euros ($78.7 million) for manipulating the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate in an ''illegal bilateral cartel'' with the Royal Bank of Scotland. R.B.S., however, was granted immunity and avoided a fine of €110 million after revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.

TD
''Anti-cartel enforcement is a top priority for the commission and no sector is exempt, including the financial sector,'' the European Union said in a statement.

Interest-rate  derivatives -- such as forward rate agreements, swaps, futures and options -- are financial products used for managing interest-rate fluctuations. In December 2013, the European Unionfined a group of global financial institutions a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.

JPMorgan received a 40 percent reduction in its  fine for cooperating with the investigation, as well as a 10 percent reduction for agreeing to settle the case. Regulators accused R.B.S. and JPMorgan of trying to distort the process used to price interest rate  derivatives that were in francs between March
2008 and July 2009.

They discussed future rate submissions for Libor tied to the  Swiss franc and, at times, exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices, regulators said.

JPMorgan said that it had cooperated fully with the  European Commission throughout the investigation.

''The settlement makes no finding that JPMorgan Chase management, or any other JPMorgan Chase employee, had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue, or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms'  Swiss franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss franc Libor rates,''
the bank said in a statement.

In a separate settlement also announced on Tuesday, the European Commission said that R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, operated a  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest-rate derivatives, imposing fines worth a total of €32.4 million ($41.4 million). R.B.S. avoided fines of €5 million on this case for bringing the activity to the commission's attention.

European regulators said that from May to September 2007, R.B.S., UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse agreed to quote to clients wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of  Swiss franc interest-rate  derivatives. The banks maintained narrower spreads for trades among themselves.


Page 72 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The aim was to lower the banks own transaction costs and continue the flow of trades between themselves while preventing others from participating on the same terms in the  Swiss franc               derivatives market. Unlike in previous cartels in the financial sector, this one was not about colluding to set a benchmark but rather the banks agreeing on a wider bid-ask spread for the price of a particular financial derivative.

''Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated,'' said Joaquín Almunia, the commission vice president in charge of competition policy.

In the second case, UBS paid the largest fine of €12.7 million, while JPMorgan paid a  fine of €10.5 million. Credit Suisse paid a €9.2 million fine. UBS's  fines were reduced by 30 percent after it cooperated in the case, while JPMorgan's fines were cut 25 percent and Credit Suisse did not get a reduction. All the banks got a 10 percent discount for settling with the commission.

UBS declined comment on Tuesday. Credit Suisse said it decided to settle the case ''in order to avoid lengthy legal proceedings.''

Global financial institutions have paid more than $6 billion in  fines over manipulating benchmark rates.

HD     Europa- Antitrust: Commission settles cartel on bid-ask spreads charged on Swiss Franc interest rate derivatives; fines four major banks EUR 32.3 million

Release date - 21102014

The European Commission has found that four international banks, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse, operated a cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives in the European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
The Commission imposed fines worth a total of EUR 32 355 000. RBS received immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the cartel to the Commission. UBS and JPMorgan received reductions of their respective fines for cooperating with the investigation under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice. All four banks received a 10% reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Joaquin Almunia, said: ‘Unlike in previous cartels we found in the financial sector, this one did not involve any collusion on a benchmark. Rather, the four banks agreed on an element of the price of certain financial  derivatives. This way, the banks
involved could flout the market at their competitors’ expense. Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated.’

Interest rate  derivatives are financial products that are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. The so-called ‘bid-ask spread’ is the difference between the price at which a market maker is willing to sell and to buy a given product.

The Commission’s investigation disclosed that between May and September 2007, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse agreed to quote to all third parties wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of short term over-the-counter  Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives, whilst maintaining narrower spreads for trades amongst themselves. The aim of the agreement was to lower the parties’ own transaction costs
and maintain liquidity between them whilst seeking to impose wider spreads on third parties. Another objective of the collusion was to prevent other market players from competing on the same terms as these four major players in the  Swiss franc derivatives market.
The fines
The fines were set on the basis of the Commission’s 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 and
MEMO/06/256).

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the banks’ sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope and the duration.

RBS was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and thereby avoided a  fine of around EUR 5 million for its participation in the infringement. UBS and JP Morgan received a reduction of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the Commission’s leniency programme. All four banks have chosen to turn the page and agreed to settle the case with the Commission, leading to a further reduction in their fines of 10%.

Background on the products concerned

Interest rate  derivatives are financial products that are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. This case concerns certain interest rate  derivatives in the Swiss Franc currency.

The ‘bid-ask spread’ refers to the difference between the bid price and the ask quoted by a market maker (respectively the price at which the market maker is willing to buy and the price at which it is willing to sell a particular contract). Market makers hold themselves out as able and willing to buy or to sell financial products. At the time of the infringement, the four participants were market makers in short term
over-the-counter  Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives.
The settlement procedure

Today’s second decision in the  Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives sector marks the 16th settlement decision since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008 (see IP/08/1056 and MEMO/08/458). Under a settlement, companies acknowledge their participation in a  cartel infringement and their liability for it. Settlements are based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 and allow the Commission to apply a simplified procedure and thereby reduce the length of the investigation. This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs; good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker decisions and a 10% reduction in  fines.

The Commission previously reached settlements with participants in cartels for DRAMs (see IP/10/586), animal feed phosphates (see IP/10/985), washing powder (see IP/11/473), glass for cathode ray tubes (see IP/11/1214), compressors for fridges (see IP/11/1511), water management products (see IP/12/704), wire harnesses (see IP/13/673), Euro interest rate  derivatives and Yen interest rate  derivatives (see IP/13/1208), Polyurethane Foam (see IP/14/88), Power Exchanges (see IP/14/215), Bearings (see IP/14/280), Steel Abrasives (see IP/14/359) and Mushrooms (see IP/14/727).
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court and Council Regulation 1/2003 both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission fine.

In June 2014, the European Parliament approved a proposal for a Directive that aims to make it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to obtain damages for such infringements (see IP/14/455 and MEMO/14/310). The Directive is based on a proposal by the Commission of June 2013 (see IP/13/525
and MEMO/13/531). The proposal is now with the EU Council of Ministers for final approval. The text of the proposal and more information on antitrust damages actions is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/documents.html.

HD     Europa- Antitrust: Commission settles RBS-JPMorgancartel in derivatives based on Swiss franc
LIBOR; imposes  EUR 61.6 million fine on JPMorgan

Release date - 21102014

The European Commission has found that two international banks, RBS and JP Morgan, participated in an illegal bilateral cartel aimed at influencing the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
Such collusion is prohibited by EU antitrust rules. The banks agreed to settle the case with the Commission under a simplified procedure. RBS received immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the cartel to the Commission. JPMorgan was  fined EUR 61 676 000 after benefitting from a reduction of its fine for its cooperation with the investigation under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice, as well as a 10% reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Joaquin Almunia, said: ‘This is the third case where the Commission finds a  cartel related to the manipulation of a financial benchmark, in which major banks colluded instead of competing with each other. Our economy needs a healthy, transparent,
well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced.’

Interest rate  derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products used for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Between March 2008 and July 2009 RBS and JP Morgan tried to distort the normal course of the pricing of interest rate  derivatives denominated in Swiss franc. They discussed the future  Swiss Franc Libor rate submissions of one of the banks and at times exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices. The infringement covered the whole of the European Economic Area (EEA).
The fines
The fines were set on the basis of the Commission’s 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 and
MEMO/06/256).

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the banks’ sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope and its duration.

RBS was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and thereby avoided a  fine of around EUR 110 million for its participation in the infringement. JP Morgan received a reduction of its  fine for its
cooperation in the investigation under the Commission’s leniency programme. Both banks agreed to settle the case with the Commission, leading to a further reduction in  fines of 10%.

Background

Interest rate  derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products which are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. They derive their value from the level of a benchmark interest rate, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) - which is used for various currencies including the  Swiss franc (CHF). This benchmark reflects an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of banks who are members of a panel. It is intended to reflect the cost of interbank lending in Swiss franc and serves as a basis for various financial  derivatives. The levels of the benchmark rate may affect either the cash flows that a bank receives from a counterparty, or the cash flow it needs to pay to the counterparty under interest rate  derivatives contracts.

In December 2013, the Commission already  fined several banks for their participation in cartels in Euro and Yen interest rate  derivatives (see IP/13/1208). This decision is therefore the third  cartel related to a financial benchmark that the Commission has found and sanctioned. Anti-cartel enforcement is a top priority for the Commission and no sector is exempt, including the financial sector. Banks should refrain from engaging into such practices and should comply with EU competition rules.
The settlement procedure

Today’s decision is the 15th settlement since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008 (see IP/08/1056 and MEMO/08/458). Under a settlement, companies acknowledge their participation in a  cartel infringement and their liability for it. Settlements are based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 and allow the Commission to apply a simplified procedure and thereby reduce the length of the investigation. This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs; good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker decisions and a 10% reduction in  fines.

The Commission previously reached settlements with participants in cartels for DRAMs (IP/10/586), animal feed phosphates (IP/10/985), washing powder (IP/11/473), glass for cathode ray tubes (IP/11/1214), compressors for fridges (IP/11/1511), water management products (IP/12/704), wire harnesses (IP/13/673), euro and yen interest rate  derivatives (IP/13/1208), Polyurethane Foam (IP/14/88), Power Exchanges (IP/14/215), Bearings (IP/14/280), Steel Abrasives (IP/14/359) and Mushrooms (IP/14/727).

The European Commission has finedJPMorgan, UBS and Credit Suisse a total of EUR94m for taking part in cartels in the financial sector, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

JPMorgan received a EUR61.7m  fine for rigging the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009, JPMorgan was also fined EUR10.5m for taking part in a  cartel on Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives. UBS received a penalty of EUR12.7m while Credit Suisse’s fine was EUR9.2m. Royal Bank of Scotland escaped total  fines of EUR115m as it alerted the Commission about both cartels.

TD
These latest penalties handed out by the  European Commission are part of penalties handed down by authorities around the world against top banks for rate-rigging, breaking trade sanctions and other misbehaviour. All the banks involved in this most recently  fined wrongdoing were awarded a 10% reduction in their penalties for admitting their wrongdoing.

Royal Bank of Scotland has avoided a  fine from the European Commission after it blew the whistle on a
cartel to rig the  Swiss franc Libor rate.
The bank admitted it acted alongside JP Morgan in distorting the pricing of interest rate  derivatives
between March 2008 and July 2009.

TD
They have agreed to settle the case with the Commission, resulting in a fine of £48.6 million for JP Morgan but immunity for RBS as it had revealed the existence of the cartel. The penalty for the bank would have been £87 million.

The European Commission has found that four international banks, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse, operated a cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives in the European Economic Area (EEA). The Commission imposed fines worth a total of 32 355 000. RBS received immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the cartel to the Commission. UBS and JPMorgan received reductions of their respective  fines for cooperating with the investigation under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice. All four banks received a 10% reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

TD
Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Joaquín Almunia, said: "Unlike in previous cartels we found in the financial sector, this one did not involve any collusion on a benchmark. Rather, the four banks agreed on an element of the price of certain financial  derivatives. This way, the banks
involved could flout the market at their competitors' expense. Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated."

Interest rate  derivatives are financial products that are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. The so-called "bid-ask spread" is the difference between the price at which a market maker is willing to sell and to buy a given product.

The Commission's investigation disclosed that between May and September 2007, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse agreed to quote to all third parties wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of short term over-the-counter  Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives, whilst maintaining narrower spreads for trades amongst themselves. The aim of the agreement was to lower the parties' own transaction costs and maintain liquidity between them whilst seeking to impose wider spreads on third parties. Another objective of the collusion was to prevent other market players from competing on the same terms as these four major players in the  Swiss franc derivatives market.
The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on  fines.

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the banks' sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope and the duration.

RBS was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and thereby avoided a  fine of around 5 million for its participation in the infringement. UBS and JP Morgan received a reduction of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. All four banks have chosen to turn the page and agreed to settle the case with the Commission, leading to a further reduction in their fines of 10%.

The European Commission has found that two international banks, RBS and JP Morgan, participated in an illegal bilateral cartel aimed at influencing the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009.

JPMorgan was fined 61.7 million euros after benefitting from a reduction of its  fine for its cooperation with the investigation under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice, as well as a 10 per cent reduction for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission. It was also  fined 10.5 million euros for participating in a cartel on Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives.

European authorities  fined U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase more than $78 million Tuesday for manipulating an international financial benchmark and participating in a  derivatives cartel tied to the Swiss franc.

Swiss banking giants UBS and Credit Suisse were also  fined by the European Commission for their role in operating a  cartel for Swiss franc derivatives. All agreed to settle the violations.

TD
Royal Bank of Scotland was involved in both violations, but avoided  fines by disclosing the cartels to the European Commission, which investigates evidence of antitrust regulations for the European Union.

Total fines in the case, the latest in a series of EU investigations of financial manipulation, came to roughly $119 million, said Joaquin Almuna, the EU vice president in charge of monitoring competition.

"Acting against financial cartels is one of our top priorities, given the importance of a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector for the entire economy," Almuna said in a statement announcing the penalties. "All market players in this sector must be aware that no violation of antitrust rules will be tolerated."

JPMorgan said the bank fully cooperated with the EU throughout the investigation. The bank's shares closed up 2.3% at $57.93 on Tuesday.

"The settlement makes no finding that JPMorgan Chase management, or any other JPMorgan Chase employee" apart from a trader who no longer works for the bank "had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue," the bank said in a statement responding to the EU penalties.

According to the EU, the first violation involved JPMorgan and RBS collusion over  Swiss franc Libor -- the common shorthand for the London Interbank Offered Rate. Libor involves multiple currencies worldwide for varying time periods, and is used to set rates on trillions of dollars in mortgages and loans.

JPMorgan and RBS secretly colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 to rig the benchmark in an effort to distort the pricing of  derivatives indexed on it, the EU said.

The second violation focused on JPMorgan, RBS, UBS and Credit Suisse in their role as leading market makers in Swiss franc interest-rate derivatives. The banks agreed to quote wider, fixed spreads to third parties on certain categories of derivatives while maintaining narrower spreads among themselves, the EU said.

One objective of the collusion "was to prevent other players from competing on the same terms in this market," said Almuna.

The new penalties are smaller than the  fines of 1.7 billion euros ($2.2 billion) that the EU imposed in
December on six banks for manipulating Euro (Euribor) and Japanese yen (Libor) benchmarks.

JPMorgan, UBS and Credit Suisse hit while RBS gains immunity after alerting watchdog

The European Commission has handed out another round of  fines to several banks, which agreed to pay €94m in penalties for participating in two distinct cartels involving interest rate products denominated in Swiss francs.

TD
JPMorgan Chase was forced to pay the highest sum, €61.6m, for the first  cartel, aimed at influencing the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009.

The second lender involved, Royal Bank of Scotland, received immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to Europe's top competition authority.

Yesterday's settlement is the EU's third  cartel probe into the rigging of interbank lending rates. The commission issued a record €1.7bn combined  fine in December last year to six banks for colluding to manipulate the Japan-focused yen Libor benchmark and its European sister Euribor.

The EU's settlements raised the tally for benchmark manipulation to more than $6bn, a sum that is expected to rise as regulators conclude investigations and as private lawsuits - up to 50 in the US alone
- stack up.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition chief, said: "Our economy needs a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced."

The second cartel uncovered by the commission colluded to set bid-ask spreads charged on  Swiss      franc interest rate  derivatives. Three banks paid a collective  fine of €32.3m, with UBS hit with €12.6m, JPMorgan €10.5m and Credit Suisse €9.2m. RBS again secured immunity after alerting the commission to the wrongdoing.

Mr Almunia said the  cartel involved agreeing on the element of the price of certain  derivatives, rather than manipulating a benchmark.

"This way, the banks involved could flout the market at their competitors' expense. Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated."
The case is not connected to the Libor benchmark rigging allegations of the first  cartel.

Credit Suisse, which has in the past stressed that it does not expect a material impact from regulatory investigations into Libor rigging, said: "Following discussions with the  EU Commission, Credit Suisse has decided to settle this case . . . in order to avoid lengthy legal proceedings."

RBS, the state-owned lender, is the only institution subject to every one of the commission's benchmark investigations. It has paid €391m for taking part in Euribor and yen Libor cartels.

HD          EU FinesJ.P. Morgan Over Rigging  of Rates

BRUSSELS -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was  fined more than 72 million euros ($92 million) by European Union regulators on Tuesday for rigging a benchmark interest rate and operating a separate cartel for Swiss franc derivatives, marking the latest phase in an EU crackdown on alleged market abuse by financial institutions.

The European Commission, the bloc's central antitrust regulator, said J.P. Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC had colluded between March 2008 and July 2009 in an attempt to rig the  Swiss  franc London interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate.

TD
In a separate decision, the commission said J.P. Morgan, RBS and two Swiss banks -- Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG -- had operated a  cartel for Swiss franc interest-rate  derivatives between May and September 2007.

UBS was fined 12.7 million euros for participating in the  cartel, while Credit Suisse will pay a 9.2 million euro fine.

All of the banks recognized their involvement in the cartels, in exchange for a 10% reduction in their respective fines, the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said. "Cartels in the financial sector, whatever form they take, will not be tolerated."
RBS avoided  fines of around 115 million euros because it disclosed the existence of the cartels.

A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said the settlement "makes no finding" that the bank's management or employees knew about or were involved in the cartels, "or that the trader's actions had any impact on the firms'  Swiss franc Libor submissions or the published  Swiss franc Libor rates."

A spokesman for Credit Suisse said the bank settled the case "to avoid lengthy legal proceedings." RBS and UBS declined to comment.

Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have levied some 6 billion euros in  fines against financial institutions in connection with the manipulation of widely used financial benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor.

The commission charged 13 of the world's largest investment banks last year with colluding in the $18 trillion market for credit  derivatives.

Tuesday's  fines pale in comparison with the record 1.71 billion euro penalty against six financial companies handed down by the EU in December for operating cartels to rig the yen Libor and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.

That ruling also targeted RBS and J.P. Morgan, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale SA, Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin Holdings Ltd., a small London cash broker.

The scale of the  fines reflects "the value of sales of the relevant products and the duration of the infringements," Mr. Almunia said.

Further fines are possible. The bloc also is investigating possible manipulation of foreign-exchange markets.

HD      Commission settles RBS-JPMorgancartel in derivatives based on Swiss franc Libor

The European Commission has found that two international banks, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and JP Morgan, participated in an illegal bilateral  cartel aimed at influencing the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009. Such collusion is prohibited by EU antitrust rules.

The banks agreed to settle the case with the Commission under a simplified procedure. RBS received immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. JPMorgan was  fined EUR61,676,000.

TD
Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Joaquín Almunia, said: "This is the third case where the Commission finds a  cartel related to the manipulation of a financial benchmark, in which major banks colluded instead of competing with each other. Our economy needs a healthy, transparent,
well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced."

Between March 2008 and July 2009 RBS and JP Morgan tried to distort the normal course of the pricing of interest-rate  derivatives denominated in Swiss franc. They discussed the future  Swiss Franc Libor rate submissions of one of the banks and at times exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices. The infringement covered the whole of the European Economic Area (EEA).

The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on  fines. In setting the level of fines, the Commission took into account the banks' sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope, and its duration.

RBS was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and thereby avoided a fine of around EUR110m for its participation in the infringement. JP Morgan received a reduction of its fine for its cooperation in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. Both banks agreed to settle the case with the Commission, leading to a further reduction in  fines of 10 per cent.

A round up of some of the week's most significant corporate events and news stories.
Pouyanné takes Total reins after plane crash kills chief

TD
Patrick Pouyanné was appointed as the new chief executive of Total SA this week after former head of the French oil and gas major Christophe de Margerie was killed in a plane crash, writes Michael Stothard in Paris.
De Margerie's business jet caught fire at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after striking a snowplough late on
Monday. Russian authorities said the driver of the snowplough was drunk, a claim refuted by his lawyer.

It took 48 hours for Total, the world's fifth-largest listed oil and gas company, to call an emergency board meeting and choose a replacement, appointing the 51-year-old head of refining and chemicals Mr Pouyanné.

The company also appointed Thierry Desmarest, the Total chief executive from 1995 to 2007, as chairman to provide a steady hand in the boardroom.

Mr Pouyanné has spent more than 17 years at Total. He started out in exploration, moving to the downstream chemicals and refining division. Here he proved himself an adept cost-cutter, restructuring the business.

In his new role, he is expected to come under shareholder pressure to execute further cost-cutting partly because of lower oil prices. There are also geopolitical issues to consider, with western sanctions
against Russia having halted Total's joint venture with Lukoil to explore shale oil in western Siberia.

In Russia, an investigation into the crash is under way. The director-general of Moscow's Vnukovo airport and his deputy resigned, while investigators detained four employees, in addition to the snowplough driver.
Yahoo bolsters case that strategic plan is working

For the last two years, it did not really matter what Marissa Mayer did. Yahoo's chief executive primped and preened its products, bought a boat load of companies and rolled out a completely new set of advertising options, writes Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

< > Investors simply were not looking. They just viewed Yahoo stock as a way to get a piece of Alibaba - the US group had a 24 per cent stake in the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce group, some of which was sold in September's initial public offering.

But suddenly, all eyes are on Yahoo's core business. Alibaba went public last month and a week later, activist shareholders started to plead with Yahoo to take drastic action, including one suggestion it should tie-up with AOL.

Page 96 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ms Mayer used Yahoo's third-quarter earnings announcement this week to fight back and her case for sticking to her original strategic plan was helped a little (but not a lot) by better than expected earnings.

She also spilled the figures to defend the company against allegations that it cannot be trusted with the money it received from the Alibaba IPO.

Ms Mayer argued she has spent far more on buybacks (what shareholders want) than deals (which they are worried will not boost revenue), that some deals are necessary and she has hired tax experts to help reduce how much of the money goes to the government.

She also pointed to what she sees as signs of hope in the main business - increased mobile revenue and growth at Tumblr, the blogging platform.

Tesco chairman bows to pressure as profits tumble

Tesco faced fresh turmoil this week as profits sank more than 90 per cent and Britain's biggest retailer admitted it had been overstating profits for longer than previously thought, writes Andrea Felsted in London.

Sir Richard Broadbent, chairman, bowed to investor pressure and said he would step down in an effort to draw a line under the affair.

His resignation came as Tesco said it could no longer provide full-year guidance, pushing the shares to an 11-year low. Since the beginning of the year the group has issued three profit warnings, and its market value has more than halved.
Tesco said profits had been overstated by £263m, against a previous estimate of £250m a month ago. Dave Lewis, new chief executive, refused to comment on whether the overstatement had been the result
of error or deliberate action. He said, however, there was "evidence that no one made any financial gain
from the situation".

The accounting discrepancy arose from the way it recognised income from suppliers. Some £118m of the shortfall related to the first half of this year, with £70m related to last year and some £75m to previous years. Restating the numbers meant that trading profit in the six months to August 23 fell from
£1.59bn to £937m.

Tesco announced a month ago that a £1.1bn forecast of pre-tax profit released just weeks earlier had been overstated, and called in accountants Deloitte and lawyers Freshfields to investigate.

Mr Lewis said that severance payments - together worth millions of pounds - to Philip Clarke, ousted as chief executive in July, and Laurie McIlwee, who resigned as finance director in April, were being withheld until the conclusion of an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Brussels closes Libor  cartel probes with flourish of  fines
Another chapter in the long-running Libor rate rigging saga closed this week when Europe's main
antitrust body ended its  cartel probes with a round of multimillion euro penalties, writes Daniel Schäfer in
London.

The European Commissionfined a number of global banks a combined €94m for participating in two distinct cartels - one of them connected to Libor - involving interest rate products denominated in Swiss francs.

JPMorgan Chase received the highest penalty, €61.6m, for its participation in a  cartel aimed at influencing the  Swiss franc Libor interbank lending benchmark, a rate widely used to price mortgages and other financial products.

Royal Bank of Scotland was the second lender involved but it escaped a €115m  fine after receiving immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels to Europe's top competition authority.

The EU's settlements marked the latest in a series of large  fines for Libor manipulation handed out by authorities in the US and Europe in the past two years. It has taken the total tally for benchmark rigging to more than $6bn, a sum that is expected to increase further as regulators conclude investigations and as private lawsuits - up to 50 in the US alone - stack up.

Page 97 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In December last year, the commission issued a record €1.7bn  fine to six banks for colluding to manipulate the Japan-focused yen-Libor benchmark and its European sister Euribor.

This week, it also revealed the existence of another  cartel that colluded to set bid-ask spreads charged on Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives. In this case, UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse paid a collective fine of €32.3m.
And finally ... the lighter side of the news

● Everyone has a need for speed these days. To meet this desire for acceleration German engineers at ThyssenKrupp have developed an airport travelator using magnetic train technology that can double an average pedestrian's walking pace. Now you can add velocity into the toxic mix surrounding the murderous perambulations of spatially challenged buffoons blithely dragging heavy cases behind them, scything through crowds at airports leaving a trail of battered shins and crushed feet.

● The powers that be at a certain Cupertino-based technology group must be kicking themselves. While they were focusing on phablets, Fujifilm was diversifying into pharmaceuticals and a more old-fashioned form of tablet. Set aside the goodwill to be gained by solving modern medical challenges with an eye to design - the publicity for the drugs would write itself: 'An Apple a day keeps the doctor away.'

● US farmers need to drag themselves into the vanguard of the consumer era as harvested grain is left in fields because of freight congestion. In this digital age when the customer is king, the way to motivate a tardy company is with a social media firestorm. Commuters need only be delayed by nanoseconds before the tweets start to fly. Perhaps it is time for the agricultural industry to raise a digital pitchfork against epic rail fails.

● The team that put the wheeze into Caterham Formula One's racing cars have called in the safety car and are trundling towards the pits. It could have been the utter lack of points in five years of competing in Grands Prix, or the embarrassment of being overtaken by a Toad driving a jalopy and shouting: 'Poot! Poot!' Administrators are racing to scrutinise the books before lawyers start stripping the group for parts.

HD            UBS Posts Higher Profit Despite Legal Charges

The Swiss bank UBS reported on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit increased 32 percent even as it took a loss of nearly $2 billion for legal charges, reflecting the struggle it and other banks face with litigation and regulatory issues.

The bank reported net profit of 762 million Swiss francs, or $802 million, up from 577 million francs in the same period a year earlier.

TD
UBS and many of its competitors are part of an international investigation into possible currency manipulation. The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain, the United States Justice Department and regulators from Switzerland and Hong Kong are looking into the issue.

UBS is one of a handful of banks expected to take part in a global settlement with the British regulator in the coming weeks concerning the manipulation of foreign currency markets.

The bank said it did not expect the regulatory environment to improve soon, confirming analysts' concerns that banks will be dealing with such issues for some time.

To that end, UBS said Tuesday it had set aside 1.8 billion francs for future litigation and regulatory costs.

"At this point in time, we believe that the industry continues to operate in an environment where charges associated with litigation, regulatory and similar matters will remain elevated for the foreseeable future," UBS said in a statement.

The bank said it expected charges associated with such matters to remain at "elevated levels" through 2014.

The bank reported that its underlying profit before tax was 1.7 billion francs. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast, on average, net profit of 737 million francs; Bloomberg had reported an average estimate of 804 million francs.

The legal charge was partly offset by a net tax benefit of 1.3 billion francs related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets

The chief executive of UBS, Sergio P. Ermotti, said that he was pleased with the quarterly performance and that the bank was facing its regulatory issues head on.

UBS has been focused on cutting costs in its investment bank and building its wealth-management business.

"Three years since introducing our strategy, the business is far stronger, its earnings power is much greater, and our absolute and relative capital position speaks for itself," Mr. Ermotti said in a statement. "That gives us every confidence in our ability to deliver on our capital returns policy."

The group reported operating income for the quarter of 6.9 billion francs, up from 6.3 billion in the same period a year earlier. Operating expenses, however, rose to 7.4 billion francs from 5.9 billion francs a year earlier.


Page 100 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The investment bank, which has been aggressively shrinking, posted a loss of 1.3 billion francs compared with a profit of 251 million francs a year ago, reflecting litigation provisions. Underlying profit before taxes was 494 million francs, which the bank said reflected a "strong" performance in a traditionally weak summer period.
The bank projected restructuring costs of 700 million francs for 2014 and 1.4 billion francs for 2015. The bank's common equity Tier 1 capital, a measure of its ability to absorb losses, rose to 13.7
percent at the end of the second quarter from 11.9 percent in the period a year earlier.

That measure is used to determine the size of a bank's capital buffer. European banks are required to have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital of 4 percent under the so-called Basel III regulations. Larger banks, however, are required to maintain a much higher minimum capital level.

UBS continues to face regulatory pressures. In a settlement announcement last week, the  European Commission said UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse operated a cartel related to  Swiss franc interest-rate  derivatives, imposing fines totaling 32.4 million euros, or about $41.1 million.
UBS was ordered to pay the largest  fine, at 12.7 million.All rights reserved

UBS recently said that certain authorities had started settlement talks in a foreign exchange investigation that could lead to “material”  fines.

The bank also said that as part of the discussions, the Justice Department and UBS had agreed in principle to extend a so-called nonprosecution agreement that was struck after the bank admitted in
2012 that it manipulated interest rates. The agreement, which requires the bank to refrain from committing crimes and to cooperate with any investigations, was set to end Dec. 18, but will be extended one year.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Financial supplement

A financial supplement containing income statement and balance sheet information for the nine quarters ending 30 September 2014 is available on  www.rbs.com/results
Highlights
RBS reports a third successive quarterly profit, improved capital and further progress in de-risking.

Q3 2014 attributable profit was GBP896 million, up from GBP230 million in Q2 2014 and a loss of GBP828 million in Q3 2013. Profit before tax was GBP1,270 million compared with GBP1,010 million in Q2 2014
and a loss of GBP634 million in Q3 2013.
The quarter included net impairment provision releases of GBP801 million, principally in Ulster Bank and
RBS Capital Resolution, and litigation and conduct costs of GBP780 million.

RBS continues to make excellent progress in building its capital ratios. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio has strengthened 220 basis points since the year end and 70 basis points in the quarter to 10.8%.

Capital build was supported by further excellent progress in the nine months to 30 September in de-risking the balance sheet, including:


--     Further disposals and run-off in RCR, with funded assets down GBP11 billion.
-- A 16% reduction in RWAs in Corporate & Institutional Banking, including running down our US-backed
product franchise.


--     The sale of EUR9 billion of securities in the RBS N.V. liquidity portfolio.
Personal & Business Banking continued to perform strongly with income growth of 3% in the quarter.
Operating profit in Q3 2014 was GBP881 million, up 66% on Q2 2014.

Commercial & Private Banking had an improved performance with income up 1% compared with Q2 2014. Operating profit in Q3 2014 was GBP471 million, up 23% on Q2 2014.

Corporate & Institutional Banking had a weak quarter with an operating loss of GBP557 million which reflected litigation and conduct costs of GBP562 million, including GBP400 million relating to potential costs following investigations into the foreign exchange market, and significantly lower income. [ 31-10-14
0700GMT ]

Further progress has been made on improving efficiency, with adjusted operating expenses down 5% over the quarter. RBS remains on track to deliver its GBP1 billion operating cost reduction target for 2014, at constant foreign exchange rates.
The quarter saw RBS achieve the largest ever IPO of a US bank, listing 28.75% of Citizens Financial
Group. We continue to target an IPO of Williams & Glyn towards the end of 2016.

RBS confirms it will retain Ulster Bank following completion of the strategic review. Ulster Bank remains a core part of RBS, offering a good strategic fit with our focused retail and commercial banking strategy. We have a good market position and believe that Ulster Bank can deliver attractive returns, with appropriate investment.
Highlights
Ross McEwan, Chief Executive, said:

"In February I placed trust at the heart of my new strategy for our bank. We have taken the first steps towards that goal, with early progress in making RBS simpler, clearer and fairer.
We are reducing costs, and are on track to achieve our capital targets.

UK and Ireland are showing signs of growth, and impairment trends are significantly better than we had anticipated at the start of the year.

We have confirmed today that Ulster Bank remains a core part of our bank. We have a good market position and believe that, with investment, Ulster Bank can deliver attractive shareholder returns in the future.

But we know we still have a long list of conduct and litigation issues to deal with and much, much more to do to restore our customers' trust in us."

Highlights
Q3 2014 performance



-- Operating profit(1) was GBP1,277 million compared with GBP1,318 million in Q2 2014 and a loss of GBP155 million in Q3 2013. Restructuring costs totalled GBP180 million, down from GBP385 million in the prior quarter, while litigation and conduct costs, including GBP400 million of potential conduct costs following investigations into the foreign exchange market and an additional GBP100 million provision for Payment Protection Insurance, were GBP780 million compared with GBP250 million in Q2 2014.

--  Operating profit(1) excluding restructuring costs and litigation
and conduct costs (adjusted operating profit) improved to GBP2,237 million from GBP1,953 million in Q2 2014 and GBP399 million
in Q3 2013.

-- Total income was 11% lower at GBP4,359 million, mostly driven by the scaling back of activity in CIB, the non-repeat of the GBP170 million gain on CFG's sale of the Illinois franchise
in Q2 2014, and GBP104 million(2) losses recorded on the disposal of available-for-sale debt securities in the RBS N.V. liquidity portfolio. These were partly offset by a GBP65 million improvement in net interest income resulting from better deposit margins
and a GBP121 million quarter on quarter improvement in RCR non-interest income principally driven by disposal gains. Income was up 3%
in PBB and 1% in CPB.

-- Operating expenses were up 5% at GBP3,883 million. Excluding restructuring costs and litigation and conduct costs totalling GBP960 million (Q2 2014 - GBP635 million), operating expenses were down 5% compared with Q2 2014. RBS remains on track to deliver GBP1 billion of cost reductions in 2014.

-- A net release of impairment provisions of GBP801 million in the quarter compares with a net release of GBP93 million in Q2 2014. These were recorded primarily in RCR and
Ulster Bank,
reflecting the sustained improvements in economic and asset market conditions in the UK and especially Ireland. While net impairment charges increased in UK PBB and in CPB as a result of lower latent provision releases than in Q2 2014, underlying
credit conditions remain benign. Risk elements in lending declined by 11% or GBP3.6 billion in the quarter; the reduction from
the beginning of the year was GBP8.9 billion, or 23%.

-- Profit before tax, which includes a gain on own credit of GBP49 million, was GBP1,270 million, up 26% from Q2 2014.


Page 114 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
-- Profit attributable to ordinary and B shareholders was GBP896 million, up from GBP230 million in Q2 2014.

--  Tangible net asset value per ordinary and B share was 388p at
30 September 2014, compared with 376p at 30 June 2014.

Balance sheet and capital



--  Funded assets fell by GBP4.1 billion to GBP732.1 billion at
30 September 2014. Growth in lending in the core business was more than offset by disposals and run-off in RCR, disposals
of available-for-sale securities, and continuing risk reduction in CIB. These balance sheet reductions, partially offset by
the impact of the strengthening US currency on dollar-denominated balances, resulted in a 3% reduction in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to GBP381.7 billion.

-- Total assets increased by GBP35.0 billion, driven by increases in the market value of
derivatives. The increase in derivative
assets and liabilities mostly related to foreign exchange contracts: primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar but also reflecting somewhat higher trading volumes following an upsurge
in currency volatility. The value of interest rate derivatives
also increased, driven largely by the downward shift in yields.

Notes:



(1) Operating profit before tax, own credit adjustments, gain on redemption of own debt, write down of goodwill, strategic disposals and RFS Holdings minority interest ("operating profit"). Statutory operating profit before tax was GBP1,270 million for the quarter ended 30 September 2014 and GBP3,922 million for the nine months ended 30 September 2014.
(2) An additional GBP73 million loss attributable to other shareholders is included within RFS Holdings minority interest.

Highlights
Balance sheet and capital (continued)



-- Loans and advances to customers grew by GBP7.4 billion, or 2%, to GBP393.0 billion.
--  UK PBB loans and advances to customers grew by GBP0.6 billion, with net mortgage growth of GBP0.8 billion partially offset
by declining card balances.
--  Commercial Banking loans and advances grew by GBP1.1 billion, with demand strongest in the mid- and large corporate segments.
--  CIB's loans and advances increased by GBP4.1 billion driven
by a combination of lending to large corporates, and collateral movements.
--  By the end of September 2014, pro-active 'Statements of Appetite' had been issued to more than 300,000 SME customers, offering
in excess of GBP12.2 billion of new or additional funding. Gross new lending to SMEs (including customers in both PBB and CPB) totalled GBP2.6 billion in Q3 2014, up 24% from Q3
2013.
-- Customer deposits grew by GBP4.1 billion, or 1%, to GBP405.4 billion, mostly reflecting CFG's growth in money markets and term deposits, amplified by the strengthening of the US dollar.

Page 115 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
--  CET1 ratio strengthened to 10.8%, compared with 10.1% at 30
June 2014 and 8.6% at 31 December 2013. The improvement reflects the attributable profit for the quarter together with favourable movements in cash flow and foreign currency reserves along with
a 3% reduction in risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio improved by 20 basis points to 3.9%.

--  RBS's results in the
European Banking Authority's stress test,
which was based on data from the end of 2013, were satisfactory. These results do not reflect the significant de-risking and
good capital accretion that has taken place in the first three
[ 31-10-14 0700GMT ]


quarters of 2014 during which time the CET1 ratio has increased by 220 basis points to 10.8%.

-- Our purpose is to serve customers well. Our actions are beginning to have an impact.

-- We are seeing early signs of results from becoming simpler and clearer. Our 'Instant Saver with Savings Goals' product is the first, and only, banking product to achieve the 5-star Fairbanking Mark and we intend to achieve Fairbanking Marks for our other products.

-- While NatWest's NPS is flat for Personal Banking, it has made strong progress in Commercial Banking where no other bank scored more highly in Q3 2014. For the RBS brand, NPS scores recovered from minus seventeen to minus four in Personal Banking and from minus five to zero in Commercial Banking. However, we have much more to do in order to reach our goal of being number one for service, trust and advocacy by 2020.

Highlights
Outlook

These results reflect improvements in economic activity and asset values in RBS's core UK and Irish markets so far in 2014. Economic growth in our core markets is expected to continue, although the pace looks likely to moderate into 2015. Against this backdrop, we anticipate further credit impairment releases in Q4 2014 offset by modest new impairments. The outlook for 2015 remains relatively benign, albeit with some risks to the downside. At such low levels of impairments there may be volatility in any quarter.

The net interest margin in Q4 2014 is expected to remain at around Q3 2014 levels, with modest asset margin pressure balanced by lower funding costs.

Income from the fixed income product suite is expected to remain weak during Q4, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet reduction programme, lower risk appetite, costs associated with exiting legacy portfolios and a weaker than anticipated trading performance during October.

RBS remains on track to deliver its targeted GBP1 billion of cost reductions in 2014 on a constant currency basis. Restructuring costs in Q4 2014 are expected to be higher, with some potential write-downs, as we reduce our footprint and simplify our systems and product set. Previous guidance on restructuring costs in the four year period to 2017 remains unchanged at GBP5 billion.

RCR guidance remains unchanged from the 30 September 2014 Trading Statement and, if market conditions remain favourable, we expect continuing strong progress in balance sheet and risk reductions and an accelerated timetable to achieve its wind-down goals.

Ongoing conduct and regulatory investigations and litigation continue to present challenges and are expected to be a material drag on both earnings and capital generation over the coming quarters. The timing and amounts of any further settlements or redress however remain uncertain and could be significant.

Notes:


For the purposes of net interest margin calculations the following adjustments have been made.
(1) Net interest income has been reduced by GBP7 million in Q3 2014 (Q2 2014
- GBP14 million; Q3 2013 - GBP19 million) and by GBP35 million in the
nine

GBP57
months ended 30 September 2014 (nine months ended 30 September 2013 - million) in respect of interest on financial assets and liabilities
designated
as at fair value through profit or loss.
(2) Net interest income has been reduced by GBP38 million in Q3 2013 and GBP7

million in the nine months ended 30 September 2013 in respect of non-recurring
adjustments.

Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014



-- Net interest income increased by 2% to GBP2,863 million with improvements in deposit margins in UK PBB and Commercial Banking, supported by the
quarter's
higher day count.

--  Net interest margin (NIM) increased by four basis points to 2.26%
supported
by deposit re-pricing initiatives in UK PBB and Commercial Banking. CFG's

reduced NIM was driven by: lower commercial lending spreads; higher borrowing
costs resulting from the growth in money market accounts, term deposits and the issue of subordinated debt; and the impact of the Illinois
franchise
sale in Q2 2014.

--  Non-interest income totalled GBP1,496 million, down 30% from GBP2,127 million
in Q2 2014. Within this, income from trading activities declined by
GBP391
million, reflecting the strategic decision to concentrate on core product

areas in CIB. Other operating income reduced by GBP271 million compared with Q2 2014, reflecting a non-repeat of the GBP170 million gain in Q2

on the sale of the Illinois franchise by CFG, and losses of GBP104
million(1)
on the disposal of available-for-sale debt securities.

Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014



--  Operating expenses increased by 5% to GBP3,883 million, principally reflecting
a GBP530 million increase in litigation and conduct costs to GBP780 million,
which was partly offset by lower restructuring costs, down GBP205 million.

--  Litigation and conduct costs in Q3 2014 included GBP400 million of potential
conduct costs following investigations into the foreign exchange market and an additional GBP100 million charge for PPI reflecting higher than
expected
reactive complaint volumes.

--  Adjusted operating expenses declined to GBP2,923 million, down GBP142 million
or 5%. The fall was primarily attributable to tight control of discretionary
expenditure, lower incentive accruals in CFG and CIB in particular, and the impact of the sale of the Illinois branches in Q2 2014. Adjusted
operating
expenses for the first nine months of the year were 9% lower than the comparable
period in 2013.

--  The cost:income ratio was 89% compared with 75% in Q2 2014 reflecting higher
litigation and conduct costs along with lower income. The adjusted cost:income
ratio was 67%, up from 62% for Q2 2014, as lower income, primarily in CIB

and Centre, outweighed the decline in operating expenses.

Analysis of results
Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014



-- A net loan impairment release of GBP803 million was recorded in Q3 2014, GBP714 million higher than in Q2 2014. This included a GBP610 million
release
in RCR driven by the improved economic environment and rising asset values
in the UK and especially Ireland, together with net provision releases in


Ulster Bank supported by rising Irish residential property prices and proactive
debt management. While UK PBB's net impairment charge increased as a result
of lower latent releases, underlying credit conditions remain benign.
-- REIL decreased by GBP3.6 billion to GBP30.5 billion during Q3 2014. Of the reduction, GBP3.0 billion was in RCR which continued its strategy of
disposing


Page 124 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of non-performing assets. Continued favourable market conditions resulted

in some disposals being achieved at prices above net book value. The
GBP0.6
billion reduction in non-RCR was primarily in Commercial Banking portfolios
due to repayments and write-offs.

--  REIL as a percentage of gross customer loans declined, both in RCR, to
67.6%,
and in the rest of RBS to 3.4%.

Analysis of results [ 31-10-14 0700GMT ]
Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014



-- The end-point CRR CET1 ratio improved to 10.8% from 10.1%, principally driven by retained earnings and favourable movements in cash
flow and foreign currency reserves, and the continuing reduction in RWAs.

-- RWA reductions of GBP10.4 billion were achieved during the quarter, particularly in RCR (down GBP4.5 billion), CIB (down GBP4.6 billion) and
Ulster Bank (down GBP3.8 billion). These were partially
offset by an increase in CFG (up GBP3.7 billion) which was amplified by the strengthening of the US dollar.

-- The leverage ratio improved by 20 basis points reflecting increased attributable profit as leverage exposure remained broadly stable.

2014 - GBP72 million loss;
quarter ended 30 June 2014 - GBP13 million profit; quarter ended 30
September 2013 - GBP150
million profit) and profit and loss on hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Segment performance
Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014
UK Personal & Business Banking



--  Operating profit increased by 3% to GBP499 million primarily reflecting higher income. Adjusted operating profit increased by 3% to GBP682
million.
--  Total income grew by 3% to GBP1,543 million, supported by improvements in deposit margins. Operating expenses remained broadly stable at GBP965
million.

--  Net impairment losses increased by GBP19 million primarily reflecting lower
latent releases. However, underlying default charges continued to decrease,
down 5% in the quarter with continued improvements in asset quality.

--  Gross new mortgage lending totalled GBP5.3 billion. Net mortgage growth was GBP0.8 billion with strong retention in fixed rate roll-offs and
higher
repayments.

--  Business Banking gross new lending increased by 44% in the year to date compared with the same period in 2013. The recent launch of the Small
Business
Fund demonstrates the business's continued commitment to this market sector.

--  Operating profit increased by GBP336 million to GBP382 million, primarily due to further net impairment releases supported by rising Irish
residential
property prices coupled with proactive debt management. The potential exists
for further releases in the future if market conditions continue to improve.
Restructuring costs were stable. Adjusted operating profit increased by
GBP336 million to GBP394 million.

--  Total income grew by 1% to GBP214 million. Proactive re-pricing of deposits
has contributed to the improvement in net interest margin since Q3 2013.

In both Q2 2014 and Q3 2014 net interest margin benefited from the recognition
of interest income on non-performing assets. Management continues to
focus

been

on implementing cost saving initiatives but expenses during 2014 have

adversely impacted by a number of additional regulatory charges and levies.

--  Trading conditions improved further during Q3 2014 supported by GDP
growth,
lower unemployment and a recovery in property values but the business environment
remains challenging.
Ulster Bank has seen an increase in demand for new
lending, from both personal and business customers throughout 2014.


Commercial Banking


--  Commercial Banking continues to focus on simplifying the way customers do business with the bank. The business improved the online customer
lending
process, streamlined its product range, reduced the average account opening
time by ten days and implemented a further 56 'simplifying customer
life'

ideas.

--  Progress has been made on integrating the Commercial and Private businesses
resulting in an increase in referrals and helping to ensure that customers'
broadest needs are met.

--  Operating profit grew by 30% to GBP407 million quarter on quarter, primarily
reflecting the absence of litigation and conduct costs during the quarter
and lower restructuring costs (down 70%). Adjusted operating profit remained
stable with higher income and lower operating expenses offset by modest net impairment charges compared with net impairment release in Q2 2014.

--  Total income grew by 2% to GBP811 million partly as a result of margin expansion,
primarily from deposit re-pricing. Cost saving initiatives resulted in
an

8% reduction in direct expenses.


Segment performance
Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014 (continued) Commercial Banking (continued)


--  Net impairment losses totalled GBP12 million compared with a GBP9 million net release in Q2 2014 as a result of lower releases of latent
provisions.

--  Deposit balances decreased by GBP1.0 billion to GBP87.0 billion reflecting

Page 138 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
active management of the bank's funding surplus, while net loans and advances
to customers grew by GBP1.1 billion across a number of sectors to
GBP85.0
billion. RWAs increased by GBP1.9 billion primarily from a change in methodology.


Private Banking



--  Following a review of the high net worth business, RBS has decided to exit
the international business. This exit will be carried out with a focus on
minimising client and business disruption while maximising value and
certainty
of execution. Private Banking UK remains a core business with a significant
opportunity to integrate and leverage the franchise within Commercial & Private Banking.

--  Operating profit decreased by 9% to GBP64 million principally due to higher
restructuring costs. Adjusted operating profit declined by 3% to GBP71 million.

--  Total income decreased by 1% to GBP270 million while operating expenses excluding restructuring costs increased by 3% to GBP203 million
primarily
due to remediation expenses.

--  Net impairment releases totalled GBP4 million compared with a GBP1 million
net impairment charge in Q2 2014.

--  Client assets and liabilities grew by GBP0.7 billion in Q3 2014 with increases
across all categories. This includes growth of GBP0.2 billion in assets under management to GBP28.9 billion across the UK and international
businesses.


Corporate & Institutional Banking



--  Corporate & Institutional Banking continued to make progress on reducing RWAs and controlling discretionary expenditure during Q3 2014, focusing on strengths in core product areas to serve its customers better whilst moving to a lower risk model.
--  Operating loss grew by GBP532 million to GBP557 million reflecting higher litigation and conduct charges partly offset by lower restructuring
costs.
Adjusted operating profit was subdued, declining by GBP156 million to
GBP21

million, driven by lower income, partially offset by lower operating
expenses
as the business continued to manage down discretionary expenditure. Adjusted
operating profit was GBP570 million in the year to date compared with
GBP506
million in the same period in 2013.

Page 139 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
--  Total income declined by 23% to GBP831 million in Q3 2014. Rates performance
was relatively muted, falling 19% to GBP240 million. Credit fell by
GBP111
million, primarily due to Asset Backed Products, where resources deployed
by the business continued to reduce in line with the strategic decision to concentrate on core product areas. RWAs in Assets Backed Products
have

almost halved to GBP12 billion in 2014.

--  RWAs were GBP123.2 billion, down GBP4.6 billion compared with end Q2
2014,
reflecting both risk reduction and business mitigation actions, and despite
adverse currency movements of GBP1.3 billion.


Segment performance
Q3 2014 compared with Q2 2014 (continued) Citizens Financial Group



--  The initial public offering of
Citizens Financial Group (CFG) was successfully
completed with shares priced at $21.50 per share, and trading began on
the the
New York Stock Exchange on 24 September. Given the trading strength of stock, the underwriters also exercised their overallotment option,
resulting
in a total of $3.5 billion of common stock being sold. As a result,
RBS's

70.5%
holding in CFG stood at 71.25% as of 30 September and was reduced to of shares outstanding following a buyback by CFG on 8 October.

--  Operating profit for Q3 2014 was $271 million. Excluding the $283 million

net gain on the sale of the Illinois franchise in Q2 2014 and restructuring
costs, operating profit was down $5 million or 2% from Q2 2014.

--  Total income was down 21% from Q2 2014, principally driven by the impact of the Illinois franchise sale.

--  Operating expenses, excluding restructuring costs, decreased by 6%
largely
due to the impact of the Illinois franchise sale as well as lower incentive
accruals and higher consumer regulatory compliance costs in Q2 2014.

--  Loans and advances were up 2%, driven by higher commercial loans, auto loan
organic growth and purchases and a strategic initiative to purchase residential
mortgages. Customer deposits have also increased by 2% from the prior quarter
maintaining a 98% loan:deposit ratio.


RBS Capital Resolution

Page 140 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.

--  RCR funded assets were GBP18 billion, down GBP11 billion or 38% since inception
on 1 January 2014; with GBP3 billion of the reduction in the current quarter
driven by disposals and run-off.
--  RWA equivalent (RWAe)(1) decreased to GBP38 billion, a reduction of GBP27 billion or 41% since 1 January 2014. The RWAe reduction of GBP5.2
billion
in the quarter reflects a combination of disposals and run-off partially offset by the impact of impairment releases.
--  Operating profit for the quarter was GBP638 million, up GBP572 million compared
with Q2 2014, including GBP605 million of net provision releases reflecting
improving economic conditions.

--  RCR has been capital accretive since its formation on 1 January 2014.


Central items



--  Operating loss in Central items in Q3 2014 was GBP319 million compared with
an GBP86 million operating profit in Q2 2014. In Q3 2014, RBS took advantage
of improved market prices to dispose of EUR9 billion of available-for-sale
debt securities at a loss of GBP104 million(2) and recognised a loss of
GBP110 million primarily relating to IFRS volatility arising from interest
rate movements. Q2 2014 benefited from a number of small gains on asset realisations.

Notes:



(1) RWA equivalent (RWAe) is an internal metric that measures the
equity capital employed in segments. RWAe converts both performing and non-performing exposures into a consistent capital measure, being the sum of the regulatory RWAs and the regulatory capital deductions, the latter converted to RWAe by applying a multiplier of 10.
(2) An additional GBP73 million loss attributable to other shareholders is included within RFS Holdings minority interest.

Notes:



(1) Includes all effects relating to disposals, including associated removal of deductions from regulatory capital.
(2) Principally reflects credit migration and other technical adjustments. (3) Includes fair value adjustments and foreign exchange movements.
(4) RWA equivalent (RWAe) is an internal metric that measures the equity capital
employed in segments. RWAe converts both performing and non-performing exposures
into a consistent capital measure, being the sum of the regulatory RWAs and the regulatory capital deductions, the latter converted to RWAe by
applying
a multiplier. RBS applies a CET1 ratio of 10%; this results in an end
point

CRR RWAe conversion multiplier of 10.

--  The movement in available-for-sale financial assets during the quarter predominantly
reflects realised losses arising on the disposal of securities in the liquidity
portfolio. In the nine months ended 30 September 2014, the movement primarily
arises on unrealised gains on Spanish and US bonds.

--  Cash flow hedging gains in both the quarter and nine months largely result
from decreases in the Sterling and Euro swap rates.

--  Currency translation gains in the quarter are principally due to the weakening
of Sterling against the US dollar. The losses in the nine months are driven
by the strengthening of Sterling against the Euro, partly offset by the weakening against the US dollar.

Notes
1. Basis of preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with RBS's 2013 Annual Report and Accounts which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee of the IASB as adopted by the European Union (EU) (together IFRS).
Accounting policies
There have been no significant changes to RBS's principal accounting policies as set out on pages 377 to
386 of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts. The adoption of a number of amendments to IFRSs effective
for 2014 has not had a material effect on RBS's results.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The judgements and assumptions that are considered to be the most important to the portrayal of RBS's financial condition are those relating to pensions, goodwill, provisions for liabilities, deferred tax, loan impairment provisions and fair value of financial instruments. These critical accounting policies and judgments are described on pages 386 to 389 of RBS's 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
Page 175 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Going concern

Having reviewed RBS's forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence, the directors have a reasonable expectation that RBS will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Interim Management Statement for the period ended 30 September 2014 has been prepared on a going concern basis.
Restatements [ 31-10-14 0700GMT ]

On 27 February 2014, RBS announced the reorganisation of the previously reported operating divisions into

three franchises. In addition, in order to present a more complete picture of funding, operational and business costs of the franchises and operating segments, certain reporting changes were implemented.

For further information on these changes refer to the Q2 2014 Restatement Document dated 21 July 2014, available on www.investors.rbs.com/restatement

(1) The analysis of income from trading activities is based on how the business is organised and the underlying risks managed. Income from trading activities comprises gains and losses on
financial instruments held for trading, both realised and unrealised, interest income, dividends and the related hedging and funding
costs in the trading book.

Notes
3. Earnings per ordinary and equivalent B share

Following agreement between RBS and Her Majesty's Treasury for the retirement of the Dividend Access Share (DAS), earnings per share for periods ended after 25 June 2014 only reflect DAS dividends recognised before the end of a reporting period: GBP320 million was recognised in the quarter ended 30
June 2014. For periods ending on or before 31 March 2014 earnings are allocated solely to the DAS and earnings per ordinary and equivalent B share for such periods are therefore nil. The DAS does not share in losses. For periods prior to 25 June 2014, adjusted earnings per ordinary and equivalent B share excludes the rights of the dividend access share.

5. Litigation, investigations and reviews

Except for the developments noted below, there have been no material changes to litigation, investigations and reviews as disclosed in the Interim Results for the six months ended 30 June 2014. Other regulatory provisions increased by GBP500 million (see Note 4) during the three month period ended 30 September
2014, GBP400 million of which was in connection with the investigations and reviews around foreign exchange trading. Although RBS has established a provision with respect to these investigations, the effect

Page 179 of 184 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of the outcome of these investigations, any regulatory findings and any related developments, including the timing and amount of  fines or settlements, could result in the future outflow of resources in respect of
these investigations ultimately proving to be substantially greater than or less than the aggregate provision
RBS has recognised.
Litigation
ISDAFIX antitrust litigation

In September and October 2014, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc) and a number of other financial institutions were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints alleging manipulation of USD ISDAFIX rates, to the detriment of persons who entered into transactions that referenced those rates. The complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and contain claims for unjust enrichment and violations of the U.S. antitrust laws and the Commodities Exchange Act.
Notes
5. Litigation, investigations and reviews (continued) Complex Systems
As previously disclosed, The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. (RBS N.V.) was a defendant in an action heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York filed by Complex Systems, Inc (CSI). The plaintiff alleged that RBS N.V. had since late 2007 been using the plaintiff's back-office trade finance processing software without a valid licence, in violation of the US Copyright Act. RBS N.V. and CSI have now reached a settlement of the action, and RBS N.V. has paid the agreed settlement sum to CSI. This brings an end to the proceedings and provides RBS companies with an on-going, perpetual licence to use the software at issue.
Investigations and reviews
LIBOR and other trading rates

On 21 October 2014, the European Commission (EC) announced its findings that RBS and one other financial institution had participated in a bilateral cartel aimed at influencing the  Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate between March 2008 and July 2009. RBS agreed to settle the case with the EC and received full immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the EC and co-operating closely with the EC's ongoing investigation. Also on 21 October 2014, the EC announced its findings that RBS and three other financial institutions had participated in a related  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives in the European Economic Area (EEA). Again, RBS received fullimmunity from fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the EC and co-operating closely with the EC's ongoing investigation.
Foreign exchange trading

Various governmental and regulatory authorities in different countries have been conducting investigations into foreign exchange trading and sales activities apparently involving multiple financial institutions. RBS is under investigation by, has received enquiries from and/or is in discussion with certain of these authorities including, among others, the FCA and Serious Fraud Office in the UK, and the Department of Justice and certain other financial regulatory authorities in the United States. RBS is reviewing communications and procedures relating to certain currency exchange benchmark rates as well as foreign exchange trading and sales activity.
Technology incident in June 2012

As previously disclosed, on 19 June 2012, RBS was affected by a technology incident, as a result of which the processing of certain customer accounts and payments were subject to considerable delay. RBS agreed to reimburse customers for any loss suffered as a result of the incident and RBS made a provision of GBP175 million in 2012.

On 9 April 2013, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it had commenced an enforcement investigation into the incident. This was a joint investigation conducted by the FCA together with the UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and enforcement proceedings have since commenced. Separately the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) initiated an investigation and has issued enforcement proceedings against Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, an RBS company. Ulster Bank Ireland Limited anticipates entering into settlement discussions with the CBI before the end of the year.

Notes
5. Litigation, investigations and reviews (continued) Multilateral interchange fees
As previously disclosed, in 2007, the EC issued a decision that, while interchange is not illegal per se, MasterCard's multilateral interchange fee (MIF) arrangements for cross border payment card transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded consumer credit and debit cards in the EEA were in breach of competition law. MasterCard appealed against the decision to the General Court, which upheld the EC's original decision. MasterCard appealed further to the Court of Justice and RBS intervened in those appeal proceedings. On 11 September 2014, the Court rejected MasterCard's appeal and confirmed the EC's original decision. MasterCard had negotiated interim cross border MIF levels to apply for the duration of the General Court and Court of Justice proceedings and further negotiation is expected in light of the Court's decision.
Investigation into advised mortgage sales

On 27 August 2014 the FCA announced that it had  fined RBS GBP14.47 million in relation to an investigation into advised mortgage sales made by RBS plc and NatWest in the period June 2011 to March
2013 inclusive.
6. Risk factors
A summary of the principal risks which could adversely affect RBS are included on pages 135 to 137 of the
Interim Results 2014.
7. Recent developments
CFG

On 8 October 2014, in a US$334 million capital exchange transaction, CFG repurchased 14.3 million common shares from RBSG International Holdings Limited and issued US$334 million of subordinated
debt to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. As a result, RBS's holding in CFG declined from 71.25% as at 30 September 2014 to 70.5% of shares outstanding.

On 24 October 2014, CFG declared a quarterly common stock dividend of US$0.10 per share. This dividend will be paid on 20 November 2014 and will amount to US$55 million in aggregate.
2014 EBA EU-wide stress test
On 26 October, 2014, the European Banking authority (EBA) announced the results of the 2014 EBA
EU-wide stress test. RBSG plc and its subsidiaries Ulster Bank Ireland Limited and RBS N.V. all reported
capital ratios above the respective post-stress minimum requirements.
8. Post balance sheet events

There have been no significant events between 30 September 2014 and the date of approval of this announcement which would require a change to or additional disclosure in the announcement.

HD       European CommissionFines Banks In Two Settlements Related To Swiss Franc Interest Rate
Derivatives Cartels

LP
On 21 October 2014, the  European Commission announced that it had reached settlements with a number of international banks that participated in two cartels in the market for financial  derivatives based on Swiss franc interest rates. Interest rate  derivatives are financial products which are commonly used by financial institutions or companies for managing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Their value derives from a benchmark interest rate. These benchmarks represent an average of the quotes submitted on a daily basis by a number of banks who are members of a panel.

TD
In the first of the cases, the Commission found that two international banks, RBS and JP Morgan, tried to distort the normal course of the pricing of interest rate  derivatives denominated in Swiss francs. According to the Commission, between March 2008 and July 2009, they discussed the future  Swiss       Franc submissions of one of the banks based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") and at times exchanged information concerning trading positions and intended prices.

Under the settlement procedure, JP Morgan received a reduction in its  fines of 10%. As JP Morgan cooperated in the investigation, a further reduction of 40% was granted under the leniency programme. As a result, the Commission imposed a  fine of € 61 million on JP Morgan.

In the second case, the Commission found that four major players in the Swiss franc derivatives market, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan and Crédit Suisse, operated a  cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate  derivatives in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). The so-called "bid-ask spread" is the difference between the price at which a market maker is willing to sell and to buy a given product.

Between May and September 2007, the four banks agreed to quote to all third parties wider, fixed bid-ask spreads on certain categories of short term over-the-counter  Swiss franc interest rate derivatives, whilst maintaining narrower spreads for trades amongst themselves. This aimed to prevent other market players from competing on the same terms.

As all four banks agreed to settle they benefitted from a reduction in  fines of 10%. For their cooperation in the investigation, UBS and JP Morgan received further reductions under the leniency programme, of
30% and 25% respectively. As a result, UBS was  fined € 12.7 million, JP Morgan € 10.5 million, and
Credit Suisse € 9.2 million.

In both cases, RBS avoided total  fines of around € 115 million as it benefited from immunity for revealing the existence of the two cartels to the Commission.

This is not the first time the Commission has cracked down on anti-competitive conduct in the interest rate derivatives industry. In 2013, the Commission imposed a record total amount of  fines on eight banks for participation in a  cartel in Euro interest rate  derivatives and cartels in Yen interest rate derivatives (see VBB on Competition Law, Volume 2013, No. 11, available at  www.vbb.com).
