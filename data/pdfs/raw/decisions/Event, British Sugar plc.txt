SHARES in Tate & Lyle and Associated British Foods, owner of  British Sugar Corporation, fell on news that the two firms face  fines from the European Commission.

The penalties could be imposed tomorrow, a  Commission source was reported as saying, although the final amounts have yet to be agreed. Shares in Tate & Lyle shed 7p on the news to 310p. ABF was
down 8p to 557p.

TD
The EC watchdog has been investigating the alleged cartel over alleged price fixing and market-sharing agreements for about 10 years . The two companies are said to have agreed to fix market shares at
their 1986 levels following a price war in the early 1980s.

A Tate & Lyle spokesman said the company was unaware of recent developments. "However, if we are fined, we do not expect the amount to be material in any sense," he added. "The files have been gathering dust for years now."
Officials at ABF were unavailable for comment.

BRUSSELS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will fine British Sugar Plc and Tate & Lyle Plc on Wednesday for allegedly fixing sugar prices and agreeing production levels in Britain, a Commission source told Reuters on Tuesday.

The source said the  European Union's antitrust watchdog would also  fine two sugar distributors but declined to give details, saying the level of the  fines had not yet been agreed.

TD
Tate & Lyle played down the prospect of a  fine, saying it had co-operated with the  Commission in the inquiry which started some ten years ago.

British Sugar is part of Associated British Foods Plc.

The Commission's probe into the U.K. sugar market had not been made public, but is not a real surprise.
Last year the EU executive  fined Irish Sugar, a subsidiary of Greencore Group, 8.8 million ecus
($10.5 million) for allegedly abusing its dominant position in Ireland.

The European Committee of Sugar Manufacturers (CEFS) said the sector had long been a target of the Commission's competition body. Under the EU's farm policy the sugar sector benefits from minimum guaranted prices which largely influence market prices.

"(EU competition authority) DGIV does not like the sugar regime. It does not understand that everybody produces under the same conditions, the same prices and the same constraints," CEFS Secretary-General Jules Beauduin told Reuters.
He denied that sugar manufacturers operated a cartel.

Wednesday's decision will be the  Commission's third cartel  fine this year and comes ahead of expected stiff penalties against Swiss-Swedish engineering firm Asea Brown Boveri and a group of heating pipe manufacturers possibly later this month.

EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said last year that the  Commission's cartel busters had never been so active in unveiling price-fixing and market-sharing practices.

The size of the  fines for this type of offence varies according to their gravity, duration and other criteria including whether or not the companies have made amends.

But, according to Commission guidelines, companies involved in price cartels and market sharing quotas are likely to be fined a minimum of 20 million ecus.

Irish Sugar was found guilty of abusing its market power - the  Commission said it controls 95 percent of the Irish market - to prevent imports of cheaper sugar. Under 1997 guidelines this is punishable
with a fine of between one and 20 million ecus.
($1 = 0.83 ecu).

LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - British sugar group Tate & Lyle Plc played down on Tuesday the prospect of a European Commission fine on the company for allegedly fixing the price and agreeing production levels for sugar in Britain.

"We have behaved entirely properly. The outcome of the inquiry is not going to be material to the company," said a company spokesman.

TD
"We have co-operated and communicated with the Commission throughout its inquiry. In fact we actually brought the issues to attention of the Commission some ten years ago," he added.
EarlierM an EC source in Brussels told Reuters that  British Sugar, owned by Associated British
Foods Plc, and Tate & Lyle will be  fined on Wednesday.

He also said the Commission would fine two sugar distributors but declined to give any further details, adding the level of the  fines had not yet been agreed.
Noone at ABF could be immediately reached for comment.
Tate shares were off seven pence at 305p. ABF were down six pence at 559p by 1330 GMT. Last year the EU  fined Irish Sugar, a subsidiary of Greencore Group Plc, 8.8 million Ecus ($10.5
million) for allegedly abusing its dominance in Ireland.

HD        Brussels hits UK sugar barons with Pounds 35m price-fix fine

COSY price-fixing cartel operated by a number of leading  British sugar firms has struck a sour note with the bureaucrats of Brussels, who today slappeda Pounds 35 million  fine on the offenders.

The largest  fine - Pounds 28 million was imposed on  British Sugar, with a Pounds 5 million  fine for Tate & Lyle, while two smaller  fines of just over Pounds 1 million were levied on Napier Brown and James Bud-gett.

TD
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert concluded that the way in which the firms had operated their pricing policies between late 1986 and July 1990 was illegal.

Brussels officials said the sugar firms held "numerous meetings" which took place at regular intervals during this period.

Instead of competing on price, which would have benefited the consumer, the sugar barons made sure that it sold for more than would have been the case with free competition.

An EU statement said: "The  Commission found that the companies have pursued the object of restricting competition through a coordi-nation of their pricing policy on the white granulated sugar market in Great Britain."

In all, Brussels chiefs say there were 27 meetings between the four offending sugar producers which enabled them to discuss issues such as pricing policy and discounts to large customers.

EU chiefs noted that they did not have "sufficient evidence" of a detailed price-fixing operation but they concluded that the consultations between the firms "led to an atmosphere of mutual certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour".

The statement goes on to accuse the four firms of "intentional pursuit of the collaborate strategy of higher pricing".
These four firms together control around 90 per cent of the entire British market for white sugar. The scale of the  fines were linked to the degree of participation in the price-fixing activities.

British Sugar's fine was the highest because of its large share of the British market and because
Brussels chiefs concluded that the producer was "the driving force" behind this new price-fixing strategy.

This is not the first time that the EU  Commission has fined firms for breaking  European free competition laws. Similar action has been taken against producers of plastics and steel firms.
"The only people to benefit from this sort of behaviour are the companies concerned," said an EU
official.

"This sort of activity means prices are higher for the consumer, and that rival firms can be squeezed out of the market.

TATE & LYLE and Associated British Foods'  British Sugar will learn today how much they are going to be fined by the European Commission for abuse of dominant position by allegedly fixing sugar prices and output for the British market, writes Jonathan Annells from Brussels.

Two sugar distributors are also expected to face penalties but  Commission officials refused to give any details about the case before the end of the Commissioners' weekly meeting, saying the companies had to be informed first.

TD
Under EU rules, the duration and severity of the infringements have to be taken into account, as well as mitigating arguments such as cooperation with the inquiry and action to rectify the situation. There is a minimum fine of 20 million ecus (Pounds 14 million) for companies found guilty of operating a
price-fixing cartel, with lower thresholds for less serious abuses of dominant position.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission said Wednesday it has  fined U.K. sugar producers British Sugar and Tate & Lyle PLC (U.TAT), as well as sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett for violating E.U. price fixing rules.

British Sugar has been fined 39.6 million European currency units (XEU), while Tate & Lyle has been fined XEU7 million. Napier Brown and James Budgett have each been  fined XEU1.8 million.

TD
The E.U.  Commission said in a statement that the  fine was due to the companies' "collaborative strategy of higher pricing" between 1986 and 1990.

All four companies collaborated on price of industrial white granulated sugar, whilst the two producers also pursued the strategy with retail white granulated sugar, the E.U.  Commission said.

"The E.U. Commission found evidence of numerous meeting between the parties...In an initial meeting between British Sugar and Tate & Lyle on 20 June 1986 the principles of the future anti-competitive conduct were set," the statement said.

"Each (fined party) could rely, if not on the precise price levels of the other participants, at least on their intentional pursuit of the collaborative strategy of higher pricing," the statement said.

The fines were calculated in relation to the duration of the infringements and the market share of the companies.
There were several aggravating factors in relation to  British Sugar, the statement said.

British Sugar was "the instigator of the infringements and "the driving force," and had acted contrary to the "clear wording" in an earlier E.U.  Commission decision involving Napier Brown.
However, Tate & Lyle's  fine was substantially reduced because it cooperated with the E.U.
Commission's investigation, including submitting incriminating letters.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--British Sugar, a unit of Associated British Foods PLC (U.ABF) said Wednesday it will appeal the 39.6 million  European currency units (XEU)  fine imposed on it by the European Union Commission.

The fine for price fixing in the U.K., along with fellow sugar producer Tate & Lyle PLC (U.TAT), was close to double the suggested ceiling for so-called "serious infringements" of E.U. competition law.

TD
"British Sugar will be appealing against this decision," the company said in a statement and refrained from giving further comment.

Meanwhile, Tate & Lyle was  fined just XEU7 million, while distributors Napier Brown and James Budgett were  fined XEU1.8 million each for their part in the price fixing which occurred in the U.K. between 1986 and 1990.

Explaining the size of the  fines, a Commission official said that originally  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle both faced  fines close to XEU20 million each.

However, there were aggravating circumstances in both cases, resulting in one  fine nearly doubling and the other being cut to less than a half.

Tate & Lyle cooperated, the official said: "If it were not for Tate & Lyle we wouldn't have discovered this cartel," he said.
However, British Sugar dragged its feet, the official said, adding: "Even while we were fining them in
1988 for having tried to squeeze a merchant out of the retail market, they were busy setting up the
cartel," he said.

The European Commission is today expected to  fine British Sugar and Tate &Lyle for allegedly fixing prices and agreeing production levels for sugar in Britain during the mid-1980s.

At the end of an investigation lasting almost 10 years, the  Commission is also expected to impose penalties on two sugar distributors also said to be involved in rigging the market. Tate &Lyle said yesterday it had originally alerted the EU authorities to the fact that certain discussions "may have taken place" and had subsequently co-operated with the cartel investigation.

TD
"We don't anticipate the consequences to affect materially this business," said a spokesman for Tate
&Lyle.  British Sugar, which has at least two-thirds of the UK sugar market, declined to comment. Under
new EU rules, the severity of the  fines will reflect the length and seriousness of the cartel, rather than
the turnover of the companies. Emma Tucker, Brussels

BRITISH Sugar, Tate & Lyle and two sugar distribution companies will be  fined millions of pounds today by the European Commission for allegedly running a price-fixing cartel.

The biggest  fine, which could be as much as #14m is likely to be imposed on  British Sugar, which the EC believes played the leading role in an agreement to gradually raise prices for granulated white sugar on the UK market.  British Sugar, a unit of the food conglomerate Associated British Foods, said it
could not comment on the matter.

TD
EC sources said the case stems from a decision in the 1980s by the  commission to fine British Sugar three million European currency units (#2.1m) for breaching EU competition rules. At the time, the commission accused the company of trying to squeeze Napier Brown, a sugar distributor, out of the
UK market by reducing wholesale prices.

That fine was set at a low level because  British Sugar implemented a compliance programme to bring it into line with EU rules, which forbid agreements that threaten competition. But at about the time the company was fined, it was already working with Tate & Lyle, Napier Brown and another distributor, James Budgett, to boost prices gradually on the  British sugar market, the  commission sources said.

British Sugar and Tate & Lyle, which together hold more than 90% of the British market, brought the distribution firms into the arrangement because the distributors had links with sugar companies on the Continent which would have undermined any attempt to boost prices. The  commission's competition officials were tipped off about the cartel by submissions Tate & Lyle made to the Office of Fair Trading, sources said.

The OFT's own investigations into  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle led the two companies to give court undertakings in late 1996 not to fix prices. The OFT accused the two producers of reaching an agreement on pricing between 1986 and 1990.

The British Sugar ruling is the latest sign of the determination of Karel Van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, to crack down on companies that break EU antitrust rules. The EC is expected soon to fine a Swedish-Swiss company and others for running a heating pipe cartel.

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - British merchant James Budgett Sugars Ltd said on Wednesday it disagreed with a decision by the  European Commission to fine the company for its part in alleged price-fixing in Britain in the late 1980s.

The Commission fined Budgett, jointly owned by commodity and financial serices group ED & F Man and by Irish Sugar, and independent merchant Napier Brown, 1.8 million Ecus each ($2.16 million).

It also fined British Sugar Plc 39.6 million Ecus (47.5 million) and Tate & Lyle seven million Ecus
($8.4 million). "This was a very long time ago, the issues were highly complicated and we disagree with
the findings," David Barratt, managing director of James Budgett Sugars Ltd, told Reuters by phone.

"Naturally we are consulting with our advisers before giving any further response and have to await receipt of the full decision in due course," Barratt added, declining further comment.

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - White sugar futures were firmer but off the highs on Wednesday afternoon after the EU awarded a larger than expected tonnage at the weekly export tender.
The EU granted licences for 123,000 tonnes of white sugar, against trade forecasts of 60,000 to
100,000 tonnes. A maximum rebate of 51.771 Ecus was granted against expectations of 51.810 and
51.820 Ecus.

"It gave the market a temporary boost," said a trader.

At 1625 GMT, near December stood at $217.90 a tonne, up 50 cents, after touching a high of $218.70. March was also up 50 cents at $223.60. Turnover of 2,001 lots was almost entirely in the front two months.

Morning trade featured fund shorts rolling out of December into March. Dec/March last traded at $5.70, against a high of $6.50 and Tuesday's close of $6.00.

BRUSSELS, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday fined British Sugar, Tate & Lyle and two sugar traders for agreeing prices for white granulated sugar in Britain between
1986-1990.
The EU executive  fined British Sugar plc 39.6 million ecus ($47.5 million), Tate & Lyle seven million
($8.4 million) and merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett 1.8 million ecus ($2.16 million) each.

TD
British Sugar, part of Associated British Foods Plc, said it was considering appealing the
Commission decision.

"We have been co-operating with the  Commission during their lengthy investigation and it was our contention there was no effect on prices as a consequence of the charges they were levelling," the company said.

The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, said it had evidence of "numerous meetings" during which the four companies conspired to keep sugar prices high.

The evidence of anti-competitive behaviour was particularly strong for white granulated sugar for industrial use, it said.
The four accounted for around 90 percent of the U.K. market.

Tate & Lyle received a lower  fine because it cooperated with the  Commission including submitting self-incriminating evidence.

"British Sugar was the instigator of the infringements and throughout the relevant period remained the driving force," the  Commission said.
The Commission last year fined Irish Sugar, a subsidiary of Greencore Group , 8.8 million ecus
($10.5 million) for allegedly abusing a dominant position in Ireland.

It had also  fined British Sugar 10 years ago for attempting to squeeze a merchant out of the retail sugar market.

HD          Sugar price fixing  seen as EU-wide problem. BY          By Peter Blackburn

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) -  European Commission fines on British sugar producers and merchants for alleged price fixing only touched the tip of an iceberg and wider investigations are needed, sugar users and analysts said on Wednesday.

"It's an EU-wide problem," said a veteran sugar industry source. "The real reason is the nature of the regime. EU prices do not reflect market reality."

TD
EU consumers pay more than triple the world market white sugar level of currently just under $220 a tonne - which recently slumped to an 11-year low due to abundant global supplies and depressed demand.

Under the EU sugar regime, producers are guaranteed high prices through a system of national production quotas and barriers to keep out cheap imports.

Industrial sugar users in the soft drinks, biscuits, chocolate and chemical industries have long campaigned for lower prices. They absorb about 70 percent of total EU sugar consumption of 12.5 million tonnes annually.

In an interview with Reuters in May, the chairman of the U.K. Industrial Sugar Users' Group, Tom Callnon, said there seemed to be a "gentleman's agreement" among major EU sugar producers to concentrate on their own domestic markets.

"In other words they will not attack outside their own market which restricts international companies from adopting pan-European purchasing policies," he said.

Though one analyst pointed out that EU housewives enjoyed stable sugar supplies and that the sweetener was only a tiny share of the weekly household budget.
One problem is that EU sugar production is highly concentrated.

"There is a very small number of companies and the system is set up in such a way that it's difficult for them not to seek to manipulate the market," the industry source said.

"The Commission is quite right to  fine them for it but the real reason is the nature of the regime," he added.

"If you set up a regime which says you can't have any competition, so long as you are just below the imported price, then whether or not there is a surplus, if there are only a few producers, then those producers will make sure the price is just below."

Britain has a sugar deficit, consuming about 2.2 million tonnes and producing around 1.5 million tonnes. As a deficit market, sugar commands a premium in Britain to the EU guaranteed price but under the "gentleman's agreement" sugar does not flow in from surplus areas.

"With a sensible regime some British companies would seek to compete as they are efficient producers but the regime doesn't let them," the industry source said.

On Wednesday, the EU executive  fined British Sugar plc 39.6 million ecus ($47.5 million), Tate & Lyle seven million ($8.4 million) and merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett 1.8 million ecus ($2.16 million) each for alleged price fixing.
The four are said to control 90 percent of the U.K. market.

Tate & Lyle imports some 1.1 million tonnes of cane sugar from the Commonwealth countries, which mostly groups former British colonies and dominions, under an EU preferential arrangement granted under the Lome convention, a trade and aid pact.

British Sugar has in recent years been producing way above its EU beet sugar quota of 1.144 million tonnes. Excess sugar has to be exported at world market levels.

British Sugar said it was considering an appeal and James Budgett said it disagreed with the EU
decision.

Last year the EU  fined Irish Sugar 8.8 million Ecus ($10.5 million) for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the Irish market, said to be 95 percent. ((Peter Blackburn, London Newsroom +44 171 542

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Weak demand and the end of a
South African refinery strike tipped platinum to a nearly

TD
seven-year low Wednesday while LIFFE white sugar firmed on a
higher-than-expected EU export tender.
Base metals ended slightly lower on the London Metal Exchange amid thin volume, with selling pressure on aluminium setting the tone.
Gold drifted through  Europe in the lower half of its
mid-$290s range, with directionless foreign exchange and equity markets robbing it of external pointers.
Platinum dropped to fix in the London afternoon at $339.00 a troy ounce, the lowest since January 1992.
Dealers said platinum was suffering from the lack of demand for the metal, used in jewellery, vehicle catalysts and electronics.
"The demand for platinum is falling out of bed really. It
is looking very depressed and the feeling is that it might try lower," one London dealer said.
The end of a 15-day strike at major South African producer
Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd's (Implats) refinery complex also undermined prices, said another dealer. London white sugar futures were firmer late after the

European Union's weekly export tender granted licences for
123,000 tonnes of white sugar, up on trade forecasts of 60,000 to 100,000 tonnes.

Whites opened little changed after being whacked down at the close on Tuesday in order to push up the EU export restitution.

"It's a messy market. People are still bearish as there's no real offtake and any technical rallies will run into producer selling," added the trader. Traders forecast that the EU will approve the export of between

Tate & Lyle Plc was  fined seven million Ecu by the  Commission. "Tate and Lyle is reviewing its response to the imposition of this  fine," said a Tate spokesman.
A spokesman for  British Sugar said the dispute dated back to before the company was acquired in
1991 by Associated British Foods.

"We have been co-operating with the  Commission during their lengthy investigation and it was our contention there was no effect on prices as a consequence of the charges they were levelling," said British Sugar.

The Commission, The European Union's antitrust watchdog, said it had evidence of "numerous meetings" during which four companies - including sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett
- had conspired to keep prices high.
The four companies account for about 90 percent of the market for Britain's white granulated sugar. Tate & Lyle received a reduced  fine because it co-operated with the  Commission, including the
submission of self-incriminating evidence, while  British Sugar was seen as a cartel leader, said the
Commission. 171583 3769, uk.equities.news@reuters.com)).

HD          Sugar firms fined #33m for price-fixing. BY          By GRAEME SMITH.

Two British sugar firms have been fined a total of #33million for ripping off customers by conspiring to keep prices high.

The European Competition  Commission yesterday ruled British Sugar and Tate and Lyle had created a cartel run through a series of secret meetings.

TD
The companies, along with two distributors who were also  fined, controlled 90 per cent of the entire white granulated sugar market in Britain.
But the  commission ruled they had collaborated between 1986 and 1990 to keep prices high. Peterborough-based British Sugar was said to have been the main instigator of the cartel and was
fined #28million by the commission.

London-based Tate and Lyle, whose sugar is advertised on television by celebrity chef Gary Rhodes, were fined #5million after giving details of 18 meetings incriminating themselves.
The two distributors, Napier Brown and James Budgett, were  fined #1.2million each.

The fines were welcomed by the Consumers' Association which said customers had suffered considerably from paying inflated prices.

Domestic and commercial sugar buyers were both affected but the CA said it was impossible to put a figure on the rip-off as it wasn't blatant price-fixing.

Instead the  commission found the firms could be sure their rivals would not compete strongly on price because of the regular discussions they had.
But one expert said the punishment was too small to seriously damage the value of the companies. Mark Lynch, analyst at stock-brokers Warburg Dillon Reed, said: "Is #28million a lot of money? Yes. Is
it material to the finances of  British Sugar? No."
AB Foods, which bought  British Sugar in 1991, reaped pre-tax profits of #850million last year while
Tate and Lyle reported profits of #160million.

British Sugar said it planned to appeal against the decision and Tate and Lyle said they were
"considering our options".

FOOD giants  British Sugar and Tate and Lyle were  fined Pounds 33million yesterday - for fixing the price of sugar.

Before the secret deal in June 1986 the firms, which supply 90 per cent of the UK's sugar, were in a price war which saw a 2lb bag drop to about 50p.

TD
After the agreement prices rose to up to 75p. The firms' representatives met 18 times in four years to fix prices.
Since the scam was exposed in the early 1990s the price of sugar has remained stable.

The European Competition  Commission fined Peterborough-based  British Sugar Pounds 28 million and London-based Tate and Lyle Pounds 5million.

FINES totalling 50.2 million ecu have been imposed on  British sugar companies by the European         Commission, which said the firms concerned had breached EU competition rules by coordinating their pricing policies. British Sugar was fined 39.6 million ecu, Tate & Lyle was ordered to pay 7 million ecu, and Napier Brown and James Budget were both  fined 1.8 million ecu. The  Commission found evidence of numerous meetings between

the parties which took place at regular intervals between 1986 and July 1990. During this period, the four companies controlled around 90% of the entire white granulated sugar market in the UK.

THE Commission this week approved proposals for a regulatory framework for the distance-selling of financial services. The plan aims to offer a high level of protection to consumers of retail financial services such as insurance, banking and investment trading by telephone. Under the draft rules, consumers would have the right to a 14-day 'cooling-off period' to reconsider their purchases if they had
not received the full terms and conditions of a contract before they signed or if they were put under unfair pressure. The cooling-off period would be extended to 30 days for consumer mortgages, life insurance and pensions.

COMPETITION Commissioner Karel van Miert's spokesman said this week it was still "an open question" whether the institution would impose  fines as a result of an investigation into Swedish company Skanska AB's stake in building materials group Scancem. The  Commission opened a full four-month probe in
July into a deal under which the company raised its share of votes in Scancem to 48%.

CREDIT card companies Visa USA and MasterCard International will not face an EU probe after US authorities accused them of unfair practices to keep competitors at bay and challenged their control by the same group of banks. The  Commission said the matter would not be probed by its anti-trust officials because there were no Union firms directly involved.

A GERMAN Internet venture between DeTeOnline GmbH, Axel Springer Verlag AG, Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH and Internet Corporation has been cleared by the  Commission. The new company, WSI Webseek Infoservice, will provide free search and navigation services for German Internet users.

TRANSPORT Commissioner Neil Kinnock's spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said this week that all his concerns about a new Italian decree on air traffic distribution at Milan's two airports had been answered by Rome. She said Kinnock was satisfied that the decree, which allows four out of ten passengers to continue using Linate airport (which is closer to the city centre than the Malpensa terminal), did not breach EU law.

The European Commission fined four British sugar companies a total of 50.2 million  European
currency units (US$60.35 million) for collaborating to raise sugar prices in Britain eight years ago.

British Sugar PLC, a division of Associated British Foods PLC and supplier of more than half Britain's sugar, was  fined 39.6 million Ecu for its role as "instigator," the EC said. Tate & Lyle, Britain's second-biggest sugar supplier, was  fined seven million Ecu, while sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were  fined 1.8 million Ecu each.

TD
British Sugar said it "cooperated fully" with the investigation and it will appeal the ruling. Analysts said Tate & Lyle is likely to appeal as well.

British Sugar and Tate & Lyle collaborated to raise retail prices for white granulated sugar from June
1986 to July 1990, the EC said yesterday. All four companies pursued a similar strategy for
wholesale sales of white granulated sugar, it said.

The four companies together controlled about 90% of the white granulated sugar market during the four-year period.

Britain's two biggest sugar producers and two sugar merchants were yesterday  fined a total of ECU
50.2m ( #35.5m) by the  European Commission for fixing prices and rigging the market for white
granulated sugar in the UK in the late 1980s.

British Sugar got the steepest  fine of ECU 39.6m for its role as "the driving force" behind the cartel and for having initiated the first price-fixing meeting. The company said it would appeal against the decision.

TD
Tate &Lyle's  fine of ECU 7m was sharply reduced because of its decision to collaborate fully with the Brussels authorities. During the six-year investigation, the company handed over two self-incriminating letters. The sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were each  fined ECU 1.8m.

According to the  Commission the cartel operated between June 1986 and July 1990, during which time the four companies controlled 90% of the white granulated sugar market in the UK. It began with a meeting on June 20 1986 between  British Sugar and Tate &Lyle. Napier Brown and James Budgett joined in later that year.

Brussels uncovered evidence of 18 further meetings during which  British Sugar told the other parties the target prices it hoped to reach for industrial sugar. There were a further eight meetings between British Sugar and Tate &Lyle during which they discussed their discounting policies and  British Sugar revealed its pricing policy.

The Commission said that while it did not have enough evidence to prove price fixing, the regular meetings "led to an atmosphere of mutual certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour."

British Sugar was treated more harshly than the others partly because of its high market share and its position as price leader. But Brussels also maintains that having waged an unsuccessful price war against its competitors it took the initiative in setting up the cartel.

Yesterday  British Sugar said the events took place under previous management and before its acquisition in 1991 by Associated British Foods.

Napier Brown and James Budgett were let off more lightly. The  Commission said that because they were dependent on supplies from  British Sugar and Tate &Lyle for much of the sugar they sold as merchants, their ability to influence the market and exercise power over prices was limited.

British Sugar, based in Peterborough, was described as the instigator of the cartel and fined #28m. London-based Tate and Lyle was  fined #5m after providing evidence to the commission, including self-incriminatory details.
Distributors Napier Brown and James Budgett were each  fined #1.2m.

However, there is little prospect that the move will lead to lower sugar prices. The cartel, which began in 1986, ceased to operate four years later.
The commission, which started its investigation in 1991, found the four companies implemented a
"collaborative strategy of higher pricing".

In its ruling, it described how the two production companies first met in June 1986, when the cartel was formed. The merchants joined a few months later.

Over the next four years, the companies held a total of 18 meetings to discuss pricing and between them controlled 90% of the white sugar market in the UK.

The merchants were involved in discussions about the industrial price for sugar, while Tate & Lyle and British Sugar conspired over the retail prices.

The commission concluded the four did not fix prices precisely, but that because of the discussions each could be sure the others would not compete strongly on price.

Singling out  British Sugar, it stated: "It was the instigator of the infringements and remained the driving force."

British Sugar pointed out that the case related to events which took place under a previous management, before the company was taken over by Associated British Foods. It said it would appeal against the  fine.
Tate & Lyle expressed surprise at the size of its  fine, adding that it, too, might appeal.

Its spokesman, arguing that  British Sugar was the market leader in the UK and alone had the power to dictate prices, said: "They are the price leaders and we are the followers."

A commission spokesman explained that the case had been dealt with at a  European, rather than national level, because the companies' actions tended to exclude foreign competitors from the British market.

He characterised the  fines as "quite high", but pointed out that the maximum  fine which could have been imposed was 10% of each individual company's annual turnover.
Although yesterday's  fine is a major one, it is not a record. Last month, the  commission imposed a
#191m fine on a container shipping price-fixing cartel.

Analyst Mark Lynch, at stockbrokers Warburg Dillon Reed, said the  fines were too small to seriously damage the value of the companies, adding: "Is #28m a lot of money? Yes. Is it material to the finances of  British Sugar? No."

AB Foods, which bought  British Sugar in 1991, reaped pre-tax profits of #850m in its last full year. Its sales reached #5.2bn. Tate & Lyle reported pre-tax profits of #160m on sales on #4.3bn.

BRUSSELS has imposed  fines totalling #33m on Britain's sugar barons for rigging the market in secret meetings between 1986 and 1990.

The European Commission has imposed the largest penalty on  British Sugar, which it accused of being the instigator and driving force of the price-fixing. BS is appealing against a  fine of 39.6m ecus. Its rival, Tate & Lyle, whose chief executive is Larry Pillard, escaped with a  fine of just 7m ecus. Napier Brown and James Budgett, the sugar merchants, have each been  fined 1.8m ecus.

TD
The Commission said that Tate & Lyle's  fine was substantially reduced to take into account its
co-operation with the investigation which included "submitting two self-incriminating letters ... these two
letters adduced decisive evidence of the cartel's existence and allowed the  Commission to intervene."

British Sugar said the events took place under previous management and that the company had
co-operated fully with the investigation.  British Sugar "contended throughout that there had been no
effect on prices as a consequence". The price-fixing followed a price war led by BS in the early 1980s.
According to the  Commission, it tried to end hostilities at a meeting in 1986 with T&L. At 18 further
meetings BS and the other companies discussed target prices and discounts to retail customers.

BRITISH Sugar and Tate & Lyle were  fined a total of #33 million yesterday after the European Competition Commission found that the two companies - along with two British sugar distributors - had created a cartel designed to keep UK sugar prices high.

British Sugar, based in Peterborough, was described as the instigator of the cartel and was  fined
#28 million by the  commission.

TD
London-based Tate & Lyle was fined about #5 million after providing evidence to the commission, including details which incriminated itself.
The two distributors, Napier Brown and James Budgett, were  fined #1.2 million each. According to the  commission, the cartel operated between 1986 and 1990.

British Sugar issued a statement in which it emphasised that the case took place under a
previous management and before it was taken over by Associated British Foods, its current parent
company. The company said it would appeal against the  fine.

A Tate & Lyle spokesman said the firm was surprised by the size of the  fine and was considering its options.

The commission found that the two sugar producers first met in June 1986, when the cartel was formed. The sugar merchants joined a few months later.
During the next four years, they controlled 90% of the white sugar market in the UK.

The merchants were involved in discussions about the industrial price for sugar while Tate & Lyle and British Sugar conspired over the retail prices.
The four companies had a total of 18 meetings over the four years to discuss pricing.

The commission concluded the four did not fix prices precisely between them, but because of these discussions each could be sure the others would not compete strongly on price. It concluded that there had existed a "collaborative strategy of higher pricing".

The competition watchdog said the  fines had been set according to the size of the companies and their share of the sugar market.

But it singled out  British Sugar as having aggravated its offence, saying: "British Sugar was the instigator of the infringements and throughout the relevant period remained the driving force."
The commission has been carrying out its investigation into the sugar cartel since 1991. Mark Lynch, of stockbrokers Warburg Dillon Reed, said the  fines were too small to seriously
damage the value of the companies.

AB Foods, which bought  British Sugar in 1991, reaped pre-tax profits of #850 million in its last full year. Its sales reached #5.2 billion.

FINES ON PRODUCERS (BRITISH SUGAR, TATE & LYLE) AND TWO SUGAR MERCHANTS IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR UNLAWFUL PRICE COORDINATION.

TD
Brussels, 14/10/1998 (Agence Europe) - Following the conclusions of Competition Commissioner Karel
van Miert, the European Commission imposed fines on two sugar producers and two sugar merchants in
the United Kingdom, for having restricted competition through coordination of their pricing policy on the
British white granulated sugar market. The  fines are:-ECU 39.6 million for producer  British Sugar and 7
million for Tate & Lyle;-ECU 1.8 million each for Napier Brown and James Budgett, merchants.A note from
the spokesperson explains that the decision covers concerted strategies for price increases over the period
1986-1990, during which the companies involved controlled about 90% of the white granulated sugar
market in Great Britain. The  Commission states it has proof of numerous meetings between the parties.
The principles of anti-competitive behaviour had been defined from the outset between British Sugar and
Tate & Lyle, and the merchants then joined in the agreement. Targeted prices were given by British Sugar
and discount policies were defined for large clients. The  Commission considers that the participation of the
four parties in regular meetings on industrial sugar, and the regular meetings of  British Sugar and Tate &
Lyle on the retail sugar industry, are sufficient proof of the existence of a cartel and the intention to pursue
a concerted price policy strategy for higher prices. The Commission does not, however, have specific
proof relating to the fixing of common prices.In determining the fines, the Commission used its
"guidelines" in this field as a basis. It felt that the infringement was serious and of medium duration.  British
Sugar is fined more heavily than the others as this company, states the  Commission, has been the
instigator of infringements and the driving force for application of the infringements. In addition, British      
Sugar acted in a manner contrary to the clear wording contained in its full comprising compliance
programme for respect of Community law, that it had presented to the  Commission in October 1986, on
the occasion of another competition case (attempt to exclude Napier Brown from the retail market). For
Tate & Lyle, on the other hand, the  Commission has considerably reduced the  fine because of the way it
cooperated in the investigation (it had allowed the  Commission to examine two self-incriminating letters,
thus giving the  Commission decisive proof as to the existence of a cartel and allowing it to intervene).

CAMILLO FRACASSINI.

BRITAIN'S biggest sugar companies have been  fined a total of #33 million for conspiring to keep their prices artificially high.

TD
British shoppers and manufacturers paid inflated prices for four years as a result of the cartel formed by British Sugar, Tate & Lyle and two  British sugar distributors, the  European Competition  Commission has found.
Using their stranglehold on the market, the companies kept retail and industry prices for granulated
white sugar artificially high, meaning that consumers paid too much, not just for granulated sugar but for
thousands of processed food products containing sugar. These include breakfast cereals, chocolate
confectionery, cakes, biscuits, baked beans and ready meals.

British Sugar was described as the instigator of the cartel by the  commission and fined #28 million.

The company had broken an assurance given ten years ago that it would not act anti-competitively again after being  fined #2.1 million by the  European Commission for trying to squeeze a sugar merchant out of business.

Tate & Lyle, which is based in London and processes sugar cane, was  fined about #5 million after providing evidence to the  commission, including details which incriminated itself.

Napier Brown and James Budgett, the two distributors, were  fined #1.2 million each for their involvement with the cartel which operated between 1986 and 1990.

Last night, the Consumers' Association welcomed the  commission's ruling but criticised the British authorities for not having acted themselves.

Mark Purdy, senior policy researcher for the Consumers' Association, said: "We welcome strong action to root out cartels in this or any other industry. British consumers will clearly have suffered a considerable loss through inflated prices brought about by this sugar cartel."

The seven-year investigation by the European Commission found that Tate & Lyle and  British Sugar which controlled 90 per cent of the British sugar market, formed the cartel in June 1986. The meeting followed a price war between the two companies.

The two sugar merchants were brought into the cartel a few months later because of their links with foreign sugar companies which could have undermined efforts to keep prices artificially high. The merchants were involved in discussions about the industrial price for sugar, while Tate & Lyle and British Sugar conspired over the retail prices..

While the  commission concluded that the four did not fix prices, it said there had been an understanding during the discussions that the companies would not compete strongly on price. It concluded a "collaborative strategy of higher pricing" had existed.

The commission singled out British Sugar, which owns the best-selling Silver Spoon brand, as having aggravated its offence. Its report said: "British Sugar was the instigator of the infringements and throughout the relevant period remained the driving force."

The commission has been carrying out its investigation into the sugar cartel since 1991. Officials found about the cartel following submissions by Tate & Lyle to the Office of Fair Trading in 1990.

The commission fined British Sugar #2.1 million in 1988 for attempting to put a sugar merchant out of business.

The company escaped with the limited fine after it gave an undertaking to abide by EU rules forbidding anti-competitive agreements. British Sugar said while Tate & Lyle said it was reviewing its options.

IF EVER a judgment was passed to benefit the consumer it was surely yesterday with  British Sugar and Tate and Lyle fined a total of #33million for conspiring to keep sugar prices artificially high. The European Competition Commission, in fining the pair, has made it clear that no form of cartel is acceptable. The irony is that, previously, the companies had been involved in a price war with each other and the cartel arrangement sprang from a desire to end the war. To the man in the street, the figure is an astronomical amount. But to big business, it is merely a dent in their operation. Analysts believe the fines are too small to damage the value of either company. News of the  fine will, however, spread through industry generally and it will fire a warning shot across the bows of any company with similar designs. And for the consumer, this can only be positive.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Union fined four British sugar companies a total of $60.2-million
(U.S.) yesterday for violating EU rules on price fixing.
The EU's executive  commission said it imposed fines of $47.5-million against  British Sugar PLC
and $8.4-million against Tate & Lyle.

TD
Sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were also found guilty of violating EU
price-fixing rules and were each  fined $2.2-million.

The four companies were fined because of their "collaborative strategy of higher pricing" on the sugar market in Britain, a commission statement said.

British Sugar said it will appeal.

The commission said the infringements took place between 1986 and 1990. At the time, the four companies represented about 90 per cent of the entire white granulated sugar market in Britain.

THE European Commission yesterday imposed fines totalling more than #35m on  British Sugar, Tate & Lyle and two sugar distributors for price fixing.

British Sugar, which was fined #27.7m, said it would appeal against the ruling. The  commission said Tate & Lyle's co-operation with the EU cartel inquiry led to a reduced  fine of #5m. The two sugar merchants, Napier Brown and James Budgett, were each  fined #1.26m.

TD
A commission official said that, under EU competition guidelines,  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle had initially each faced  fines of about #14m, but  British Sugar's fine was increased because of its key role in setting prices on wholesale and retail markets.

British Sugar, a unit of Associated British Foods, also reneged on pledges it made in a previous EU monopolies case, the  commission said. It was  fined #2.1m in 1988 for trying to squeeze Napier Brown out of the retail sugar business.
In contrast, Tate & Lyle provided "decisive evidence of the cartel's existence", the  commission said.

British Sugar insisted it had co-operated fully with the  commission and said that the case involved events under a previous management before its acquisition by Associated British Foods. The company also claimed that its actions had "no effect on prices".
Although the fines were below recent record-level penalties imposed by Brussels, the size of the
British Sugar fine reflects the  commission's determination to crack down on cartels.
The commission accused British Sugar of waging a price war against competitors in the early to mid
1980s and later seeking their co-operation to boost prices.

It said the four companies held numerous meetings between 1986 and 1990 to discuss pricing. "In an initial meeting between  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle on 20 June 1986, the principles of the future anti-competitive conduct were set. The merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett joined this conduct before the end of 1986," the  commission said.

A further 18 meetings were held, it said, during which  British Sugar told the others of its target prices for industrial sugar.

For retail sugar, there were eight more meetings between  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle, where British Sugar revealed its pricing policy to Tate & Lyle and the two companies discussed discounts for large retail customers.

While the  commission did not find sufficient evidence that prices were fixed jointly, the meetings "led to an atmosphere of mutual certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour," the  commission's statement said.

Associated British Foods, which took over  British Sugar in 1991, recorded pre-tax profits of #850m last year on sales of #5.2bn. Tate & Lyle had pre-tax profits of #159m on sales of #4.1bn.

BRITISH SUGAR and Tate & Lyle were  fined a total of #33m by the  European Commission yesterday for operating an illegal cartel which inflated the price paid for sugar by consumers and retailers for four years.

The two companies and two merchants, who were also in on the deal, held a total of 27 meetings to discuss prices. Together they controlled around 90 per cent of Britain's white granulated sugar market.

TD
British Sugar, the instigator of the cartel, bore the brunt of yesterday's  Commission action, being fined #28m, as opposed to Tate & Lyle's #5m, reduced because of its co-operation. The two distributors, Napier Brown and James Budgett, were  fined #1.2m each.

British Sugar said it would appeal against the EC decision. The company said in a statement that it had "vigorously defended" its case. The company maintained that "that there had been no effect on prices" as a result of the events investigated by the EC. Tate & Lyle was unavailable for comment.

Yesterday's  fines end a saga of price manipulation which began with an attempt by  British Sugar to slash prices and drive others out of the market.

In 1986 British Sugar found itself under financial pressure and switched tactics, instigating a meeting with its rival, Tate & Lyle, which took place on 20 June 1986. The object, the  Commission said, was "to replace this price war by a collaborative strategy of higher pricing with its competitors".
By the end of 1986 the two sugar producers had been joined by two merchants, Napier Brown and
James Budgett, and systematic discussion continued until 2 July 1990.

During meetings the firms discussed the figures they aimed to pay for industrial sugar and the prices they would charge for products, including the discounts which would be given to big retail customers.
The merchants held talks about the industrial price for sugar, while Tate & Lyle and  British Sugar
colluded over retail prices.

In a statement yesterday the  Commission said that even if it could not prove that specific prices were fixed, the talks "led to an atmosphere of mutual certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour.

"Each of them could reply, if not on the precise price levels of the other participants, at least on their intentional pursuit of the collaborative strategy of higher pricing".

A Commission source said yesterday that it was impossible to estimate how much the consumer had lost because prices had first been artificially reduced by  British Sugar, then hiked. Nobody could judge the real market price in the mid and late 1980s, he said.

The cartel came to light after an admission from Tate &Lyle, which wrote two self-incriminating letters to the Office of Fair Trading. That resulted in an action in the Restrictive Practices Court against  British   Sugar and Tate & Lyle in December 1996.

The OFT copied the letters to the  Commission which said yesterday that they contained "decisive evidence of the cartel's existence and allowed the  Commission to intervene in this case".

The penalties fall well below the maximum  fines imposed for breach of  European competition rules. Last month the  Commission imposed a #191m fine on 16 companies which operated a price-fixing cartel on transatlantic container shipping.

The European Commission has fined British Sugar, Tate & Lyle , Napier Brown and James Budgett a combined Ecu50m (35.8m stg) for their role attempting to fix sugar markets during the late 1980s. Said
to have been the cartel's leader,  British Sugar was fined Ecu39.6m, while T&L was  fined Ecu7m and Napier Brown and James Budgett Ecu1.8m each. British Sugar has said it will appeal the decision, and added it had 'co-operated fully with the commission'. - FORD LOSSES IN  EUROPE HIT 160M STG.

TD
Automotive group Ford has reported that losses for the third quarter nearly doubled from $140m to
$273m (160m stg) as a result of marketing and production costs related to the launch of the Ford Focus.
Also contributing to the losses were lower car part exports to emerging markets. In North America, net
income rose from $620m to $900m, while the group as a whole reported a 10 per cent increase in profits
to $1bn and a decline in revenues from $36.1bn to $32.6bn. - KINGFISHER SET TO WIN VCI AS RIVAL
BACKS DOWN

Retail group Kingfisher appears set to acquire video and music publishing group VCI following Scottish Media 's decision to withdraw from the bidding. Scottish Media sold its 26.4 per cent in VCI to Kingfisher after deciding not to top the retailer's 120p per share offer. VCI's board has recommended the Kingfisher bid, which values it at 47m stg, more than double its current market value. Scottish Media said it would gain 3.4m stg from the sale of its VCI stake and would continue to seek expansions through acquisitions and organic growth. THE TIMES - VIAGRA FAILS TO BOOST PFIZER.

Despite the immense success of anti-impotence pill Viagra, US drugs group Pfizer has reported just a 15 per cent increase in third quarter profits to $667m (392m stg). While US doctors wrote 300,000 prescriptions for Viagra in May, the number is said to have halved since then, and the drug's launch in Europe did not meet with the anticipated effect. The company also said profits were not higher because of a number of charges and long-term investments in new drugs. Shares in Pfizer were marked down 10 per cent on Wednesday as a result of the poorer-than-expected results. - HMV MEDIA ON TRACK FOR FLOAT

The HMV Media Group, which encompasses HMV music stores and the Dillons and Waterstone's book shops, has said it will proceed with plans to float within the next two years despite the current market turmoil. Joint chief executive Alan Giles said the group is 'very much on track' and that its long-term financing would allow it to choose the best time for an IPO in coming months. HMV Media will open 15 large stores in the UK and five superstores in North America and  Europe before the end of 2000. Maiden pre-tax losses for the three months to July 25 were 15m stg on operating profit of 2.3m stg. - C&W SIGNS $300M DEAL WITH SERVICENET.
Telecoms group Cable & Wireless has signed a $300m deal to provide voice and data services in over
40 countries to ServiceNet. ServiceNet, the joint venture between Andersen Consulting and GTE, was
formed in 1996 to run advanced computer software for large corporations. Its chief executive, John
Whiteside, said the agreement with C&W would provide 'the foundation for ServiceNet's worldwide
collaboration, business infrastructure and business process initiatives.'

THE GUARDIAN - INVESTMENT PACT IN TATTERS

The French government has said it will not participate in the next round of talks scheduled to begin on Monday on the 'multinationals' charter' global investment deal. French prime minister Lionel Jospin said the country would not liberalise rules now only to eventually face an invasion of Hollywood blockbusters which would place its film industry in jeopardy. The US and UK governments have disputed subsidies granted to France's film industry, and British trade minister Brian Wilson has assured 'Britain remains committed to the liberalisation of investment worldwide'. - TINY TYRE FIRM ROLLS INTO CHINA.

Green Tyre, the Teeside upstart which manufactures environmentally-friendly bicycle tyres, has announced plans to construct a factory in China - the world's largest bicycle market. Managing director Colin Scarsi said the group expects 'major benefits' from the Chinese venture, as there are currently over half a billion cycles in the market and it is growing by 36m a year. The factory will be run by a Chinese business consortium which has invested 4m stg in the project. - IT'S RENOIR AND CHIPS AT $1.9BN CASINO

Steve Wynn's $1.9bn Bellagio casino will open in Las Vegas on Thursday. The casino includes a miniature version of Lake Como, a gallery of  fine art, mosaic-tile floors, etched glass ceilings and 3,000 guest rooms. Wynn believes Las Vegas has become saturated with run-of-the-mill casinos, and says the luxurious Bellagio will attract a more sophisticated, worldly market. Despite the considerable emphasis
he has placed in the development of Bellagio, Wynn has reassured employees of his other properties that the older casinos are as important as Bellagio.
THE INDEPENDENT - DAIWA PUTS LONDON BANK UP FOR SALE IN  EUROPEAN RETREAT. Japanese broking giant Daiwa Securities has placed Daiwa  Europe, its UK banking arm, up for sale.
The move follows the merger of Daiwa's capital markets activities with those of Sumitomo , and the
subsequent decision by both groups to concentrate on securities. The business was valued at 160m in
march, and Paribas has been appointed to seek a buyer. Analysts believe that due to the current state of
the financial markets, Paribas may have a hard time finding a buyer willing to pay that much. - GRE JOB
CUTS RISE BY 300 AS OFFICES ARE SHUT

Guardian Royal Exchange is to eliminate 300 jobs at its Eastbourne and Folkestone offices through its merger with health insurer PPP. Full redundancy packages will be offered to all staff unable to be assigned a job elsewhere within the group. As a result of the merger, Guardian will also drop its name from all of its healthcare products and replace them with the PPP brand name. GRE now hopes to achieve annual savings of 25m stg from the merger - up from initial projected savings of 15m stg. - DIET AID LIFTS SCOTIA HOPES.

UK biotech group Scotia Holdings has indicated it is close to signing a multi-million dollar deal with a major food group for the worldwide rights to its Olibra slimming ingredient. Olibra, derived from palm and oat oil, can stifle one's appetite and is currently used in the Maval brand of yoghurt. Scotia has indicated it would like to see the ingredient used in soups and salad dressings as well. Unigate , Danone , DelMonte and Procter & Gamble are leading candidates to acquire the rights to Olibra. Copyright 1998. Financial Times Information Limited. All Rights Reserved.

BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said on Thursday that the fines imposed by the European Commission on British Sugar , and three other U.K. sugar companies showed the EU sugar regime might have to be reformed.
"I think the regime works but as the U.K. case shows, you can misuse any regime," Fischler told
Reuters, adding: "I can't exclude that in the future another regime...could take place. more.

TD
The Commission fined British Sugar, owned by Associated British Foods, 39.6 million Ecus and imposed reduced penalties on Tate & Lyle and two traders for coordinating the price for white granulated sugar between 1986 and 1990.

Industry observers believe the companies' anti-competitive behaviour may to a certain extent have been encouraged by the EU sugar regime which guarantees minimum prices to manufacturers.

A Commission source said on Thursday that  British Sugar, which the  Commission said was the "instigator" of the British cartel, had tried to convince France's Beghin Say to take part in the deal. But Beghin Say had refused, sensing the danger, he said.

The European Commission announced on Wednesday that it has decided to impose  fines totalling 50.2 million ECU (around [pounds]35.5 million at current rates) on four  British sugar companies for conspiring to co-ordinate their domestic white granulated sugar prices, and thereby restricting competition.

The Commission claims that meetings between sugar producers  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle began on June20 1986 at which "the principles of the future anti-competitive conduct were set." A further eight meetings followed, according to a  Commission statement, "in which the two companies discussed their respective discount policies towards large retail customers."

TD
Two sugar merchants (Napier Brown and James Budgett) joined the "cartel" towards the end of 1986, and this, the  Commission said, led to a series of 18 discussions over the co-ordination of industrial sugar prices in a collaboration that continued until June 2, 1990. At the time, the four parties held 90% of the British white granulated sugar market.
"Collaborative strategy" on pricing

Although there is no evidence of actual price fixing, the  Commission argues that through the cartel the companies "could rely, if not on the precise price levels of the other participants, at least on their intentional pursuit of the collaborative strategy of higher pricing."

The Commission has calculated the  fines individually, according to the level of participation of each party. British Sugar, as a prominent figure on the sugar markets and as the instigator and main player in the collaboration, has received a 39.6m ECU  fine (approximately [pounds]28m). The company has said that it will appeal against the decision.

Tate & Lyle, another company with a significant share in the market, saw its  fine reduced to 7m ECU ([pounds]5m) as a result of its co-operation with the  Commission in exposing the cartel's activities.

Napier Brown and James Budgett face  fines of I .8m ECU each [pounds]1 3m), taking into account that the two merchants were not involved in the initiative from the beginning and only participated over industrial sugar prices. The  Commission also believes that their involvement had no major influence on the market as both were considered to be largely dependent on supplies from  British Sugar and Tate & Lyle.

British Sugar accused before

British Sugar has previously faced Commission legal action between 1986 and 1988, when the company was fined for trying to force Napier Brown out of the market in a price war. During the procedure,  British   Sugar agreed to comply with the  Commission in order to reduce its  fine.

It now appears that while  Commission proceedings were under way in the "Napier Brown-decision", the two companies had ended hostilities and were already in collusion to fix prices, the Commission
statement goes on. As a result,  British Sugar was in clear breach of its own promises to the Commission. The Commission considers these to be "aggravating factors" which have been taken into account in the current decision.

HD    COMPETITION - SUGAR GIANTS FORCED TO SWALLOW COMMISSION'S BITTER PILL. WC   554 words

After a ten-year legal investigation by competition officials at the European Commission, the axe finally fell on October 14, when the EU executive announced that British Sugar and Tate & Lyle, along with sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budget are being fined for price fixing on the white granulated sugar market in the UK during the mid-1980s. Confident now that the companies involved actually agreed on a "collaborative strategy of higher pricing", the  Commission has imposed fines of ECU 39.6m on British Sugar, ECU 7m on Tate & Lyle and ECU 1.8m each on Napier Brown and James Budget.

TD
The price-collusion meetings which the  Commission's investigation uncovered - some 26 in total - (and subsequent price fixing, which its Competition Directorate-General could not prove) are said to have taken place between June 20 and July 2 (for  British Sugar and Tate and Lyle) and from the end of 1986 until July 1990 (for Napier Brown and James Budget) where the four British companies allegedly arranged with each other targeted prices they intended to obtain, through both industrial and retail sugar deals with distributors. During this period, the companies accounted for around 90% of the sugar market in Great Britain.

The fines have been calculated on the basis that the infringements were serious and of medium duration - a new rule which replaces the previous system of gauging the companies' turnover and, perhaps more importantly, the fact that the  Commission was able to conclude its investigation based on Tate & Lyle's admission that the meetings actually took place; the sugar producer had previously submitted two
self-incriminating letters, whereas with  British Sugar, "aggravating factors" had to be taken into consideration by the cartel investigation team of DG IV.

Ultimately, the  Commission could not prove that price-fixing agreements had actually been executed, although it was adamant that "the regular meetings led to an atmosphere of certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour". Under Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty a
concerted practice had taken place which could have affected trade and pricing - binding legislation sufficient to prosecute the sugar companies and the distributors.

Karel Van Miert's spokesman added: "British Sugar was the instigator of the infringements and throughout the relevant period remained the driving force. In fact, having waged a price war against its competitors, it took the initiative to replace the price war by a collaborative strategy of higher pricing with its competitors".

British Sugar to challenge fine.

British Sugar, a company owned by Associated British Foods, has on a previous occasion been  fined for breaking EU competition rules and immediately responded to the  Commission's decision by vowing to have the decision overturned in the  European Courts in Luxembourg. Its principal defence to the charges is that the events all took place during a period before  British Sugar was bought by Associated British Foods in 1991. Geoff Lancaster,  British Sugar's Public Relations Officer, told  European Report that the company was presently talking with its legal counsel over "the complexity of the issues involved
responsible for the protracted nature of this case which  British Sugar has vigorously defended...British    Sugar will be appealing against this decision".

British Sugar has been fined #28m by the European Commission for a price fixing cartel with Tate & Lyle and sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett.

Between 1986 and 1990 the four operated a cartel to inflate the price of white granulated sugar on the industrial and retail markets in the UK.

TD
Tate & Lyle had a lesser  fine of #5m on the basis it had co-operated by providing "decisive evidence". Napier Brown and James Budgett were both fined #1.3m. The four firms collectively represented 90% of the UK white granulated sugar market. The Commission concluded regular contact between the four ensured "an atmosphere of mutual certainty as to the participants' intentions concerning their future pricing behaviour....Each could rely, if not on the precise levels of the other participants, at least on their intentional pursuit of the collaborative strategy of higher pricing."

British Sugar is to appeal.

By ANTONY BARNETT. <'People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices'
- Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (1776).

TD
THE Government's Competition Bill, which aims to crack down hard on cartels and price-fixing, moves a step closer this Tuesday when it returns to the House of Lords.

A timely reminder of the need for urgent and radical reform of the UK's competition law came last week, when the European Commission handed out a #33m  fine to British Sugar and Tate & Lyle for running a cartel that kept sugar prices high for four years.

The two companies, which control 90% of the UK's #1bn-plus white granulated sugar market, held 27 meetings between 1986 and 1990 which, according to the  Commission, led to a 'collaborative strategy of higher pricing'.

The Consumers' Association claims the public and industry have 'suffered considerable loss through inflated prices'.

As Smith rightly surmised, cartels are a fact of life in a free market where companies do anything they can to protect profits.

Professor Richard Whish, competition law expert at King's College, London, said: 'Whenever you have a product which is basic, homogenised and difficult to differentiate - such as cement or sugar - it's easy for cartels to form.'

But until now, the man charged with busting British cartels, John Bridgeman, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), has, by comparison with his  European counterparts, lacked the teeth to do his job properly.

Under existing UK law, before Bridgeman can even investigate whether a cartel exists, he needs documentary evidence to prove that an anti-competitive cabal is in operation. Even then, the OFT can only refer the matter to the Restrictive Practices Court, which itself merely has the power to order the companies to stop fixing prices.

This can take years. Only if the cartel continues to flout the Restrictive Practices Court order can the companies be fined for contempt of court.

Theresa Smallbone, competition policy expert at the National Consumer Council, said: 'It's pretty impossible to break a cartel in the UK at the moment. And there is certainly little deterrent for companies to stop one. The OFT needs proof before it can act, so it's a kind of Catch-22 situation. You are dependent on whistleblowers. And even if companies are found guilty, they have little to fear.'

The Competition Bill, which will bring the UK into line with the EU, will allow Bridgeman to investigate where he has no proof, but simply a reasonable suspicion, that a cartel exists. He will then have strong new powers to act, including being able to launch a dawn raid on a company's head office to seize

Page 79 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
documents and computer files if necessary. Companies found guilty of acting anti-competitively can be
fined 10% of turnover, and directors can be jailed.

Whish said: 'When it comes to breaking cartels, you really need the powers to launch a dawn raid and impose penalties. It will act as a powerful deterrent.'

Those lobbying against the new law, including the Confederation of British Industry, argue that cartels are rare and that the Government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But while there have been relatively few high-profile examples of UK cartels - the last being the ready-mixed concrete market a few years ago - the OFT's cartel taskforce has still been overworked. And even with its comparatively diluted powers it has found evidence of a raft of small UK cartels.

Last month, for instance, the OFT uncovered a cartel operating between two high-technology companies supplying laboratory products. They had secretly swapped information on prices charged to customers and limited the extent to which they undercut each other.
The two companies' sales managers agreed not to compete on price for customers worth more than
#3,000. Bridgeman said this damaged many customers, including hospitals and public bodies.

This case was exposed by whistleblowers, as was a recent case against five companies fixing the prices of ceiling tiles in the UK. Two anonymous individuals working in the industry taped together torn up and discarded scraps of paper detailing an agreement to fix prices.
The OFT also won a recent victory over a cartel in replacement car panels.

The new Competition Bill, which should be in force by March 2000, will mean a big culture change at the OFT. But whether or not it will result in a vigorous trust-busting competition authority, as many competition experts believe is necessary, remains to be seen.

BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday is expected to  fine
Swiss-Swedish engineering firm Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and five small German and Danish firms for
allegedly stifling competition in the market for district heating pipes.
"I have had no news of a postponment (of the decision)," a  Commission spokesman said on Monday.

TD
He refused to give any details and said the decision would probably not be made public until
Wednesday evening.

The Commission will start its weekly meeting at a later-than-usual 1200/1000GMT and it has a range of other issues on the agenda.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog, has been investigating the firms' practices for years among suspicion of price-fixing and carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.

Rival Swedish firm Powerpipe has said that the existence of the cartel was common knowledge in the industry. Besides ABB, the companies concerned are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.

Under 1997 guidelines the  Commission can fine companies found guilty of operating a cartel a base sum of 20 million ecus. But the amounts actually levied in cases since then have varied both upwards and downwards depending on whether a company was ringleader or follower, its size and the seriousness and duration of the infringement.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies, all of them hit with much smaller amounts.

In September it slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).

Volkswagen holds the record for the biggest EU  fine on an individual company at 102 million ecus. ((Amelia Torres +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Europe's food and drinks industry on Monday appplauded the European Commission for fining British sugar companies for price-fixing but suggested the problem was endemic throughout the EU.

"The Commission's latest decision raises serious questions (about) whether the 'collaborative strategy of higher pricing' practised by the British companies in this case has already been replicated between other EU member states," the Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar (CIUS) said in a statement.

TD
The CIUS, representing food and drinks companies responsible for some 70 percent of the EU's annual sugar consumption, also called on the  Commission to start crafting proposals to reform the sugar regime so as to be able to usher in a new system in 2001 "based on competitive principles."

Sugar prices within the EU, argued CIUS, were consistently pegged 8-15 percent above support prices despite present surplus stocks.

The Commission last week fined British Sugar Plc, Tate & Lyle Plc and two sugar traders for agreeing prices for white granulated sugar in Britain between 1986 and 1990.

EU Farm Chief Franz Fischler subsequently acknowledged the EU sugar regime might be ripe for reform. "I can't exclude that in the future another regime...could take place," he said.

London, 19/10/1998 (Agence  Europe) - British Sugar has announced plans to file an appeal in the European Court of Justice against a heavy fine (50.2 million Ecus) imposed on it by the European Commission. The leading  British sugar producer points out that it cooperated with the Commission and that infringement in question had no impact on prices. Tate & Lyle, which received a smaller fine, nonetheless claims to be surprised, as it also cooperated fully in the investigation (which the Commission has acknowledged). Financial analysts say that the  fines will not endanger either firm's financial stability.

BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The European Commission's sugar management committee is looking at ways to set up a statistical base to monitor European Union sugar prices, Commission sources said on Tuesday.
The sources said the idea was not new and had not been triggered by the  Commission's decision
last week to  fine British Sugar and three other U.K companies for allegedly conspiring to keep prices
high.

TD
"This has not influenced us. The idea has been in the pipeline for some time and we had a similar discussion a year ago but it was put on the back-burner," one source told Reuters.

The European Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar (CIUS), which represents the food and beverages industry, on Monday hailed the  Commission's fines and suggested that price-fixing may have been wider than just in Britain.

CIUS noted that EU prices were consistently 8-15 percent higher than the EU's support prices despite structural oversupply.

CIUS Secretary-General Alain Beaumont told Reuters the  European sugar regime, which guarantees minimum prices and sets national production quotas, was the root of the problem.

He added that only a reform of the sector would ensure normal market functioning, but this would take a long time and price monitoring was a step in the right direction.

"The market looks all right in the sense that you have several producers at the  European level, but in practice there is no  European sugar market because of the system of national quotas which fragments the market along national lines," Beaumont said.

The Commission last year fined Irish Sugar for abusing its dominant position in Ireland, but there is little it can do to ensure the market is driven on normal supply-demand rules beyond penalising practices that restrict fair competition.
EU farm ministers set minimum prices and are the only ones empowered to modify the sugar regime. The Commission sources said the sugar committee met last week on setting the statistical database. The Commission currently gets the data from sugar users, chiefly CIUS, one source said, adding that
it would be "useful" to get neutral ex-factory prices.

He said national experts sitting in the committee had agreed to report back on the issue, but one problem was to agree on a common measurement.

Another problem was that sugar production in most EU countries is concentrated in one or a few companies only, so that providing prices, for example, for Britain or Denmark, would be equivalent to revealing the prices of  British Sugar or Danisco, one said.
This could raise confidentiality problems, he added.

BONN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Reform of the  European Union sugar regime is needed in order to create fairer prices for domestic consumers of the commodity, said Karsten Keunecke, managing director of the German confectionery industry association BDS.

"Why should nearly all agricultural market be reformed and sugar be excluded?" he said on Tuesday in response to an inquiry by Reuters.

TD
"We feel encouraged by recent reports showing EU farm Commissioner Franz Fischler seems to be considering changes to the system."

Last week, when the EU imposed  fines on British Sugar Plc, Tate & Lyle and two traders for coordinating prices between 1986 and 1990, Fischler said the sugar regime might have to be reformed.

"A market regime where such practices are possible for such a long time, looks much in need of reform - it needs more market and more competition," Keunecke said.

The self-financing sugar regime, with its provisions for quotas, is not mentioned in the Agenda 2000 farm reform proposal being pursued by the  Commission.

Keunecke said it meant users in the EU were generally paying more for sugar than the EU support price, while producers earned export subsidies and third-country consumers obtained a cheaper price.

Keunecke rejected the argument used by the producing industry that the cost of the sugar regime, which guarantees minimum prices to producers, was neutral for the EU budget.

"This is not quite correct; processors and end-consumers all bear the cost of the artificially high price," he said.

German industrial sugar users consume around 2.3 million tonnes of white sugar annually, of which the confectionery industry accounts for a third.

BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's sugar management committee is holding talks with a view to create a statistical base to monitor sugar prices in the  European Union, Commission sources said on Tuesday.

The officials would not say whether they were concerned about the formation of sugar prices after the Commission last week fined British Sugar and three other U.K companies for conspiring to keep prices high.

TD
"This has not influenced us. The idea has been in the pipeline for quite some time and we had a similar discussion a year ago but it was put on the back burner," one source told Reuters.

The European Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar (CIUS), which represents the food and beverages industry, on Tuesday hailed the  Commission's fines and hinted that the British case may have been copied elsewhere in the 15-nation bloc.
CIUS particularly noted that EU prices were consistently between eight to 15 percent higher than the
Union's support prices despite a situation of structural oversupply.

The Commission sources said that the EU's sugar committee held a meeting last week on setting the statistical base, but reckoned it would be a difficult task.

One of the problems was that sugar production in most EU countries is concentrated in one or a few companies only, meaning that giving the prices, for example, for Britain or Denmark, would be equivalent to revealing the prices of  British Sugar or Danisco , one said. This could raise confidentiality problems, he added.

HD          EU expected to fine ABB in heat pipe case. WC         333 words
PD          21 October 1998

LP
BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to announce on Wednesday a stiff  fine on Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd for allegedly stifling competition in the heating pipes market.

Commission sources said the European Union executive would also punish five small German and
Danish firms.

TD
But they were tight-lipped on the level of the  fines which were expected to be decided at the
Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday afternoon.

A Commission spokesman said an announcement may have to wait until this evening to allow time to inform the companies concerned.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog, has been investigating the firms' practices for years amid suspicion of price-fixing and the carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.

Rival Swedish firm Powerpipe has said the existence of the cartel was common knowledge in the industry. Besides ABB, the companies concerned are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.
Under 1997 guidelines the  Commission can fine companies guilty of cartel operation a base sum of
20 million Ecus ($23.93 million). But amounts actually levied in cases since then have been higher and
lower depending on whether a company was ringleader or not, its size and the seriousness and
duration of the infringement.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies, all of them hit with much smaller amounts.

In September it slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).
Volkswagen holds the record for the biggest EU  fine on an individual company at 102 million ecus. ($1=.8357 Ecu).

BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday fined Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd for allegedly stifling competition in the heating pipes market, a Commission source told Reuters.

Details on the  fine were not available. A  Commission spokesman declined to comment and said a statement was unlikely before 1730/1530GMT.

TD
The European Union's antitrust watchdog was also expected to punish five small German and Danish firms.

The decision was taken at the  Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday afternoon, but the companies concerned must be informed first.

The Commission has been investigating the firms' practices for years amid suspicion of price-fixing and the carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.

Rival Swedish firm Powerpipe has said the existence of the cartel was common knowledge in the industry. Besides ABB, the companies concerned are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.
Under 1997 guidelines the  Commission can fine companies guilty of cartel operation a base sum of
20 million Ecus ($23.93 million). But amounts actually levied in cases since then have been higher and
lower depending on whether a company was ringleader or not, its size and the seriousness and
duration of the infringement.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies, all of them hit with much smaller amounts.

In September it slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).
Volkswagen holds the record for the biggest EU  fine on an individual company at 102 million ecus. ($1=.8357 Ecu).

BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday slapped a 70 million Ecus ($84 million) fine on Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd for allegedly stifling competition in the market for heating pipes.

This was the third largest  fine ever imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog on a single company after Volkswagen in January (102 million Ecus) and Tetra-Pak in 1991 (75 million Ecus).

TD
In a damning statement, the  Commission said ABB and nine smaller companies were guilty of "running a secret market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor."
It said the cartel was started in Denmark in 1990, extended to Germany soon afterwards and from
1994 "the whole  European market, worth around 400 million Ecus, was cartellised."

European antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said it was "difficult to imagine a worse cartel" and added that a former ABB Executive Vice-President directed the cartel. The  Commission did not give his name.
ABB said it had no reaction as it was studying the ruling.

District heating pipes are common in northern and eastern  Europe. Instead of each building being individually heated, whole localities are served via a system of underground pipes carrying hot water into each house from a central power station.

Other companies worst hit were Denmark's Logstor (8.9 million Ecus) and German firms Henss/Isoplus and Pan-Isovit with  fines of 4.95 million Ecus and 1.5 million Ecus respectively.

The Commission had been investigating the firms' practices for years and in 1995 carried out dawn raids at their premises after it received complaints from rival Swedish firm Powerpipe.

"The Commission...found that the cartel systematically tried to force out of business the only competitor not in the 'ring', Powerpipe of Sweden," the statement said.

Powerpipe came under reprisal measures by ABB and the other cartel members especially after it won a contract in Germany "so large that the cartel had allocated it to a consortium of ABB, Henss/Isoplus and Pan-Isovit," the  Commission said.

The ABB  fine was considerably higher than the 20-million-Ecu base sum the  Commission can levy in relation to price-fixing or market-sharing cartels. One aggravating circumstance was the cartel continued for nine months after EU inspectors found incriminating evidence in the surprise raids, the Commission said.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

The ABB cartel is the third such announcement by the  Commission since September, the result of years of active investigations by  European cartel busters who, in Van Miert's recent words, have never been so busy.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies.

In September it also slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).

The European Commission yesterday slapped an ECU 70m ( #50m)  fine on ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering multinational, for its critical role in a price-fixing cartel, which from 1994 controlled the entire European market for insulated steel heating pipes. Nine other companies were  fined a total of ECU
22.21m.

The Commission, the European Union's executive branch, also accused the cartel of trying to force out of business the Swedish company Powerpipe, the only competitor not part of the "ring". "It is difficult to imagine a worse cartel," said Karel Van Miert, the EU competition commissioner. "The main producers tried to bankrupt the only competitor who was willing to take them on. They deliberately flouted EU public procurement rules... and they continued the violation nine months after  Commission investigators
caught them red handed."

TD
ABB said yesterday it had not yet decided whether to appeal against the  fine, among the largest imposed on an individual company.

The other companies involved in the case were Loegstoer, Tarco, and Starpipe of Denmark; Isoplus, Pan-Isovit, Brugg Rorsysteme and Ke-Kelit of Austria and Germany; KWH Tech of Finland, and Sigma Tecnologie di Rivestimento of Italy. Loegstoer got the second biggest  fine of ECU 8.9m.

According to the  Commission the cartel began in Denmark in 1990, but soon spread to cover the entire European market worth around ECU 400m. In Germany and Denmark, the two biggest markets, the cartel operated a sophisticated system of bid rigging under which one company was nominated to win the contract and other cartel members deliberately put in higher offers. Brussels investigators were
tipped off by Powerpipe in 1995 after the cartel members, furious that Powerpipe had won a big project in
Germany, refused to deliver supplies to the Swedish company.

Yesterday was the third time in less than two months that the  Commission, which acts as  Europe's antitrust enforcer, has imposed  fines on companies involved in market-rigging. Earlier this month it punished two British sugar companies and last month it imposed its biggest ever antitrust  fines on 15 of the largest shipping lines. The  Commission said the fines would have been higher if the companies had not owned up to their violations.

HD          EU seen facing struggle to monitor sugar prices. BY           By Peter Blackburn

LP
LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) -  European Commission plans to monitor sugar prices in the 15 member states of the  European Union may prove difficult to implement, industry sources said.

They were reacting to comments by  Commission officials this week that the the EU's sugar management committee was looking at ways to set up a statistical base to monitor EU sugar values.

TD
The disclosure followed hefty EU fines last week on British Sugar , Tate & Lyle Plc and two British  
sugar merchants for alleged price fixing in the late 1980s.

Last year the EU  fined Irish Sugar and it has also penalised Suiker Unie of the Netherlands for the same practices.

"One problem is that there's a whole raft of prices," said one trade source. "There is the listed price and then numerous negotiated prices with large chocolate producers down to local sweets manufacturers."

Another difficulty is that in most EU countries sugar production is concentrated among very few companies which are unwilling to reveal confidential commercial information.
Prices vary according to tonnage, quality, delivery period and other contract terms.

Prices quoted by sugar producers were way off what people were actually paying, said an industry source, adding that they were usually much higher.

For a more balanced view, the  Commission would need to question sugar purchasers as well as sellers, the source added.

The European Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar (CIUS) has complained that EU sugar prices were consistently eight to 15 percent higher than EU support prices despite surplus stocks.

In a statement this week, it suggested that price-fixing was endemic throughout the EU and called for reforms to allow greater price competition.

In France, the French sugar intervention board FIRS said that in October 1997 the  European              Commission had released a list of sugar prices in each member state.
The list included prices quoted by CIUS suggesting sugar prices in France were between 16.9 and
17.2 percent higher than support prices.

"FIRS conducted its own survey because we felt the gap was very large. What we found out was that the gap was of less than 10 percent," a FIRS official said. FIRS released its findings in December
1997.

On the users' side, the Alliance 7 group, which represents French chocolate and confectionery groups, said it had nothing to add to what CIUS said.


Page 106 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Other national user groups were also reticent to speak out.
But in Germany, the managing director of the German confectionery industry association BDS, Karsten
Keunecke, said that sugar reform was needed in order to create fairer prices for domestic consumers.

"We feel encouraged by recent reports showing EU farm Commissioner Franz Fischler seems to be considering changes to the system," Keunecke told Reuters.
Trade sources said it would be difficult to obtain accurate pricing information in countries, such as
Denmark and Britain, where there were only one or two producers.

"You can't force people to disclose details of confidential commercial contracts," said one source, adding that maybe the  Commission was exceeding its mandate.

But if market prices were 15 pct above the intervention level then that was a matter of concern, the source added.

CIUS Secretary General Alain Beaumont told Reuters in Brussels that the EU sugar regime, which guarantees producers high prices through national production quotas and barriers to block cheap imports, was the root problem.

"The fault is with the structure of the EU sugar system and is EU-wide," a British industry source said, adding that efficient producers would welcome greater competition.

Some sources suggested that the  Commission could cut subsidised exports and make storage more costly so as to oblige producers to lower prices and market sugar more aggressively.
"If it came to the crunch producers can always put sugar into intervention," one source said. French sugar producers declined to comment on alleged price-fixing.
But in Bonn, Germany's sugar industry association WVZ said that the British  fines concerned events
10 years ago and were a British domestic matter.

A company official at German producer Nordzucker AG said there was a broad political consensus that there were good reasons for keeping the EU sugar market regime in place.
Spanish producers said the British situation was different to Spain's.

Jose Miguel Herreros, spokesman for Spain's national beet growers' federation, said, "I don't believe there's a problem of this sort in Spain. Perhaps in Britain the problem comes from the fact that there's only one (beet) sugar company,  British Sugar."

"In Spain there are four sugar companies, so there's some competition between them and there isn't the motive to do it (a cartel)," he added. ((Peter Blackburn, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064, fax

HD    SUGAR INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS FINES RAISE SERIOUS COMPETITION QUESTIONS. WC   296 words

The Brussels-based Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar has said the harsh  fines imposed by the European Commission on British Sugar and Tate & Lyle, as well as sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett, for price fixing on the white granulated sugar market in the UK during the mid-1980s raise serious competition questions (see European Report NF8 2351). In a statement, CIUS (which represents sugar and isoglucose purchasing interests of Europe's food and drinks industry, accounting for around
70% of EU sugar consumption) claims that the Commission's October 14 Decision "is further evidence of a lack of competition within the EU sugar market and the lack of a true EU internal market for sugar".

TD
CIUS pointed out that sugar prices within the EU are consistently between 8% and 15% above the effective support price for sugar, despite a situation of structural over-supply. "Bearing in mind that Irish Sugar was fined in 1997 for abuse of dominant position in that market, the  Commission's latest decision raises questions whether the 'collaborative strategy of higher pricing' practised by the British companies in this case has already been replicated between other EU Member States", the statement added.

The sugar-users' group has welcomed comments by  European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler that the EU sugar regime is in dire need of reform and recommends action to ease pressure on the market in next year's farm price package. In the meantime, CIUS urges the EU executive and the Member States to start thinking now about reform proposes "to create a market-oriented sugar regime in 2001 that is
based on competitive principles and takes the interests of all sectors into account".

LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Associated British Foods Plc(ABF) is expected to post a flat set of 1998 profits on Monday, as the strength of sterling eats into earnings at  British Sugar.

Changes in the green pound - the unit into which ECU-based European Union guaranteed farm subsidies for Britain are converted - cut profits from ABF subsidiary British Sugar by 15 million pounds at the half year stage.

TD
Strong compeition within the sugar market also restricted the level of price increases. The high value of sterling is continuing to encourage cheaper imports and lower margins on exports for manufacturers.
ABF makes Twinings tea, Burtons biscuits, Ryvita dry biscuits and Allied frozen foods in Britain. Brokers polled by Reuters estimate profits before tax and exceptional items will range from 400 million
to 428 million pounds. That compares with a figure of 420 million last year once an exceptional profit
on disposal is taken out.

"I think the big issue for ABF is at British Sugar and with sterling. The green pound devaluations translate to lower profits for British Sugar," said Rabobank analyst Michael Bourke.
"But going forward sterling looks as if it has topped out and we could see the reverse effect," he added. Rabobank are going for 422 million in profit before tax and exceptional items, earnings per share of
31.7 pence and a dividend of 10.75p.

ABN, the group's animal feeds division, also suffered from difficult market conditions - falling feed prices, cheaper imports, reduced volumes and an increased level of bad debts.
The group also sold its Irish food retail companies to Tesco last year, which will reduce earnings. In Australia and New Zealand the group's George Weston Foods division is facing tough trading
conditions as competitors continue to undercut its prices.

Chief executive Gary Weston warned shareholders at the time of ABF's interim results in April, that it was unlikely the company would be able to match last year's operating results.

The investment community is keen to find out what ABF, majority owned by the Weston family, plans to do with its cash stockpile of about 1.5 billion pounds.

Analysts said they were unsure whether ABF would provide for a  fine of $47.5 million imposed on it by the European Commission in October for its part in an alleged price fixing of white granulated sugar
in Britain between 1986 and 1990.

ABF shares traded 3.7 percent lower or 22p down at 576p on Friday. They set a high of 670p for the year.

HD         FOCUS - ABF promises more as pound weakens. BY          By Tim Farrand

LP
LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Associated British Foods Plc surged seven percent higher on
Monday on hopes a recent dip in the value of the pound will help the group to re-build profits this year.
ABF shares were up 40 pence at 600p after the results.

TD
The group reported profits before tax of 391 million pounds ($654.1 million) in the year ended September 12, 1998, down 35 million, after taking a hit of 37 million due to the high level of sterling and an exceptional charge of 19 million.

The exceptional charge related to a  fine imposed on ABF subsidiary British Sugar, by the European  Commission for its part in an alleged cartel that conspired to keep British sugar prices high between
1986 and 1990.

British Sugar is appealing against the decision.

But if the exceptional item is eliminated the figure of 410 million is well within the range of brokers' forecasts of 400 million to 428 million pounds.

"There is an element of reassurance in the market that the figures are in line. It is also unlikely to get the same currency hit this year, in fact recent sterling weakness should help in a modest way," said Merrill Lynch analyst Tim Potter.

ABF said the appreciation of the pound had reduced sales by 277 million pounds ($463.4 million). But after allowing for the adverse currency affect and the closure of a  European commodity trading operation, sales grew six percent.

British Sugar contributed profits of 151 million pounds, 28 million down on last year. Changes in the green pound - the unit into which ECU-based  European Union guaranteed farm subsidies for Britain are converted - cut profits at  British Sugar by 15 million at the half year stage.

In an interview chairman Garry Weston said, "sales are up on last year at the moment. We are seeing the same kind of conditions helped slightly by weaker sterling.

"Sterling has been going against us because it has lowered the price of sugar but I think we will see stability this year," he added.

The pound has come down from 2.849 against the mark on September 14 to 2.7516 on Monday. Sterling soared to a nine year high of 3.10 marks in March.

The high value of sterling also continued to encourage cheaper imports and lower margins on exports for manufacturers.

As well as milling and baking ABF makes Twinnings Tea, Burton biscuits, Ryvita dry biscuits and Allied frozen foods in Britain.

The group earned 119 million pounds on its cash stockpile of about 1.5 billion during the year, up from
72 million pounds last year.

ABF is looking to acquire specialist food ingredient companies in  Europe and the United States, but asset prices are currently "very high", said Weston.

Weston a sprightly 72-year old who combines the role of chairman and chief executive, said he had not set a date for his retirement and declined to comment on any plans for a successor.
"Everyone takes my temperature every day," he joked. ($1=.5978 Pound) ((Tim Farrand, London newsroom +44 171 542 6437, fax +44 171 583 3769,

HD         FOCUS - ABF promises more as pound weakens. BY          By Tim Farrand

LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Associated British Foods Plc surged seven percent higher on
Monday on hopes a recent dip in the value of the pound will help the group to re-build profits this year.
ABF shares were up 40 pence at 600p after the results.

TD
The group reported profits before tax of 391 million pounds ($654.1 million) in the year ended September 12, 1998, down 35 million, after taking a hit of 37 million due to the high level of sterling and an exceptional charge of 19 million.
The exceptional charge related to a  fine imposed on ABF subsidiary British Sugar, by the European
Commission for its part in an alleged cartel that conspired to keep British sugar prices high between
1986 and 1990.

British Sugar is appealing against the decision.

But if the exceptional item is eliminated the figure of 410 million is well within the range of brokers' forecasts of 400 million to 428 million pounds.

"There is an element of reassurance in the market that the figures are in line. It is also unlikely to get the same currency hit this year, in fact recent sterling weakness should help in a modest way," said Merrill Lynch analyst Tim Potter.

ABF said the appreciation of the pound had reduced sales by 277 million pounds ($463.4 million). But after allowing for the adverse currency affect and the closure of a  European commodity trading operation, sales grew six percent.

British Sugar contributed profits of 151 million pounds, 28 million down on last year. Changes in the green pound - the unit into which ECU-based  European Union guaranteed farm subsidies for Britain are converted - cut profits at  British Sugar by 15 million at the half year stage.

In an interview chairman Garry Weston said, "sales are up on last year at the moment. We are seeing the same kind of conditions helped slightly by weaker sterling.

"Sterling has been going against us because it has lowered the price of sugar but I think we will see stability this year," he added.

The pound has come down from 2.849 against the mark on September 14 to 2.7516 on Monday. Sterling soared to a nine year high of 3.10 marks in March.

The high value of sterling also continued to encourage cheaper imports and lower margins on exports for manufacturers.

As well as milling and baking ABF makes Twinnings Tea, Burton biscuits, Ryvita dry biscuits and Allied frozen foods in Britain.

The group earned 119 million pounds on its cash stockpile of about 1.5 billion during the year, up from
72 million pounds last year.

ABF is looking to acquire specialist food ingredient companies in  Europe and the United States, but asset prices are currently "very high", said Weston.

Weston a sprightly 72-year old who combines the role of chairman and chief executive, said he had not set a date for his retirement and declined to comment on any plans for a successor.
"Everyone takes my temperature every day," he joked. ($1=.5978 Pound).

ABF said it had made full provision for a 28 million pound  fine imposed on British Sugar by the
European Commission.

British Sugar is appealing against the decision. The fine relates to the alleged price fixing of sugar granules by a cartel of companies, including British Sugar, between 1986 and 1990.

As well as milling and baking ABF makes Twinings Tea, Burton biscuits, Ryvita dry biscuits and Allied frozen foods in Britain. The high value of sterling is continuing to encourage cheaper imports and lower margins on exports for manufacturers.
The group said investment income for the year rose to 119 million punds from 72 million.

ABF also said it would spend some 15 million pounds on upgrading its computer systems to tackle the challenge from the Year 2000 millennium bug. Nine million pounds of this spending will be charged against operating profits.
ABF shares were up 15 pence at 575p. ($1=.5978 Pound). (C) Reuters Limited 1998.

ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS PLC 2nd November 1998
ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS plc PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 12
SEPTEMBER 1998

TD
KEY POINTS
- Profit before tax at #391 million - down #35 million
- Sterling appreciation reduced profit before tax by #37 million
- Exceptional provisions reduced profits by #19 million
- Worldwide sales from continuing operations #4,195 million
- Sterling appreciation reduced sales by #277 million
- In the past twelve months


- Expenditure on new assets and businesses #283 million
- Shareholders' funds up at #2,997 million

In a year of global economic turbulence the ABF group has demonstrated its

financial strength and resilience to adverse operating conditions. Group profit before tax was #391 million. This was achieved despite the #37 million impact of the continuing high levels of sterling and
the provision for exceptional costs of #19 million. After excluding the profit arising from the 1997 sale of our Irish food retailing interests and our adhesives business in Australia totalling #424 million, the comparable profit before tax was #426 million.

Group turnover of our continuing operations at #4,195 million is #242 million below last year. After allowing for the adverse currency affect of #277 million and the closure of a high volume but low margin European commodity trading operation last year, sales show an underlying increase of 6 per cent.

British Sugar contributed profits of #151 million, #28 million below last year. The benefits of another excellent harvest and past capital investment programmes were more than offset by the appreciation in the Green Pound and the full provision for the recently announced  European Commission fine.

Shareholders will have read in the newspapers that the European Commission has imposed a fine of Ecu 39.6 million, equivalent at current exchange rates to #28 million, on British Sugar plc pursuant to Article 85 of the  European Treaty. This was in respect of matters which occurred between 1986 and
1990, prior to Associated British Foods plc acquiring ownership of  British Sugar. British Sugar is to appeal against this decision which we believe to be out of all proportion to the alleged offence. Including an additional charge of #13 million taken as an exceptional charge in the current year, full provision has been made for the  fine.

Results from our milling and baking divisions were adversely affected by the poor 1997 harvest and continuing surplus capacity in the plant baking market. Rationalisation and restructuring of our bakeries continues and during the year provision was made for the closure of our Nottingham bakery.

Our animal feed division, ABN, has continued to suffer from the after affects of the BSE crisis and the financial pressures on farmers who are struggling with low prices due to oversupply.

Other manufacturing divisions within the UK largely produced results in excess of last year. Twinings had a record year in spite of the strength of sterling in the markets in which they operate and achieved best ever sales volumes in  Europe. However, Burtons Biscuits came under pressure from greater competition from local manufacturers in export markets and the dramatic decline in the Russian economy and as a result profits were lower than the record achieved last year.

Primark, our clothing retail operation, has gone from strength to strength returning another year of record profits, up by 26 per cent to #23 million on a turnover of #295 million up 16 per cent on the comparable period last year.

George Weston Foods operating in Australia and New Zealand had a particularly difficult year in an aggressive competitive environment particularly in the baking industry. Profits were reduced from #33 million to #25 million although #6 million of this reduction is attributable to currency translation following the weakness of the Australian dollar. In the United States, AC Humko and Abitec have had a remarkable year, generating profits of #19 million, a #10 million advance on last year due to our rationalisation and integration programme coming to fruition. Further small acquisitions complementing the existing business have been made during the year, which together with an ongoing capital expenditure programme, has increased our investment in the United States to over #200 million.

Investment opportunities in the Far East and Asia have been limited due to political and economic uncertainties.  British Sugar has, however, secured a further investment in China, taking a majority shareholding in a sugar refinery. In view of the instability within Indonesia, we have agreed with our joint venture partner to mothball the newly built glucose factory in this country until a more favourable business climate returns. The investment has been written down in our books by #6 million which has been treated as an exceptional item.

Investment income for the year has increased from #72 million to #119 million, the main factors being a combination of a strong performance from our fund managers, who exceeded the targets set on the funds held under management, and the full year effect of the income arising on the funds realised upon the disposal of our Irish retail companies.

"Year 2000 and the millennium computer bug" headlines have been attracting attention for some time. The ABF group initiated a Year 2000 compliance programme in 1996/97 to address the group's exposure to these issues, with each division forming a committee to monitor compliance progress and to ensure that adequate resources are available either to replace or upgrade existing systems by early
1999.

A large proportion of the compliance effort has been in the normal upgrades and replacement of existing networks and production facilities. This expenditure has amounted to some #8 million during the current year, of which #5 million has been charged to operating profits. The balance has been capitalised in accordance with group accounting policies. It is forecast that future expenditure on Year
2000 remedial work will be some #15 million, of which #9 million will be charged against operating profits.

Whilst there can be no absolute guarantees that the group will not be subject to a Year 2000 failure, we are in the process of taking the necessary steps to ensure that contingency plans minimise disruption
to our supply chain and to our customers.

On 1 January 1999 the  Euro will become the official single currency of the eleven countries forming the European Monetary Union. Although the United Kingdom has, at present, opted out of the single currency, the group's subsidiaries based in those countries will be directly affected by the introduction
of the Euro and have therefore made the necessary administrative and accounting arrangements to handle non-cash transactions in the new single currency where required.  Euro notes and coins will not be in use until 1 January 2002 but arrangements for handling cash and for dealing with the changeover are well advanced.
At a board meeting today, the directors declared a second interim dividend of 6.25p per share (1997 -
5.75p) which will be paid on 6 April 1999 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 5
March 1999. This makes a total dividend for the year of 10.5p, an increase of 5 per cent on the
previous year excluding the special dividend payment.

UK BAKERS and millers Associated British Foods has risen above the effects of the strong pound, it claimed today -despite a fall of GBP 35 million from its pre-tax profits.
The company, ABF, whose holdings include the bakery and biscuit group Burtons and the Chancelot Mill at
Leith, saw profits nosedive to GBP 391 million.

TD
But an ABF spokesman said that, in a year of global economic turbulence, it had demonstrated its financial strength and resilience to adverse operating conditions.

Group profits before tax were GBP 391 million, which were achieved despite the GBP 37 million impact of the continuing high levels of sterling and the provision for exceptional costs of GBP 19 million, he added.
Irish

After excluding the profit arising from the 1997 sale of its Irish food retailing interests and its adhesives business in Australia totalling GBP 424m, the comparable profit before tax was GBP 426 million.
But group turnover of continuing operations at GBP 4195m is GBP 242m below last year.
Its British Sugar arm contributed profits of GBP 151m - GBP 28m below last year - due to the  fine
imposed by the European Competition  Commission after it was found to be operating a cartel with Tate &
Lyle and two distributors which kept prices unfairly high.  British Sugar is to appeal.

British Sugar has, however, secured a further investment in China, taking a majority shareholding in a sugar refinery.

ABF said results from its milling and baking divisions were adversely affected by the poor 1997 harvest and continuing surplus capacity in the plant baking market, and it is continuing the rationalisation and restructuring of its bakeries, including the planned closure of its Nottingham bakery.
Struggling

And its animal feed division, ABN, has continued to suffer from the after-effects of the BSE crisis and the financial pressures on farmers who are struggling with low prices due to oversupply.

But the spokesman said other manufacturing divisions within the UK largely produced results in excess of last year.
Tea company Twinings had a record year and achieved best sales volumes in  Europe.

However, Burtons Biscuits came under pressure from greater competition from local manufacturers in export markets and the dramatic decline in the Russian economy, and as a result profits were lower than last year.
At a board meeting today, the directors declared a second interim dividend of 6.25p per share - up from
5.75p in 1997 - making a total dividend for the year of 10.5p, an increase of five per cent on the previous
year, excluding the special dividend payment.

Associated British Foods yesterday tried to put a brave face on a fall in profits, saying its results demonstrated both its financial strength and resilience to adverse operating conditions.
In the year to September 12 the group made a pre-tax profit of #391m on continuing operations against
#401m during the previous 12 months.

TD
However, ABF said that if the pound had not risen in value, this year's profit would have been #37m higher.

Group turnover fell to #4.2bn from #5.2bn, although much of the drop was the result of discontinued operations.
ABF's  British Sugar subsidiary contributed profits of #151m - #28m less than last year.

The group said the benefits of another excellent harvest and past capital investment programmes were more than offset by other factors.

These were the rise of the green pound - the artificial exchange rate used to calculate  European Union agriculture subsidies - and a recent  European Commission fine of #28m.
ABF is appealing against this decision, which related to an alleged offence concerning an article in the
European Treaty before  British Sugar became part of the group.

Meanwhile, the animal feed division ABN continued to suffer from the after effects of the BSE crisis and the financial pressures facing farmers.

The group claimed to be well-prepared for the introduction of the single  European currency in much of the continent in January.

"Although the United Kingdom has, at present, opted out of the single currency, the group's subsidiaries based in those countries (which have joined) will be directly affected by the introduction of the  euro and have therefore made the necessary administrative and accounting arrangements," the company said.

Shareholders will receive a final dividend of 6.25p to make a total for the year of 10.5p, up from 10p last year.

THE STRENGTH of sterling continues to be a major headache for Garry Weston's Associated British
Foods.

TD
The strong pound hammered the Twinings Tea and Burton's biscuits group at the interim stage in April and yesterday's full year numbers showed further scars. A #37m currency hit pushed profits down from
#426m to #391m, excluding exceptionals.

The pound may have eased slightly but not enough to make much of a difference. It will continue to hurt British Sugar where profits fell by #28m to #151m last year. A bumper crop boosted processing volumes but this was not enough to counter the currency impact. The division was also hit by a #28m fine from the European Commission for alleged price fixing by the company in the 1980s. This necessitated a #19m provision in the full-year accounts.
Elsewhere, milling and baking profits were hit by the poor harvest last year and overcapacity in the
baking market. But in the US the food ingredients businesses have done well with combined profits rising
by #10m to #19m helped by a strong performance from the AC Humko speciality oils business. Last
month's #120m acquisition of SBI, which produces ingredients for the beauty industry, will increase
ABF's presence in this sector.

Although trading will continue to be tough, investors can expect Mr Weston to find a few more uses for ABF's notorious cash pile. Currently standing at #1.5bn and yielding income of #119m, the warchest has more buying power in the present environment of weakening asset values. Although no-one should expect a mega-deal from the cautious Mr Weston, ABF is expected to continue adding on growth businesses in core areas such as food ingredients.

This is not one of ABF's more exciting phases - its trading profits have gone virtually nowhere over the past few years. But it remains a steady performer. On current year profit forecasts of #425m, the shares - up 29p to 589p yesterday - trade on a forward p/e of 18. That is just behind the two most highly rated British food companies, Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. A solid hold.

JEFF NEWTON.

ASSOCIATED British Foods, the food processor and manufacturer, saw its shares gain 5 per cent yesterday on hopes that a recent dip in the value of the pound will help the group to re-build profits this year.

TD
The group reported pre-tax profits of #391 million in the year ending 12 September, down #35 million after taking a hit of #37 million due to the high level of sterling and an exceptional charge of #19 million. ABF shares closed at 589p, up 29p.

The exceptional charge related to a  fine imposed on British Sugar, an ABF subsidiary, by the European Commission for its part in an alleged cartel that conspired to keep  British sugar prices high between 1986 and 1990.  British Sugar is appealing against the decision.

Had it not been for the exceptional item, ABF's profits would have been well within the range given in brokers' forecasts of #400 million to #428 million.

Tim Potter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said: "There is an element of reassurance in the market that the figures are in line. It is also unlikely to get the same currency hit this year. In fact, recent sterling weakness should help in a modest way."

ABF said the appreciation of the pound had reduced sales by #277 million but, after allowing for the adverse currency effect and the closure of a  European commodity trading operation, sales grew 6 per cent.

British Sugar contributed profits of #151 million, #28 million down on last year. Changes in the green pound - the unit into which farm subsidies guaranteed by the  European Union are converted from ECUs - cut profits at  British Sugar by #15 million at the half-year stage.

Garry Weston, the chairman and chief executive of ABF, said, "Sales are up on last year at the moment. We are seeing the same kind of conditions helped slightly by weaker sterling. Sterling has been going against us because it has lowered the price of sugar but I think we will see stability this year."

In addition to milling and baking, ABF makes Twinings tea, Burton biscuits, Ryvita dry biscuits and Allied frozen foods in Britain.

The group earned #119 million on its cash stockpile of about #1.5 billion during the year, up from #72 million pounds last year.

ABF is looking to acquire specialist food ingredient companies in  Europe and the United States but regards current asset prices as too high.

Mr Weston, who is 72, said he had not set a date for his retirement and declined to comment on any plans for a successor. "Everyone takes my temperature every day," he joked.

ABF also said it would spend #15 million upgrading computer systems for 2000, of which #9 million will be charged to operating profits.

ASSOCIATED British Foods yesterday said that the #28m  fine imposed by the European                 Commission on its British Sugar business for price fixing in the 1980s was almost double what it had expected.

ABF has taken a further #13m provision to cover the  fine, and said that it is prepared to spend another two years appealing against the judgment.

TD
This, combined with a #36m reverse from the strength of sterling, forced the company into a decline in annual pre-tax profits to #391m, from #410m, for the year to September 12.
Primark, ABF's clothing retail division, was the best performing part of the group, with profits up by
26%, to #23m, in the year.
ABF's George Weston Foods division in Australia and New Zealand suffered a #7m profits decline, to
#25m, after stiff competition in baking. The company said that #6m of the downturn was the work of a
weak Australian dollar.

About a quarter of group operating profits were generated from the investment division, which is looking after #1.4bn of funds while the company searches for an acquisition. Peter Patchett, group financial controller, said that the hunt has so far been unsuccessful.

Mr Patchett said: "We have been looking for acquisitions for a very, very long time, but some of the asking prices are still too high. Share prices have gone down, but vendor aspirations are still quite high."

ABF's results were broadly in line with City expectations. Analysts remained concerned about effects of currency translation and cut about #20m from profit forecasts for next year. They now expect
pre-tax profits of #425m.

After an #8m charge for adapting computers to cope with the millennium bug, earnings per share eased to 29.6p (30.3p). The dividend rises to 10.5p (10p) with a final 6.25p due on April 6.

ASSOCIATED British Foods is so well entrenched in its core food markets that its profits are unlikely to fluctuate far from where the economies in which it trades head. Those markets are not in rude health, but could be a lot worse. Bolstered by the staple nature of its product offering and the almost infamous strength in the balance sheet there is little that should go seriously wrong at ABF.

But even barring the appearance of grotesque mistakes that would undermine the respect with which ABF is held - and which have impaled so many rivals - the company has its burdens. ABF also has the European Commission to contend with. The  fine imposed on British Sugar for price-fixing in the
1980s hurt and the food safety police prowl with ever greater ferocity.

TD
The exchange rate poses problems, but where ABF may benefit from the fall in the value of sterling, it may also suffer. Income from ABF's #1.5bn of cash generates a quarter of group profits but that will erode if sterling's weakness is accompanied by lower interest rates.

Besides, ABF is a manufacturer, not a bank, and it should find a better home for the cash. A decent acquisition is long overdue, but it is so long overdue that doubts must be raised that the deal is out there to be done. Hold.

COMPANIES &FINANCE - UK - ABF seeks acquisitions in North America - FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY REPORTS FULL-YEAR OUTCOME DOWN FROM - EXCEPTIONAL-BUOYED #850M TO
#391M.

Associated British Foods plans to expand in North America by buying small companies whose technologies it can expand into new products and markets.

TD
"We want some smaller companies with technology we can grow," said Garry Weston, chairman. "The US has a lot of small companies, such as family businesses, that we can buy relatively cheaply." Last month, ABF bought SPI, which makes some pharmaceutical ingredients and supplies polyols used as sweetening agents in foods and as additives in products such as toothpaste.

His comments came as ABF announced pre-tax profits of #391m for the year to September 12. This compared with #850m in 1997, #424m of which came from the sale of the group's Irish retailing business and its Australian adhesives operation. Operating profits on continuing businesses fell from #342m to
#316m.

Mr Weston said the high level of sterling had cut annual profits by #37m, and there were also provisions for exceptional costs of #19m.

He added that the company would appeal against the  fine imposed last month by the  European             Commission on British Sugar and three other UK sugar companies for alleged price fixing in the late
1980s, before British Sugar was bought by ABF. Although the group had previously made provision of up to #15m for the fine, the total penalty of #28m, described by Mr Weston as "out of all proportion to the alleged offence", meant #13m was taken as an exceptional charge this year.

This provision, together with the strength of the green pound, contributed to a drop in  British Sugar's profits to #151m ( #179m). Burtons Biscuits faced greater competition in its export markets and was particularly hard hit by the economic slump in Russia, where its Wagon Wheels were among the biggest selling biscuits. George Weston Foods, the group's Australian and New Zealand business, also suffered a dip in profits to #25m ( #33m), partly through aggressive competition in the baking industry.

However, these declines were partly offset by stronger performances from Twinings tea, from Primark, the UK clothing retailer which raised profits 26% to #23m, and in the US, where AC Humko and Abitec more than doubled profits to #19m ( #9m). Investment income rose two-thirds from #72m to #119m.

The board is recommending a second interim dividend of 6.25p, giving a total of 10.5p for the year, against 10p in 1997 excluding the special dividend paid after the disposal of the Irish business. Earnings per share were 29.6p (75.6p).
The shares rose 29p to 589p by the close yesterday. Comment

* Although it publishes its results close to Bonfire night, ABF rarely delivers fireworks: this year is no exception. They reflect its robustness and resilience, but signal no significant change from the cautious and conservative approach that has made ABF renowned as a safe haven. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits for 1998-99 in the #415m-425m range, giving a forward p/e between 18 and 19. The shares look fully valued.

BROKERS are braced for a plunge but in celebratory mood - even though 450 of their colleagues were shown the door at Merrill Lynch yesterday and futures and options exchange Liffe painted a gloomy job picture for its bright-hued crew.

This is because the reductions for which brokers are preparing this time are not in their precious share prices but in interest rates, which many of them believe will move lower and lower in the months ahead.

Few seem to doubt that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will sanction a rate cut this week, and all dealers are left to bicker about is how big it will be.

At the end of last week the pin-striped brigate were excited about the prospects of a half-percentage point rates cut, but a weekend of sober reflection seemed to have damped down their expectations a little yesterday - although a dismal survey showing the collapse in demand for manufactured goods had driven prices and output to new lows kept hopes alive of a larger rate cut.

The more measured money, though, seemed to be opting for a quarter-point cut. What is clear is that whatever the size of this week's reduction in rates, what seems to be keeping the market afloat is the prospect of a cut every month the MPC meets.
Amid the chat about interest rates the market was distracted from Chancellor Gordon Brown's
pre-Budget report, due to be delivered later today, in which he is expected to reveal the damage the
recent downturn in the global economy will inflict on borrowing requirements.

Ahead of his Budget taster, Mr Brown yesterday turned his attention again to hedge funds, which bore the brunt of the blame for the turbulence in the world markets during the late summer.

He added fuel to the battle against funds such as Long-Term Capital Management, bailed out on the instructions of the United States Federal Reserve Bank, by calling for an investigation into the amount of capital banks usually set aside when dealing with hedge funds.

Banking stocks that took the impact of much of the anxiety about hedge funds fell back yesterday, denting their recent recovery. Barclays, which stumped up #180m for the LTCM bail-out, fell 33p to
1,255p, NatWest lost 17p to 990 1/2 p and Bank of Scotland was off 5 1/2 p at 638p.

All the banks did not succumb, however, and those which are dubbed the "mortgage banks" were generally stronger. Alliance & Leicester rose 6p to 865p and Halifax was up 8p at 800 1/2 p.

Overall, the FTSE ended 87 points higher at 5,525, after losing some of its upward momentum earlier in the day which saw the blue chip index touch 5,564.

Trevor Greetham, Merrill Lynch's global strategist, said for the first time since the summer rout that it was time to go "over weight" in British stocks - particularly in engineers and transport stocks - because the market had got too gloomy and was already pricing as if in a recession, which might not happen.

There are clouds on the horizon, however, he said, particularly in the US, which yesterday seemed oblivious to concerns about its prospects as the Dow Jones traded 125 points higher.

In addition to hopes about interest rate cuts, dealers found time to concentrate on the stories of individual stocks. Rank, which parted company with chief exective Andrew Teare last week, raced up
5% to 261 1/2 p, amid fevered talk that predators were poised to pounce. Names in the frame include John Garrett, the former leisure head at the troubled company, and Luke Johnson, formerly of Pizza Express, chairman of Belgo.
Despite ubiquitous chatter about takeovers, speculation continued that Mr Teare's successor will be
Ken Hanna, thought to be looking for senior role after successfully splitting up Dalgety.

GUS, the retailer, was one of FTSE's best performers, rising nearly 8% to 689p after it confirmed plans to sell its finance division, which could raise as much #1.2bn.

Securicor, up 23p to 460p, also excited the stock market with news of its venture with Germany's state-owned Deutsche Post.

Among the other companies leading the FTSE's charge were SmithKline Beecham, up 33p to 781p, and British Telecom, up 33p to 803 1/2 p, apparently on hopes that lower interest rates and sterling would help their export prospects.

As well as BT and Securicor, other telcoms shares also had a good run on the back of link-ups with supermarkets. Orange rose 32 1/2 p to 590p, Vodafone rose 39p to 838 1/2 p and Colt rose 42p to
816p.

Tate & Lyle, a regular on the takeover list, soared by 20% to 429p, thanks in part to Associated British Foods, up 29p to 587p, and the owner of British Sugar, which reported pre-tax profits of #391m, hurt by sterling's strength and provision for a fine from the European Commission. However, the food company was optimistic about its prospects.

HD          ABF mauled by strong  sterling. BY          By Lisa Buckingham City Editor.

ASSOCIATED British Foods, whose businesses include  British Sugar, Twinings Tea, Allinson bread and Ryvita, suffered a profits slump of more than a half to #391m in the year to September.

But shares in the group, headed by Garry Weston, rose 19p to 582p because underlying performance was better than the headline figure suggested, although there was no disguising the mauling which ABF suffered from the strong pound.

TD
The City had expected a sharp drop because last year's profits were boosted by a huge gain from the sale of its Irish supermarkets business and most of the currency effects had been anticipated.
The latest profits were reduced by #37m, while #277m was wiped off sales because of the high pound. Mr Weston said, however, that if adverse currency movements and the closure of a  European
commodity operation were stripped out, underlying sales were 6% ahead. Although ABF intends to
appeal against the #28m  fine imposed on its British Sugar subsidiary by the European Commission
for alleged price fixing, the latest figures include a full provision.

There was little indication of a bid from ABF's #1.5bn cash pile, but the money did contribute to investment income of #119m, up from #72m.

Mr Weston said that sales were currently ahead of last year because of the slightly weaker pound, which is still 10% higher against a trade-weighted basket of currencies than it was two years ago.

But cheaper imports are threatening to undermine parts of the company's operations and it is struggling to overcome weaker export margins. ABF also expects to spend about #15m to safeguard its computer systems from the Year 2000 millennium bug.

British Sugar, ABF's major operating unit, suffered a #28m fall in profits to #151m, mainly because of changes to the green pound, the currency of  Euro-farm subsidies.

Associated British Foods' results didn't exactly sparkle. Profits fell in line with analysts' expectations and overall it was a relief that trading wasn't worse, given the global economic turmoil.

Underlying pre-tax profits slipped just 8 per cent once the 1996-97 pounds 424m one-off profit from the Irish supermarkets sale to Tesco is stripped out. The strong pound hurt trading as predicted, with pounds 277m cut from turnover and pounds 37m from profits. The related rise in the green pound (used to price sugar
and linked to the sterling/Ecu rate) also hurt, reducing AB unit  British Sugar's profits by pounds 28m to pounds 151m.
AB took a pounds 13m charge to cover a pounds 28m  fine imposed by the European Commission. The
EC ruled British Sugar fixed sugar prices in the late 1980s, before AB bought the business. AB will appeal.
Elsewhere, the Asian crisis bit. AB and its joint-venture partner mothballed a new glucose factory in
Indonesia. It's taken a pounds 6m charge to write down this operation's assets. The Australian and New

Zealand businesses' profits fell too, from pounds 33m to pounds 25m, as weakening local currencies hurt profits on translation.
Investment income grew from pounds 72m to pounds 119m as AB's fund managers beat targets.

But there's still no news of AB's plans for its multi-billion pound cash pile. Analysts say it must make a substantial acquisition soon or return some of its funds to investors.
On analysts' forecasts of pounds 420m pre-tax profits for the present year, the shares trade on a forward
PE ratio of 18. Fairly priced.

Associated British Foods has criticised the #28m  fine imposed by the European Commission on
British Sugar for price fixing saying it was "out of all proportion to the alleged offence".

The group is to appeal, but the  fine and the appreciation of the green pound hit  British Sugar's contribution to the group, with the proceeds from its "excellent harvest and past capital investment" all but wiped out.

TD
Twinings had a record year, and despite the strength of sterling posted its best ever sales volumes in
Europe. But Burtons Biscuits came under pressure from local manufacturers in export markets.
ABF's group pre-tax profit was down #35m to #391m with turnover from continuing operations down
#242m to #4,195m.

HD          EU panel lacking  data to monitor sugar prices. WC         247 words

BRUSSELS, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The  European Union's sugar management committee lacks the statistical data it needs to monitor EU sugar prices and is struggling to compile an improved database, an EU member state official said on Wednesday.

"There is a general feeling there is not much reliable data on domestic sugar prices for the committee and that we need something better," the official told Reuters.

TD
The panel has been mulling the problem for some time and industry sources in October predicted the complex and sometimes confidential nature of domestic sugar prices would make their task even more difficult.

Last month's decision by the  European Commission to fine British Sugar Plc and three other British companies for price fixing gave the panel fresh impetus to resolve the problem, EU officials say.

The European Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar (CIUS), which represents the food and drinks industry, piled more pressure on the committee in the scandal's wake, suggesting price fixing was endemic throughout the EU.

Tuesday's meeting saw the panel hold a preliminary discussion but this failed to result in concrete proposals, the official said.

Ironically the committee was also forced to postpone a scheduled review of the EU's export commitments for 1997/98 because of a lack of statistical data. ((Andrew Osborn, Brussels Newsroom
