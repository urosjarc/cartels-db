SWISS-Swedish multinational Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) is facing punitive  fines as European Commission competition officials wind up a long-running investigation into an alleged cartel operated by specialised heating  pipe manufacturers.

Commission officials are expected to submit recommendations by the end of this month for imposing
fines running into millions of ecu on the Zurich-based engineering giant.

TD
The level of the proposed  fines will be calculated in accordance with new EU rules which ignore the turnover of the companies concerned and concentrate instead on the length and seriousness of the cartel.

"These  fines will make the recent ones on shipping companies look small," said one of the firms involved in the case, referring to the financial penalties totalling 273 million ecu imposed last month on
15 shipping companies which agreed prices and capacities for cargoes across the North Atlantic.

"We are talking big money," said a  Commission official, although he added that the institution would seek the views of national competition experts on how severe the punishment should be before making a final decision. Industry experts say the level of the  fines could be reduced as a result of this consultation exercise.

ABB, whose insulated steel pipe business is based in Copenhagen, is being targeted as the alleged ringleader of a cartel, along with three other Danish companies, Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe, and two German firms Panisovit and Isoplus.

ABB has refused to make any comment ahead of a final  Commission ruling. It is the biggest of the five firms involved, with sales in the  pipe sector totalling 230 million ecu in 1997.
Together, the companies are accused of setting prices and sharing out the market between 1980 and
1989.

Swedish company Powerpipe alerted the  Commission to the suspect practices when it found that it was having to compete with  pipes sold at prices below the cost of production whenever it tried to enter new markets in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark.

There are also allegations that Powerpipe's customers were threatened with boycotts to force them to break their links with the Gothenburg-based company.

Insulated  steel pipes are a fundamental part of district heating systems, where warmth from the production of electricity is circulated either as steam or hot water to heat nearby houses or companies.

The Commission's Directorates-General for energy (DGXVII) and environmental policy (DGXI) are in favour of the technology, regarding it as less wasteful than alternative forms of heating.

Historically,  Europe is a world leader in district heating, although such systems have largely been based in Scandinavian countries, Germany, and parts of eastern  Europe, with Danish manufacturers taking a significant share of the market.


Page 3 of 80 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Western companies have been trying to sell their up-to-date technology to central and eastern  Europe, although the market has not expanded as fast as they expected.

The Copenhagen-based industry body, the European Association of Heating  Pipe Manufacturers, says there are no significant producers of insulated steel pipes for district heating outside  Europe.

It adds that around 30 medium-sized and large  pipe manufacturers sell on the  European market. "I do not see any possibility of a  cartel operating in the past or now," said a spokesman for the association.

BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to fine Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG later this month for participating in a cartel in the district heating pipes market, a Commission source said on Friday.

The source said the size of the  fine had not yet been decided, but other companies likely to be hit included Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe from Denmark and German firms Panisovit and Isoplus.

TD
The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has been investigating the alleged cartel for years, but the probe became public only after its inspectors, in 1995, raided the premises of ABB, the suspected ringleader, and other participants.

ABB has denied any wrongdoing, but Powerpipe, Sweden's largest  pipe manufacturer, has said that the cartel was common knowledge in the industry.
The Commission can fine companies a minimum of 20 million ecus for participating in price or
market-sharing cartels.

Last month it slammed a  fine of 273 million ecus on a group of shipping firms, with P&O Nedlloyd the worst hit at 41 million ecus. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European Union competition chief Karel Van Miert said on Monday that the European Commission would fine Swedish-Swiss engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd this month in connection with a heating pipe cartel probe.

"There will be  fines, that's for sure," Van Miert told reporters, declining to specify how high they would be.

Van Miert said a committee of antitrust experts from the 15 EU states had already met on the issue and agreed with the  Commission that ABB and other companies had violated EU competition rules.

He said the size of the  fine was the only issue that remained to be decided. He gave no details about the other companies involved.

STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Swedish shares plunged further in late trade on Monday on the back of Wall Street's lower opening, with brokers bracing for further falls on Tuesday.

"It's 80 percent psychology now, anything could happen in the next session but probably we will open lower if Wall Street continues to fall," a broker said.

TD
The all-share general index dropped 4.13 percent to close at 2,554.80, levels not touched since early February last year and the OMX top-30 share index shed 4.34 percent to close at 533.72 in thin turnover of 5.58 billion crowns.

"There are a lot of hedge funds pulling out of Sweden at the moment and long-term buyers are still on the sidelines," another broker said.

Brokers said weaker Asian markets and disappointment at last weekend's G7 meeting were the main cause for the falls.

Telecoms group Ericsson plunged 8.5 crowns to close at 128.5. It has now dropped back to levels last touched in early May last year. Price falls on technology stocks in the U.S. were largely to blame for Ericsson's fall, a broker said.

"If I had said 10 months ago that Ericsson could ever fall below 130 crowns people would have called me an idiot and now it has closed at 128.5," a broker said. "Now Ericsson is actually cheaper than Astra."

One broker said investors would stay clear of cyclical, telecoms and banking stocks and were instead likely to pick up pharmaceutical stocks seen as safe havens in times of financial turmoil.
"Pharmaceuticals are now the safest bet," he said.
But drugs group Astra failed to buck the trend to shed five crowns, closing at 132.5 crowns. Pharmacia & Upjohn (P&U) shed 3.5 crowns to close at 381.5. P&U signed a two-year research
agreement with French gene reserach company Genset

Electrical engineering group ABB closed unchanged at 67 crowns. It announced a U.S. $350 million power plant order. The  European Commission said it would fine ABB this month in connection with a heating pipe cartel probe.

From Tuesday's Wall Street Journal  Europe

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission is preparing to slap substantial  fines on a group of heating-pipe manufacturers, including ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, which is accused of being the ringleader of a cartel.

TD
Karel Van Miert, the commission's top competition official, said Monday the long-running investigation into allegations of illegal price-fixing and shutting out competitors is "at the very, very end" and served notice that the probe would likely result in a  fine. "There will be a  fine, that's for sure," he said.

Although the amount of the  fine won't be determined until later this month,  commission officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it's likely to be "high" in accordance with guidelines and could possibly set a new record for such penalties.

Fines for serious infringements of the European Union's competition law start at 20 million  European
currency units ($23.9 million). The fines are adjusted upward for gravity, duration and aggravation,
and downward for mitigating factors including cooperation during the ensuing investigation.
ABB's Denmark-based  insulated steel-pipe business is accused of orchestrating a  cartel for almost
10 years between 1980 and 1989. A representative for Zurich-based ABB, a Swiss-Swedish
engineering group, declined to comment on the  commission's likely decision.

Van Miert said there had been cooperation with "some of the companies" under investigation, and indicated that "some have been more cooperative than others."

In a recent fine levied against the TACA shipping consortium, which the  commission accused of engaging in cartel practices over a long period,  fines ranged from less than 7 million ECUs for the smallest companies to almost 30 million ECUs for the largest. The total was a record 273 million ECUs. The companies are appealing the  fines.

In January, Volkswagen AG, was  fined a record 102 million ECUs for allegedly preventing customers from buying its cars across national borders for several years. The German auto maker is also appealing the fine.

Insulated  steel pipes linked to power plants are used to provide residential and office heating in much of Scandinavia, Germany and Eastern  Europe. The commission has promoted these systems as an environmentally friendly form of heating.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--A European Union Commission official said Tuesday that a decision on how much to fine a group of heating pipe manufacturers including Swedish/Swiss engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG (ABBBY) will likely be taken Oct. 21.

The group has been accused of  cartel behavior, including  price fixing,  and shutting out competitors, the Commission official said.

TD
The size of the  fine won't be decided until the day before the decision is taken by the 20
commissioners at their weekly meeting, the official said. He refused to comment on speculation that the
fine might be the largest ever imposed on a  cartel by the Commission.

The largest such  fine to date was XEU273 million levied on the TACA freight shipping alliance last month.

ABB's Danish steel pipemaking unit has been accused of orchestrating a  cartel for nearly 10 years between 1980 and 1989, the official said.

Other companies involved include three other Danish manufacturers - Logstar, Tarco and Starpipe - and two Germany-based companies, Panisovit and Isoplus.

The European Commission will impose steep fines on ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering multinational, before the end of the month for its role in a  Europe-wide price-fixing and market-rigging cartel, Karel Van Miert, the  European competition commissioner, said yesterday.

"They will be  fined," said Mr Van Miert. "Now all that has to be agreed is the level of the  fines." The commissioner said a committee of national competition experts agreed with his conclusion that ABB and five other companies specialising in  insulated steel pipes, had violated EU anti-trust rules. ABB has been singled out as the alleged ringleader of the cartel.

TD
The other companies involved are three Danish companies - Logstar, Tarco and Starpipe, and two
German-based companies - Panisovit and Isoplus.

Together they are accused of price fixing  and sharing out the market between 1980 and 1989. Under new EU rules the severity of the fines will reflect the length and seriousness of the  cartel, rather than the turnover of the companies. Emma Tucker, Brussels

STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Swedish shares plunged further in late trade on Monday on the back of Wall Street's lower opening, with brokers bracing for further falls on Tuesday.

"It's 80 percent psychology now, anything could happen in the next session but probably we will open lower if Wall Street continues to fall," a broker said.

TD
The all-share gen Telecoms group Ericsson plunged 8.5 crowns to close at 128.5. It has now dropped back to levels last touched in early May last year. Price falls on technology stocks in the U.S. were largely to blame for Ericsson's fall, a broker said.

"If I had said 10 months ago that Ericsson could ever fall below 130 crowns people would have called me an idiot and now it has closed at 128.5," a broker said. "Now Ericsson is actually cheaper than Astra."

One broker said investors would stay clear of cyclical, telecoms and banking stocks and were instead likely to pick up pharmaceutical stocks seen as safe havens in times of financial turmoil.
"Pharmaceuticals are now the safest bet," he said.
But drugs group Astra failed to buck the trend to shed five crowns, closing at 132.5 crowns. Pharmacia & Upjohn (P&U) shed 3.5 crowns to close at 381.5. P&U signed a two-year research
agreement with French gene reserach company Genset

Electrical engineering group ABB closed unchanged at 67 crowns. It announced a U.S. $350 million power plant order. The  European Commission said it would fine ABB this month in connection with a heating pipe cartel probe.

The European Commission is expected to  fine a group of heating  pipe manufacturers, including ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG,the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant. ABB's Denmark-based  insulated steel pipe business is accused of orchestrating a price-fixing cartel between 1980 and 1989. A representative of Zurich-based ABB declined to comment. Fines for serious infringements of the European Union's competition law start at 20 million European currency units ($23.9-million U.S.).
The fines are adjusted upward for gravity, duration and aggravation, and downward for mitigating factors including co-operation during the ensuing investigation.

BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's expected decision to  fine Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG is likely to fall on October 21, a Commission official said on Wednesday.

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert confirmed this week that the  European Union's antitrust watchdog would  fine ABB and five smaller companies.

TD
The companies are accused of conspiring to fix prices of pre-insulated district heating  pipes.

Commission officials would not speculate on the level of the  fines, which would be agreed towards the decision date to avoid leaks to the press.
The other companies named in relation to the  cartel probe are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of
Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.

The Commission can fine companies found guilty of participating in price cartels or  market-sharing arrangements a base sum of 20 million ecus ($24.4 million), which can be reduced or increased depending on the duration of the infringements and whether there are any attenuating or aggravating circumstances.

Last month it imposed a record penalty of 273 million ecus on a group of shipping companies for allegedly abusing their dominant position on transatlantic container trade.
The biggest individual  fine ever imposed on a single company was 102 million ecus on Volkswagen in
January. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

OIL companies have been warned against  price fixing  by Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert after top executives from the industry gathered to discuss depressed prices at a closed-door meeting. The talks were apparently aimed at considering ways to survive the current price slump. French oil company Total said it had received a letter from the  European Commission about the meeting.

VAN Miert confirmed this week that Swedish-Swiss engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) is facing fines for its part in a heating  pipe cartel. He added that the level of the penalties for members of the price and market-fixing  cartel was the only thing which still had to be decided.

TD
THE Commissioner also stressed that the options were still open on how to create fair competition between public and private television companies. He acknowledged that proposals that public broadcasters should not be allowed to use licence fees or government subsidies to buy increasingly expensive sports rights or to finance game shows were included in a  Commission discussion paper, but said no decisions had yet been taken.

TELECOMS service companies in France and Germany have agreed to join forces to take on former national monopolies France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. France's association of telecommunications service providers AOST and its German counterpart VATM said they faced similar problems in prising open the markets.

MEDIA partners, the Milan-based group in the forefront of moves to create a new  European football super-league, has filed a complaint with the  Commission against UEFA for abusing its dominant position. The move followed UEFA's unveiling of a new showcase competition involving 24 or 32 teams which will offer prize money totalling more than 400 million ecu.

EUROPEAN industry was working at 83.6 % of its full capacity in July compared with 83.5% in April, according to Eurostat  figures released this week. Activity within the 11 countries set to launch the  euro stood at 83.7%, up from 83.4% in April.

BRITISH Petroleum and Amoco have formally asked the  Commission to approve their 100-million-ecu merger. The deal is likely to be cleared with few problems.

DANISH Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has called for EU heads of government to discuss joint measures to safeguard jobs and economic stability in the face of the current financial crisis.

LUXEMBOURG has proposed a shake-up in its national laws which will, it claims, allow it to steal a march on rivals and become a financial centre for pensions provision. Two laws have been drafted to allow US-style pension products to be offered. They are designed for multinational companies creating defined-contribution or defined-benefit pension funds for their staff.

ITALIAN tyre and cable giant Pirelli has been cleared by the  Commission to take over the energy cables activities of Siemens. Officials said that although the deal would create a high market share for Pirelli's cable business in Italy, the cable market was operating increasingly on a  Europe-wide basis.

COURT proceedings against EU governments which have signed 'open skies' agreements with the US are likely to be launched by the end of the year, the  Commission warned this week. But a spokesman for Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said the countries concerned (Belgium, Luxembourg,


Page 17 of 80 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Austria, the UK and Germany) still had time to head off action in the
European Court of Justice before the legal process starts.

GERMAN ice-cream distributor Langnese Iglo GmbH has lost its appeal in the ECJ against a Commission ruling that it could not keep rival brands out of its leased freezers. The  Commission said in 1992 that German distributors were breaking competition rules by freezing Mars ice-creams out of the market.

HD           EU to fine British sugar firms - source. BY            By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will fine British Sugar Plc and Tate & Lyle Plc on Wednesday for allegedly fixing sugar prices and agreeing production levels in Britain, a Commission source told Reuters on Tuesday.

The source said the  European Union's antitrust watchdog would also  fine two sugar distributors but declined to give details, saying the level of the  fines had not yet been agreed.

TD
Tate & Lyle played down the prospect of a  fine, saying it had co-operated with the  Commission in the inquiry which started some ten years ago.
British Sugar is part of Associated British Foods Plc.

The Commission's probe into the U.K. sugar market had not been made public, but is not a real surprise.
Last year the EU executive  fined Irish Sugar, a subsidiary of Greencore Group, 8.8 million ecus
($10.5 million) for allegedly abusing its dominant position in Ireland.

The European Committee of Sugar Manufacturers (CEFS) said the sector had long been a target of the Commission's competition body. Under the EU's farm policy the sugar sector benefits from minimum guaranted prices which largely influence market prices.

"(EU competition authority) DGIV does not like the sugar regime. It does not understand that everybody produces under the same conditions, the same prices and the same constraints," CEFS Secretary-General Jules Beauduin told Reuters.
He denied that sugar manufacturers operated a  cartel.

Wednesday's decision will be the  Commission's third cartel fine this year and comes ahead of expected stiff penalties against Swiss-Swedish engineering firm Asea Brown Boveri and a group of heating pipe manufacturers possibly later this month.

EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said last year that the Commission's cartel busters had never been so active in unveiling  price-fixing and market-sharing practices.

The size of the  fines for this type of offence varies according to their gravity, duration and other criteria including whether or not the companies have made amends.
But, according to Commission guidelines, companies involved in price cartels and  market sharing
quotas are likely to be fined a minimum of 20 million ecus.

Irish Sugar was found guilty of abusing its market power - the  Commission said it controls 95 percent of the Irish market - to prevent imports of cheaper sugar. Under 1997 guidelines this is punishable
with a fine of between one and 20 million ecus.

($1 = 0.83 ecu).

BRITISH Sugar, Tate & Lyle and two sugar distribution companies will be fined millions of pounds today by the  European Commission for allegedly running a price-fixing cartel.

The biggest  fine, which could be as much as #14m is likely to be imposed on British Sugar, which the EC believes played the leading role in an agreement to gradually raise prices for granulated white sugar on the UK market. British Sugar, a unit of the food conglomerate Associated British Foods, said it could not comment on the matter.

TD
EC sources said the case stems from a decision in the 1980s by the  commission to fine British Sugar three million European currency units (#2.1m) for breaching EU competition rules. At the time, the commission accused the company of trying to squeeze Napier Brown, a sugar distributor, out of the UK market by reducing wholesale prices.

That fine was set at a low level because British Sugar implemented a compliance programme to bring it into line with EU rules, which forbid agreements that threaten competition. But at about the time the company was fined, it was already working with Tate & Lyle, Napier Brown and another distributor, James Budgett, to boost prices gradually on the British sugar market, the  commission sources said.

British Sugar and Tate & Lyle, which together hold more than 90% of the British market, brought the distribution firms into the arrangement because the distributors had links with sugar companies on the Continent which would have undermined any attempt to boost prices. The  commission's competition officials were tipped off about the  cartel by submissions Tate & Lyle made to the Office of Fair Trading, sources said.

The OFT's own investigations into British Sugar and Tate & Lyle led the two companies to give court undertakings in late 1996 not to fix prices. The OFT accused the two producers of reaching an agreement on pricing between 1986 and 1990.

The British Sugar ruling is the latest sign of the determination of Karel Van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, to crack down on companies that break EU antitrust rules. The EC is expected soon to fine a Swedish-Swiss company and others for running a heating  pipe cartel.

BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday is expected to  fine
Swiss-Swedish engineering firm Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and five small German and Danish firms for
allegedly stifling competition in the market for district heating  pipes.
"I have had no news of a postponment (of the decision)," a  Commission spokesman said on Monday.

TD
He refused to give any details and said the decision would probably not be made public until
Wednesday evening.

The Commission will start its weekly meeting at a later-than-usual 1200/1000GMT and it has a range of other issues on the agenda.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog, has been investigating the firms' practices for years among suspicion of price-fixing and carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.

Rival Swedish firm Powerpipe has said that the existence of the  cartel was common knowledge in the industry. Besides ABB, the companies concerned are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.

Under 1997 guidelines the  Commission can fine companies found guilty of operating a  cartel a base sum of 20 million ecus. But the amounts actually levied in cases since then have varied both upwards and downwards depending on whether a company was ringleader or follower, its size and the seriousness and duration of the infringement.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies, all of them hit with much smaller amounts.

In September it slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).

Volkswagen holds the record for the biggest EU  fine on an individual company at 102 million ecus. ((Amelia Torres +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission is expected to levy a hefty  fine on Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG (ABBBY) for its involvement in a  price fixing cartel in the 1980s, according to Brussels lawyers Tuesday.
ABB, along with a handful of much smaller companies, was involved in cartel activities in the heating
pipe manufacturing business between 1980 and 1989, according to the Commission.

TD
Offenses under  European law include price fixing,  and shutting out competitors, a  Commission
official said.

E.U. Commissioners meet Wednesday in Strasbourg to decide how much to  fine the companies involved, and lawyers expect them to come down hard, particularly on ABB.

"I wouldn't be surprised if the  fine was over XEU20 million," said one lawyer specialized in E.U. competition law.

The lawyer said ABB's behavior could be classified as a "very serious infringement", in E.U. terminology.

These cases involve price fixing  and practices "that jeopardize the proper functioning of the single market," according to a Commission document.

Other companies involved include three other Danish manufacturers - Logstar, Tarco and Starpipe - and two Germany-based companies, Panisovit and Isoplus.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission said Wednesday that it has  fined Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG (ABBBY) XEU70 million over its involvement in a price-fixing cartel in the 1980s.

A spokesman for ABB said that the company hadn't yet decided whether to appeal against the  fine, and said there would be no further comment until it has scrutinized the E.U. decision.

TD
The E.U. Commission fined 10 companies in total, although ABB's  fine was by far the largest. The total fines amounted to XEU92.21 million.
Other companies involved include Danish manufacturers Logstar and Tarco, which were  fined
XEU8.9 million and XEU3 million, respectively.

Two Germany-based companies, Pan-isovit and Isoplus, were  fined XEU4.95 million and XEU1.5 million, respectively.

Smaller fines were imposed on Dansk Ror (XEU1.475 million), Brugg (XEU925,000), KWH (XEU700,000) and Ke-Kelit (XEU360,000).
ABB, along with a handful of much smaller companies, was involved in cartel activities in the heating
pipe manufacturing business between 1980 and 1989, according to the Commission.
The cartel "began in Denmark in late 1990 and soon extended to Germany and other markets," the
E.U. Commission said in a statement.

HD         EU Fines ABB Asea Brown Boveri $84 Million  In Price-Fixing Ruling

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Wednesday that it has  fined Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG 70 million European Currency Units ($84 million) for the concern's alleged involvement in a price-fixing cartel in the 1980s.

A spokesman for ABB (ABBBY) said the company hadn't yet decided whether to appeal the  fine, adding that it would make no further comment until it has reviewed the EU decision. ABB could appeal to the executive arm of the 15-member  European union.

TD
The commission alleges that ABB, along with a handful of much smaller companies, was involved in cartel activities in the heating-pipe manufacturing business between 1980 and 1989. ABB's  fine was by far the largest of the  fines, which totaled 92.21 million ECU, that the EU imposed on 10 companies

Among other concerns  fined in the price-fixing case were two German-based companies, Pan-isovit and Isoplus, which were penalized 4.95 million ECU and 1.5 million, respectively. Danish manufacturers Logstar and Tarco were  fined 8.9 million ECU and three million, respectively. Several other companies received smaller fines, including Dansk Ror, Brugg, KWH and Ke-Kelit

Fines for serious violations of the EU's anticompetition law usually begin around 20 million ECU, but they can range upward for more serious and lengthy violations. They can also be lowered for mitigating factors, such as cooperating with investigators.

The fines in ABB's case were imposed for "running a secret  market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel" in pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor, the EU Commission said. The cartel "began in Denmark in late 1990 and soon extended to Germany and other markets," the commission added.

District heating systems serve whole localities by a system of underground  pipes that carry hot water into each house from a central heat generation source, such as a power station.

"In Germany and Denmark, the two largest markets, the producers operated a particularly sophisticated system of bid-rigging: a 'favorite' was nominated to win each contract and the other  cartel members put in higher offers," the  commission said.

The commission added that the  cartel "systematically tried to force out of business the only competitor not in the ring" - Powerpipe, of Sweden.

Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the ABB  fine was so large for several reasons, including evidence the cartel had been initiated "at the top level."

The commission said it is pleased by ABB's assurances that it would "take all measures called for by this decision, including those ensuing from personal responsibilities within the company."
"ABB's position is underscored by the recent resignation of the company's former Executive
Vice-president who effectively co-ordinated the  cartel," the  commission added.

The highest  fine ever imposed by the commission reportedly is a 273 million ECU penalty levied last month against the Transatlantic Shipping Conference Agreement for allegedly driving up prices on transatlantic container traffic between 1993 and 1995. The  fines run from 6.88 million ECU for the

Page 41 of 80 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
smallest company in the group to 41.26 million for the largest. The trade group has advised its members to appeal.

In January the  commission fined Volkswagen AG 102 million ECU, the prior record, for allegedly preventing customers from buying its cars across national borders for years. Volkswagen has also indicated that it plans to appeal.

Separately, ABB reported a 10% rise in nine-month net profit, below analysts' forecasts of an increase of 12% to 29%. Net income totaled $849 million compared with $774 million a year ago.

In its earnings report ABB said that before translation into dollars, earnings in the currencies of the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant's various markets rose 11%. Sales were down 0.7% to $22.31 billion from $22.46 billion.

For the full year, the company (ABBBY) said that excluding a year-ago restructuring charge, 1998 earnings should exceed the 1997 level. In 1997, the company took an $866 million charge in anticipation of a negative impact from the Asian financial crisis. The company reported net profit last year of $572 million. The charge financed a reshuffling of some operations in the U.S. and western Europe, including the reduction of 10,000 jobs, as well as to pay for its Asian expansion.

One marker of whether that strategy will yield dividends can be found in incoming orders, which fell 5% world-wide to $25.70 billion from $27.06 billion, in line with forecasts. Valued in local currencies, orders were little changed for the first nine months.

"The results were lower than expected and the order intakes weren't too good," said a trader at a foreign bank in Zurich. "The results were nothing dramatic." ABB's shrinking order book suggests weak earnings growth for some time to come, analysts said. Income growth, they added, would have to depend on ABB's restructuring efforts to reduce costs.

Francine Lenoir, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, said she now expects ABB to report a 10% rise in net income for the full year, down from her previous expectation of a 17% increase. "The main question is about  Europe," Lenoir said, explaining that much depends on increased demand for ABB's products and services in this region. "But there is less clarity here," she said, referring to the uncertain European outlook.

Lenoir and other analysts said signs that Asian markets may be bottoming out and stabilizing are reassuring for ABB, but growth still seems some way off.

Indeed, ABB Chief Executive Goeran Lindahl told Dow Jones that "It will take a few years, maybe three years" for growth to return in the Asian countries. He was more hopeful about the large markets of India and China, saying growth there could offset slowdowns elsewhere.

Against that, analysts said, was the possibility of a slowdown in North America. Nonetheless, they weren't discouraged by the results.

Pierre Tissot, an analyst at Lombard Odier & Cie in Geneva, said ABB seemed prepared to "make the best" of a bad economic situation in many of its markets. He lauded the company's restructuring efforts and approved of what he called a very selective approach by ABB in accepting contracts and orders.

"They aren't accepting any (contracts) unless they promise satisfactory profits," Tissot said. The order book, he noted, now was smaller but of a "better quality."

Lindahl said he remains optimistic that growth in Asia will return and that continued growth in India and China could compensate for losses elsewhere. "In the longer term I'm optimistic that we will see growth return to the Asian countries," Lindahl said. "It will take a few years, maybe three years."
Lindahl reiterated that he expects volumes in the full year of 1998 to match volumes seen in 1997. Regarding ABB's presence in Brazil, Lindahl said he doesn't expect to see a dramatic impact on
earnings if Asia's economic crisis spreads there.
ABB expects to see new opportunities for growth in North and South America, the Middle East and
Africa, Lindahl said.

EU competition officials, meeting in Strasbourg on October 21, will decide the gravity of a number of price-fixing allegations made against heating  pipe cartels, particularly firms in Scandinavia, a Commission official confirmed as European Report was going to press. The meeting, held behind close doors, is expected to impose maximum fines under EU law for heating  pipe manufacturers of 10% of annual group turnover, which, it is feared might force some manufacturers to close down. (European Report will return to this case in a forthcoming issue.).

BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to announce on Wednesday a stiff  fine on Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd for allegedly stifling competition in the heating  pipes market.

Commission sources said the European Union executive would also punish five small German and
Danish firms.

TD
But they were tight-lipped on the level of the  fines which were expected to be decided at the
Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday afternoon.

A Commission spokesman said an announcement may have to wait until this evening to allow time to inform the companies concerned.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog, has been investigating the firms' practices for years amid suspicion of price-fixing and the carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.

Rival Swedish firm Powerpipe has said the existence of the  cartel was common knowledge in the industry. Besides ABB, the companies concerned are Logstor, Tarco and Starpipe of Denmark and Germany's Panisovit and Isoplus.
Under 1997 guidelines the  Commission can fine companies guilty of  cartel operation a base sum of
20 million Ecus ($23.93 million). But amounts actually levied in cases since then have been higher and
lower depending on whether a company was ringleader or not, its size and the seriousness and
duration of the infringement.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies, all of them hit with much smaller amounts.

In September it slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).
Volkswagen holds the record for the biggest EU  fine on an individual company at 102 million ecus. ($1=.8357 Ecu).

ZURICH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd said it had no comment for the moment on a fine of 70 million Ecus slapped on it by the  European Commission for operating a price cartel in heating pipes.

"We have received the ruling. We are studying it and we have no comment for the time being," a spokesman for the Swiss-Swedish group told Reuters.

TD
The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, also  fined Danish company Logstor 8.9 million Ecus and imposed lesser penalties on eight smaller companies.

The Commission said in a statement that ABB and the other companies had been punished for "running a secret market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor".
It said the  cartel was started in Denmark in 1990, extended to Germany soon afterwards and from
1994 "the whole  European market, worth around 400 million Ecus, was cartellised".

BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday slapped a 70 million Ecus ($84 million) fine on Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd for allegedly stifling competition in the market for heating  pipes.

This was the third largest  fine ever imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog on a single company after Volkswagen in January (102 million Ecus) and Tetra-Pak in 1991 (75 million Ecus).

TD
In a damning statement, the Commission said ABB and nine smaller companies were guilty of "running a secret market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor."
It said the  cartel was started in Denmark in 1990, extended to Germany soon afterwards and from
1994 "the whole  European market, worth around 400 million Ecus, was cartellised."

European antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said it was "difficult to imagine a worse cartel" and added that a former ABB Executive Vice-President directed the  cartel. The Commission did not give his name.
ABB said it had no reaction as it was studying the ruling.

District heating  pipes are common in northern and eastern  Europe. Instead of each building being individually heated, whole localities are served via a system of underground  pipes carrying hot water into each house from a central power station.

Other companies worst hit were Denmark's Logstor (8.9 million Ecus) and German firms Henss/Isoplus and Pan-Isovit with  fines of 4.95 million Ecus and 1.5 million Ecus respectively.

The Commission had been investigating the firms' practices for years and in 1995 carried out dawn raids at their premises after it received complaints from rival Swedish firm Powerpipe.

"The Commission...found that the  cartel systematically tried to force out of business the only competitor not in the 'ring', Powerpipe of Sweden," the statement said.

Powerpipe came under reprisal measures by ABB and the other  cartel members especially after it won a contract in Germany "so large that the  cartel had allocated it to a consortium of ABB, Henss/Isoplus and Pan-Isovit," the  Commission said.

The ABB fine was considerably higher than the 20-million-Ecu base sum the Commission can levy in relation to price-fixing or market-sharing cartels. One aggravating circumstance was the cartel continued for nine months after EU inspectors found incriminating evidence in the surprise raids, the Commission said.

Under EU legislation  fines cannot go beyond 10 percent of a company's total annual sales, a threshold which has never been approached.

The ABB  cartel is the third such announcement by the  Commission since September, the result of years of active investigations by  European cartel busters who, in Van Miert's recent words, have never been so busy.

Last week the  Commission fined British Sugar 39.6 million ecus for conspiring on prices in Britain with other companies.

In September it also slapped a total record  fine of 273 million Ecus on 15 shipping firms, with the highest penalty for P&O Nedlloyd (41 million ecus).
($1=.8357 Ecu).

ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG (ABBGY) said Thursday that it will appeal an $84 million  fine imposed by the European Union Commission for alleged price fixing  in the 1980s.
ABB said it considered the  fine disproportionate and at variance with previous  Commission practice.

TD
In its ruling, the E.U.  Commission fined ABB for its alleged involvement in  cartel activities in the heating pipe manufacturing business between 1980 and 1989.
The fines were imposed for "running a secret  market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in
pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor, the
Commission said in a statement Wednesday.

Since 1996, when ABB management had established the facts on the violations, ABB cooperated closely with the  European Commission's investigations, ABB said.

"Following the discovery of the infringements, ABB has taken strong internal measures to reinforce compliance with competition rules," ABB said.

THE European Commission has fined ten firms a total of 92.21 million ecu for operating a secret market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in pipes used for district heating systems and for attempting to eliminate a competitor, Powerpipe of Sweden. The biggest  fines have been imposed on to Switzerland's ABB and Denmark's Logstor AS, which must pay 70 and 8.9 million ecu respectively.

THE Commission came under fire from member states this week for suggesting that state television may be getting too much public money and wasting it on buying costly broadcast rights to sports events and entertainment shows. A majority of countries agreed not to adopt guidelines for applying EU state aid rules to the broadcasting sector, fearing this would limit their right to finance public TV.

US FEARS that the EU might be trying to exclude American suppliers from  Europe's mobile phone market were this week rejected by the  Commission. US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she was concerned that the EU was pushing "exclusionary" technical norms in the race to develop the next generation of mobile phone standards. But a spokesman for Telecoms Commissioner Martin Bangemann said the Union only wanted to ensure that rival systems for the 'third generation' system were "compatible".

COMPANIES in  Europe must move beyond national borders and take a pan-European approach to cope with the pressures of a single currency, a report by a British-based think-tank said this week. The report by The Economist Intelligence Unit said the approach of economic and monetary union was likely to increase cost-cutting pressure on multinational companies.

NORDIC building materials company Scancem AB said this week it was looking into a proposal made by its main owner Skanska to settle an EU dispute regarding its market dominance in the region. Scancem said in a statement that its board had asked chief executive Sven Ohlsson to evaluate possible alternatives to Skanska's plan. Last week, Skanska said Scancem should sell off its Finnish operations
or take similar action, which would in turn pave the way for Skanska to reduce its stake in Scancem.

CENTRAL and eastern  European countries seeking EU membership will need to spend 33 billion ecu to create an effective rail infrastructure, a  Commission official claimed this week. He said this investment was needed to create crucial rail corridors covering some 20,000 kilometres of track in the region,
adding that it was essential not only to cope with the predicted quadrupling of East-West traffic once the easterners joined the EU, but also to avoid replicating western  Europe's mistake of abandoning rail for roads.

THE Commission this week approved Novartis AG's transplant drug Simulect for marketing in the EU. Simulect, which has already been launched in the US and Switzerland, is designed to help prevent rejection of donor kidneys in transplant patients.

TAX Commissioner Mario Monti said this week that the EU should reach an agreement on proposals for a coordinated approach to taxing interest on private savings in the Union by June next year. The prediction followed a discussion on the subject at a recent informal meeting of EU finance ministers in Vienna.

MONTI'S officials say they are narrowing the differences between the EU and US over online privacy protection and do not expect a trade row to erupt once a tough new Union law takes effect on Saturday (24 October). US Under-Secretary of Commerce David Aaron said the US had accepted the  European

POLISH Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek claimed this week that  Commission President Jacques Santer had supported his country's plan to restructure its steel sector and he predicted the 15 EU member states would do the same. He told reporters that Santer had given his "unequivocal support" to the plan which involved ending tariff protection by 2000 and setting production quotas.

HD        EUROPE - ABB fined heavily over role in cartel. BY       By Emma Tucker in Brussels.

The European Commission yesterday slapped an ECU 70m ( #50m)  fine on ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering multinational, for its critical role in a price-fixing cartel, which from 1994 controlled the entire European market for insulated steel heating pipes. Nine other companies were  fined a total of ECU 22.21m.

The Commission, the European Union's executive branch, also accused the  cartel of trying to force out of business the Swedish company Powerpipe, the only competitor not part of the "ring". "It is difficult to imagine a worse cartel," said Karel Van Miert, the EU competition commissioner. "The main producers tried to bankrupt the only competitor who was willing to take them on. They deliberately flouted EU public procurement rules... and they continued the violation nine months after  Commission investigators
caught them red handed."

TD
ABB said yesterday it had not yet decided whether to appeal against the  fine, among the largest imposed on an individual company.

The other companies involved in the case were Loegstoer, Tarco, and Starpipe of Denmark; Isoplus, Pan-Isovit, Brugg Rorsysteme and Ke-Kelit of Austria and Germany; KWH Tech of Finland, and Sigma Tecnologie di Rivestimento of Italy. Loegstoer got the second biggest  fine of ECU 8.9m.

According to the  Commission the cartel began in Denmark in 1990, but soon spread to cover the entire European market worth around ECU 400m. In Germany and Denmark, the two biggest markets, the cartel operated a sophisticated system of bid rigging under which one company was nominated to win the contract and other  cartel members deliberately put in higher offers. Brussels investigators were tipped off by Powerpipe in 1995 after the  cartel members, furious that Powerpipe had won a big project in Germany, refused to deliver supplies to the Swedish company.

Yesterday was the third time in less than two months that the  Commission, which acts as  Europe's antitrust enforcer, has imposed  fines on companies involved in market-rigging. Earlier this month it punished two British sugar companies and last month it imposed its biggest ever antitrust  fines on 15 of the largest shipping lines. The  Commission said the fines would have been higher if the companies had not owned up to their violations.

ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, was  fined 70m ecus (#49m) by the European              Commission yesterday for stifling competition in the heating  pipes market, compounding the disappointment of lower than expected results (Adam Jones writes).

ABB and several other companies had been investigated amid suspicion of  price-fixing and the carving up of markets in Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Its  fine is the third-largest imposed by the  Commission on a company.

TD
ABB said nine-month net profits rose 9.7% to $849m on operating profits of $1.44bn, up just 1.5 percent. Sales were almost unchanged at $22.3bn.

Analysts had forecast an average net profits rise of 18% to over $911m. ABB said it was sticking to its forecast of higher net profits for 1998 as a whole.

ZURICH, Oct 22 (AFP) - ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd said on Thursday that it will appeal to the European Court of Justice against a fine of 70 million ECUs (84 million dollars) imposed by the European Commission concerning a pipe cartel.

The commission said on Wednesday that it would  fine ABB and nine other companies 92.21 million ECU for running a market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging cartel in district heating  pipes and for seeking to eliminate a competitor.

TD
ABB said the  fine was "disproportionate" and "at variance" with previous  commission practice.
ABB said it had cooperated closely with the EU  Commission's investigations since 1996. "Following the discovery of the infringements, ABB has taken strong internal measures to reinforce
compliance with competition rules."
ABB said it would have no further comment on this case at this time. tjf/hd

BRUSSELS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Thursday shrugged off
Swiss-Swedish engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd's announcement that it would appeal
against a heavy fine for running a cartel.

Spokesman Stefan Rating also dismissed ABB's argument that the 70 million Ecus ($84 million)  fine - the third largest ever imposed by the  European Union's antitrust watchdog - represented a shift from previous Commission practice.

TD
"I think it is very much in keeping with  Commission practice," Rating told a news briefing.

"I think the decision is very well reasoned...we have said our last word...it's now for the Court of Justice to assess whether (ABB's) argument holds water. I, for one, think it doesn't," Rating, a competition lawyer, added.

It is normal for companies to challenge big fines in the European courts. Volkswagen appealed a 102 million Ecus penalty imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog in January, the largest amount ever levied on a single firm.

But court challenges take years and the EU tribunals rarely overturn  Commission antitrust decisions, often reducing the  fines only symbolically or questioning points of procedure.

In the meantime, ABB must pay the  fine within three months. If it goes ahead with the appeal, which it must do within two months, it could choose to provide a bank guarantee which must cover the  fine, plus interest.

Antitrust challenges are lodged with the European Court of First Instance (CFI) and take on average two years. CFI decisions may be appealed in the European Court of Justice, the EU's higher court.

The Commission last year adopted guidelines on the method for calculating  fines which foresee a base sum of 20 million Ecus for "very serious infringements" of EU competition rules, usually
price-fixing and market-sharing cartels.

That increases depending on any aggravating factors, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement. Big companies are also usually hit harder than small ones because they are deemed to know that they are breaking the law.

The Commission identified the following factors in a statement issued after its decision on Wednesday to fine ABB and nine smaller firms for operating a  cartel in the market for district heating pipes:
- The fact that the  cartel activities continued for nine months after being uncovered.
- The fact that "one (of ABB's) most senior officers" master-minded and directed the  cartel.

The statement said the  fines would have been "substantially" higher had not "most of the producers admitted the violation". ABB said on Thursday it had cooperated closely with the  Commission since
1996.

Page 63 of 80 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The ABB  fine represents 44 percent of its sales of district heating steel pipes in 1995, but only 0.25 percent of its 1997 global group turnover of 27.6 billion Ecus, the Commission said.

Under EU rules the  Commission cannot fine a company more than 10 percent of its annual global turnover.

HD           ABB to appeal EU cartel fine. WC          457 words

ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd said it would appeal against a 70 million Ecus ($84 million)  fine imposed on it by the  European Commission for leading a cartel that controlled the  European heating pipe market.
"ABB said it considered the  fine disproportionate and at variance with previous  Commission
practices," the Swiss-Swedish group said in a brief statement.

TD
The fine announced on Wednesday was the third largest ever imposed by the  European Union's antitrust watchdog on a single company after Volkswagen in January (102 million Ecus) and Tetra-Pak in 1991 (75 million Ecus).

ABB declined to name the the manager or managers responsible for the alleged  cartel, which the Commission said grouped ABB with nine smaller companies to share markets, fix prices and try to drive a competitor out of the  European market for district heating systems.
ABB said it would appeal the  Commission's decision to the  European Court of Justice. "Since 1996, when ABB Group management had established the facts on the violations, ABB
cooperated closely with the  European Commission's investigations," ABB said in its statement.

"Following the discovery of the infringements, ABB has taken strong internal measures to reinforce complianmce with competition rules," the company said.
ABB said it would be making no further comment at this time.

"Because we are appealing, the case now becomes a matter of litigation, and that restricts what we can say," a spokesman added.
ABB named the business at the centre of the  Commission's allegations as ABB IC Moeller of
Denmark, part of the company's sprawling international Power Generation division.

District heating systems use large  pipes to move steam generated in electrical power plants to nearby settlements, rather than having boilers in each building. It is a common practice in northern and
eastern Europe.

European antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said the  cartel was directed by a former ABB Executive
Vice-President, but the  Commission did not give his name.
ABB also declined to name the manager referred to by Van Miert.

The title of executive vice-president is held by all members of the ABB group executive committee except the chief executive officer, who is president of the committee.

Besides power generation, ABB has global activities in industrial automation, power transmission and distribution, and supplies for the gas, oil and petrochemical industry.
It also has two service divisions, one for financing and another for contracting.

Better-than-expected third-quarter results from pharmaceuticals giant Novartis gave ZURICH a shot in the arm and, unlike many of its neighbours, the market closed higher.
The SMI index finished 91.8 or 1.5% better at 6,225.9. Novartis shot up SwFr 181 or 8.4% to SwFr
2,329 as the company unveiled its third-quarter sales figures and a bullish forecast for the full year.

TD
One analyst said that after a disappointing performance in the first half of the year, the company appeared to have turned round sales in the US. The figures were likely to mark the start of a revival of confidence in the company, he said.
Among the chemicals groups, Clariant, due to release nine-month figures today, lost SwFr 20 to SwFr
620, in spite of an upgraded recommendation from Goldman Sachs, while Ciba was flat at SwFr 110.25
as the US investment bank reduced its earnings estimates.

ABB gave up SwFr 53 to SwFr 1,471 in further response to Wednesday's figures and with the added irritation of a ECU 70m ( #49m) fine by the European Commission for leading an alleged  cartel that controlled the  European heating pipe market.

FRANKFURT registered its disappointment with the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged and the Xetra Dax index slid 85.43 or 1.9% to 4,449.12.

Deutsche Telekom remained under pressure for a second straight day, following a business magazine report that the company had cut its 1999 profit forecast. The shares lost DM 2.30 to DM 46.80 in spite of Telekom's insistence that it had not made any forecasts.
Mannesmann, its major telecoms competitor, was a beneficiary of switching and an upgrade from
Hypo-Vereinsbank. The shares closed DM 4.20 higher at DM 151.30.

Bank's were hurt by the absence of a rate cut and Deutsche Bank lost ground for the first time in three days. The shares turned back from a four-week intraday high to close DM 3.50 lower at DM 101.50. Hypo-Vereinsbank fell DM 3 to DM 137 while Dresdner, rumoured to be considering a takeover of Bfg Bank, lost DM 1 to DM 62.90.
Car stocks were weak after Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp was reported to have warned that
the industry could slide into recession soon. Daimler lost DM 4.45 to DM 132.80, while BMW lost DM 65
to DM 1,076 as events at its Rover Group UK offshoot continued to generate more heat than light.
AMSTERDAM survived a severe shakeout for Philips to end modestly higher. The AEX index hardened
1.67 to 972.33.

Philips initially pushed higher following third-quarter results, but ran into heavy selling late in the session. The shares closed off Fl 9.50 or 8.5% at Fl 102 in volume of 6.6m.

Royal Dutch also fell from grace. Following disappointing third-quarter results from its US offshoot, the oil giant fell Fl 1.60 to Fl 89.40.

Publishers had another active session. Wolters Kluwer, up 6.1% on Wednesday on rumours of a big buyer in the market, added a further Fl 2 to Fl 370. VNU rose Fl 2.60 to Fl 65.90.
Baan, badly mauled by a profits warning earlier this month, was taken up by the bargain hunters, rising
Fl 1.60 or 9% to Fl 19.40.
PARIS lost early gains amid disappointment over the Bundesbank's failure to cut interest rates and Wall
Street's weak opening. The CAC 40 closed 19.86 down at 3420.92.

Cap Gemini, the software company, gained FFr 14 to FFr 759 on the back of the recent rally in US technology stocks. Higher sales and a lower-than-expected impact from the Asian crisis helped Remy-Cointreau gain FFr 0.50 to FFr 78.50.

Vivendi, the diversified utilities group, gained FFr 24 to FFr 1,246 following a newspaper interview with the chairman of SGE, which is 51% owned by Vivendi. The interview contained a reiteration of earlier statements about the profitability of the construction group and SGE closed up FFr 16.90 at FFr 251.

MILAN closed lower despite an earlier rally triggered by hopes of an imminent rate cut, and the Mibtel index fell 185 or 1% to 19,352.

Olivetti, the most active issue of the day, was up L151 to L3,720. The shares jumped 7% after its mobile-telephone affiliate Omnitel announced higher-than-expected third-quarter net profit of L264bn.

Telecom Italia gained L59 to L11,478 after reports that chairman Gianmario Rossignolo would be stripped of his executive powers at today's board meeting.

Profit-taking hit Banca di Roma, which fell L146 to L2,695. Compart rose L15 to L1,166 on heightening speculation around its sale of Fondiaria to Generali and merger with Montedison.

MADRID was dragged down by disappointment over a rate cut and a weaker Wall Street, and the general index fell 16.13 or more than 2% to 728.44.

BBV was off Pta115 to Pta1,700 on profit-taking despite strong earnings figures. Argentaria lost Pta175 to Pta2,900, while Santander fell Pta140 to Pta2,375.

STOCKHOLM fell back sharply after posting early gains as the all share general index finished 65.19 off at 2,788.83. The strong early performance was in response to results from Ericsson that were only slightly below analysts' expectations.

The telecoms group announced profits up 17% to SKr12.1bn and turnover up 11% to SKr125.4bn. The market had been apprehensive following Volvo's disappointing results on Wednesday. In later trading Ericsson fell SKr1.50 to finish at SKr160 as Wall Street slipped.

HELSINKI rose as Nokia drove the Hex general index 80.62 higher to 4335.26. The telecoms company gained as a result of rival Ericsson's results and Nokia's own figures today. Nokia finished up FM15.5 at FM419.

Mining and metals group Outokumpu was among the leaders as a result of improving global sentiment, analysts said. Outokumpu, which hit record lows earlier in October, gained FM4 to finish at FM52. Written and edited by Michael Morgan, Jeffrey Brown, Emiko Terazono and Paul Gregan

ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering multinational, said yesterday it would appeal against an ECU 70m
( #50m) fine imposed by the European Commission for taking part in a market-rigging, price fixing   
cartel in the market for insulated heating pipes.

ABB said the  fine was "disproportionate" and "at variance with previous Commission practice". Loegstoer of Denmark, one of nine other companies involved in the cartel, said it would also appeal against its ECU 8.9m  fine. The companies have to pay the  fines within three months. However, the Commission can accept a bank guarantee in lieu of payment while the appeal is heard, provided interest is added to the value of the  fine if the appeal is unsuccessful.

VAN MIERT EXPLAINS REASONS FOR VERY HEAVY  FINE ON ABB (ASEA BROWN BOVERI) FOR AGREEMENT OVER DISTRICT HEATING SYSTEMS - "IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A WORSE CARTEL".

TD
Brussels, 22/10/1998 (Agence  Europe) - As EUROPE announced yesterday, the European Commission has slapped fines for a total of ecu 92.2 million on ten companies that had set up a cartel in the field of district heating systems. The heaviest  fine, covering around 75%, was inflicted on the multinational firm ABB (Asea Brown Boveri).European Commissioner Karel Van Miert explained the size of the  fine as
follows:"Major industrial groups taking part in secret cartels cannot expect  fines to be limited to 10% of their turnover in the particular business; this would be a mere pinprick.  Fines have got to be felt. In this particular instance, it is difficult to imagine a worse  cartel. The main producers tried to bankrupt the only competitor who was willing to take them on. The deliberately flouted the EU Public Procurement rules. Bid-rigging is no better than fraud. They continued the violation for nine months after the Commission investigators had caught them red-handed. This violation calls for condign  fines".The fine imposed on ABB reflects the fact that one of its most senior officers in Zurich masterminded and directed the  cartel. The cartel was not therefore the unauthorised and atypical action of a minor subsidiary but a deliberate act decided at the top level. Van Miert emphasised once again the Commission's absolute determination to fight cartels as well
as other distortions of competition. However, the Commission is pleased to note ABB's assurances that it would take all measures called for by this decision, including those ensuing from personal responsibilities within the company. ABB's position is underscored by the recent resignation of the company's former Executive Vice-President who effectively coordinated the  cartel.A note from the spokesperson services explains the main elements of this case in detail:"District heating". District heating systems are common in Northern and Eastern  Europe but examples are found even in Greece and Portugal. Instead of each building being individually heated, whole localities are served via a system of underground  pipes carrying hot water into each house from a central heat generation source (often a power station; excess energy is used to heat the water).Nature of the  cartel. The cartel was formed in Denmark late 1990 and quickly spread to Germany and other Member States; from 1994, it had taken over the whole of the  European market, with a value of some ecu 400 million. The  cartel concerns the pipes, which consist of an inner steel carrier pipe for the hot water, an outer plastic casing  pipe and foam insulation between. The customers for district heating  pipes are mainly public and local government authorities. Contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive tendering and the larger projects are subject to European Union Public Procurement rules; these were deliberately flouted by the cartel. Moreover, the cartel allocated
national market quotas to its members and fixed prices in the pipes market. In Germany and Denmark, the two largest markets, the producers operated a particularly sophisticated system of bid-rigging: a "favourite" was nominated to win each contract and the other  cartel members put in higher offers. Th  cartel continued operating for nine months after the  Commission had discovered the evidence in surprise investigations in June 1995. The  Commission also found that the  cartel systematically tried to force out of business the
only competitor not in the "ring", Powerpipe of Sweden. Powerpipe informed the  Commission in January
1995 of a cartel, which, it claimed, was also taking reprisals against it because it refused the join. These
retaliatory measures had intensified since it entered the German market in 1994. After Powerpipe had won
a major contract in Germany which was so large that the  cartel had allocated it to a consortium of ABB,
Henss/Isoplus and Pan-Isovit, the other producers had organised a collective boycott and had prevented
Powerpipe getting supplies.The  fines. The Commission referred to the provisions in force according to

.../.. In very serious cases, the point of departure is a  fine amounting to ECU 20 million. The  Commission
takes into account the fact that most producers concerned had recognised the infringement and had

collaborated in the investigation (which allows for reductions in the  fine from 10-50%).At the end of the day, the fines decided were as follows:"ABB was  fined ECU 70,000,000, Logstor ECU 8,900,000,

Brugg Rohrsysteme German, Ke-Kelit Austrian and Sigma Italian.In a press release issued in Zuerich, the
group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) announced that it will file a suit at the Court of Justice against the
European Commission decision. It feels that the  fine is out of proportion and does not comply with earlier
Commission practices. The press release recalls that the ABB management cooperated closely in the
enquiry and that it took severe internal measures to guarantee its behaviour complied with the  European
competition rules.

HD    COMPETITION - HEATING PIPE CARTEL FINED BY COMMISSION FOR PRICE FIXING. WC   311 words
PD    24 October 1998
SN    European Report

A price-fixing cartel which started in 1990, involving ten  insulated steel heating pipe manufacturers, and by 1994 had totally controlled the entire  European market has been heavily fined by the European         Commission, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert announced on October 21.

Firms from Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Finland and Italy were all  fined heavily by the Commission for their part in a  price-fixing scam, which left only one Swedish competitor, Powerpipe, in the market and continued 9 months after competition officials carried out dawn raids on the companies' offices in search of evidence of collusive practices. In 1995, Powerpipe blew the whistle on the ring after the cartel refused to supply the Swedish firm with supplies because it had secured an important contract which the cartel members expected to win.

TD
"It is difficult to imagine a worse  cartel", Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said, describing the price-fixing ring which in Germany and Denmark operated under a system whereby one company would be nominated to win a contract while other companies in the ring deliberately put in higher bids. The companies involved in the exposed  cartel were Logstor, Starpipe, Tarco, Isoplus, Pan-I-sovit, Brugg Rorsysteme, Ke-Kelit, KWH Tech and Sigma Technologie di Rivestimento.

The biggest offender by far, though, was the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri (which currently has the Commission's Merger Task Force looking at the merger of one of its subsidiaries with Volvo Aero); the Commission imposed fines of ECU 70m while the nine other firms, together, were  fined a total of only ECU 22.21m. ABB immediately announced that it would fight the  fine, which it considers "disproportionate and at a variance with previous Commission practice", particularly as ABB had cooperated closely with the European Commission's investigations.

Five of Europe's biggest gas companies are under investigation by the  European Commission for alleged anti-competitive behaviour, an official said yesterday.
Following complaints from a North Sea gas producer, the  Commission last year raided the premises of
Ruhrgas, Brigitta, Thyssengas, Gaz de France and Gasuni.

TD
The Norwegian subsidiary of Marathon, the US oil company, complained that the five companies were effectively fixing their prices by co-ordinating the terms under which they bought gas from the Texan supplier.

Marathon also complained that whenever it tried to sell gas to other bodies, the five companies barred access through the pipeline system.

If the companies are found guilty of colluding, the  Commission has the power to  fine them. In the last six weeks it has imposed heavy  fines on shipping companies, sugar companies and steel  pipe manufacturers for their roles in cartels.

It could be several months before the investigation is concluded because of the difficulty of proving collusive behaviour. Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the US Federal Trade  Commission, raised the case on Wednesday when he met Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner. The complaint falls under the EU's sole jurisdiction.

Ruhrgas and Brigitta are two of Germany's largest natural gas importers and distributors. Gaz de France is France's natural gas monopoly.

Earlier this month Britain's two biggest sugar producers were fined by the Commission for fixing prices. Shortly afterwards,  fines were imposed on a group of heating pipe manufacturers, among them ABB,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, for operating a  cartel. The heaviest  fines ever imposed were on
15 of the world's largest shipping lines. In September they were told to pay ECU 273m ($328m) for
abusing their dominant positions in the market and operating a  price-fixing cartel.

HD    COMPETITION PROBE INTO GAS GROUPS' PRICE FIXING. WC   226 words

LP
Following the hard-line policy of bringing cartels to book in recent weeks, the European Commission's Competition Directorate-General (which has  fined sugar producers, steel pipe manufacturers and shipping companies in the last six weeks) has now launched an investigation into price-fixing among five of Europe's biggest gas companies following a complaint from a Norwegian subsidiary of a US oil company. The firm lodged a complaint last year after failing to sell gas to other firms outside the 'ring' of five, claiming that the companies involved in the  cartel barred access through the pipeline system.

TD
The current investigation, which started following dawn raids of the five firms (Ruhrgas, Brigitta, Thyssengas, Gaz de France and Gasunie) could take several months to complete though as investigators from the Commission's own competition department will try to piece together evidence and testimony from a wide range of sources and areas. It is believed that the companies accused of the  price-fixing practices through access to the pipeline, were setting their tariffs by collectively coordinating the terms under which they bought gas from a Texan supplier. The case was raised on October 28, when Robert Pitofsky, Chairman of the US Federal Trade  Commission, paid a visit to the EU Competition Commissioner, Karel Van Miert, in Brussels.

HD     ABB exhorts  staff to comply  with ethical issue directives

ZURICH, Nov 13 (AFP) - ABB Group President Goran Lindahl issued strict orders to staff to comply with directives on ethical matters, in a letter erroneously sent to the Swiss press Friday.

"Serious problems of compliance with group directives and trade legislation have recently surfaced in our group, particularly in the areas of insider trading and trust violations," the letter addressed to ABB managers said.

TD
"These cases take a toll on our worldwide image and brand name, and on the loyalty of our customers and employees," the letter said.
The letter was unintentionally distributed to media through an in-house error.

The Swiss federal banking  commission is investigating insider trading allegations linked to ABB's 2.1 billion dollar acquisition of Dutch process automation group Elsag Bailey in October.
The European Commission announced in late October that it would fine ABB and nine other companies
92.21 million ECUs (110.7 million dollars) for running a market-sharing, price-fixing and bid-rigging
cartel in district heating  pipes and for seeking to eliminate a competitor.
The Swiss-Swedish group is appealing that decision in the  European Court of Justice.

Lindahl said staff must enforce strict compliance with group directives, indstructions and policies, and must not compromise on any issues that may constitute a violation of applicable laws wherever ABB is conducting its business.

ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, yesterday vowed to stamp out insider trading and anti-trust violations among its staff, after inadvertently admitting its image had been harmed by such incidents.

The move follows dismis-sal of two managers earlier this month, accused of using inside information to profit from ABB's $1.5bn ( #900m) acquisition of Elsag Bailey, a New York-listed process automation company.

TD
That case emerged just weeks after ABB was fined $85m by the European Commission for taking part in a price-fixing cartel in the market for insulated heating pipes.

Both incidents have dented the reputation of ABB, regarded for many years as one of the world's best managed industrial companies.

In a confidential memo to managers, Goeran Lindahl, chief executive, said: "These cases take a toll on our worldwide image and brand name, and on the loyalty of our customers and employees." The memo was mistakenly passed to the media after Infotec, the company's distribution agents in Zurich - where it has its headquarters - entered the wrong fax database for sending Mr Lindahl's letter around the world.

ABB denied the memo had been sent deliberately to news organisations to demonstrate increased internal scrutiny at the company.

The group said: "This is a terrible mistake by our fax service provider; it was meant for senior corporate offices, country managers and corporate staff managers."

The memo, entitled Compliance in the ABB Group, was followed swiftly by a release saying: "Please disregard the previously received memorandum which was for internal management distribution within ABB."

Some industry analysts, however, were sceptical. "Either it is gross incompetence or they are being rather Machiavellian about trying to improve their image," said one engineering analyst in Stockholm, who declined to be named.
