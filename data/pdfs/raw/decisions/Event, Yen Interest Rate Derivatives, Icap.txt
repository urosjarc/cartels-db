Feb 2 (Reuters) -  ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker, will be  fined by the EU this week for allegedly facilitating cartels on  yen-denominated inter-rate benchmarks, the Financial Times reported.

TD
The fine is expected to be under 10 million euros ($11.34 million), although the regulator will not decide on the exact penalty until later this week, the newspaper said. (http://on.ft.com/18I660O)

The European Commission charged ICAP in June with fixing yeninterest rate derivatives as part of a cartel including UBS , Deutsche Bank, RBS, JPMorgan , Citigroup and broker RP Martin.
Unlike this group of banks and brokers, which admitted wrongdoing in return for a reduced  fine, ICAP
has rejected the EU accusations and denied wrongdoing.
The FT, citing people involved in the case, said  ICAP had refused to settle and had informed the
European Commission that it would appeal against any  fine as wrong in fact and law.

ICAP faces an EU  fine this week for allegedly facilitating cartels on  yen-denominated inter-rate benchmarks, as Brussels tackles the holdouts in rate-rigging probes that have already resulted in about
€1.7bn in penalties.

The world's largest interdealer broker has strongly denied wrongdoing, refused to settle and has informed the  European Commission that it will appeal any  fine as wrong in fact and law, according to people involved in the case.

TD
Although the Commission will not decide on the exact penalty until later this week, it is expected to be under €10m. If its appeal is unsuccessful,  ICAP will however be in the line of fire for potential damages claims. The Commission declined to comment.

A charge-sheet served against ICAP in June accused the broker of enabling illegal arrangements between banks in markets for the yen-based London interbank offered rate and  yen Tibor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate. The allegations covered periods between 2007 and 2010.

The cartel probe is one strand of a long-running Commission investigation into manipulation of interbank lending benchmarks, such as Libor and its European sister benchmark Euribor, which involves up to 11 financial groups.

In late 2013, Brussels handed out a record €1.7bn of combined  fines to six banks and a cash broker which admitted their involvement in the cartels. Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and RP Martin were  fined a total of €669m for colluding on  Yen-Libor linked products. UBS won immunity and avoided a €2.5bn penalty by tipping off the Commission to the existence of the cartel.

The Commission has since confronted  ICAP and three other banks that refused to enter settlements on at least one of the alleged cartels. HSBC, JPMorgan and Crédit Agricole were also served a so-called statement of objections, a charge-sheet that outlines the Commission's case for potentially imposing a fine. The euribor cases are not expected to be concluded this week.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>Throughout the proceedings,  ICAP has argued that the setting of interest-rate benchmarks is not a competition issue and said the Commission has been unable to show ICAP benefited from participation in any cartel. While it admits that some staff were involved in individual malpractice, it argues the same issues were part of a £55m settlement with UK and US financial regulators in September 2013.

If its appeal is lodged,  ICAP will be the first financial institution to challenge the fundamentals of the Commission's rate-rigging cases in court. Société Générale has taken legal action over how its €446m settlement  fine was calculated.

ICAP acts as a middleman in the market, moving large and illiquid blocks of assets such as swaps between buyers and sellers, often by telephone. As an interdealer broker, it does not participate in the

daily Libor rate-setting process, although some of the products it does trade are based on it. However, their roles as intermediaries make it a key conduit in the market for information for other banks.

The Commission has in the past  fined groups that facilitated the functioning of a cartel between separate companies.

"We will be very disappointed if the European Commission chooses to pursue this case," a spokesperson for ICAP told Reuters. "The European Commission has failed to put forward any evidence to show a competition violation. We remain of the view that these allegations are without any merit and we will take all steps available to defend ourselves."
The European Commission said it had no comment on the matter. ($1 = 0.8817 euros) (Reporting by

Greece proposes restructuring ECB loans: In an apparent bid to protect private investors from additional losses, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is proposing to replace government debt held by the ECB and the official sector with growth-linked and perpetual bonds, an insider tells Reuters. Greece has yet to discuss the plan, which spares private sector debtors from any restructuring, with the ECB.

* German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that there will be "great tensions" in the eurozone if members were to fail to agree on a common path to remain competitive with the rest of the world, Bloomberg News says. Merkel's remark comes as eurozone leaders face new tension in connection with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' calls for a debt write-down. Tsipras is due to meet with  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow to discuss Greece's bailout program, Bloomberg News reports.

* U.K. Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday that the standoff between Greece and its lenders over the terms of the country's bailout program "is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy," Bloomberg News reports.

* The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision yesterday launched a consultation on guidance on accounting for expected credit losses. The paper sets out supervisory requirements for banks relating to sound credit risk practices associated with expected credit loss measurement. The 11 principles comprising the guidance include requiring banks to have a process in place to appropriately group lending exposures on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics.

* European banks are engineering so-called bail-in eligible securities to lower the cost of raising additional capital under new proposals from international regulators, the Financial Times writes. The new type of securities offer lower coupons than similar existing bonds but provide greater protection for investors.

* Starting in 2016, banks in the U.K. may be required to create stress test scenarios tailored to their businesses and have them approved by regulators, The Independent writes. The simulated disasters would be on top of an economic shock scenario that the Bank of England will set.

* German banks will face significant cost increases in 2015 and 2016 as bank levies are harmonized across Europe, the Börsen-Zeitungwrites.

The joint venture will kick off in France with the purchase financing of Peugeot Citroën cars, Cinco Días reports. Les Echos also reports.

Press Release

ICAP plc response to European Commission decision

London, 4 February, 2015-  ICAP plc (IAP.L), a leading markets operator and provider of post trade risk mitigation and information services, notes today's decision of the  European Commission (EC) to issue a fine of GBP11.3 million. This allegation relates to Yen Libor and is based on the same underlying matters that  ICAP Europe Ltd, a subsidiary of ICAP's Global Broking division, settled with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) in September 2013.

ICAP does not accept the EC's decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts.

HD      EU fines British cash broker 14.9 million euros for yen rate-rigging

Brussels (dpa) - The European Unionfined British-based brokering company  ICAP 14.9 million euros (17 million dollars) on Wednesday for manipulating  yen interest-rate benchmarks, as part of a wider crackdown on rate-rigging.

Suspicions about the practice date back to the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmarks involved - most notably Libor and Euribor - serve as references for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

TD
ICAP's fine relates to manipulations of the Libor rate for the Japanese  yen. In 2013, the London-based broker was already fined a combined 87.5 million dollars by US and British authorities for its activities.

The European Commission, the EU's executive, found that  ICAP had distributed misleading information and used its contacts at other banks to influence the  yen Libor rate.

The company had also served as a communications channel for two traders at Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) "thereby enabling the anti-competitive practices between them," the commission said.

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

ICAP is one of several financial institutions investigated by the commission over seven separate cases of
yen benchmark manipulations undertaken between 2007 and 2010.

The other companies - UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JP Morgan and the broker RB Martin - settled with the commission after admitting their cartel involvement. Between them, they were  fined almost 670 million euros.

ICAP had refused to settle, so the commission continued its investigation, concluding that the broker had been involved in six of the seven cartels.
The commission has also investigated rate-rigging practices in other currencies, including the euro.

HD     The Morning  Risk Report: China Bank Probes Point to Governance  Issues

China's high-profile anti-corruption drive has turned its head toward the nation's financial sector, as multiple reports noted this week, all of which pointed to the questioning of a senior executive of one bank and a board member of another regarding possible corruption. To that end, Beijing's anti-graft authorities recently formed a department to focus mainly on the financial sector, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing Chinese officials familiar with the matter.

Fitch Ratings, in a statement on Tuesday, said the investigations of the two bank leaders shouldn't greatly affect their employers, but they do "underscore broader issues" of governance, management and political risks at China's banks. The agency said its ratings for China's banks "already reflect a degree of risk related to weak corporate governance," and that a lack of transparency, as well as nascent regulatory and legal systems, are a sector-wide constraint on ratings. "These events...could be a precursor to a wider investigation into corporate management. If so, as far as the financial sector is concerned, it has the potential to enhance transparency and improve governance standards in the long run--which would be credit positive," said Fitch.

Joe Murphy, an attorney with 35 years' experience practicing in the compliance field, said the probes will likely send a message to Chinese firms that they need to have compliance programs, and independent reviews of those programs. Firms that are beholden to local governments, a common arrangement in China, present a high risk for corruption, he said. "You need some independent controls, and independence in the board, " said Mr. Murphy. "That board needs to supervise a compliance program.
Any type of corruption investigation is likely going to lead to the implementation of a compliance program."

Alibaba lawsuit faces long odds . The law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP has filed a class action suit against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., faulting the company for not disclosing meetings with China's State Administration of Industry and Commerce prior to its record-setting $25 billion public offering last September. Winning the case faces longer than the usual odds, attorneys say, and could be academic, because Alibaba's risk disclosures make it clear there are obstacles to enforcing U.S. court judgments against the company.

Flavorings makers focus on safety. Food and flavorings manufacturers are looking for ways to minimize the health and safety risks their workers face when handling large quantities of chemical compounds used to enhance scents and flavors. Federal exposure limits for the vast majority of such chemicals haven't been updated since the 1970s, and while some private groups have issued recommendations it's mostly falling on manufacturers to find solutions to keep workers safe and prevent complaints, lawsuits and workers' compensation claims that could cost them money and tarnish their reputations.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto called Tuesday for the government's watchdog agency to investigate whether there was any conflict of interest in federal government works awarded to contractors that sold homes to the first lady, the finance minister and to the president himself, the WSJ reports. In public remarks about the real-estate scandals affecting his government, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated that there was nothing illegal or improper in the purchases made from government contractors. But he acknowledged that revelations have generated doubts about the honesty of his government.

ICAP fined over Libor manipulation .

Korean bribery evolves. In South Korea, there's evidence of evolution in the art of bribery, the WSJ
reports. Traditionally, those looking for business favors have provided apple boxes full of cash or
late-night entertainment. But a recent investigation by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office found
that bribery has become more personalized. A luxury sedan, an imported premium car, a high-end bicycle
and even tuition for golf lessons have been part of the kickbacks offered by lobbyists to executives at
Korea's utilities companies, the prosecutor's office said in a statement this week.

Wintergreen Advisers LLC is asking Coca-Cola Co. to retract "secret bonus" shares given to top management and asked for the company's board to resign, along with anyone involved in devising or promoting the executive-compensation plan, the WSJ reports. In a letter to the board released Tuesday, Wintergreen said the proxy statement for a revised plan announced in October failed to adequately explain the program. Wintergreen charged that proxy statement fell "far short of the both the spirit and letter of federal securities laws governing proxy disclosure."

World Bank launches probe over China loan. The World Bank has launched an investigation into whether its chief financial officer and other top brass mishandled a $1 billion Chinese loan to the bank's poverty fund, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. The bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, hired a top law
firm on behalf of the institution in late December to conduct the review after senior finance officials flagged the transaction to external auditors, according to these people. At issue is whether management created a conflict of interest when one of the bank's units helped China lend cash to another of the bank's arms.

BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) -  ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker, was  fined 14.9 million euros ($17.1 million) on Wednesday for rigging the  yen Libor financial benchmark, part of a crackdown by EU regulators against anti-competitive behaviour in the industry.
The European Commission said ICAP took part in several cartels, which included UBS, Royal Bank of
Scotland , Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan and broker RP Martin.

All of the institutions, except  ICAP, admitted wrongdoing and received a reduced total  fine of 669.72 million euros in December 2013. UBS escaped a sanction because it alerted the rigging to the Commission.

The European Union antitrust authority said ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels by disseminating misleading information to certain banks on the yen Libor panel and also used its contacts on the panel to influence the setting of the rates.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is currently probing possible wrongdoing in the foreign exchange markets, said the decision sent a strong signal to the industry.

"(Tuesday's decision) marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  Yen interest rate derivatives sector -- but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets," she said.

ICAP, one of 10 institutions  fined by U.S. and European authorities in 2013 for rigging  yen Libor benchmarks, said it would challenge the EU decision in court.

"This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the European Commission has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation," the company said in a statement.

U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down billion of dollars in  fines to more than 10 banks and brokerages for fixing various financial benchmarks.

Icap, the broking giant founded and run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, has been fined €15 million (£11.2 million) by the  European Commission for colluding in the Libor-fixing scandal and breaking cartel rules.

But Icap immediately said it would challenge the  fine on the grounds that it was a regulatory matter not a competition issue.

It said in a statement: "ICAP does not accept the EC’s decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled."

"It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation."
It has already paid £55 million to the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission over  yen Libor rigging.

“Today’s decision to  fine the broker Icap sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences,” said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
“It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  yen interest-rate derivatives
sector — but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets.”

Icap said it would challenge the  fine in the European Courts.

HD     Broker ICAP Fined For Participation In Yen Interest Rate Derivatives Cartels

(RTTNews) - The  European Commission has fined the UK based broker ICAP EUR14960000 for having breached EU antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels in the sector of Yen interest  rate derivatives (YIRD).

In December 2013, the Commission already imposed  fines on a number of major banks that decided to settle the case with the Commission.

TD
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in charge of competition policy said: "Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences."
The Commission imposed  fines on the banks UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan and on
the broker RP Martin in December 2013. These companies had admitted their involvement in one or more
cartels in the YIRD sector, which allowed the Commission to settle the case with them.

In the YIRD sector, the Commission uncovered seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between 1 and 10 months in the period 2007 to 2010. The anticompetitive conduct concerned discussions between traders of the participating banks on certain JPY LIBOR submissions. The traders involved also exchanged, on occasions, commercially sensitive information relating either to trading positions or to future JPY LIBOR submissions.

Proceedings against  ICAP continued as it chose not to settle the case. The Commission's investigation uncovered that  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels in the YIRD sector through various actions that contributed to the anticompetitive objectives pursued by the cartelists

LONDON — European competition authorities  fined the British financial firm  ICAP about 14.9 million euros, or $17 million, on Wednesday, saying the firm had breached antitrust laws by facilitating attempts by several banks to rig a benchmark  interest rate.

The fine against ICAP comes more than a year after the European Commissionfined a group of global financial institutions  a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they had colluded to fix benchmark interest rates, including the  London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

TD
ICAP on Wednesday called the  fine “wrong both in fact and in law.”

The firm said the Europe Commission’s accusations related to activity regarding Libor as it was tied to the Japanese yen and involved actions for which it already had entered a regulatory settlement. The firm agreed to pay British and American authorities  an $87 million fine related to the Libor manipulation in 2013.

“This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled,”  ICAP said in a news release. “It is not a competition issue, and the E.C. has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European courts.”

On Wednesday, the  European Commission accused ICAP of disseminating misleading information to banks that weren’t part of a cartel of banks trying to influence the  yen Libor, saying the information was veiled as “predictions” or “expectations” of where the rate would be set.

The European CommissionfinedUBS, the  Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and the British broker RP Martin in December 2013 for their involvement in cartels that tried to influence the  yen Libor as it related to  interest rate derivative securities.

The European Commission also accused ICAP on Wednesday of using its contacts at other banks in an attempt to influence their submissions and serving as a communications channel between traders at Citigroup and at R.B.S., assisting in their anticompetitive behavior.

“Today’s decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences,” Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner responsible for competition policy, said in a  news release. “It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  yen interest rate derivatives sector – but not the end to our efforts to fight anti-competitive practices in financial markets.”

The European Commission said that its investigation found that  ICAP helped facilitate six different cartels that tried to influence the  yen Libor from 2007 to 2010.

Three former  ICAP brokers are facing separate criminal charges in London that they conspired to manipulate Libor as it related to the  yen and are expected to go to trial later this year.

London broker refused to do a deal with the  European Commission alongside other firms in 2013

ICAP, the inter-dealer broker set up by the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, said it plans to challenge a  fine of €14.6m (£11m) imposed by the  European Commission on Wednesday for the company’s role in trying to manipulate the  yen Libor benchmark.

TD
ICAP said the penalty for anti-competitive behaviour was “wrong both in fact and in law” as it relates to the same manipulation that has already led to a settlement with the US and UK regulators in September 2013.

“This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation,” the London-listed firm added in a statement.
The fine comes over a year after ICAPpaid £55m to settle with the Financial Conduct Authority and the
US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission on the same matters.
However, ICAP refused to take part in a settlement with the  European Commission alongside a
group of banks and brokers including Deutsche Bank, RBS, UBS, JP Morgan, RP Martin and Citigroup,
which paid fines totalling €669.7m in December 2013.

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequence,” said Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner overseeing competition policy. “It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  Yen interest rate derivatives sector – but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets."

The Commission found that  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels to rig the  yen Libor benchmark that were under investigation, relating to the period between 2007 and 2010.

Three former  ICAP brokers pleaded not guilty to criminal charges related to rigging Libor in the UK courts in December. They are expected to stand trial in September alongside former brokers from RP Martin.

Brussels, Feb. 4, (dpa/GNA) - The European Unionfined British-based brokering company  ICAP 14.9 million euros (17 million dollars) on Wednesday for manipulating  yen interest-rate benchmarks, as part of a wider crackdown on rate-rigging.

Suspicions about the practice date back to the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmarks involved - most notably Libor and Euribor - serve as references for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

TD
ICAP's fine relates to manipulations of the Libor rate for the Japanese  yen. In 2013, the London-based broker was already fined a combined 87.5 million dollars by US and British authorities for its activities.

The European Commission, the EU's executive, found that  ICAP had distributed misleading information and used its contacts at other banks to influence the  yen Libor rate.

The company had also served as a communications channel for two traders at Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) "thereby enabling the anti-competitive practices between them," the commission said.

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

ICAP is one of several financial institutions investigated by the commission over seven separate cases of
yen benchmark manipulations undertaken between 2007 and 2010.

The other companies - UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JP Morgan and the broker RB Martin - settled with the commission after admitting their cartel involvement. Between them, they were  fined almost 670 million euros.

ICAP had refused to settle, so the commission continued its investigation, concluding that the broker had been involved in six of the seven cartels.
The commission has also investigated rate-rigging practices in other currencies, including the euro. GNA

The world’s largest inter-dealer broker has been  fined £11million by the  European Commission over allegations it helped Libor  interest rate rigging 'cartels' set up by major banks.

Icap, the UK firm set up by former Conservative Party treasurer Michael Spencer, was accused by the EC of facilitating 'six of the seven cartels' set up to manipulate Libor interest rates denominated in the Japanese yen currency.

TD
These so-called cartels operated between 2007 and 2010 and were run by traders working for Royal
Bank of Scotland, Swiss giant UBS, Citigroup and Germany’s Deutsche Bank.

ICAP is a middleman which helps to broker trades between investment banks.

But yesterday the EC accused it of spreading misleading information to banks involved in setting Libor, a key benchmark interest rate used to set mortgages.
It was also accused of 'serving as a communications channel' between rogue traders of Citigroup and
RBS.
The fine for breaching competition law comes after  ICAP was hit with a £54million penalty last year by
UK and US regulators for Libor rigging.

ICAP (down 3.4p to 471.3p) refused to take part in a settlement with the EC alongside a group of banks and brokers. It said it would challenge the decision, saying it believes it to be 'wrong both in fact and law'.

ICAP Plc is facing an EU fine, expected to be less than €10 million, for allegedly facilitating cartels for
Japanese yen-denominated interest  rate derivatives, the Financial Times reported Feb. 2.

ICAP has denied the allegations and notified the  European Commission that it will contest any  fine as wrong in fact and law, the FT added, citing "people involved in the case." If  ICAP's appeal fails, the company could face potential damages claims.

TD
The EC will not decide on the exact amount of the  fine until later in the week of Feb. 2, according to the report.

In June 2014, the EC informed  ICAP of its preliminary view that the interdealer-broker may have acted as a facilitator to breaches of EU competition law by certain banks in relation to  yen LIBOR and  yen TIBOR for isolated periods between 2007 and 2010.

European Commission has issued inter-dealer broker with £11.3m  fine

Icap has said it will appeal against a decision by the  European Commission to fine the British broker
£11.3m regarding allegations that it facilitated  Yen Libor rate-rigging cartels.

TD
Icap issued a statement on Wednesday maintaining the  fine was “wrong both in fact and in law,” and said that it will be challenging the  fine through appeal in the European courts.

European antitrust regulators hit the world’s largest inter-dealer broker with the  fine over allegations that Icap took part in several  yen interest rate derivatives cartels, the latest move by the  European              Commission against rate rigging.

Icap said it does not accept the EC’s decision. “This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  Icap facilitated a competition law violation,” said the firm.

The allegation relates to  Yen Libor and is based on the same underlying matters that  Icap Europe, a subsidiary of Icap's global broking division, settled with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in September 2013, said the broker.

At the time,  Icap was hit by $87m in fines after it became the first broker to be found guilty of colluding with bank traders to rig the Libor benchmark  interest rate.

The bank was ordered to pay the CFTC a $65 million civil monetary penalty and take steps to ensure the integrity and reliability of its benchmark-setting protocols.

The FCAfined Icap £14 million ($22.4 million) reduced from £20 million on the basis that  Icap was willing to settle.

HD         ICAP to appeal EC’s yen Libor fine

ICAP believes that the  fine imposed by the European Commission of €14.96 million ($11.3 mn) on Wednesday for having breached EU antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels in the sector of  yen      interest rate derivatives is wrong both in fact and in law.

The interdealer broker argued that the issue was a regulatory matter which had already been settled, adding that that the Commission has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation and so the firm will be challenging the decision at appeal in the European Courts.

TD
On Wednesday, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, head of competition policy at the EC said that, “Today’s decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences.” She added that it marks the completion of the EC’s antitrust investigation in the yean  interest rate derivatives sector.

In December 2013, the Commission imposed  fines totaling €669 mn on UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan and the broker RP Martin, after the compaines admitted their involvement in  yen Libor rigging and agreed to settle their cases with the Commission.

According to the EC,  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels in the  yen interest rate derivatives sector through various actions that contributed to the anticompetitive objectives pursued by the cartelists. This was done, in particular, by disseminating misleading information to certain  yen Libor panel banks, using its contracts with several  yen Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringements with the aim of influencing their submissions, and serving as a communications channel between a trader of
Citigroup and a trader or RBS.

ICAP argued that this allegation relates to  yen Libor and is based on the same underlying matters that ICAP Europe, a subsidiary of  ICAP’s Global Broking division, settled with the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in September 2013.

HD        ICAP to fight €14.9m Brussels fine

ICAP is to fight a €14.9m  fine imposed on it by European antitrust authorities for aiding a cartel in the
yen swaps markets as Brussels formally closed a portion of its long-running probe into rate manipulation.
The UK interdealer broker said the  fine handed out by the  European Commission on Wednesday was
"wrong both in fact and in law".

TD
A charge-sheet served against  ICAP last year accused it of facilitating illegal arrangements between banks in markets for the  yen-based London interbank offered rate and  yen Tibor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate.

The allegations covered periods between 2007 and 2010.  ICAP said the fine was based on the same underlying case for which it had been  fined £55m by the UK and US regulators in September 2013.

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," said Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust commissioner.

She added that the ruling marked the end of its investigation into alleged manipulation of rates based on the Japanese currency. That was only one strand of a long-running Commission investigation into manipulation of interbank lending benchmarks, such as Libor and its European sister benchmark Euribor, which involves up to 11 financial groups. So far, six banks and an interdealer broker have been  fined
€669m for colluding on  yen-Libor products. The others admitted their involvement in the cartels.

ICAP's fine is based on its alleged infringements of anti-competitive rules, whereas the penalties levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were based on breaches of its systems and controls.

ICAP said it had not been shown any evidence of the effect of its actions on prices and competition in the market. The vast  interest rate swap market is largely conducted bilaterally and on the phone between banks. The company acts as a middleman in the market, moving large and illiquid blocks of assets such as swaps between buyers and sellers. It did not participate in the daily Libor rate-setting process, although some of the products it does trade are based on it.

"This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled," the company said in a statement. "It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation."
The broker plans to appeal to the general court in Luxembourg, where many applicants have their  fines
reduced and nearly 10 per cent of cases are thrown out. The process is likely to take two to three years.

The Commission said ICAP had disseminated misleading information to certain  yen Libor panel banks aimed at persuading non-members of the cartel to submit rates in line with the adjusted "predictions" or "expectations".

European commission fines international money broker for facilitating several cartels involved in setting benchmark interest rates in the Japanese  yen

Icap, the international money broker run by former Conversative party chairman Michael Spencer, has reacted angrily to a €14.9m (£11.3m)  fine from the European commission for rigging Libor.

TD
After a long-running dispute, the commission said it was fining Icap for facilitating several cartels involved in setting benchmark interest rates in the Japanese yen.

Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the decision to  fine Icap “sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences”.
“It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  yen interest rate derivatives
sector – but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets,” she said.

But Icap, which is the world’s biggest inter dealer broker and has already been  fined by the City regulator and the US authorities, said the decision was wrong in fact and law.

“This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  Icap facilitated a competition law violation.  Icap will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts,” the company said.

The commission has already imposed €669m of  fines for Libor rigging on banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank which had admitted their involvement in cartels to set  yen Libor. Icap refused to settle and the EC said it had found that the broker facilitated six of the seven cartels it had identified.

The EC kicked started the formal process against  Icap in June 2014 when it issued a statement of objectives , a key step in its investigative procedures.

Spencer has already expressed  his regret about the role of three of Icap’s former employees in rigging Libor for which it was fined £55m in September 2013 . One of them was known as “Lord Libor”. At the time, Spencer described up to 10 former and current employes as “rotten apples”.

HD     Euro banks downgraded

Six European banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc, had their ratings cut by
Standard & Poor’s on the prospect that their governments are less likely to provide aid in a crisis.

Barclays Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc also had the long-term ratings on their holding companies reduced. Standard Chartered Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc had their short-term ratings lowered as well, S&P said in a statement Tuesday. Deutsche Bank AG was among other banks in Germany and Austria that may have their credit ratings cut, S&P said.

TD
The lenders in the U.K., Austria and Germany were singled out for downgrades because those countries implemented rules requiring creditors to take losses before taxpayers at the start of this year, 12 months earlier than the rest of their peers in the 28-member European Union. S&P said in November it would review the banks’ ratings because of the move.

The EU enacted the bank-resolution law last year in a bid to end taxpayer bailouts that prevailed in the financial crisis.

Under the new rules, authorities will generally require 8 percent of a struggling bank’s liabilities to be wiped out before recourse can be made to industry funds or taxpayer support.

RBS said in a statement that S&P’s move wasn’t specific to the bank and welcomed the ratings company’s decision to upgrade its long-term outlook on the lender to stable from negative.

Officials at Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC in London, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and Zurich-based Credit Suisse declined to comment. A spokesman for Standard Chartered in London didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICAP Fined $17 Million by EU for Aiding Banks’  Yen Libor Cartels

ICAP Plc, the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks, was  fined 15 million euros ($17.2 million) by the European Union’s antitrust arm for helping traders to manipulate  yen Libor derivatives.

ICAP spread misleading information to lenders on a panel that set the interbank rate for  yen Libor and aided contacts between traders, the  European Commission said Wednesday in an e- mailed statement from Brussels.  ICAP in 2013 refused to join financial institutions in paying  fines to settle the EU case.

UBS Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and brokerage RP Martin Holdings Ltd. previously agreed to a combined penalty of 669.7 million euros. ICAP has paid fines of $88 million in a deal with U.S. and U.K. regulators to settle charges over contacts with UBS traders.

ICAP said it would appeal the  fine to the EU courts because the decision was “wrong both in fact and in law,” according to an e-mailed statement.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke Tuesday at a news conference in Washington about the Justice
Department’s $1.5 billion settlement with Standard & Poor’s.

S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., will pay more than a year’s profit to settle claims that it inflated ratings on subprime-mortgage bonds at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.
KPMG Survey Finds Companies Differ in Adopting COSO 2013

Twenty percent of 450 financial reporting executives surveyed last month by KPMG LLP said implementing the financial reporting framework known as COSO 2013 was “chief among their worries for year-end reporting,” according to a statement by the firm.

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s updated framework, agreed upon by five private organizations including the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Financial Executives International, was published in May 2013, with a December 2014 effective date.
Some public companies continue to use the original version that came out some 20 years ago in
Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

“The SEC has indicated it will accept the original version, for a period of time, so long as it is disclosed in the filing,” said George Graves, a partner in KPMG’s internal audit, risk and compliance services group.

“The reason why most publicly traded companies are focused on COSO 2013 is due to its importance to their compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404,” said Graves, referring to the landmark federal law aimed at improving corporate governance law and financial disclosure.

About 40 percent polled said they would adopt COSO 2013 for 2014 reporting, and 30 percent said they would do so in 2015. More than a quarter said they do not plan to implement it immediately and were uncertain as to when they would start using it, according to a statement by KPMG.

“While the transition will impact most companies to varying degrees, it’s going to be present more of a challenge for middle market companies, due to their fewer available resources,” Graves said.

BRUSSELS--London-based brokerage firm  ICAP PLC was fined EUR14.9 million ($17 million) on Wednesday by the European Union's antitrust body for participating in an attempt to manipulate key benchmark interest rates.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, had already imposed  fines on a number of major banks in December 2013 that decided to settle the case.  ICAP chose not to settle this case.

TD
In a statement, the Commission said it found that ICAP facilitated six of the seven distinct cases it had identified as breaching rules in the yen interest  rate derivatives sector. That included disseminating misleading information to some of the banks of the panel that set  yen rates and serving as a communications channel between traders involved in anticompetitive activities, the EU said.

The Commission also said that  ICAP used its contacts with several banks represented on the  yen rates panel that didn't breach EU rules "with the aim of influencing their submissions."

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said.
In a statement,  ICAP said it disputed the Commission's decision and will challenge the ruling. "ICAP doesn't accept the EC's decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a
regulatory matter that has already been settled," the company said. "It is not a competition issue, and the
EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be challenging
this decision at appeal in the European Courts."

ICAP reached a settlement in September 2013 with U.K. and U.S. regulators over their probes into manipulation of  yen benchmark rates.

In December 2013, the  European Commission imposed fines worth EUR669.7 million on UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and the broker RP Martin for their role in  yen benchmark rates cartels.

That was part of billions of euros of  fines levied by regulators against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other widely used financial benchmarks.

BRUSSELS--London-based brokerage firm  ICAP PLC was fined EUR14.9 million ($17 million) on Wednesday by the European Union's antitrust body for participating in an attempt to manipulate key benchmark interest rates.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, had already imposed  fines on a number of major banks in December 2013 that decided to settle the case.  ICAP chose not to settle this case.

TD
In a statement, the Commission said it found that ICAP facilitated six of the seven distinct cases it had identified as breaching rules in the yen interest  rate derivatives sector. That included disseminating misleading information to some of the banks of the panel that set  yen rates and serving as a communications channel between traders involved in anticompetitive activities, the EU said.
The Commission also said that  ICAP used its contacts with several banks represented on the  yen
rates panel that didn't breach EU rules "with the aim of influencing their submissions."

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said.
In a statement,  ICAP said it disputed the Commission's decision and will challenge the ruling. "ICAP doesn't accept the EC's decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a
regulatory matter that has already been settled," the company said. "It is not a competition issue, and
the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be
challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts."

ICAP reached a settlement in September 2013 with U.K. and U.S. regulators over their probes into manipulation of  yen benchmark rates.

In December 2013, the  European Commission imposed fines worth EUR669.7 million on UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and the broker RP Martin for their role in  yen benchmark rates cartels.

BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators handed down a 14.9-million-euro ($17.07 million) fine to ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker, for taking part in several  yen        interest  rate derivatives cartels.

The European competition authorities  fined the British financial firm  ICAP about 14.9 million euros Wednesday, saying the firm had breached antitrust laws by facilitating attempts by several banks to rig a benchmark interest rate.

The $17 million fine against ICAP comes more than a year after the European Commissionfined a group of global financial institutions a combined €1.7 billion to settle charges that they had colluded to fix benchmark interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

TD
ICAP said on Wednesday that the commission’s accusations related to activity regarding Libor as it was tied to the Japanese  yen and involved actions for which it already had entered a regulatory settlement. The firm agreed to pay the British and American authorities an $87 million  fine related to the Libor rate fixing in 2013.

‘‘This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled,’’ ICAP said in a news release. ‘‘It is not a competition issue, and the E.C. has presented no evidence that ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.’’

The European Commission said its inquiry found that  ICAP helped facilitate six different cartels that tried to influence yen-related Libor rates between 2007 and 2010.

HD           ICAP HIT WITH £11M LIBOR FINE BY           BY JAMES SALMON

LP
THE world's largest inter-dealer broker has been  fined £11m by the European Commission over allegations it helped Libor  interest rate rigging 'cartels' set up by major banks.

Icap, the UK firm set up by former Conservative Party treasurer Michael Spencer, was accused by the EC of facilitating 'six of the seven cartels' set up to manipulate Libor interest rates denominated in the Japanese yen currency.

TD
These so-called cartels operated between 2007 and 2010 and were run by traders working for Royal
Bank of Scotland, Swiss giant UBS, Citigroup and Germany's Deutsche Bank.

ICAP is a middleman which helps to broker trades between investment banks. But yesterday the EC accused it of spreading misleading information to banks involved in setting Libor, a key benchmark interest rate used to set mortgages.
It was also accused of 'serving as a communications channel' between rogue traders of Citigroup and
RBS.
The fine for breaching competition law comes after  ICAP was hit with a £54m penalty last year by UK
and US regulators for Libor rigging.

ICAP (down 3.4p to 471.3p) refused to take part in a settlement with the EC alongside a group of banks and brokers. It said it would challenge the decision, saying it believes it to be 'wrong both in fact and law'.

BROKERAGE  Icap has become the first City institution to challenge a  fine for attempted Libor manipulation, yesterday vowing to battle the  European Commission.

The EC issued the firm with a €14.9m (£11.2m) fine, arguing that Icap broke competition rules "by facilitating several cartels in the sector of yen interest  rate derivatives."

TD
Icap was fined £54m in 2013 by US and UK regulators after some of its former staff helped bank traders try to fiddle the key interbank  interest rate benchmark.
Chief executive Michael Spencer apologised at the time.

However, this time the interdealer broker believes it has no case to answer, and that there is no evidence against it.

"Icap does not accept the EC's decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled," the firm said in a statement.

"It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  Icap facilitated a competition law violation.  Icap will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts."

HD     Europa-Antitrust: Commission fines broker ICAP EUR 14.9 million for participation in several cartels in Yen interest  rate derivatives sector
WC    968 words

Release date - 04022015
The European Commission has fined the UK based broker ICAP EUR 14 960 000 for having breached
EU antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels in the sector of Yen interest  rate derivatives (YIRD).

TD
In December 2013, the Commission already imposed  fines on a number of major banks that decided to settle the case with the Commission.

Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in charge of competition policy said: ‘Today’s decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences. It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  Yen interest rate    derivatives sector - but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets.’

The Commission imposed  fines totalling EUR 669 719 000 on the banks UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan and on the broker RP Martin in December 2013. These companies had admitted their involvement in one or more cartels in the YIRD sector, which allowed the Commission to settle the case with them.

In the YIRD sector, the Commission uncovered seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between 1 and 10 months in the period 2007 to 2010. The anticompetitive conduct concerned discussions between traders of the participating banks on certain JPY LIBOR submissions. The traders involved also exchanged, on occasions, commercially sensitive information relating either to trading positions or to future JPY LIBOR submissions.

ICAP chose not to settle the case. Proceedings against it therefore continued under the normal procedure. The Commission’s investigation uncovered that  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels in the YIRD sector through various actions that contributed to the anticompetitive objectives pursued by the cartelists, and in particular, by:
disseminating misleading information to certain JPY LIBOR panel banks, which were veiled as
‘predictions’ or ‘expectations’ of where the JPY LIBOR rates would be set. This misleading information
was aimed at influencing certain panel banks that did not participate in these infringements to submit JPY
LIBOR rates in line with the adjusted ‘predictions’ or ‘expectations’ (UBS/RBS 2007, UBS/RBS 2008,
UBS/DB 2008-09, Citi/DB 2010 and Citi/UBS 2010 infringements);

using its contacts with several JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringements, with the aim of influencing their JPY LIBOR submissions (UBS/RBS 2007, Citi/DB 2010 and Citi/UBS 2010 infringements); and

serving as a communications channel between a trader of Citigroup and a trader of RBS and thereby enabling the anticompetitive practices between them (Citi/RBS 2010 infringement).
The fines imposed on ICAP are as follows: Name of undertaking

Fines

Following its earlier practice with respect to  fines for facilitators as well as the EU Court’s case law on this point, the Commission set the  fines as a lump sum by using its discretion in accordance with point 37 of the Commission’s 2006 Guidelines on  fines (also see Press release and Memo). The  fines reflect the gravity, duration and nature of  ICAP’s involvement as a facilitator as well as the need to ensure that the fine has a sufficiently deterrent effect.
Background on the products concerned

Interest rate derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products which are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of  interest rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. They derive their value from the level of a benchmark interest rate, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) - which is used for various currencies including the Japanese  Yen (JPY). This benchmark reflects an average of the quotes
Page 58 of 91 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
submitted daily by a number of banks who are members of a panel. It is intended to reflect the cost of interbank lending in Japanese  Yen and serves as a basis for various financial  derivatives. The level of
the benchmark rate may affect either the cash flows that a bank receives from a counterparty, or the cash flow it needs to pay to the counterparty under  interest rate derivatives contracts (for more details see also Memo).
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Antitrust Regulation (Council Regulation 1/2003) both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages can be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission  fine.
The Antitrust Damages Directive, which the Member States have to implement in their legal systems by
27 December 2016, makes it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to obtain compensation. More
information on antitrust damages actions, including a practical guide on how to quantify antitrust harm, is
available in the Commission’s Policy Brief and on the Commission’s website.

UK-based broker ICAP has been fined by the European Commission (EC) for its participation in the
Libor scandal concerning manipulation of benchmark interest rates.

ICAP has to pay a EUR 14.9 million penalty for its involvement in a number of cartels in the  Yen interest rate derivatives sector.

Dealers of the company thus helped banks to influence the important  Yen-LIbor reference rate in the period from 2007 to 2010.

ICAP has had to pay several  fines already for its participation in the scandal.

Brussels, 04/02/2015 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 4 February, the  European Commission decided to fine the UK-based broker  ICAP €14.9 million for facilitating six of the seven cartels discovered on the derivatives market for yen interest rates. The Commission presented its objections in June 2014 and
ICAP opted not to settle the case with the Commission.

TD
In December 2013, the Commission uncovered seven separate bilateral infringements in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, which lasted between one and ten months over the period from 2007 to 2010, involving five banks - UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin. For its part,  ICAP communicated misleading information to certain JPY Libor panel banks, which was presented as predictions or expectations of the level at which the  yen libor rate would be set. This information aimed to influence certain panel banks not involved in the infringements to submit  yen Libor rates in line with the adjusted predictions or expectations, the Commission explains.  ICAP also used its contacts with several yen Libor panel banks not involved in the infringements to influence their  yen Libor submissions. Lastly, ICAP served as a communications channel between a Citigroup trader and an RBS trader, thereby enabling the anti-competitive practices between them.

“Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences. It marks the successful completion of our anti-trust investigation in the yen interest rate derivatives sector - but not the end to our efforts to fight anti-competitive practices in financial markets”, said Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner.

The European Commission has fined the UK based broker ICAP 14 960 000 for having breached EU antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels in the sector of Yen interest  rate derivatives (YIRD). In December 2013, the Commission already imposed  fines on a number of major banks that decided to settle the case with the Commission.

Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in charge of competition policy said: "Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences. It marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  Yen interest rate derivatives sector but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets."

TD
The Commission imposed  fines totalling 669 719 000 on the banks UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan and on the broker RP Martin in December 2013. These companies had admitted their involvement in one or more cartels in the YIRD sector, which allowed the Commission to settle the case with them.

In the YIRD sector, the Commission uncovered seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between 1 and 10 months in the period 2007 to 2010. The anticompetitive conduct concerned discussions between traders of the participating banks on certain JPY LIBOR submissions. The traders involved also exchanged, on occasions, commercially sensitive information relating either to trading positions or to future JPY LIBOR submissions.

ICAP chose not to settle the case. Proceedings against it therefore continued under the normal procedure. The Commission's investigation uncovered that  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels in the YIRD sector through various actions that contributed to the anticompetitive objectives pursued by the cartelists, and in particular, by:
disseminating misleading information to certain JPY LIBOR panel banks, which were veiled as
'predictions' or 'expectations' of where the JPY LIBOR rates would be set. This misleading information
was aimed at influencing certain panel banks that did not participate in these infringements to submit
JPY LIBOR rates in line with the adjusted 'predictions' or 'expectations' (UBS/RBS 2007, UBS/RBS
2008, UBS/DB 2008-09, Citi/DB 2010 and Citi/UBS 2010 infringements);

using its contacts with several JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringements, with the aim of influencing their JPY LIBOR submissions (UBS/RBS 2007, Citi/DB 2010 and Citi/UBS 2010 infringements); and

serving as a communications channel between a trader of Citigroup and a trader of RBS and thereby enabling the anticompetitive practices between them (Citi/RBS 2010 infringement).

HD     EC fines ICAP €15M for breaching EU antitrust rules

The European Commission said Feb. 4 that it finedICAP Plc about €15.0 million for breaching EU
antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels for Japanese yen-denominated interest rate derivatives.

The EC's investigation found that  ICAP facilitated six of the seven cartels for  yen-denominated interest   rate derivatives through various actions that helped the cartelists in pursuing their anticompetitive objectives.

TD
Among other things,  ICAP disseminated misleading information to certain  yen LIBOR panel banks.

Margrethe Vestager, the EC's competition commissioner, said the  fine "marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the  yen interest rate derivatives sector — but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets."

ICAP said the same day that it does not accept the EC's decision, which it views as "wrong both in fact and in law." The company said the allegations are based on the same underlying matters that  ICAP Europe Ltd. settled with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in September 2013.

Commenting on the latest EC move, the company said: "It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European courts."

HD        ICAP to fight €14.9m Brussels fine for alleged rate manipulation; General financial

LP
ICAP is to fight a €14.9m  fine imposed on it by European antitrust authorities for aiding a cartel in the yen swaps markets as Brussels formally closed a portion of its long-running probe into rate manipulation.

The UK interdealer broker said the  fine handed out by the European Commission yesterday was "wrong both in fact and in law". Charges made against ICAP last year accused it of facilitating illegal arrangements between banks in markets for the  yen-based London interbank offered rate and  yen Tibor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate.

TD
The allegations covered periods between 2007 and 2010.  ICAP said that the  fine was based on the same underlying case for which it had been  fined £55m by the UK and US regulators in September
2013.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust commissioner, said: "Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP
sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences."

She added that the ruling marked the end of its investigation into alleged manipulation of rates based on the Japanese currency. That was only one strand of a Commission investigation into manipulation of interbank lending benchmarks, such as Libor and its European sister benchmark Euribor, which involves up to 11 financial groups. So far, six banks and an interdealer broker have been  fined €669m for colluding on yen-Libor products. The others admitted their involvement in the cartels.

ICAP's fine is based on its alleged infringements of anti-competitive rules, whereas the penalties levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were based on breaches of its systems and controls.

ICAP said it had not been shown evidence of the effect of its actions on prices and competition in the market. The vast  interest rate swap market is largely conducted bilaterally and on the phone between banks. The company acts as a middleman, moving large and illiquid blocks of assets such as swaps between buyers and sellers. It did not participate in the daily Libor ratesetting process, although some of the products it does trade are based on it.

"This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled," the company said. "It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation."
The broker plans to appeal to the general court in Luxembourg, where many applicants have their  fines
reduced and nearly 10 per cent of cases are thrown out.

BRUSSELS -- London-based brokerage firm  ICAP PLC was fined 14.9 million euros ($17.1 million) on Wednesday by the European Union's antitrust body for participating in an attempt to manipulate key benchmark interest rates.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, had imposed  fines on a number of major banks in December 2013 that decided to settle the case.  ICAP chose not to settle.

TD
The commission said it found that ICAP facilitated six of the seven distinct cases it had identified as breaching rules in the yen interest-rate derivatives sector. That included disseminating misleading information to some of the banks that participated on the panel that set  yen rates and for serving as a communications channel between traders involved in anticompetitive activities, the EU said.

The commission also said  ICAP used its contacts with several banks represented on the rates panel that didn't breach EU rules "with the aim of influencing their . . . submissions."

"Today's decision to  fine the broker ICAP sends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences," said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.

In a statement,  ICAP said it disputed the commission's decision and will challenge the ruling. "ICAP doesn't accept the EC's decision, which it believes is wrong both in fact and in law. This is a regulatory matter that has already been settled,"  ICAP said. "It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that  ICAP facilitated a competition law violation.  ICAP will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts."

ICAP reached a settlement in September 2013 with U.K. and U.S. regulators over their probes into manipulation of  yen benchmark rates.

In December 2013, the  European Commission imposed fines of 669.7 million euros on UBS AG, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and the broker RP Martin for their roles in  yen-benchmark rate cartels.

That was part of billions of euros of  fines levied by regulators against financial institutions in connection with probes into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other widely used financial benchmarks.

Greek bonds no longer acceptable as ECB collateral: The ECB Governing Council yesterday decided to stop the use of marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by Greece in its monetary policy operations, revoking a waiver on such securities. The decision, which takes effect Feb. 11, comes as it is currently not possible to assume a successful conclusion of the program review, according to the ECB, even as Greece continues to refuse to cooperate with its creditors over a new reform deal. Reuters notes that the decision shifts to the Greek central bank the burden of providing Greek lenders with emergency liquidity assistance. The Wall Street Journal and The Irish Times also have reports.

TD
* In an interview with Handelsblatt, European Parliament President Martin Schulz urged Greece to uphold its commitments to European partners to avoid falling into national bankruptcy, Reuters says. Schulz said European partners would only discuss the possibility of giving Greece concessions if the country sticks with its bailout commitments. Schulz signaled that the concessions could include alternatives to tough austerity measures.

* The EU's 28 member states yesterday reached a preliminary agreement on a proposed law designed to regulate a wider-than-expected range of market benchmarks, Reuters reports. The deal came after the states agreed to change the way they decide which benchmarks are "critical" and should be subject to new supervision.
UK AND IRELAND

RBS earmarks 99 branches for closure: Speaking before the U.K. Treasury Select Committee, Moray McDonald, managing director of products at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's personal and business banking division, said a change in free banking would put the industry in a "better place" as it would remove "inherent cross-subsidy" and allow banks to innovate more, The Times of London writes. McDonald also told the panel that RBS has identified 99 branches that could be closed this year as part of a shift to digital banking, the Financial Times adds.
* The European Commission ordered ICAP Plc to pay a  fine of approximately €15.0 million for
breaching antitrust rules by facilitating several cartels for Japanese yen-denominated interest rate          
derivatives. ICAP rejected the  fine as "wrong both in fact and in law" and vowed to appeal the decision at
European courts. The Independent, the Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph cover.

* JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s alternative investment arm, Highbridge Capital Management LLC, is leading a group of unsecured creditors who pledged to invest £300 million in exchange for a stake of roughly 80% in Towergate Partnership Ltd., the Financial Times reports. Insiders told the FT that the deal is not yet
formal.
* Non-Standard Finance Plc announced today its intention to proceed with an IPO to raise approximately
£100 million for acquisition purposes. The placing price is £1 per share. The firm has secured a
cornerstone investment of roughly £48 million from Woodford Investment Management LLP, Invesco
Asset Management Ltd. and Marathon Asset Management.

* Taoiseach Enda Kenny is not expected to follow Greece and renegotiate Ireland's debt when he meets with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels tomorrow, The Irish Times notes.
GERMANY, SWITZERLAND AND AUSTRIA

UBS once more in US tax crosshairs: U.S. prosecutors have launched a new probe into UBS AG to determine if it helped U.S. citizens evade taxes using investment vehicles that are banned in the U.S., Handelsblatt writes, citing The Wall Street Journal. UBS paid $780 million to settle U.S. tax-evasion claims in 2009.

* Munich Re today posted preliminary fourth-quarter 2014 IFRS consolidated profit attributable to equity holders of €700 million, down from €1.2 billion a year earlier. The company proposed a dividend of €7.75 per share for 2014, up from €7.25 per share for 2013.

* Excellere Capital Group said yesterday that it is interested in acquiring Heta Asset Resolution AG, the former Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, Handelsblatt writes. The group plans to publish details of its offer next Wednesday. Die Presse also reports.

ICAP plc - Trading Statement


-    Positive momentum in new Electronic and Post Trade initiatives
-   Activity on EBS increased significantly as FX market volatility rose sharply
-    Global Broking impacted by a reduction in bank client activity
-    Cost savings programme remains on track
London, 10 February, 2015 -  ICAP plc (IAP.L), a leading markets operator and provider of post trade risk mitigation and information services, announces today its trading statement for the period from 1
October 2014 to 31 December 2014. Results for the year ended 31 March 2015 will be announced on
19 May 2015.

Group revenue for the third quarter to 31 December 2014 was 1% lower than the same period last year on a constant currency basis, 2% lower on a reported basis.

In December,  ICAP announced its strategic plans to combine its electronic businesses EBS and BrokerTec. The combined business, known as EBS-BrokerTec, will allow  ICAP to leverage BrokerTec's market leading platform, client relationships and strong team, as well as EBS's technology and innovation pipeline, to deliver unique products and services to the industry and expand the addressable market of both platforms under the leadership of Gil Mandelzis. Gil Mandelzis has been CEO of EBS since March 2012 and founded Traiana, a provider of post-trade and risk management services
acquired by ICAP in 2007.

Electronic Markets delivered low double digit revenue growth in the third quarter underpinned by significantly increased activity levels at EBS, which saw its highest monthly average daily volume (ADV) since February 2013 as all currency pairs benefited from the uptick in volatility. The Bank of
Japan's bond buying announcement on 30th October drove near record levels of volumes in dollar/ yen, as did the recent removal of the cap by the Swiss National Bank in euro/ Swiss franc. Recent structural growth in non-deliverable forwards and offshore Chinese renminbi has continued. Customer interest in EBS Direct remains strong with over 100 new customers in the pipeline to be on boarded. EBS Direct
is in an investment phase as additional functionality and services are added to the platform. Trading activity on the BrokerTec platform was mixed with strength in US Treasuries partly offset by weakness in Repos.

Low double digit revenue growth was also achieved by the Post Trade Risk and Information division in the third quarter, a reflection of the positive return from the ongoing investment in the business and the strong demand for TriOptima's compression (triReduce) and portfolio reconciliation (triResolve) services. In December, TriOptima completed its first compression cycle in the Japanese Securities
Page 73 of 91 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Clearing Corporation and more recently announced that it will be collaborating with CLS Group to deliver an FX forward compression service. Traiana's Harmony network has benefited from the recent increase in FX activity. Performance at Reset continues to be hindered by the lack of short-term volatility.

As previously highlighted, a combination of factors including low interest rates, flat yield curves and bank deleveraging have all impacted the performance of Global Broking. In response to structural changes in customer demand, the division has refocused its priorities towards franchises where it has market leading positions and as a result has closed unprofitable desks and operations. Although Global Broking revenues declined by 8% during the period (on both a constant currency and on a reported basis) excluding the businesses that were exited, this decline was 4%.

Global Broking is investing in areas where it has market leading franchises such as OTC European Interest Rate Derivatives, which has benefited from rising volatility and continues to develop hybrid and electronic trading offerings such as i-Swap and other matching platforms.

The Group remains focused on delivering its cost savings programme and is on track to reach the target of GBP43 million for the current year and at least GBP60 million on an annualised basis.
On 4 February ICAP confirmed that it intended to challenge at appeal in the European Courts the
European Commission's decision to issue a  fine of GBP11.3 million in relation to  Yen Libor.

Michael Spencer, Group Chief Executive Officer of  ICAP said: "After a challenging first half, we have witnessed welcome signs of improved market activity in a number of areas, notably in FX. Moreover, we have seen the benefits of the significant investment in our exchange-like electronic platforms, EBS and BrokerTec, as well as in our Post Trade risk reduction services. We are committed to grow our addressable markets and strengthen the position of our innovative businesses. We are also making good progress with our restructuring programme. While we see signs of increased activity in some markets we continue to remain cautious as conditions in Global Broking remain challenging.

"We are confident our strategy will position  ICAP to deliver future growth. Our cash generation remains strong and we will continue to balance the need to invest in growth opportunities with returns to our shareholders."

Notes:

The closing exchange rates at 6 February 2015 were $1.52/GBP and EUR1.35/GBP. If these rates remain constant for the rest of FY2014/15 then the average exchange rates for FY2014/15 would be
$1.61/GBP (FY2013/14: $1.59/GBP) and EUR1.27/GBP (FY2013/14: EUR1.19/GBP). The estimated year-on-year impact on FY2014/15 is GBP12m operating profit reduction from translational and transactional exposures.

Each 1 cent change in US dollar and euro full year average exchange rates would impact FY2014/15 operating profit by GBP1 million and GBP1 million respectively. For FY2014/15, current hedges represent hedged 74% of $/GBP and 94% of EUR/GBP forecast transactional exposures.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the  ICAP February IMS analysts' conference call. My name is Raji, and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. (Operator Instructions).

TD
I'll now hand you over to your host, Michael Spencer, Group CEO of  ICAP, to begin today's conference. Thank you.

MICHAEL SPENCER, GROUP CEO, ICAP PLC: Thank you, Raji, and good morning, everyone. I'm Michael Spencer. I'm Group CEO of ICAP. And here with me today on this call is David Ireland, who's our interim Group Finance Director; Serra Balls, our Group Head of Communications; and Alex Dee, our Head of Investor Relations.

This morning, as I'm sure you've seen, we issued our trading statement for the period October 31, 2014 to December 31. As ever, in a few moments I'll be happy to take your questions, but first let me run through the significant points of our announcement.

Overall Group revenue for the third quarter was down 1% compared to the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis, down 2% on a reported basis.

We've told you previously that the first half of the financial year has been challenging. Since then, we've seen improved market activity in a number of areas.

Our electronic businesses are continuing to perform extremely well and delivered low double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, with EBS achieving its best performance since February 2013.

Trading on the BrokerTec platform was mixed during the quarter, with particular strength in US treasuries partially offset by weakness in repos.

During the quarter, we announced that we are combining our electronic businesses, EBS and BrokerTec, under the leadership of Gil Mandelzis. We believe there's a symbiotic benefit to combining these businesses, which will allow us to expand our addressable markets and deliver many new products and services. As such, we continue to invest heavily in this division.

EBS Direct is currently in an investment phase, with additional functionality and services being added to the platform, and 100 customers in the pipeline to be on-boarded; while EBS Market has benefitted from recent uptick in volatility with structural growth in non-deliverable and Chinese renminbi particularly notable.

Our post-trade risk and information division delivered low double-digit revenue growth. The continued strong performance here demonstrates the value of the investments made in expanding our products and services, and the strong demand for our compression and portfolio reconciliation services.

In December, TriOptima completed its first compression cycle with the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation, and more recently announced that it will be collaborating with the CLS Group to deliver an FX forward compression service.

Along with EBS, Traiana's Harmony network has benefitted from the recent increase in foreign exchange activity, although performance at Reset continues to be hindered by the lack of short-term  interest rate volatility.

As I previously highlighted, a combination of factors, including low interest rates, flat yield curves and bank deleveraging have all impacted the trading performance of the global broking division.

In response to structural changes in customer demand, this division has refocused its priorities towards franchises where it has a market-leading position and which we have benefitted from rising volatilities, such as European interest rate derivatives. As a result, we've had to take the difficult decision to close unprofitable desks and other operations.

Although the headline global broking revenue figures declined 8% during the period, if you exclude businesses that are exited, that decline is actually 4%.

The restructuring program is delivering results and is on track to deliver savings of GBP43 million this year, and an annualized saving in excess of GBP60 million per annum.

Finally, we have seen that last week the European Commissionfined ICAP GBP11.3 million, EUR14.9 million, for allegedly facilitating the competition -- facilitating competition law breaches between banks in relation to  yen LIBOR.

We do not agree with this decision, which relates to the same matters that our global broking subsidiary, ICAP Euro Limited, has already settled with the CFTC and FCA in September 2013. And we are challenging this  fine, as we simply do not believe that this is a competition matter, and will appeal against it in the European courts.

So to summarize, we have seen continued signs of activity and volatility across a number of our markets, although conditions in global broking remain challenging.

Our electronic and post-trade businesses continue to grow, and we believe we can expand the markets we operate in quite considerably. As we grow the addressable market of many of our businesses, we are confident our strategy will position  ICAP to deliver future success.
And now, please ask whatever questions you would like. Over to you, Raji. Questions and Answers
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Daniel Garrod, Barclays.

DANIEL GARROD, ANALYST, BARCLAYS: A couple of questions from me. Firstly, you've spoken in the past about the desire for the consolidation within the IDP industry. Wonder if you could make any comments around what you're seeing as fallout from what's happening in the US. Does it empower you to push down broker comp rates lower? Any incremental ability to take out voice broker headcount due to further consolidation?
Second question, you commented about bringing BrokerTec and EBS businesses together. I wonder if
you could provide any more color around that. Are there any potential reduced IT spend from putting those
businesses together, any comments around the similarity of the customer base ability to cross-sell further
with those two businesses being more aligned? Thank you.

MICHAEL SPENCER: Obviously a lot of press coverage on the BrokerTec -- sorry, not BrokerTec, the bid for GFI by BGC and part of that is CME as well.

I'm not going to get drawn in, if you don't mind, into a detailed assessment of what I think the likely outcome may be, but I do think that finally it looks highly likely that we will see some industrial
consolidation in our sector which is well overdue, and indeed, overwhelmingly beneficial for the industry as a whole.

I've argued for many years that we've got five global broking firms and in my view there's room for three, probably. Let us hope we get there somehow or other.

Our own headcount in global voice broking, we've taken the -- addressed those matters quite vigorously last year. Our headcount in global broking shrank by, including the support staff not just the brokers alone, the front end brokers, by about 400 last year.

So that gives you a good indicator of how much we've done, and we think that's the right reaction to market conditions and don't see any need for any further change.

Page 79 of 91 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But compensation rates obviously have been coming down, I suspect will continue to come down; a reflection, by the way, of all the costs, the increased costs within the industry, not just technology-based, which are considerable, but very considerable, obviously, regulatory compliance and risk support staff costs as well.

You asked me about the EBS and BrokerTec merger; this has been in the back of my mind for a long time. I think it is essential to -- it's not just driven by the savings related to technology, though that is a component but a small component.

Actually, in the short run, we probably will run the technology platforms independently for a variety reasons. On the BrokerTec, it's on an OMX platform which is contracted for a number of years, so we're not going to change that in the short run.

And there will be some small technology savings, but the real benefit here is from a customer point of view, looking at selling -- cross-selling product. EBS Direct on foreign exchange has been a big success, as you know.

My next project is to add fixed income into that service as well so that we have a liquidity pool on the direct service that is FX, forward FX, which we've launched later this year and fixed income, and ultimately more products than that.

We see a lot, a lot of technology and idea synergies in new functionality, new order types and things like that. So it is absolutely the right thing to have all our electronic transactional capability within one much bigger group.

I think this is a division which has huge, huge long-term potential and I am very committed to it. We're investing some good money in it, and I'm very actively involved in all the related issues. So, hopefully, this is going to be a good story for many more years to come.
DANIEL GARROD: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Philip Middleton, Merrill Lynch.

PHILIP MIDDLETON, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Two things; first of all, following on from that could you give us any timeline for bringing fixed income onto EBS Direct, because that's obviously quite an important initiative?

And, alongside that, there's been some talk recently about SEF reform, particularly from Commissioner Giancarlo. I wondered if you actually see any real prospects of dealing with the US/European divide on SEFs which I think has been quite damaging for liquidity?

MICHAEL SPENCER: We've only just, Philip, as you know, merged the EBS and BrokerTec divisions at the very end of last year, and obviously Gil Mandelzis, the CEO of the combined division, has been grappling with all the issues related in terms of staff numbers, who does what, and so forth.

He tells me that he is going to have fixed income on the direct platform in the current calendar year. I personally think that's probably a bullish expectation, not because that's not doable, but because before that we must launch FX forwards on the platform, which is, I think, an obvious extension of what we've done very successfully so far in spot FX.

If he can manage to get fixed income satisfactorily on the platform in the current calendar year, I will be pleased. But it will be there or thereabouts. It's clearly a high priority for us. It will make the proposition from a customer base wider and bigger and deeper and better, and all the rest of it.

Clearly, we've already got whatever it is, 250 customers on the direct platform and with a significant number, as I mentioned earlier, still in the pipeline. A large number of those current customers we already have will be very interested in taking liquidity and fixed income as well. So that will be an exciting and interesting story, and I hope it won't just stop at fixed income in terms of our product capability there.

The other, of course, big excitement for us is the -- what we've referred to as the addressable market issue. We do see an increasing number of what we would call buy-side clients coming onto the direct platform, and the addition of fixed income I think will clearly enhance the attractiveness of that service to the buy-side.

In SEF reform, Giancarlo, Christian (sic) Giancarlo, who indeed came from GFI, has a considerable degree of personal market knowledge, experience and expertise, and I think has been a refreshing and constructive addition to the CFTC and has clearly made an impact on their thinking.

I think it's premature to make any forecast as to what may or may not happen, but we like what he says. And maybe there will be some tweaking of what goes forward. I think quite honestly that may well be a good thing for market structure, not just in the United States but internationally, because you are correct that there has been a considerable degree of liquidity bifurcation on certain products which are -- some of it is traded on SEF and some of it off SEF.

I think expectation of wholesale change to the Dodd-Frank Act is probably more difficult as it would need to get through the Senate. However, who knows? If there is a change of party at the leadership of the United States, then that is possible. Certainly one of the Republican candidates has made it clear that he thinks Dodd-Frank is worthy of a fairly considerable review.
So I hope there may be change there, and any change that is forthcoming I think would be constructive. PHILIP MIDDLETON: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Arnaud Giblat, UBS.

ARNAUD GIBLAT, ANALYST, UBS: I've got two questions, please. First, you've indicated you're making good progress with the CLS and the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation to do some compression services. I was wondering if you could give us maybe a bit more color in terms of the potential contribution from these two joint ventures.

And secondly, perhaps could you share some thoughts on the acquisition of Hotspot by BATS. Is this a potential competitive threat for EBS?

MICHAEL SPENCER: The extension of the TriOptima compression service, the interest rates to the Japan Clearing Corporation, clearly is overwhelmingly related to  yen interest rate derivatives. The yen interest rate derivative market is a considerably big one, certainly an important one, but in scale is not comparable to either the euro swap market or the dollar swap market. And also  yen interest rate derivatives are also cleared on LCH as well.

So it is, I would think, a nice add-on. We are certainly not representing that this changes the dial, so to speak, of our compression revenue or our compression opportunity but I think it is a very interesting
pointer that it has been -- we have often -- been suggested that clearing houses, other clearing houses will build their own compression engines and this will ultimately compete with TriOptima.

We think that more and more clearing houses will actually adopt the TriOptima compression service. I'm hopeful that another very big clearing house will, in the next several months, announce that they are adopting the TriOptima clearing service as well which will, I think, really underscore the effectiveness of the TriOptima service and its capability across multiple platforms, and I think will be a very strong affirmation as to its position and durability.

You asked as well about CLS; that is clearly a different compression, that is relating to forward foreign exchange. I think this has the potential to be a bigger project. The volumes, and these are I think publicly accessible, of forward foreign exchange that is processed through CLS is a very large number.

To what extent the foreign exchange market wants to adopt compression, I think it's premature for me to speculate. But I think this has potential to be a really nice added dimension to the TriOptima revenue. And there are many other projects, by the way, that TriOptima is working on at the moment which, for a variety of reasons, we haven't yet gone public about, which are, I think, very exciting and some of them with considerably greater potential revenue scale than the ones we've talked about.

The Hotspot sale to BATS; we obviously looked at it ourselves; for a variety of reasons we did not bid. I don't think it creates ?- if you use the word a new competitor, Hotspot is a competitor here and now today. Joining with BATS, I don't think -- BATS do not have any foreign exchange capability themselves, as you very well know. So there is no particularly product synergy that they have there. They may well have some technology synergies, I do not know.

But we don't see this, from our point of view, as particularly changing the landscape, apart from the fact that you might notice that the price paid for Hotspot was a fairly substantial one, perhaps indicating that the EBS platform is an extraordinarily valuable asset itself.
But that's for you to make your own mind up. ARNAUD GIBLAT: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Richard Perrott, Autonomous.

RICHARD PERROTT, ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS: Could I ask if you could give us a sense of EBS Direct
ADV volume progression since the H1 results? I think it was reaching close to about $20 billion per day,
but you thought this would temporary plateau as you upgraded the systems. So I was wondering if you
could give a sense about is that what you've experienced. And also give a sense about when that upgrade
will be complete and you can start getting the new customers in the pipeline onto the system.

MICHAEL SPENCER: We had -- obviously last year the EBS Direct platform has an extraordinary year of very, very considerable growth over the period of the 12 months. Towards the latter part of October, we had some -- what I would say is a deterioration in customer fill ratios because of the speed of the platform and the latency in the platform.

If you get customer rejections on individual orders above about 10% or 15% it has a fairly negative effect on the customer experience. So we decided to review some of the performance issues which were addressed from November through to January. The volumes drifted back slightly November/December, but it's back onto a growth trend again now and we've got 100-odd customers in the pipeline now.

So, Richard, we are fully behind this project. It's a very, very important project to us; not only is it delivering very rapid growth but also, specifically and most importantly, it's a platform which, because of the
disclosed liquidity structure of it, enables us to deliver the liquidity to any universe of customers, whether the customer is another bank or an HFT or a corporate or a buy-side or any of those. So it's not an
all-to-haul, in the sense of a central limit order book, but it is certainly open to all types of customers.

So this is taking  ICAP's transactional services to places we have not been before. And we are, in my opinion, at this point still only scratching the surface on that. So it's a very, very exciting project. Thank you.
OPERATOR: We currently have no questions coming through. (Operator Instructions).

? Earlier this month brokerage  Icap become the first City institution to challenge a  fine for attempted Libor manipulation, vowing to battle the  European Commission. The EC issued the firm with a €14.9m (£11.2m) fine, arguing that Icap broke competition rules "by facilitating several cartels in the sector of yen interest  rate derivatives." Icap accepted a £54m fine in 2013 after some of its former staff helped bank traders try to fiddle the key interbank interest  rate benchmark. But this time the interdealer broker is arguing that it has no case to answer, and that there is no evidence against it.

? Barclays squared up to US regulators last year, fiercely rejecting claims it had lied to investors using its dark pool trading facilities. It was the first time a British bank had reacted so strongly to legal attacks
from the US, as banks have been reluctant to fight back openly since the financial crash. Barclays petitioned to have the case thrown out. But last Friday a New York judge rejected Barclays' bid to dismiss Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's lawsuit. Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan said it was premature to dismiss the claim under the state's Martin Act, an anti-fraud law.

HD        Michael Spencer’s  empire survives the storm; Icap’s chief has seen the City transformed in 30 years. He talks politics, the eurozone and US regulators in an exclusive interview with Financial News

LP
It’s 5pm and I’m meeting Michael Spencer for a drink at one of his haunts, the George club in Mayfair. He looks trim and tanned, wears an open-necked shirt and sharp suit and is as charming as ever.

Long gone are the Two Ronnies’ style glasses, the brilliant red braces, loud cuff-links and louder suits. That was the City uniform he wore when we first met in the early 1990s, and he was in the process of turning the small voice-broker  Icap into what is today the world’s biggest electronic wholesale brokerage turning over some $1.3 trillion of transactions a day.

TD
How the 30-year-old went about transforming his four-man US dollar swap team into a £3 billion plus money-machine from the centre of Broadgate Circle is one of the rare British success stories of the post-Big Bang period which saw the City invaded, and then conquered, by America’s Wolves of Wall Street. Back then, money-broking was a rather crude world, peopled by shouty brokers who relied on
who they knew, rather than what they knew, combined with lashings of boisterous behaviour and boozy lunches.

What set the Oxford-educated physicist apart was the way he introduced rigour into the market. He did so by hiring analysts, sending out newsletters and creating the first market standard for US dollar interest-rate swap spreads by setting up the  Icap page on Reuters. This provided for the first time a reference for trading spreads over US Treasuries at a time when banks, governments and corporations were taking on innovative ways of managing risk.

In many ways, Spencer is both old and new City; the son of a colonial diplomat, self-made yet establishment, gregarious, driven but also cerebral. You’re just as likely to hear him talk about the minutiae of education policies, Zulu war tactics or the book written by his friend, Thomas Pakenham, The Mountains of Rasselas, about his travels in Ethiopia in the Fifties, as yield curves.

Born in Malaysia, Spencer spent his childhood in Ethiopia, much of it riding around barefoot on a donkey. I remember him telling me years ago how much he missed Africa’s big blue skies, hating the greyness of Britain when he came here to boarding school and how much he wanted a home there again. Well, he recently bought a ranch in Kenya, complete with its own private airstrip.

He was able to afford his African escape by growing the firm swiftly, snapping up the best broking teams, devouring rivals or reversing into other broking firms. By the mid-1990s, Spencer was spending heavily on electronic platforms such as BrokerTec and EBS which now dominate global trading in foreign exchange and fixed income respectively; as well as prevailing over the US Treasury bond market.

That is not to say Spencer did not enjoy the lighter side of the market too; from a taste for Jack Vettriano paintings to Pomerol wines to taking punts on the number of men wearing lace-up shoes under the
dining table at his legendary in-house A-list lunches. City folk still talk with nostalgia of grand parties at which Boney M and Rio carnival dancers were some of the stars, or the annual charity days where staff would clown around wearing Two Ronnies lookalike masks of Spencer.



Page 87 of 91 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Those charity days have grown up. Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge or Oprah Winfrey are more likely to be celebrities at the annual event when staff give up commission and revenue for the day, equal to 3% of pre-tax profits. More than £120 million has been raised for 2,000 charities.

Yet the financial blizzard has cut deep. In 2007,  Icap’s shares were 780p – a third or so higher than the approximately 500p they were last week, which values the group at £3 billion plus and Spencer’s fortune at more than £450 million; he has 16%. First came the financial crash, hitting trading volumes and volatility, and then the more recent Libor-rigging scandal, which hurt  Icap’s reputation and upset him personally.

He admits it has been tough. “The last five years have been hard but I think the worst is over now; volumes are looking up. We’ve restructured the business, some brokers have lost their jobs and fixed costs have come down. They will come down more.”

Spencer has also apologised “profoundly” after three of his former traders, who are now awaiting trial, were charged with manipulating the Libor  yen benchmark and Icap was fined £55 million by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority. While devastated by the Libor charges, he is also angry by the sheer scale of the economic warfare being waged by the US authorities against companies in the UK and elsewhere on disputes ranging from Libor to money laundering.

Indeed, there are many in the industry who question whether the CFTC’s actions may have been motivated by politics as much as by justice.
The US authorities have so far  fined companies from BP to BNP Paribas a staggering $55 billion.

Now the firm is “working with regulators everywhere to ensure full market transparency”, he says, adding quietly “we are where we are”. Ironically perhaps, the more sophisticated the machine that Spencer, along with rivals such as Tullett Prebon, GFI and BGC have created, the more harshly the markets in which they operate are regulated, particularly in the US. Indeed, as the biggest player in the US swaps market, he is a leading critic of the new swap rules in the Dodd-Frank Act and is backing a plan to drive through new changes.

The European Commission has also turned on Icap, having just  fined the firm £11.2 million for breaking competition rules in yen interest  rate derivatives. Spencer is fighting back, claiming the EC’s decision is “wrong both in fact and in law” and will appeal to the European courts.

That brings us to the broader European question. A staunch Conservative, Spencer has moved in time from being a warmish Europhile to trenchant Brussels critic. By contrast, his US big banking clients like Europe just as it is: so long as they can use the continent as the landing strip for their products and services, they are happy with the status quo. Not Spencer. He reckons that if David Cameron, assuming he remains Prime Minister, does not come back from Brussels with a deal ahead of a referendum, the Europhiles will find it tough to win.

“The Tories can only win a referendum if they achieve fundamental reforms with the EU on issues like welfare and immigration. He [Cameron] will need to appoint an outstanding individual to lead those talks.” What about him? “No,” he laughs, “I mean a politician. I might have to vote for coming out if there isn’t decent reform. But if we stay, then the UK must engage more with Europe, be more of an advocate so we are better placed to fight our corner on the big issues.” Like preventing the EU’s draconian rules
on bonuses? “Exactly. The new rules are regulatory witchcraft. It amounts to an act of vandalism against the City. Imagine if we were to ban wine imports from France or supercars from Germany?”

Unsurprisingly, the former Tory party treasurer, who has given £5 million to the party and once considered becoming an MP, is confident the Tories will win the May election. “I know I’m in a minority, but I believe David will pull off a majority with 320 seats and lead the next government. It’s looking more possible day by day.”

He reckons the LibDems will not do as badly as the pollsters are predicting and Ukip’s support is shrinking. “I know Farage a bit – we worked together at Drexel Burnham Lambert years ago. He’s a capable man. But his party is a disruptive force. I don’t think even he thinks he will be in government.” Labour leader Ed Miliband is a disaster, he says.

An early backer of Cameron and now a close friend, Spencer also believes the public will acknowledge what a great job the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have done in challenging conditions. “I believe the public will give them credit for that; unemployment is falling sharply, new jobs are being created on a daily basis and we are one of the fastest growing countries in the G10.”

On the other hand, the eurozone is stuck in the mud. “[European Central Bank president] Mario Draghi had no choice but to go for the big bazooka approach. The prospect of a deflationary spiral was too great a risk for the eurozone: countries like Italy and France will survive only if they reform.

“We had our reality check in 1979; I haven’t forgotten our ‘winter of discontent’. Europe has to go through the same structural reforms.”
It’s why he has no time for Greece’s attempt to write off its debts with the EU and says German
Chancellor Angela Merkel is right to play hard-ball with the new Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras.
“It would be hugely irresponsible to allow Greece to write down its debts; I don’t see a happy outcome.” So he wouldn’t be surprised by a Greek exit? “Maybe.”
What about his own Sprexit? He will be 60 in May. Is a successor being groomed? He chuckles, shakes his head, folds up the notepad he always carries and heads for the door to his next meeting: “There is
no successor. I’m having far too much fun.”
And, perhaps, he has much more to do.

The broker has outlined four key objectives for the Old Lady's review

Icap, the world’s top inter-dealer broker, has backed a review by the Bank of England into the fixed income, currency and commodities market and highlighted four key objectives for the project.

TD
London-based Icap said it is “fully supportive” of Bank of England’s Fair and Effective Markets Review
(FEMR) that seeks to tackle malpractice and restore confidence in these asset classes.

Icap added in a statement: “The company believes the focus of FEMR should be to encourage the effective functioning of deeply liquid financial markets, which are able to survive shocks, while supporting end-users’ hedging needs and facilitating the flow of capital and collateral throughout the financial system.”

The broker went on to outline four key requirements: a mechanism to agree an approach to address the complexities; firms should be given clear direction by regulators what is appropriate and not-appropriate market practice; market solutions should be appropriately specific to the complexities of the markets they serve; and there should be clear guidance for companies to support their internal decision making on valuations.

Duncan Wales, group general counsel at  Icap, said: “The Fair and Effective Markets Review provides an opportunity to be forward-looking and restore confidence in the essential functioning of the financial system and economy.

Wales believes “the core objective of this review should be to assist the industry and regulators to proactively intercept malpractice and structural weaknesses”.

“The proposals from the Bank of England should be aimed at improving confidence in the UK as a place to do business, creating incentives for market users and investors while promoting innovation,” he added.

Icap was one of a number of firms implicated in the Libor  interest rate rigging scandal and was fined
$87m in late 2013 by US and British authorities.
The broker said last month it will appeal against a decision by the  European Commission to fine the firm
£11.3m over allegations that it facilitated  Yen Libor rate-rigging cartels.
