By Joseph Schuman
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The center held in the U.S. Senate, where seven Democrats and seven Republicans worked out a deal to avoid the filibuster showdown that threatened to block the body's legislative output behind the impasse over judicial advice and consent.

TD
The seven Democrats signed a memorandum late Monday agreeing to help cut off debate over three of five of President Bush's disputed nominees for federal district and appellate courts - depriving the Democratic leadership of the required filibuster plurality - and to filibuster future nominees during the current Congress only "under extraordinary circumstances." In exchange, the seven Republicans committed to opposing rule changes backed by the White House that would do away with filibusters for judicial nominations, thus depriving the Republican leadership of the needed majority to do so.

The compromising senators, who struggled for weeks to work out a deal ahead of what would have been Tuesday's showdown, said they respected the party leaders they essentially thwarted - the GOP's Bill Frist of Tennessee and Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. But they offered a subtle swipe at Bush, saying they interpret the Constitution's Article II, Section 2 on "advice" to mean the president, before nominating judges, should consult with senators "both Democratic and Republican."

The president now faces a series of additional tests of his political authority, the New York Times notes. The House is to vote on a bill Tuesday lifting restrictions on federal financing of stem-cell research. Congress will later confront a proposed trade agreement with Central America, the confirmation of Bush's embattled choice to be ambassador to the United Nations and the first legislative steps toward overhauling Social Security.



High Court To Review Abortion Law

Any nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming months is bound to be roiled by the court's decision Monday to accept its first abortion case in five years, something the New York Times called "an unexpected development that despite the rather technical questions that the case presents is likely
to add even more heat to the already superheated atmosphere surrounding the court and its immediate future." The new case is an appeal by the State of New Hampshire of a federal appeals court ruling that struck down a parental-notification requirement for minors seeking abortions.

Separately, the justices dealt a setback to property-rights advocates, making it harder for landowners to claim compensation for government regulations they say diminish their property's value, The Wall Street Journal reports. They also upheld a government program that forces cattle producers to fund advertisements promoting beef consumption, the latest in a series of clashes between smaller farm groups and Agriculture Department marketing efforts backed by agribusiness. Also, the high court stepped back from a major dispute over international law when it dismissed from its docket a case in which the World Court had ordered new hearings for Mexican nationals on death row in Texas, Legal Times reports. The World Court last year ordered the new hearings in U.S. courts for 51 Mexican

Page 4 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
nationals because, at the time of their arrest, local police had not informed them of their rights to seek help from Mexican consulates.



Guidant Kept Defibrillator Fault Quiet

Guidant Corp. (GDT) didn't tell doctors or patients for three years that a device implanted in an estimated 24,000 people that is designed to shock a faltering heart contains a flaw that caused a small number of the units to short-circuit and malfunction, the New York Times reports. The maker of medical devices has acknowledged that the defibrillator used by a 21-year-old college student with a genetic heart disease short-circuited. The young man died from a cardiac arrest, the Times says, and Guidant subsequently told his doctors that it was aware of 25 other cases in which the defibrillator was affected by the same flaw. Guidant said it changed its manufacturing processes three years ago to fix the problem. A Guidant executive, Dr. Joseph M. Smith, tells the Times the company hadn't seen a compelling reason to issue an alert to physicians about the defibrillators because the failure rate was very low and replacing the devices might pose greater patient risks. But Monday, when told that the Times was preparing an article about the device, the company issued an advisory to doctors.



Mixed Safety Results For Crestor

Meanwhile, a study by the journal Circulation found the strongest drug for lowering cholesterol, AstraZeneca's  (AZN) Crestor, had higher rates of some serious adverse effects than rival drugs taken by millions of people. The study seemed to challenge a recent decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to keep Crestor on the market, the New York Times reports, but it also showed that over all, these kinds of drugs, known as statins, were safe. Even the risks of serious problems with Crestor are very low, according to the study. Separately, Able Laboratories (ABRX), maker of about 40 generic drugs, said it had suspended manufacturing and is recalling all of its products after a review found testing practices failed to meet federal standards, the Times reports. Another drug maker, Genentech (DNA), said one of its experimental medications improved vision, on average, for patients with a degenerative eye condition, the first time any therapy has appeared to reverse the malady in a large clinical trial, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Meanwhile, Jeffrey M. Drazen, editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, accused three of the largest drug companies of "making a mockery" of efforts to create transparency in clinical trials, and said it could lead some medical publications to avoid publishing their studies, according to the Associated Press. Drazen said Pfizer (PFE), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Merck (MRK) aren't providing enough useful information on clinical trials they register with the government. In September, the 11 members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors said they won't publish studies that aren't registered in a public database as they are launched.



Effort Against Terror Funding Slows In
Europe
A bid in the  European Parliament to cut off funds for terrorism by tightening financial-crime laws has been watered down with the help of legislators with close ties to the financial industry, including one lawmaker who is chairman of a hedge-fund firm and another who is a top executive at a bank being investigated for money laundering, The Wall Street Journal reports.  Europe's finance industry and its lobbyists have waged a fierce behind-the-scenes campaign to weaken the legislation, and several lawmakers with industry ties have pushed amendments favoring the financial firms. The  European Parliament lacks the tight restrictions on outside income of many other political institutions, including the European Commission and all three branches of the U.S. government, the Journal notes.



Another Morgan Stanley Defection

Morgan Stanley (MWD) Chief Executive Philip Purcell, still struggling to keep the firm intact in the face of an attempted coup by ex-executives, lost another top banker who helped make the firm this year's top adviser for mergers and acquisitions. Raymond J. McGuire, the global co-head of M&A, quit to join
Citigroup (C), a defection that follows last month's departures by Joseph Perella and Terry Meguid, who left in the aftermath of Purcell's March 28 management shakeup, Bloomberg notes. McGuire's
departure adds to the pressure on Purcell to keep investment banking - one of Morgan Stanley's most profitable departments - from unraveling, the news service says.

Boeing To Proceed With 777 Freighter

Boeing (BA) plans to announce Tuesday it has received sufficient commitments and interest to proceed with development of a freighter version of its 777 jetliner, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports. In recent weeks, Air France and Air Canada have said they plan to order the new freighter as part of bigger
orders each placed for the 777 passenger jet, and Boeing is believed to have commitments for the freighter from several cargo carriers as well, the PI says.

SUMMARY

The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. The Hungarian judicial system operates under clearly specified guidelines. Even so, some reforms are still needed to harmonise Hungarian law with EU standards; the transparency of the legal system is inadequate; and delays in processing court cases are a major problem. As a result, contract disputes are
unlikely to be dealt with speedily. Regulatory disputes have arisen over the government's use of price caps in certain sectors. In particular, foreign pharmaceutical companies have complained in the past about their treatment at the hands of the government. The Socialists, who came to power in 2002, have been slow to address the wrongs of past administrations. More worryingly, the Socialist-led government has whittled away the powers of some nominally independent regulatory bodies in an effort to replace officials with individuals more loyal to the sitting government.
ANALYSIS
Judicial reform is delayed, keeping the courts overburdened and slow (Moderate Risk)

The court system is overburdened and scarce budgetary resources are making it difficult for remaining judicial reforms that would help streamline procedures to be implemented. Depending on the issue and the court, firms can wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. After years of delay, however, the Socialist-led administration has finally established five Courts of Appeal at the county level, which should help alleviate the Supreme Court’s substantial backlog of cases. But the  European Commission has noted that a lack of adequate funding is still hampering the establishment of additional regional courts, which would streamline processes further. Businesses will want to pursue accelerated procedures that are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for intellectual property violations. Businesses may also want to include in their contracts that disputes be settled by binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The government maintains the use of price caps in sensitive sectors (Moderate Risk)

As part of EU membership, Hungary must phase out most regulated prices. Past governments have been slow to move on deregulation, with the current administration finally pushing ahead with energy market deregulation in the past couple of years. This leaves pharmaceuticals as one of the last markets that is completely regulated. Companies operating in this sector have repeatedly clashed with governments over price rises. International pharmaceutical companies should continue to lobby government officials to present their case for their proposed pricing schemes and removal of price caps, but should also be prepared for a slow deregulation process and surprise reversals on pricing agreements.

BACKGROUND
(Background material is updated twice yearly. Last update: July 27th, 2004) Enforceability of Contracts
Contract disputes may be taken to court, but the court system is severely overburdened. Depending on the issue and the court, firms might have to wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. Accelerated procedures are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for
intellectual property violations and for other economic crimes. The courts’ burdens were alleviated with the introduction of regional courts under Act XXII of 2002. This law established regional courts in Budapest, Szeged and Pecs beginning July 1st 2003; others will be created in Gyor and Debrecen on July 1st 2004.

Contracts may also provide for settling disputes through binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Independence of the Judiciary

The Hungarian judicial system is adequate, apart from delays in processing court cases, and it operates under clearly specified guidelines. The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. Some reforms must still be made to harmonise Hungarian law with EU requirements.

The efficiency, reliability and integrity of public-sector employees vary, and corruption is not unknown. Personal connections can considerably accelerate and improve the chances of success in bureaucratic and many other processes. A study by Gallup, in co-operation with the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations, has shown that 32% of small and medium-sized enterprises had encountered corruption in the course of business. This was most common in relationships with other companies, however, rather than
with government bodies. For state organisations, corruption was found to be most common in
public-procurement procedures, customs procedures and obtaining government permits. According to a
2003 survey by Transparency International, 54% of Hungarians perceived public officials as corrupt.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

Hungary welcomes foreign direct investment (FDI) and implements policies to encourage it. Nevertheless, the previous government’s statements and behaviour have somewhat tarnished Hungary’s image as an investor-friendly haven in central  Europe. It generally supported domestic capital and sometimes directed unfriendly rhetoric towards foreign companies. Price caps also hurt the profitability of foreign investors, and they were known to complain of occasional discrimination over public-procurement contracts. Compared with the previous government of Victor Orban, official attitudes are now improving.

The Medgyessy government has promised to lure back foreign investors, since Hungary is experiencing a decline in FDI as emerging markets vie fiercely for investment. Besides competition from other countries, local factors are also eroding growth in FDI: local labour costs are rising, there are fewer potential acquisition targets and the bulk of privatisation is now complete. To make matters worse, EU accession forced modifications to Hungary’s corporate tax-holiday scheme, and some measures were completely scrapped.

These factors, coupled with a global stockmarket downturn, caused a noticeable slowing of foreign portfolio investment in 2002, and foreign direct investors followed suit. Total FDI inflow to Hungary amounted to Euro1bn in 2002, which is only 40% of the inflow in 2001, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport. But uncertainties over the outcome of the military action in Iraq and rising oil prices also had an adverse effect, and FDI in the first four months of 2003 hit its lowest point, totalling  Euro39m--compared with Euro181m in the same period of 2002, according to the central bank. The months of February and
April saw negative FDI figures as capital left the country.

In terms of per-capita FDI, Hungary has lost the regional lead it held between 1996 and 2000. Per-capita FDI in Hungary totalled US$127 in 2002, far below the average for Central and Eastern  Europe, according to preliminary figures from the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Per-capita FDI inflows amounted to US$936 in Slovenia, US$880 in the Czech Republic and US$706 in Slovakia in 2002. Tangible evidence of an FDI slowdown also included announcements by companies on specific projects suspended or cancelled.

Nevertheless, Hungarian authorities are generally well aware of the need for capital from abroad. The government continues to offer a range of incentives to attract investment. Meanwhile, Hungary was forced to put an end to the tax waivers for major foreign investments prior to joining the  European Union. The government also introduced new investment incentives of a similar size as existing ones that are compatible with EU rules. The medium-term investment incentives programme, Smart Hungary, for
Page 8 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
example, aims to reverse the slowing influx of foreign capital in order to modernise the country’s business structure and boost its employment and income-generating capacity.

Overall, Hungary remains one of the most positive environments for foreign investors among  Europe’s transition countries (with the temporary exception of industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals). Most of Hungary’s FDI inflows are in high-technology production industries, and almost all are greenfield investments.

The attitude of the business community and the general public towards foreign investment is generally positive. Local businesses welcome foreign participation as a way to access more-developed technology, export markets and critical working capital. Majority foreign ownership and decision-making is increasingly accepted in the Hungarian business community.

Hungary is the only transition economy in  Europe to have entered a post-privatisation phase of foreign investment. Although privatisation is still the dominating force in FDI statistics in Poland and the Czech Republic, the process has all but ended in Hungary.

The largest foreign investor in 2002 was the Netherlands, with Euro438m, followed by Germany (Euro158m), the United States (Euro104m), Sweden (Euro103m) and Austria (Euro62m). Although 51% of the FDI inflow in 2002 went to production industries, the largest investments during the fourth quarter were in real estate, business services and equipment manufacturing. Foreign-owned companies produce more than one-third of GDP and account for more than one-quarter of employment. The government depends on a consistent FDI inflow of US$1.5bn-2bn as a crucial part of its economic planning.

There are no general local-content requirements that discriminate against foreigners. However, under the requirements of the tender for the two commercial television stations sold by the National Radio and Television Board, at least 35% of programming must be Hungarian produced. Parliament modified Act I of
1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) by Act XX of 2002. The amendment adjusts the legislation to EU requirements, requiring that 50% of all programming be  European in origin. The EU has expressed dissatisfaction, however, with the clause setting the minimum of Hungarian-made programming at 7% instead of the originally proposed 5%.

Although there are no Hungarian local-content requirements, exporters to the  European Union must consider EU rules. For example, Magyar Suzuki, the local automotive manufacturing subsidiary of Suzuki (Japan), had to pay the EU some  Euro32m in retrospective customs duties, plus interest, that it failed to pay in 1994-97. The  European Anti-fraud Office found that Suzuki used false declarations of Hungarian origin involving 58,000 vehicles during this period. Under the previous customs agreement between the EU and Hungary, car exporters were exempt from customs duties if combined Hungarian- and EU-origin content accounts for at least 60% of the value of the finished product. Suzuki failed to comply with these requirements in 1994-97 but still claimed the exemption.
Unfair Competitive Practices

A part of the economy remains strongly influenced by large state-owned or formerly state-owned enterprises that are sometimes monopolies. And because of the relatively small size of the Hungarian market (the population is about 10m), producers tend to establish dominant market positions rapidly, becoming monopolists or duopolists from economies of scale.

Hungarian competition policy is governed by Act LVII of 1996 on the Prohibition of Unfair and Restrictive Market Practices. This law, commonly known as the Competition Act, includes provisions against unfair competition, consumer deception, collusive and trust practices, and abuse of market dominance. The law also regulates mergers and acquisitions; it provides for their supervision by the Office of Economic Competition (OEC), which reports directly to parliament. Modelled on Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, the OEC is the chief regulatory body for competition policy in all sectors.

In a June 1998 decision, the Constitutional Court stated that the OEC may not directly apply the laws and practices of the  European Union without their first being incorporated into Hungarian law.

The Competition Act introduced several changes to align Hungarian policy with that of the EU, and it more clearly defined the functioning and responsibilities of the OEC. The most significant aspects of the law include the following:

Parliament modified the Competition Act in December 2000, introducing changes in February 2001 to harmonise Hungarian regulations with EU standards and to clarify the wording of certain parts. Although the structure and fundamental regulations of the law remained intact, the changes extended the scope of
the law and the authority of the OEC and simplified certain procedures. Major changes have been made on provisions on the prohibition of agreements restricting competition. Although under previous regulations,
the total joint market share of the parties to minor agreements could not exceed 10%, the market share
Page 9 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
now held by companies controlled by the parties must also be considered when assessing the limit. If the market share still remains below 10%, the agreement will be exempt.

The changes to the Competition Act also give the OEC new licence to monitor market processes. If in any market sector pricing tendencies or other circumstances indicate that certain businesses have entered into an agreement restricting competition or that a business is abusing its dominant position, the OEC’s chairman may request information from businesses involved in that sector.

Act X of 2002 came into force on April 1st 2002, introducing certain EU norms into the Hungarian legal system. These new norms must be applied in cases where the content of cartels or the abuses of dominant market position affect free trade between the  European Union and Hungary.
Price controls are provided for by the Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990).

The Consumer Protection Act (CLV of 1997) affects competition policy with its requirements for product safety and consumer information. The legislation reflects further harmonisation of Hungarian law with EU norms. Government Decree 89/1998 establishes the scope of authority and procedures for the Central Consumer Protection Supervisor, which implements the law. If an entity achieves unfair market advantages by breaching provisions of the act, competitors whose market positions are jeopardised may assert a claim under the provisions of the Competition Act (in addition to an action before the Central Consumer
Protection Supervisor).

Amendments to Act IV of 1959 on the Civil Code, which came into force on March 1st 1998, set legal requirements on the general terms and conditions in contracts between businesses and their customers, providing customers with more effective civil law remedies against abusive contractual arrangements dictated by businesses.

The Commercial Advertising Act (LVIII of 1997) comprehensively regulates advertising. For comparative or other advertising that qualifies as unfair competition or consumer deception, the act refers to the provisions of the Competition Act. Under the Competition Act, the courts or the OEC decide whether an advertisement is anti-competitive or deceptive. The Commercial Advertising Act was modified in December 2000 in line with EU regulations. Changes included a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media from July 1st 2001 and in the outdoor media from January 1st 2002, and stricter regulations on comparative advertising.

Rather than prohibiting monopolies and market dominance per se, the Competition Act bans abuse of a dominant position that restricts competition. Under the act, a dominant position occurs when goods reasonably substituting those of a company cannot be acquired, or can be acquired only under conditions substantially less favourable; when a company’s goods cannot be sold to another party, or can be sold only to a party under substantially less favourable conditions; or when a company can pursue its economic activities in a manner substantially independent of other participants in the market or without having to consider the attitudes of its competitors, suppliers, customers or other business partners.

The act includes the following non-exclusive list of agreements or concerned practices that might be considered impermissible if they have, as their object or effect, the prevention, restriction or distortion of economic competition:

Nevertheless, agreements between companies to engage in the practices listed above are not forbidden if the combined market share of the parties to the agreement does not exceed 10% or if the companies are not independent from each other (that is, if one controls the other or if both are controlled by the same owner). In 2002 the Office of Economic Competition (OEC)  fined Matav, the dominant telecoms provider, Ft5m and Magyar Posta Ft20m for abusing their dominant market positions. In early 2003 the OEC  fined Auchan (a French retailer) and Hungarian Cetelem Bank Ft1m and Ft2m, respectively, for deceiving customers with misleading advertisements. The OEC also  fined Tesco Global Stores (UK) Ft5m for similar reasons. Among the companies under scrutiny in mid-2003 were Henkel (a German household goods manufacturer), Tetra Pak (a Swedish packaging company) and EMKTV (a Hungarian cable provider).

In total, the OEC imposed Ft15m in  fines in the first six months of 2003. Most penalty decisions related to unfair influence on customers.

Hungary opened its electricity market on January 1st 2003. Consumers using at least 6.5 gwh per year may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice. Local distribution companies still have monopolies on their own territories; further market liberalisation measures will be gradually introduced over future years. The natural gas market will be liberalised in January 2004.
Hungary liberalised its telecoms market with the passage of the Unified Telecommunication Act on June
12th 2001. It established the framework for a liberalised telecoms market; this took effect on December
23rd 2001, when the monopoly rights of Matav, the dominant fixed-line provider, expired. The act regulates
and ensures competition in different segments of the telecoms market, including telecoms, postal activities,
Page 10 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
broadcasting and programme distribution. The act is forcing dominant market players to unbundle their networks and provide local-loop access to smaller market players for two years after their concession expires, if they receive a relevant offer from other service providers. Fixed-line telephone rates and access charge to the Internet remain regulated, and this rule is extended to the rates charged for calls from
fixed-line networks to mobile networks.

Hungary now has local monopolies in wire-based voice-telephone services, established by concession contracts concluded between telecoms providers and the former Ministry of Transport and Water. Besides its monopoly to provide local telephone services in 39 of the 54 primary areas, Matav (the formerly
state-owned giant) held a monopoly on providing domestic long-distance and international voice-telephony services until December 23rd 2001. The monopoly concessions of the providers in the remaining 15 primary areas expired on November 1st 2002. The new firms attempting to challenge Matav’s status as dominant provider have opened business in most areas of competition, including closed-network and
intra-company services. At present, Matav (Hungary), Vivendi Telecom Hungary (now owned by US-based
AIG Emerging  Europe and GMT Communications Partners), Monor Telephone Company (of United
Pan-Europe Communications based in the Netherlands), Emitel (a subsidiary of Matav) and Hungarotel
provide land-line phone services.

Competition has been slow to develop, however, and rivals accused Matav of blocking real competition by charging high prices for interconnecting its network with competitors. The Association of Alternative Telecom Service Providers decided in July 2002 to challenge Matav’s reference interconnection offer (RIO) in court. The organisation called for immediate government involvement in redefining the conditions of competition and in eliminating the interconnection pricing mechanism of the former monopoly.

The telecommunications arbitration panel ruled in May 2003 that Matav must lower its interconnect fees by an average 28%, and further declines followed as Hungary prepared for EU membership in May 2004

To address additional issues that have arisen, the IT and telecoms ministry drafted a fully EU-compliant new Unified Telecommunication Act, which was submitted to parliament in the autumn and took effect January 1st 2004. The new law introduced number transferability for fixed-line phones from January 2004 and for mobile phones from May 1st; reduced fees charged for terminating calls from fixed-line networks to mobile networks; reformed the financing of universal-access telecom services and narrowed the range of those eligible to use them. It also set up a new Communications Council.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial designs and models are all legally recognised. Legislation on intellectual property rights is comparable to that in western  European countries, but foreign producers still cite local piracy of software, music, branded apparel and pharmaceutical patents as problem areas for enforcement. However, much has already been done to improve respect for intellectual property rights, as required by the EU, OECD and WTO. Patents are protected for 20 years from the date of filing the patent application; an annual fee is required to maintain the patent. The Act on the Protection of Inventions by Patents (XXXIII of 1995) conforms to EU legislation.

The law includes detailed provisions against infringement. A patent holder or licenser that suspects patent infringement may file a lawsuit at the Budapest Metropolitan Court (Fovarosi Birosag) and may request an injunction to halt the alleged abuse, an award of compensation and damages, or confiscation of the goods produced under the infringing activity. Cases may be appealed to the Supreme Court (Legfelsobb Birosag). Disputes may be settled by either direct ruling or trial. A licensee also may sue an infringer in court. It
should be noted that Hungary’s overburdened court system often leads to lengthy delays in pursuing legal remedy, and even injunctions against infringing activity can be difficult to obtain. Holders of copyrights and trademarks suffer frequent infringement, and industry groups have been set up to lobby the government and assist authorities.

Hungary joined the  European Patent Convention (EPC) on January 1st 2003, when Act XXXIX of 2002 modified Act XXXIII of 1995 and fully integrated the Hungarian patent system into the EPC.  European patents can now be applied for at the Hungarian office in Hungarian. The Hungarian Patent Office (HPO) said the changes will not slow the patent process or increase costs.
Act XLVIII of 2001 codified the protection of industrial designs.

Act LX of 1995 extended the availability of interlocutory injunctions (temporary restraining orders) to intellectual property matters. The applicant must file a written claim showing that, without the injunction, imminent and direct damages cannot be avoided, the status quo giving rise to the dispute cannot be preserved or the position of the applicant requires protection. An interlocutory injunction may be requested only within the context of an existing litigation. The applicant must also show that the advantages of the injunction would probably outweigh its disadvantages. If granted, an injunction takes effect on the day

Page 11 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
following the date of receipt of the order on the injunction or on the date determined by the court; it remains in force until it is revoked or until judgment is passed on the merits of the case.
Increasingly, foreign firms are registering their patents in Hungary, according to the annual report of the
HPO. The number of patents registered has risen steadily since 1990; 5,906 patents were registered in
2002, and only 842 of these belonged to Hungarian companies. In 2001, domestic companies submitted
842 patent applications, and foreign companies filed 5,064 claims. Main growth areas for patent
applications were pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry and biotechnology.

The Highest Court dismissed a patent infringement case brought by Merck, a US pharmaceuticals producer, against Richter, a domestic pharmaceuticals producer in February 2003. Merck filed its suit in
1995, claiming that Richter used its patented compound in Richter’s Ednyt blood-pressure medicine. Richter said it used its own patented ingredients.
The HPO revoked one of Merck’s patents on simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering compound in February
2003, and the company appealed against the move at the Budapest Municipal Court. Merck is also suing
Teva-Biogal, an Israeli-owned pharmaceuticals producer, in a patent-infringement case related to
simvastatin.

The HPO is planning to encourage local SMEs to apply for patents through new tax cuts. The cost of registering a patent is already deductible from pre-tax profits, but SMEs making little or no profit would be allowed to write off costs as expenses. In the HPO’s estimate, about 60,000 Hungarian companies could be competitive on the global innovation market with the help of the measure instead of the 3,000 at present. The HPO’s new strategy will go before the government for approval in September.

Copyrights are protected by the Copyright Act (Act LXXVI of 1999). This strengthened protection by providing the courts with authority to decide on issuing injunctions for alleged copyright violation within 15 days of receiving the request if certain conditions are met. The act came into force on September 1st 1999 and fully harmonised Hungary’s copyright law with EU standards. It also modernised copyright provisions to account for the spread of information technologies and incorporated the provisions of international
copyright treaties.

Following the first award for damages to a foreign copyright owner (Microsoft of the US) for illegal use of software in the first half of 1999, another landmark court case in November 1999 saw the first imposition of (suspended) prison terms on two individuals for copyright infringement. Additional cases were successfully completed or launched in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to defend software copyrights. In February 2003 a Budapest court sentenced the managing director of Philos Laboratories, a Hungarian software developer, to one year in prison, the first such sentence for illegal software use in Hungary. Co-operation with the authorities reduces sanctions, but violators face up to eight years in prison for copyright infringement.

The Business Software Alliance (BSA), a private industry group, helps its members defend their copyrights, in part by initiating legal action against illegal use. The BSA says that software morality is improving; it estimates that software piracy rates dropped to 45% in 2002, from 48% in 2001, 51% in 2000 and 76% in
1994. Still, this far exceeds Western  Europe’s average of around 35%.

The Hungarian Association of Record Producers (Mahasz) estimates that 18% of the recorded works sold in Hungary in 2002 were illegal copies and that about Ft2bn in revenues was lost to the rightful copyright holders. The Audiovisual Copyright Foundation estimates that the video industry suffers Ft2bn-3bn in lost revenues per year because of pirated videos.

Act I of 1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) requires cable operators to complete contracts or obtain contract waivers from the broadcasters whose programmes they transmit. The operators must also register their programme offerings with the National Radio and Television Board (the ORTT). The ORTT must allow any broadcaster to check the registry for information regarding their programmes retransmitted by the cable operators and the protection of copyrights.

The Copyright Act of 1999 prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain decoding devices used illegally to view pay-television programming (such as HBO). Industry associations believe the number of those illegally viewing premium cable-TV programming to be about equal to the number of paying subscribers. Act LXXVII of 2001 modified the law to include electronic databases as well.

Trademarks are covered by Act XI of 1997 on Trademark Protection, which further harmonised Hungarian intellectual property legislation with EU and international norms. The act expanded trademark protection
(for example, to protect colours, voices, numbers and letters), added more precise definitions for distinctive symbols and denied protection for illegally obtained trademarks. It also strengthened the rights of
trademark holders by accelerating legal proceedings on trademark infringement. The court must decide on the infringement claim within 15 days of submitting the claim. Temporary measures in trademark infringements may be enforced. The protection of geographic indicators is also allowed under the Act on
Page 12 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Trademark Protection, in limited circumstances. Hence, names such as Tokaj (where Hungary’s famous dessert wines are produced) are protected from forgeries. Act CXXI of 1997 on Grape Growing and the Wine Economy also introduced strict rules protecting Tokaj wines, including a precise definition of the right to use of the name Tokaji. The act also tightened customs regulations to prevent the importing of counterfeit products.

In February 2003 the Budapest Municipal Court ruled against Hid Radio, a US publishing company, in a trademark-infringement case brought against it by Ringier of Switzerland, a rival publisher. Ringier claimed Hid Radio’s tabloid Szines Mai Lap greatly resembled the format and design of Mai Nap, the Ringier
group’s tabloid. Under the court ruling, Szines Mai Lap must change its logo and pay a certain amount from its profit generated during the period in question to Ringier. Hid Radio has appealed against the verdict.
Price Controls

The Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990) provides for price controls. Hungary’s economic reform has liberalised the prices of most products and services offered by private concerns. Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport Decree 30 of May 9th 2003 regulates natural gas prices; Decrees 58 and 61 of December 29th 2002 regulate the prices of retail electricity services and district heating. Decree 3 of January 21st 2002 of the Prime Minister’s Office regulates telecom tariffs for 2003. Government Decree 175/2001 required former monopoly Matav to come up with a reference interconnection offer (RIO), which lays out the key terms and conditions for making interconnections with other providers, including tariffs. The Telecommunications Authority’s arbitration panel, a regulatory body
established by the Telecommunication Act, approved Matav’s RIO on July 18th 2002, but the Association of
Alternative Telecom Service Providers challenged the RIO in court.
Internet charges are regulated by Decree 3/2003 of the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications.

The government took a strong anti-inflationary stance in 2002. As in previous years, this created strong controversy over price controls, affecting energy, telecoms and pharmaceuticals.

In pharmaceuticals, the prices of non-subsidised drugs are not supposed to be regulated (only a notification requirement exists). In 2000, international and domestic producers signed a three-year pricing pact over subsidised drugs with the government. However, the Medgyessy government postponed the agreed average 5% hike from July 1st 2002, intending to renegotiate the three-year deal and sign a four-year agreement instead. A deal finally materialised on February 1st 2003, when the price of subsidised drugs rose by an average of 4.5%. The hike was set at a fixed amount for drugs that cost less than Ft550, thus benefiting domestic manufacturers, which sell large quantities of low-priced generic drugs, such as Richter, Egis and Chinoin.

Under the three-year agreement, subsidised drug prices rose by 3.7% in July 2002, but this hike was postponed until February 2004. At the same time, the government increased the 2003 drug budget by Ft26bn but capped the amount of monthly subsidies on medications until the end of 2003. The government is planning to introduce a new subsidy system in 2004 that would altogether eliminate price talks with manufacturers, a move opposed by the Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in
Hungary (AIPM), which represents drug importers. Among the many foreign companies affected by the dispute are AstraZeneca  (UK), Bayer (Germany), GlaxoSmithKline (UK), Merck (US), Novartis (Switzerland) and Pfizer (US).

The Ministry of Health also capped pharmacies’ profit margins from July 1st 2001, limiting them to no more than Ft630 on medications that cost more than Ft3,500. The Hungarian Pharmacist Chamber announced in early 2003 that it is turning to the Constitutional Court over the estimated Ft4bn drop in revenue the sector has suffered since the margin cut in 2001. The chamber submitted a similar complaint in August 2001, with no results so far.

The government will have the power to freeze pharmaceutical prices for up to 12 months, according to a bill approved by the parliamentary economic committee. Under the existing legislation, the government can freeze prices for no more than six months -- as it actually did from the start of April this year. The bill also authorises the government to ban any producer or distributor of drugs and nutrition supplements from increasing prices for up to 12 months in case of a temporary disturbance in the market. The cabinet can
also prevent producers and distributors from increasing wholesale prices for up to one year. The two MPs who tabled the bill argue that the supply of pharmaceuticals is closely related to the constitutional rights to life and health.

Matav, the national telecoms provider, was allowed to raise the price of its subscription packages by 10% and the tariffs for local calls by 6% from January 1st 2003. However, it chose to increase its prices by an average of only 4.3% from February 1st in an attempt to ward off competitors.


Page 13 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The government approved an average 10% electricity price hike on February 1st 2003. Retail prices rose by an average 8.7%. The government also decided to lift the price caps that caused power distributor Hungarian Electricity Works (MVM) to accumulate Ft73bn in losses by end-2002, according to the Hungarian Energy Office.

The Electricity Act (Act CX of 2001), which parliament passed on December 18th 2001, is gradually introducing competition to the electricity market between January 2003 and 2010. About 35% of the market was liberalised in the first step, involving about 200 large consumers that used 6.5 gwh of electricity a year. These consumers were freely able to choose suppliers but only for up to 50% of their total electricity needs.

Natural gas retail prices did not rise in 2002, but were hiked by 12% on May 15th 2003. Gas prices for large industrial consumers rose by 5.2% on July 1st 2002, affecting about 350 companies, and have remained unchanged since then.

Parliament adopted a new natural-gas-supply law (Act XLII of 2003) in June 2003, aligning the gas market with EU norms. Under the new law, domestic natural gas prices will be pegged to world market prices, and discount household gas prices will be subsidised by higher mining fees for MOL, the oil and gas company. The law will open a part of the market to a selected group of gas users, who together consume about 40% of the total, as from January 1st 2004.

MOL welcomed the new law, saying it would enable the company to operate its gas business profitably from 2004, putting it on equal footing with other market players. But MOL’s natural-gas division expects to register a loss again this year because of the price caps, which are forcing the company to sell gas for less than it costs to import it. Nevertheless, the company expects losses far lower than the Ft120bn amount in
2001.

Rising fee incomes and a spate of mergers suggest the industry is back on the up following a tough 2003.

The PR industry spluttered its way through 2002 and saw little improvement in 2003. But all the signs are that 2004 brought with it a marked improvement in the discipline's health. Indeed, 85% of the consultancies in our league table recorded year-on-year fee income growth, suggesting good cause for a return to optimism.

TD
Yet this does not necessarily mean the PR industry has witnessed a repeat of the heady explosion of business that greeted it at the dawn of the millennium. Moreover, it remains difficult to obtain a full picture of its condition, as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act continues to prevent major players such as Weber Shandwick, Burson-Marsteller and Hill & Knowlton from providing fee income figures for the most recent year.

What can be seen, however, are encouraging signs of a more measured, consistent growth. Both the tables and a recent report by business advisers Willott Kingston Smith and global marketing communications consultant Results go some way to confirming a welcome return in market confidence. The survey revealed that of all the marketing disciplines, the most optimistic income growth expectations come from the public relations sector, with 23% of survey respondents from across the industry who have PR interests believing the medium has the greatest potential for organic growth.

'Clients are looking at how to use their budgets more effectively, and when it works well, PR is the most effective of all marketing disciplines,' claims Kris Thykier, vice-chairman of Freud Communications. 'We are increasingly seeing a shift toward PR achieving creative equality.' The agency saw such a shift translate into a healthy 24% rise in fee income over 2003, buoyed by organic growth from existing clients PepsiCo and Nestle Rowntree, and by the growth in its corporate work, including big wins from
Kimberly-Clark and Sony Pictures.
Rising status
PR's status continues to rise as the media fragments.

Furthermore, as members of the public become increasingly marketing-savvy, anecdotal evidence suggests that a more subtle approach to engaging emotions has become key to successful campaigns.

Fleishman-Hillard consumer team director Louisa Jenkins says that such an approach has become a vital force for new clients such as Kenco Coffee and existing clients including Pampers. 'We are now seeing PR receive a bigger slice of the marketing budget, especially for consumer brands,' she says. 'PR can short-cut some of the more direct approaches from other marketing disciplines, and canny marketers are using it in more strategic ways. Our experience over the past year suggests that PR is increasingly becoming the lead creative agency.'

While there may be a clear step toward PR taking the creative lead in accounts, consultancies still have to tread carefully. 'Yes, there is a little more collaboration around the table, but PR agencies need to be careful,' warns Eulogy! managing director Adrian Brady, whose agency posted a 9% increase in fee income. 'Clients are impressed if we can share our knowledge of the full marketing mix, but not so much that they think we are looking to grab another slice of their budget. If you do get a marketing director who buys into PR, they become massive fans. But there are still some issues with them understanding its full effect. As an industry, we still need to convince clients to make the proper investment and that spending money on PR can have an effect on sales and brand awareness,' he adds.

There is a sense that business has picked up for many consultancies over the past year, but providing hard evidence that PR does deliver boosted sales and brand recognition remains a heated topic of debate
- and results in some confusion. In October last year, for example, research at seminars at Henley Management College revealed that half of public relations officers cite 'gut feel' as a primary way of evaluating the success of their campaigns, and only 4% of respondents allocate at least 10% of their PR budget to research and evaluation.
Tangible results

On the other hand, an independent Metrica survey of 100 in-house PR managers and directors last year showed that 90% of them are now using media evaluation. With so many different methods of measuring a campaign's success, it is not surprising that there remains pressure on the industry to provide tangible results.

'Evaluation needs to begin earlier,' says Richard Millar, UK managing director of marketing and business development at Hill & Knowlton. 'Agencies need to understand what a client's business objectives are ahead of its communications objectives - then it will become easier to identify how to evaluate the outcomes from the start.' Putting this theory into practice helped the agency achieve growth in 2004, with accounts added from London 2012 and De Beers.

Last year also saw Hill & Knowlton focus on establishing its consumer technology division, and the launch of divisions has not stopped there.

The agency is looking at adding diversity as a practice area later this year. Fishburn Hedges, meanwhile, set up consumer subsidiary Seventy Seven PR at the start of the year, while Consolidated Communications opened a Scottish office and a consumer division to handle new business. Freud Communications is now looking at growing its public affairs division, while August.One Communications shifted its Microsoft business into its tech specialist sister agency Inferno in February, so that it can more easily move its non-tech business forward.

David Gallagher, chief executive of Ketchum London, describes 2004 as a year that marked a turn in both the economy and clients' marketing spend, resulting in the company's third successive year of double-digit growth.

This agency, too, is considering expansion. 'We are looking at extending services such as investor relations and analyst relations into specialist divisions, and are close to making new services available in our new media and entertainment divisions,' he says.

A return to market confidence is further discernible from the spate of mergers and acquisitions in 2004. Gallagher predicts this consolidation will continue as holding companies shop around. The most significant mergers and acquisitions news of 2004 for the PR industry was undoubtedly that of the world's biggest independently owned PR business, Edelman, acquiring consumer consultancy Jackie Cooper PR (JCPR) in May. Edelman, whose fee income rose by 23% to pounds 13.4m in 2004, also expanded its specialist research group Strategy One, opening a London office.
Returning confidence

'There was a certain lack of confidence in the industry until about a year ago,' says Stuart Smith, joint chief executive of Edelman London.
'This acquisition probably sent a signal to the marketplace that it was coming back.'

In addition to the Edelman/JCPR deal, other activity over the past 12 months included Huntsworth Group's acquisition of Grayling, Trimedia and Hudson Sandler, while elsewhere, Golley Slater bought NP. This
year has already seen Chime Communications snap up financial shop Grandfield, while Connectpoint has acquired Flent PR.

Consolidation fever among agencies has generated a mixed reaction from in-house directors. 'If a bigger agency is buying up smaller specialist agencies to increase its practice areas, that would appeal to me,' admits Rachel O'Reilly, head of PR at TUI UK. 'If we are looking at expanding our focus in a certain area, for example, I don't have to look for another specialist agency, but can simply turn to a retained one.'

Janice O'Reilly, senior corporate PR manager at the COI - with its coveted agency roster - argues that although agency mergers and acquisitions can bring more experience to an account, the concern is that there may be troubled times as teams settle into a new culture. 'But it is certainly a trend we have experienced, seeing fewer specialist agencies around and more offering a one-stop shop service,' she adds.


Page 16 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A fuller offer is encouraging clients to look at hiring one agency with a raft of expertise to carry out multi-disciplinary briefs. Edelman's appointment by Nutricia UK to promote its Milupa and Cow & Gate brands, for example, resulted in Edelman targeting healthcare professionals for both brands, while JCPR oversees the consumer work. 'Since the acquisition, we have become a PR shop offering a three-pronged service; corporate/B2B/public affairs, healthcare and now consumer, so there is a cross-fertilisation of work,' says Smith.

Consolidated Communications recorded a 6% drop in fee income in 2004 after experiencing a tough first half of the year, but managing director Sarah Robinson explains that plenty of business came through in the second half of the year from clients looking to take a more integrated approach.

'One of our 2004 wins was the Energy Savings Trust, which used to have several agencies, but now has just us working on consumer, B2B and public affairs,' she says.

One of the agency's biggest client additions this year was American Express; three different teams now work on the account, as the brief encompasses issues ranging from personal finance to lifestyle.

As multi-disciplinary briefs thread their way into the industry, requests for PR agencies to generate integrated marketing campaigns are also creeping in, with media fragmentation and crossover of audiences the driving forces.
But is PR the right discipline to take this type of campaign forward?

Cake chief executive Mike Mathieson and board director Greg James - both passionate advocates of integrated marketing - believe it can be. The agency makes its debut in the league tables this year. With new clients Lynx, More! magazine, Coors  Fine Light, the Marines and the World Rally Championships joining their portfolio in 2004, plus a place on the COI roster, the two believe an integrated approach makes all elements of communication work harder. Mathieson describes the agency's work for Carling Live 24 as a prime example of where it can be successful. 'We devised a programme of 24-hour non-stop music and worked on the PR for the event, plus the online campaign, the event production and the advertising - every department at Cake was working on it,' he says.

Blue Rubicon managing director Fraser Hardie shares their view that PR can successfully drive integrated campaigns. 'If we can connect themes that work on all levels, these campaigns can be very powerful at taking a client's message or objective forward,' he says. 'Clients increasingly look for this approach.'

Blue Rubicon's success with business wins from BP, Cable & Wireless and Shell, its appointment to the COI roster and organic growth from McDonald's and GlaxoSmithKline, added to investment in staff development, meant the consultancy has had no staff leave in the past two years. Yet this does not alter Hardie's view that the industry is still suffering from a shortage of quality candidates during recruitment, particularly at manager level. 'We are still being affected by people having left the industry after the dotcom crash, and there has been a decline in recruitment standards since then,' he says.

JCPR founding partner Robert Phillips agrees. 'It is still a tight labour market,' he says. 'We believe in strategic hires: if you see someone with real talent, you must grab them.'

There is certainly a temptation to herald a business boom and start popping the champagne corks. The combination of robust mergers and acquisitions activity, solid performances for more than three-quarters
of the league table's entries, and clients increasingly considering PR as the lead creative discipline all hint at better times.

But the industry is not quite there yet. Consultancies are still having to work hard to achieve these fee income boosts and big account wins, rather than having business fall into their laps. Nonetheless, it has certainly managed to get back onto steadier ground after a challenging 2003.

THE SARBANES-OXLEY EFFECT

For agencies affected by the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which restricts the financial information that firms are allowed to make public, we have used Companies House data provided by Willott Kingston Smith.

AstraZeneca,  the Anglo-Swedish drugs group, will be censured and  fined by Europe's top antitrust watchdog for illegally trying to prolong patent protection for its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug, Losec.

According to Brussels officials, the ruling was to be delivered on Wednesday by the  European               Commission. It follows a six-year probe into allegations that  AstraZeneca  misused national patent systems, for example by providing wrong information to patent offices.

TD
The Commission believes the group's actions, which took place during the 1990s, amount to an abuse of a dominant position a violation that can trigger  fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover.

However, few companies are ordered to pay such high  fines, and AstraZeneca  might escape especially lightly because of the unusual nature of the allegations.

The group, which has described the  Commission's case as "legally and factually flawed", was formally charged with breaking EU competition rules by the  Commission in July 2003.

AstraZeneca  was accused of concealing from patent offices the date at which it first received marketing authorisation for Losec, enabling it to claim an extension of the period during which the drug is protected by patent.

The Brussels regulator also alleged  AstraZeneca  switched from offering Losec as capsules to a tablet formulation, while asking patent offices to deregister market authorisation for the capsule version. This, the Commission believes, prevented parallel importers and generic producers from marketing the original capsule.

Two generic drugmakers originally launched the case, by complaining to the  Commission in 1999. Any fine will come as a fresh blow at a time when  AstraZeneca  is recovering from a series of disappointing events that have depressed its share price in recent months.

Last autumn, the company faced rejection by US regulators of its blood-thinning drug Exanta, and disappointing trials results from Iressa, a lung cancer treatment fuelling a more general concern about AstraZeneca's  pipeline of new products.

The group has also faced concerns about possible side effects linked to Crestor, its anti-cholesterol treatment which has sales of $1bn a year, and UK shareholder criticism of the remuneration package offered to Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive.

BRUSSELS, Jun 14, 2005 (ODC via Comtex) --

European antitrust authorities will decide Wednesday whether the U.K.'s  AstraZeneca  PLC (AZN) misused a dominant position with its blockbuster anti-ulcer drug Losec, an industry and E.U. official close to the case has toldDow Jones Newswires.

TD
Once the world's best-selling drug, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world, leading to a flood of cheaper, generic versions.

The Commission opened an investigation in July, 2003, saying it suspected the company of blocking or delaying the entry of generic competitors by giving incorrect information to patent offices in an attempt to prolong Losec.

In particular,  AstraZeneca  is accused of concealing from patent offices the date when it first received marketing authority for Losec.

The company is also accused of attempting to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsules to tablets. Finally, Astra is accused of preventing importers and generic makers from buying the original capsule formula in countries where it is cheap

AstraZeneca  said at the time that the allegations are "groundless."

Big money is at stake. Pharma giants like  AstraZeneca  complain that vital research and development is under threat from aggressive generic producers. Global annual sales of Losec in 2002 totaled $4.6 billion, about a quarter of  AstraZeneca's  then total revenues.

The AstraZeneca  investigation breaks new legal ground. Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the  commission alleges the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

Regulators contend  AstraZeneca  concealed from some national patent offices the date it received the first E.U. marketing authorization for Losec. The aim was to extend patent protection by as much as five years in those countries, the  commission alleges.

If regulators decide a company has broken antitrust laws,  fines of as much as 10% of annual global sales can be levied, though penalties tend to be much less and E.U. antitrust investigations can drag on for years.

EUROPE
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European antitrust authorities are expected to levy a  fine Wednesday against AstraZeneca  PLC (AZN) after concluding that the British company misused a dominant position with its blockbuster anti-ulcer drug Losec, according to a  commission official.

It was unknown how large the  fine against AstraZeneca  would be.

AstraZeneca  spokesman Steve Brown said, "We have had no contact from the  commission. But he said that if a fine is announced, "the company will appeal."

HD        FT.com site : AstraZeneca  set to appeal ?60m EU fine.

AstraZeneca  said it would appeal against the  European Commission's decision to  fine the Anglo-Swedish drugs group ?60m for illegally trying to prolong patent protection for Losec, its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug.

The decision, made on Wednesday by  Europe's top antitrust watchdog, follows a six-year probe into allegations that  AstraZeneca  misused national patent systems - by providing wrong information to patent offices, for example.

TD
The ?60m fine will come as a fresh blow to the group at a time when  AstraZeneca  is in the middle of recovering from a series of disappointing events.

The group said on Wednesday: "AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec."

"AstraZeneca  will challenge the  Commission's decision and appeal the case because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in Europe."

The Commission believes the group's actions, which took place during the 1990s, amount to an abuse of a dominant position - a violation that could have triggered  fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover.

The fine follows the company's rejection last autumn by US regulators of its blood-thinning drug Exanta, and disappointing trials results from Iressa, a lung cancer treatment.

AstraZeneca  has also faced concerns about possible side effects linked to Crestor, its
recently-launched anti-cholesterol treatment, and UK shareholder criticism of the remuneration package
offered to Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive.

The group, which previously described the  Commission's case as "legally and factually flawed", was formally charged with breaking EU competition rules by the  Commission in July 2003.

AstraZeneca  was accused of concealing from patent offices the date at which it first received marketing authorisation for Losec, enabling it to claim an extension of the period during which the drug is protected by patent.

The Brussels regulator also alleged that  AstraZeneca  switched from offering Losec as capsules to a tablet formulation, while asking patent offices to deregister the capsule version. This, the  Commission believes, prevented parallel importers and generic producers from marketing the original capsule.

On Wednesday  AstraZeneca  said: "Companies are entirely within their rights to withdraw products; to introduce new products; and to deal with product registrations as may be necessary."
The group's shares edged down 6p to GBP22.92 in mid-day trade on Wednesday.

HD        FT.com site : AstraZeneca  to fight ?60m antitrust law penalty. BY         Tobias Buck in Brussels and Andrew Jack in London
WC        415 words

LP
AstraZeneca,  the Anglo-Swedish drugs group, on Wednesday vowed to appeal against a  fine of ?60m ($73m) for violating  European Union antitrust laws by abusing the patent system and preventing rival products from entering the market.

The ruling, the first in which the  European Commission targeted such an abuse, is likely to serve as a blueprint for future cases, especially in the pharmaceuticals industry.

TD
It underlines the  Commission's determination to crack down on companies that seek to manipulate the patent regime in order to prevent competition from generic drugmakers.

The Commission conceded that its ruling broke new legal ground, and said that the novelty of the charges had resulted in a reduction of the  fine.
The regulator can, in theory, impose  fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover or about
?214m in AstraZeneca's  case.

AstraZeneca  said the ruling would have an "important negative impact" on innovative companies in
Europe. Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive, said the case was "fundamentally flawed".

The Commission ruled that  AstraZeneca  had illegally been granted extended patent protection for Losec, its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug, after providing wrong information to several national patent offices.

It also found against the group for de-registering Losec's capsule formulation from several patent offices, after switching to a tablet version.

This meant the capsules no longer had market authorisation, which prevented generic producers from entering the market with rival products.

Brussels-based competition lawyers said the ruling could mark the advent of a more steely approach towards the  European drugs industry.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, defended the ruling: "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate, and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules.
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

But Sir Tom insisted the group had "not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately". He added: "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal position will confirm that the Commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed."

An AstraZeneca  official said the company had interpreted the date of full authorisation for marketing Losec as the time from which patent extensions should apply, while the  Commission considered they should begin from the first technical approval a difference that could represent several months of additional exclusivity.

AstraZeneca's  shares closed down 1.3 per cent in London.

AstraZeneca,  the Anglo-Swedish drugs group, will today be censured and  fined by Europe's top antitrust watchdog for illegally trying to prolong patent protection for its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug, Losec.
Brussels officials said the European Commission would deliver the judgment today. It follows a
six-year probe into allegations that AstraZeneca  misused national patent systems - by providing wrong
information to patent offices, for example.

TD
The Commission believes the group's actions, which took place during the 1990s, amount to an abuse of a dominant position - a violation that can trigger  fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover.

However, few companies are ordered to pay such high  fines, and AstraZeneca  might escape especially lightly because of the unusual nature of the allegations. The fine will be announced today.

The group, which has described the  Commission's case as "legally and factually flawed", was formally charged with breaking EU competition rules by the  Commission in July 2003.

AstraZeneca  was accused of concealing from patent offices the date at which it first received marketing authorisation for Losec, enabling it to claim an extension of the period during which the drug is protected by patent.

The Brussels regulator also alleged that  AstraZeneca  switched from offering Losec as capsules to a tablet formulation, while asking patent offices to deregister the capsule version. This, the  Commission believes, prevented parallel importers and generic producers from marketing the original capsule.
It was two generic drugmakers that originally launched the case, by complaining to the  Commission in
1999. Any  fine will come as a fresh blow to the group at a time when  AstraZeneca  is in the middle of
recovering from a series of disappointing events.

Last autumn, the company faced rejection by US regulators of its blood-thinning drug Exanta, and disappointing trials results from Iressa, a lung cancer treatment.

The group has also faced concerns about possible side effects linked to Crestor, its recently-launched anti-cholesterol treatment, and UK shareholder criticism of the remuneration package offered to Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive.

A spokesman for  AstraZeneca  said yesterday that if the  Commission's move was confirmed today, the company would appeal.

HD       EU expected to rule against AstraZeneca  Antitrust case focuses  on Losec patent

BRUSSELS:

In the first antitrust case of its kind, the  European Commission was set to find the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca  guilty on Wednesday of abusing the patent protection granted to its best- selling ulcer treatment Losec, a person close to the investigation said late Tuesday.

TD
The ruling could make it harder for pharmaceutical companies operating in  Europe to profit from their inventions, according to  AstraZeneca.  It comes as the  commission is drafting plans to help  Europe's pharmaceutical industry.

After an investigation lasting several years, the  commission's antitrust division said that it believed that AstraZeneca  was guilty of abusing its patent for Losec, the person said. At its peak in the 1990s, Losec was one of the biggest-selling prescription drugs with global sales of around $6 billion a year

The alleged abuse in the 1990s prevented generic-drug makers from marketing a cheaper version of Losec once AstraZeneca's  patent had expired, the person said. The company could face a  fine of millions of euros if there was a finding of abuse.

"This is the first time  European antitrust law has been used to combat patent abuse," the person said. Neelie Kroes, the commissioner in charge of antitrust policy, will propose a ruling against the British drug maker at the  commission's weekly meeting Wednesday, the person said. The  commission can only rule in antitrust cases once all 25 commissioners have voted. One possible opponent is Gunter Verheugen, the commissioner for enterprise and industry, who is working on a plan to bolster the competitiveness of the  European drugs industry. Neither he nor his spokesman were available to comment late Tuesday.

Antitrust officials have found that  AstraZeneca  gave the wrong date for market authorization for Losec to the patent authorities to gain a longer supplementary protection certificate, the person said.

These certificates are sometimes granted to allow a company an extended period free from competition from generic competitors when there is a delay in getting market authorization for a drug. The length of the extension is calculated from the date the drug was cleared to go on sale, rather than the date of the original patent.

The antitrust officials also found that  AstraZeneca  withdrew a capsule version of Losec to stop generic drug companies from copying it, the person said. Generics are only approved if the original version is still on the market.

Chris Major, a spokesman for AstraZeneca  at its London headquarters, said that there had been informal discussions with the commission since a February 2004 hearing, "but we have heard nothing officially." He said the company would appeal if the  commission ruled against it. The  commission, the executive arm of the  European Union, refused to comment.

Major said Losec's patent expired a few years ago, but could not say precisely when. Drug patent protection can be granted for up to 20 years but Major could not specify the duration of the Losec patent. He confirmed that one of the issues in the long-running case concerns the supplementary protection certificates, which he said were designed to ensure that a company's innovative potential was not
eroded.

"This is a fundamental element for competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry," he said. "This would be the wrong procedure to apply at a time when the  European Commission is trying to restore the competitiveness of the  European industry."

BRUSSELS:

In the first antitrust case of its kind, the  European Commission was set to find the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca  guilty on Wednesday of abusing the patent protection granted to its best- selling anti-ulcer drug, Losec, a source close to the investigation said late Tuesday.

TD
The abuse prevented generic-drug makers from marketing a cheaper version of Losec once
AstraZeneca's  patent had expired, the person said.

The British drug manufacturer faces a  fine of millions of  euros for the abuse, which happened during the 1990s in several Scandinavian countries.

The commission found that the company gave the wrong date for market authorization for Losec to patent authorities to gain longer protection from generic competition, the source said. The extension is calculated from the date the drug was cleared for sale, not the date of the original patent.

AstraZeneca  also withdrew a capsule version of Losec to stop generic companies from copying it, the source said. Generic drugs are only approved if the original version is still on the market.

"This is the first time  European antitrust law has been used to combat patent abuse," the source said. Rachel Bloom-Baglin, a spokeswoman for AstraZeneca  in the United States, said that the company had "heard nothing" from the commission, but that it would appeal any negative ruling.

BRUSSELS --  European antitrust authorities are expected to levy a  fine today against  AstraZeneca PLC after concluding that the British company misused a dominant position with its blockbuster ulcer drug Losec, according to a  European Commission official.
It wasn't known how large the  fine against AstraZeneca  would be.

TD
AstraZeneca  spokesman Steve Brown last night said, "We have had no contact from the
commission." He said if a  fine is announced, "the company will appeal."

Once the world's best-selling drug, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world, leading to a flood of cheaper, generic versions.

The commission opened an investigation in July 2003, saying it suspected the company of blocking or delaying the entry of generic competitors by giving incorrect information to patent offices in an attempt to prolong Losec's position.

In particular,  AstraZeneca  is accused of concealing from some national patent offices the date when it first received marketing authority for Losec in the  European Union. Regulators contend AstraZeneca  concealed the dates in order to extend patent protection by as long as five years in those countries, the  commission alleges.

The company also is accused of attempting to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsule to tablet form. Finally, the company is accused of preventing importers and generic makers from buying the original capsule formula in countries where it is cheap.

AstraZeneca  said at the time that the allegations are "groundless."

Big money is at stake. Drug giants such as  AstraZeneca  complain that vital research and development is under threat from aggressive generic producers. Global annual sales of Losec in
2002 totaled $4.6 billion, about a quarter of  AstraZeneca's  total revenue then.

The AstraZeneca  investigation breaks new legal ground. Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the commission alleges that the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

If regulators decide a company has broken antitrust laws,  fines of as much as 10% of annual global sales could be levied, though penalties tend to be much less and EU antitrust investigations can drag on for years.

HD        EU fines AstraZeneca  60 mln euros for patent misuse

BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) - Drugmaker  AstraZeneca  Plc was fined 60 million euros ($72.71 million) by European antitrust authorities on Wednesday for misusing its dominant position and delaying the entry of generic rivals to ulcer drug Losec.

The European Commission said it had fined AstraZeneca,  Europe's third-largest drug maker, for misusing the patent system to block or delay market entry for generic competitors to Losec.

TD
"The Commission has decided that  AstraZeneca's  actions constitute serious abuses of its dominant market position in violation of EC and EEA competition rules," it said in a statement.

Losec, which was originally developed by Swedish legacy company Astra AB, was once the world's top-selling drug, although it now faces copycat competition in major markets.

The European Commission had been investigating steps taken by Astra to protect its product and has taken the view that the company did not tell the patent authorities the correct date of first marketing authorisation.

HD        UPDATE 3-EU fines Astra 60 mln euros for blocking generics

(Adds further comment from  Commission and company)

BRUSSELS/LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) -  European antitrust authorities  fined AstraZeneca  Plc 60 million euros ($73 million) on Wednesday for blocking generic competition to ulcer drug Losec, but said its excess profits dwarfed the penalty.

TD
The European Commission, which conducted a six-year investigation into the company's actions, said on Wednesday AstraZeneca  had abused its dominant market position and misused the patent system to protect Losec between 1993 and 2000.
A Commission spokesman said the amount of the  fine was far less than the excess profits
AstraZeneca  had made from its illegal behaviour.

The penalty was lower than it might have been because the  Commission took a novel legal approach, finding AstraZeneca  used administrative procedures to abuse its position of dominance, the spokesman said.

Europe's third-largest drugmaker said that novel approach was "legally and factually flawed" and it would appeal against the  fine in European Union courts.

Losec, which was originally developed by Swedish legacy company Astra AB, was once the world's top-selling drug, although it now faces copycat competitors in major markets.

The European Commission started investigating steps taken by Astra to protect Losec in 1999, following a complaint from a generic drug manufacturer, and  AstraZeneca  was formally notified of the objections in July 2003.

The EU's executive found the company hid from patent authorities the correct date of first marketing authorisation of Losec, thereby allowing it to claim an extension of the period for which patent protection is granted.

"Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement.

"Healthcare systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices. By preventing generic competition  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

The Commission also found AstraZeneca  switched Losec to a tablet from a capsule and asked patent offices to deregister the capsule form, in a move designed to stop parallel traders -- who ship drugs between EU markets -- from selling the capsule.

AstraZeneca  said it acted in good faith in obtaining extended patent protection and was entirely within its rights in withdrawing one version of Losec and introducing another.

"The Commission's interpretation in this case could mean that any innovative product may be considered dominant retrospectively and hence subject to ... special responsibility," the company said.

SENDING A SIGNAL

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd told a briefing the profit  AstraZeneca  made by illegally delaying the entry of generic rivals far exceeded the  fine but the aim was to send a signal about unacceptable behaviour.

"The point of the  Commission imposing a fine is not to necessarily to deprive the company of all the profits it has made for abusing its position. The point is to send a signal. I think 60 million  euros is quite a powerful signal," he said.

In fact, industry analysts said the  fine would have only a limited financial impact on  AstraZeneca,  which generated pretax profits of $4.9 billion in 2004 on sales of $21.4 billion.

Abuse of a dominant market position can, in theory, trigger a  fine of up to 10 percent of annual turnover. But analysts had not expected such a severe penalty in this case, with estimates ranging from 20 million to 100 million euros.

"We see modest impact on the stock given that this issue arose from Astra's practices in the previous decade and does not have any ongoing implications for the business," said Michael Leacock of Nomura, who rates the shares "neutral".

More important for  AstraZeneca's  stock price is the outlook for its newer products, including cholesterol drug Crestor which has struggled to win over doctors and patients following a series of safety allegations, which the firm says are unfounded.

Shares in AstraZeneca  were 0.5 percent lower at 22.64 pounds in a weaker market for  European drug stocks by 1300 GMT.

BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) -  AstraZeneca  Plc made far more in profits by illegally delaying the

"My understanding is the extra profit made by  AstraZeneca  as a result of keeping these generic competitors off the market was well in excess of the amount of the  fine," spokesman Jonathan Todd told a briefing.
But he called the  fine a "powerful signal".

HD        ICELANDIC PROWLERS LEND SUPPORT TO TROUBLED M&S. BY        by mickey clark

TALK of stakebuilding propelled Marks & Spencer to the top of the Footsie leaderboard today.

A report in today's Guardian newspaper claims that Icelandic investors have spent more than £170 million during the past few days building up a 3% holding. Confirmation is expected within the next couple of days, the report says. Icelandic retailer Baugur and Kaupthing and Landsbanki banks are tipped as possible buyers.

TD
But M&S, up 83/4p to 3551/2p, said it was unaware of any stakebuilding and appeared relaxed, suggesting the purchase of its 'undervalued shares' did not come as a surprise.

Brokers say the speculation has helped underpin the shares in recent days despite reports that trading remains dire at Britain's biggest clothing retailer.

Just last year, the M&S board, under new chief executive Stuart Rose, rejected a proposed £9.1 billion from Bhs tycoon Philip Green worth 400p a share. But brokers say a new bidder is unlikely to emerge.

Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce is sceptical that any Icelandic interest will result in a bid, and has repeated his underperform rating on M&S.

Nick Bubb at Evolution Securities does not think that the shares are worth more than 300p and retains a reduce rating. He expects no profit recovery this year or next.

Share prices again traded within a narrow range, unable to draw much inspiration from the overnight gains on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 index edged up 0.8 points to 5047.6.

Mobile phones giant Vodafone hardened 1p to 1361/4p despite US broker Smith Barney repeating its sell recommendation after a meeting between the two yesterday.

AstraZeneca  shaded just 1p to 2275p despite a e60 million (£39.9 million) EU fine over market misuse surrounding its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug Losec. AZ was censured by the European Commission antitrust authorities for illegally trying to prolong Losec's patent protection.

It follows a six-year probe into allegations that the company misused national patent systems. But Seymour Pierce has repeated its buy recommendation, saying the penalty does not seriously harm its prospects. AZ, however, said it planned to appeal.

Housebuilders have enjoyed a good run of late but broker Numis thinks it may be coming to an end. It has downgraded Bovis, off 5p at 6831/2p, Persimmon, 8p cheaper at 739p, Redrow, down 7p at 398p, and Taylor Woodrow, 41/2p easier at 3221/4p, from hold to reduce.

Wilson Bowden, off 11p at 1116p, has also been cut from add to hold. Numis says house prices will continue to fall, and that will put builders under further pressure in coming months.

It was the first day on AIM for Granby Oil & Gas following a placing by broker Peel Hunt at 84p. The shares settled at 961/2p.

Also making a debut on that market was Empire Online, which provides marketing services for online gaming, following a placing by Numis at 175p. The price touched 190p then settled at 1771/2p.

AIM-listed software and services group Civica fell 101/2p to 224p following a placing of 4.7 million new shares at 210p.

Some of the £10 million proceeds from that will help finance the acquisition of Flare Software Systems, which specialises in information systems and related services for local government.

ASTRAZENECA REFUTES EC'S FINDINGS IN LOSEC DOMINANCE CASE AND APPEALS DECISION

TD
AstraZeneca  announced today that it does not accept the  European Commission's decision that it infringed Article 82 EC during the marketing of Losec (omeprazole) in the 1990s, and will appeal the decision to fine the company 60 million  Euros to the Courts.

In AstraZeneca's  view, the analysis by the  Commission in reaching this decision does not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders.

AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec. Indeed this matter was so unclear that it was ultimately decided by the  European Court of Justice after several years of legal argument. The Court's judgment recognised the difficulty in interpretation of the SPC Regulation and had no criticism of the Company.
In addition,  AstraZeneca  will argue in its appeal against the decision that amongst other matters:

(S) companies are entirely within their rights to withdraw products; to introduce new products; and to deal with product registrations as may be necessary. In this case the new Losec (MUPS) tablet formulation in fact offers benefits over the previous formulation. Moreover the  Commission fails to recognise that in any event generic companies could have obtained their own registrations of omeprazole on the basis of the extensive published literature already available at that time.

• The Commission has failed to analyse properly the crucial issue of relevant market and the definition of dominance in the pharmaceutical industry. The  Commission's interpretation in this case could mean that any innovative product may be considered dominant retrospectively and hence subject to the ' special responsibility' of a dominant company. This could impose unnecessary additional burdens which will adversely affect industry competitiveness, contrary to the express aspirations of the  Commission in particular in relation to the 'Lisbon' agenda.

This is a technically and legally complex case and AstraZeneca  fundamentally disagrees with DG Competition's findings.  AstraZeneca  will challenge the Commission's decision and appeal the case because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in  Europe.

HD         AstraZeneca  Faces EU Fines over Losec Patent Misuse

Global Insight Perspective
Significance If any potential
fine against AstraZeneca for breaking anti-trust laws does materialise, it will come as a fresh blow for the company, particularly after it suffered setbacks with its cancer treatment Iressa, as well as rejection from US regulators of its blood-thinning drug Exanta.
Implications A fine will clearly mean a massive win for generic producers worldwide as they try to gain a piece of the former best-selling drug Prilosec/Losec, and could signify more court battles between generics and pharma giants.
Outlook      The European  Commission has set a new legal precedence with the
AstraZeneca investigation, since it has stepped away from its traditional evidence gathering in price manipulation or licensing restrictions areas, and moved into violations of the patent-extension restrictions.

TD
AstraZeneca  intends to appeal against any fine, according to company spokesman Steve Brown. The company, which clearly views the European Commission's case as factually and legally flawed, was officially charged with breaking European Union (EU) competition rules by the  Commission back in July 2003.

The Commission's investigation and charges were launched following complaints by generic companies in 1999. Following the loss of patent protection for Losec in several countries around the world, AstraZeneca  has since faced aggressive competition from several generic players trying to gain a slice of this once top-selling drug's sales revenue.

Firstly,  AstraZeneca  is accused of hiding the date when it first received marketing authorisation for Losec from some national patent offices in the EU. Regulators allege that this move allowed the company to extend Losec patent protection by as long as five years in the countries in question.

Secondly, the company is also being accused of asking certain patent offices to deregister the capsule formulation of the drug after it had swapped from capsule to tablet version. In addition, and related to this accusation,  AstraZeneca  also stands in the line of fire for preventing importers and generic makers
from buying the original capsule formula in countries where it was cheaper. Both these moves prevented parallel importers and generic producers from marketing the original capsule in the first place, according to the regulators.
Outlook and Implications

A legal precedent has been set by the European Commission with its six-year probe into AstraZeneca. In this investigation, the Commission claims that the company misled regulators during the
patent-extension process. Fines could be quite considerable - as much as 10% of annual global sales if

AstraZeneca

is found guilty of breaking EU competition laws. However, penalties do not tend to be as harsh as that and these kinds of investigations can continue for years. This is highly likely to occur as  AstraZeneca will seek to appeal if and when a  fine is announced.

Pharmaceutical giants such as  AstraZeneca  have complained strongly about the fact that generic producers constitute a clear and obvious threat to their R&D development funds, leading to many projects for critical treatments being delayed or de-prioritised due to financial shortfalls.

The loss of the Losec patent has clearly impacted on  AstraZeneca's  finances since global sales of the stomach ulcer drug in 2002 amounted to US$4.2 billion, which was then equivalent to one-quarter of AstraZeneca's  revenue.

If an EU  fine is announced it will come as another blow to  AstraZeneca's  already battered profile, particularly in light of recent disappointing clinical trials of lung cancer treatment Iressa (gefitinib), as well as US regulator rejection of its blood-thinning Exanta (ximelagatran).

BRUSSELS, June 15 (AFP) -
The EU commission slapped a 60-million-euro (72-million-dollar) fine on pharmaceutical giant
AstraZeneca  Wednesdays for illegally pushing rivals of a stomach ulcer medicine out of the market.

TD
The commission accused the Anglo-Swedish company of delaying or blocking market access for generic versions of its Losec medicine and preventing parallel imports of Losec from 1993 to 2000.

Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the  European Union's executive arm, said that "the effect of this is has been to deprive consumers and health systems of access to lower-priced generic drugs."

"By preventing competition from generics,  AstraZeneca  kept the prices of Losec... artificially high," he added.
The fine reflected that  AstraZeneca's  actions were a "serious infringement", Todd said.

The commission, which polices antitrust issues in the EU, said the company's actions constitute "serious abuses of its dominant market position" and violated competition.

AstraZeneca  said it would appeal the decision, arguing that the  commission failed to take into account the "substantial" evidence submitted by the company on the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders.

LONDON, June 15 (AFP) -

European stock exchanges wilted Wednesday in the wake of lackluster movement on Wall Street and in response to concern over a spurt in oil prices.

TD
The London FTSE 100 index shed 0.54 percent to close at 5,019.5 while in Paris the CAC 40 fell 0.32 percent to 4,184.36. The Frankfurt DAX gave up 0.94 percent to close at 4,548.42.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading  eurozone shares dropped 0.48 percent to 3,147.55.

On the currency market the dollar slipped against the  euro in late trading as concerns mounted on financing the US current account deficit following disappointing data on capital flows into the United States.
The single European currency was at 1.2101 dollars against 1.2028 late Tuesday in New York. On Wall Street the spike in crude oil prices put the market on the defensive after a strong opening
inspired by data showing the US economy is growing with inflation largely in check.

Reversing course after a strong start, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.26 percent to 10,520.32 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.46 percent to 2,059.47 at 1530 GMT.

Investors cheered a consumer price report showing inflationary pressures in the economy remained subdued.

Falling energy prices pushed US consumer prices lower for the first time since last July, the Labor Department reported. The consumer price index decreased 0.1 percent in May while core CPI, excluding food and energy costs, was up 0.1 percent.

There was also better news on the manufacturing front. The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose a stronger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May and a regional report on factory activity in the New York area posted a stronger-than-expected rebound in June.

The market then shifted after crude oil surged above 56 dollars a barrel for the first time since April in the wake of disappointing reports on US inventory levels.

The Energy Department said US crude supplies fell 1.8 million barrels in the week ended June 10. Crude was already trading higher as a widely expected increase in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' production ceiling failed to reverse the upward trend in energy prices.

In London most airlines were hurt by developments on the oil market. easyJet fell 1.11 percent to 244.5 pence. But British Airways edged up 0.18 percent to 275 pence on positive comments from brokers at Dresdner.

Among telecoms BT lost 1.67 percent to finish at 218.79 in response to profit-taking that set in following the launch of BT Fusion, a new service that combines fixed and mobile phone operations.

Drugmaker AstraZeneca  fell 1.32 percent to 2,246 pence after being hit with a 60-million-euro fine from the European Commission on charges that it abused its market-dominant position in a bid to thwart competition in the generic drug sector.

In Paris the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company EADS gave up 1.48 percent to end the day at 23.30 euros in the face of lingering internal leadership frictions.

In Frankfurt Fresenius Medical Care, the world leader in dialysis equipment, fell 1.14 percent to 67.40 euros after disclosing that US competition authorities were asking for more information before ruling on its bid to acquire Renal Care.
Elsewhere in Europe share prices fell 0.50 percent to 375.82 on the AEX in Amsterdam, 0.13 percent to
32,622 on the SP/Mib in Milan, 0.18 percent to 6,257.14 on the Swiss Market Index and 0.53 percent to
9,563.6 on the Ibex-35 in Madrid.
The Bel-20 in Brussels edged up 0.07 percent to 3,111.44.

In Asia on Wednesday, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed 0.71 percent higher at 11,415.88 points supported by banks and high-tech shares in cautious trade ahead of US inflation and Japanese machinery orders data.
Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index closed flat at 13,914.30 points. bur/nh/ec

UPDATE
(Updating with further detail)

TD
LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - The FTSE 100 edged higher in early deals, led by a 2 pct rally in the share of
BAT, with mining stocks also lending support, traders said.
At 8.55 am, the FTSE 100 was up 3.7 points at 5,050.5, after closing down 3.6 points yesterday at
5,046.8. The broader indices were mixed.
Volume was moderate with 220.9 mln shares changing hands in 21,507 deals.

It was an fairly uneventful session in New York last night with indices closing marginally higher, following key Retail Sales and Producer Price Index data, and better than expected earnings news from Best Buy and Lehman Brothers.
The DJIA closed up 25.01 points at 10,547.57, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.07 points to
2,069.03.

Meanwhile in Asia, the Nikkei 225 ended the day up 79.96 points at 11,415. 88, while the Hang Seng was off 9.73 points at 13,895.08 at midday.

Oil prices rose in Asian trade, staying above 55 usd per barrel, as the market consolidated ahead of a meeting today by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss its production ceiling.

In London, with a dearth of major corporate newsflow, broker comments and press speculation provided much of the early focus.
BAT rose 23 pence to 1,115 after JP Morgan raised its price target on the stock to 1,300 pence from
1,090 and reiterated its 'overweight' recommendation.

In JP Morgan's view, the improving US litigation environment will enable BAT to re-leverage its balance sheet and the broker estimated BAT could buy back up to 37 pct of its shares by 2008.

Moreover, JP Morgan argued BAT is likely to remain the leader in global tobacco M&A over the next three to five years, adding that BAT and Japan Tobacco could combine to create the world's number one tobacco company.

Mining stocks were in favour, with Xstrata up 12 at 1,036, BHP Billiton up 8 at 686-1/2 and Rio Tinto ahead 20 at 1,677.
UBS issued a positive report on Xstrata this morning, reiterating its 'buy' recommendation and raising its
2005 EPS forecasts.

UBS noted that the Xstrata share price is down 5 pct since the beginning of March, though commodity prices remain higher than many commentators expected and the rand has weakened by 21 pct
year-to-date.


Page 60 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Elsewhere, Marks & Spencer took on 3-1/4 pence to 350 following a report in today's Guardian newspaper that an Icelandic investment group is understood to be building a stake in the company and is expected to announce in the coming days that it bought more than 3 pct of the retail group.

BOC Group was up 5 pence at 1,065 following reports this morning that the group has held merger discussions with Germany's Linde.
A Linde spokesman said, "This is pure speculation".

The Guardian said today, without citing sources, that Linde is planning to spin off its materials handling business to complete the union.

Looking to the downside, GUS fell 7 pence to 869-1/2 after CSFB lowered its target on the stock to 900 pence from 960. The broker argued that whilst yesterday's IFRS restatement did not have a material impact on pre-tax profits in the year just reported, it expects it to have a more meaningful (and more negative) impact on the next financial year.

CSFB estimated that the IFRS impact on pre-exceptional pre-tax profit, which was less than 1 pct in 2005, will be about 4 pct in 2006 and 2007, which is higher than anticipated.

Shares in AstraZeneca  slipped 9 pence to 2,267 following an article in the Financial Times which claimed the pharma giant will be censured and  fined by the European Commission antitrust authorities today for illegally trying to prolong patent protection for Losec.

However, Seymour Pierce reiterated its 'buy' advice on Astra and said the possible  fine over market misuse before 2003 is not serious and unlikely to change the investment thesis for the company.
Moreover, traders argued that any  fine is likely to be small.

WM Morrison continued its descent, losing a further 1-1/2 pence to 180-1/2 following a recent spate of analyst downgrades on the back of the retailer's fifth profit warning.

BT Group, meanwhile, was hit by profit taking after announcing details for the launch of its Bluephone product.

Investec said that the pricing, technology specification, and handset guidance are all more positive than expected, and reiterated its 'buy' rating on the telecoms group.
BT lost 2-1/4 at 220-1/4.
Daily Mail was under pressure following a disappointing trading update from Johnston Press.

Johnston Press announced that advertising in May fell 4.7 pct and warned that the trading environment has become difficult, with the outlook for advertising cautious.

Bridgewell downgraded Johnston Press to 'overweight' from an outright 'buy', noting that today's comments will unsettle investors in the short term.
Daily Mail fell 5 pence to 666, and on the second line Johnston Press was off 12-1/2 at 478 and Trinity
Mirror was 4-1/2 lower at 614.
3i Group was the worst performing blue chip, down 8 at 694-1/2, as the stock traded ex-dividend.,
Ex-dividend stocks also weighed on the FTSE 250 index, with Matalan, Kesa, and Halfords all lower. Meanwhile, Kelda dropped 12 pence to 677-1/2 as Deutsche Bank downgraded the utility to 'hold' from
'buy' on valuation grounds

Shares in UK housebuilders were out of favour as Numis downgraded a host of companies on valuation grounds following a strong sector performance in the past month.
In a note on the sector, the broker downgraded Bovis, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Woodrow to
'reduce' from 'hold' and cut Wilson Bowden to 'hold' from 'add'.

Numis added it maintains its 'underweight' stance on the sector, given the continuation of negative newsflow and its macro view.

HD     EU fines British pharmaceutical company  AstraZeneca euro60 million

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union antitrust regulators  fined British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca  PLC euro60 million (US$73 million) Wednesday for keeping prices on an ulcer drug product artificially high.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the company infringed EU competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of its Losec drug between 1993 and 2000.

TD
Todd said the abuse of EU rules deprived consumers and health care providers of choices for competing ulcer drugs. "By preventing competition from generics,  AstraZeneca  kept the prices artificially high," he said.

The European Commission said AstraZeneca's  actions "constitute serious abuses of its dominant market position in violation" of EU competition rules, preventing imports of Losec made in other markets outside the EU.

It said the company did this by "giving misleading information" to several EU national patent offices, with the result that  AstraZeneca  got extended patent protection for Losec.

Todd said abuses of patent rules occurred in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and in Britain and it blocked imports of its drug in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, which is not an EU member.

AstraZeneca  said it does not accept the  European Commission's decision and will appeal that decision at the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The fine "does not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders," it said.

AstraZeneca  added that it "acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent
Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec."

AstraZeneca's  Losec was the world's best-selling prescription drug during the 1990s, but has since lost patent protection in most countries, allowing the sale of cheaper, generic versions.

Pharmaceutical companies like  AstraZeneca  have argued that EU action against them in this field will cost them billions of  euros (dollars) worth of research and development invested in new drugs, which get little or no return if cheaper generic drugs are allowed on the market.

Todd said he did not know the exact profits made from the drug between 1993-2000, but that the figure was "well in excess" of the imposed sanction.
"The idea was to send a signal and I think  euro60 million is a pretty powerful signal," Todd said.

The EU head office can impose  fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales if it finds a company violated EU antitrust rules.

Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec."

AstraZeneca's  Losec was the world's best-selling prescription drug during the 1990s, but has since lost patent protection in most countries, allowing the sale of cheaper, generic versions.

Pharmaceutical companies like  AstraZeneca  have argued that EU action against them in this field will cost them billions of  euros (dollars) worth of research and development invested in new drugs, which get little or no return if cheaper generic drugs are allowed on the market.

Todd said he did not know the exact profits made from the drug between 1993-2000, but that the figure was "well in excess" of the imposed sanction.
"The idea was to send a signal and I think 60 million is a pretty powerful signal," Todd said.

The EU head office can impose  fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales if it finds a company violated EU antitrust rules.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca  PLC 60 million euros ($73 million) Wednesday for keeping prices on an ulcer drug product artificially high.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the company infringed EU competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of its Losec drug between 1993 and 2000.

Todd said the abuse of EU rules deprived consumers and health care providers of choices for competing ulcer drugs. "By preventing competition from generics,  AstraZeneca  kept the prices artificially high," he said.

The European Commission said AstraZeneca's  actions "constitute serious abuses of its dominant market position in violation" of EU competition rules, preventing imports of Losec made in other markets outside the EU.

It said the company did this by "giving misleading information" to several EU national patent offices, with the result that  AstraZeneca  got extended patent protection for Losec.

Todd said abuses of patent rules occurred in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and in Britain and it blocked imports of its drug in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, which is not an EU member.

AstraZeneca  said it does not accept the  European Commission's decision and will appeal that decision at the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The fine "does not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders," it said.

AstraZeneca  added that it "acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent
Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec."

AstraZeneca's  Losec was the world's best-selling prescription drug during the 1990s, but has since lost patent protection in most countries, allowing the sale of cheaper, generic versions.

"The idea was to send a signal and I think 60 million  euros is a pretty powerful signal," Todd said.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca  should experience few repercussions from  European antitrust authorities' decision Wednesday to fine the company EUR60 million on patents for its ulcer drug Losec, analysts said.

The E.U.  Commission charged that the company made misleading statements to country patent authorities to extend Losec patent certificates by as much as five years in those countries.

"It was the first time that we have found a clear-cut abuse based on systematic misuse of regulatory and public procedures," said Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the E.U. Competition  Commission.

AstraZeneca  denied the charges, which involved Losec sales from 1993 to 2000, and said it would appeal the fine in the courts.

"AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec," the company said.

At 1436 GMT,  AstraZeneca's  shares were down 24 pence, or 1.1%, to 2252 pence, while the broader market was also slightly down.

Analysts said the  fine wouldn't have a material impact on  AstraZeneca  earnings because the company disclosed the case in its annual reports and the alleged infraction began before the 1999 merger of Astra Pharmaceuticals AB and Zeneca PLC.
Additionally, the EUR60 million  fine is only a small fraction of the company's operating profits, said
Michael Leacock, a Nomura analyst.

AstraZeneca's  first-quarter 2005 net profit increased to $1.04 billion from $799 million. Operating profit, the number most closely watched by U.K. analysts, rose 38% to $1.45 billion, beating forecasts by more than 10%.
Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright said the Losec case was too old to be significant now. "Such a historical event, that it is really catching up with some distant history, and has no ongoing
implications whatsoever," he added. "So in the main, from an investment point of view, totally ignore it."

AstraZeneca's  dominant market position was key to the  Commission's decision, the Competition
Commission's Todd said.

"The fact that they did this would not have been a problem if they were not in a dominant position," he added.
Page 69 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses, such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the  Commission alleges the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

"The extra profit made by  AstraZeneca  as a result of keeping these generic competitors off the market was well in excess of the amount of the  fine," Todd said.

Still, Todd said, the  fine sent an important signal. The  Commission has since passed new rules to prevent similar abuses.
But AstraZeneca  said the law was so confusing and complex that it took the  European Court of
Justice years to make the first ruling in the case.

"The court's judgment recognized the difficulty in interpretation of the SPC regulation and had no criticism of the company," the company said.

Once the world's best-selling drug, with $4.6 billion revenue in 2002, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world, leading to a flood of cheaper, generic versions.

The European Commission (EC) fines drugs giant AstraZeneca  for violating antitrust law and UK data shows that wage pressures have eased in the UK.

The EC said that Astra seriously abused its dominant market position as it imposed 60 million (£40 million) fine on Astra for delaying or blocking market access to generic versions of Losec, its stomach ulcer treatment.

Astra said it would be appealing against the  fine, asserting that the EU did not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the medicines available for the treatment of stomach acid disorders.
Shares in Astra slipped 13p to £22.63 following the news.

Meanwhile, the Office of National Statistics said that headline earnings, including bonus payments, rose by 4.6% year-on-year in the first three months to April. This was a 0.1% rise on March and below forecasts of a 4.8% increase.

The news eases the Bank of Englands concerns that higher earnings could cause wider inflationary pressures in the UK economy.

However, the same survey showed that unemployment rose above expectations, with the claimant count increasing by a higher-than-expected 13,200 in May from April to take the total up to 855,300.

At 12.20pm the FTSE 100 was off six points at 5,041 in a narrow trading margin. The FTSE 250 was seven points lighter at 7,283 and the techMARK was a point adrift at 1,183.
The FTSE  Eurofirst 300 was flat on 1,137.

US futures points to a positive start ahead of the latest reading on the consumer price index a key inflationary measure. Experts have factored in a month-on-month decline from 0.5% to 0%.
Also in focus in the US will be the weekly oil inventory data and business inventory data.
In London, Marks & Spencer (MKS) was the top blue chip, jumping 9.5p to 356.25p on reports that
Icelandic investment group Baugur had been building a stake in the struggling retail giant.

Mining groups were also back in demand thanks to a bullish note on the sector from Morgan Stanley. The broker believes that dollar weakness and robust longer-term prospects for the China will lead to a period of stronger commodity pricing.
BHP Billiton (BLT), up 16p to 694.5p, was at the vanguard of a rally in the sector, with Rio Tinto (RIO), up
38p to £16.95, Xstrata (XTA), up 17p to £10.41, and Antofagasta (ANTO), up 14p to £11.93, also
prominent on the Footsie leaderboard.

Elsewhere, Standard Chartered (STAN) dipped 4.5p to £10.36 after snapping up American Express Banks commercial banking business in Bangladesh for $24.5 million (£13.5 million). On the second line, Johnston Press sunk 14.5p to 476.25p after warning of a decline in advertising revenues since March, which it blamed on the uncertainties surrounding the general election.

Among the minnows, interactive healthcare firm Ultrasis jumped 0.1p, or 12.2%, to 0.92p after winning its first Canadian client.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European antitrust authorities  fined British pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca  PLC (AZN) EUR60 million Wednesday, saying the company artificially propped up prices on ulcer drug Losec, preventing generic competition.

The European Commission said that from 1993 to 2000  AstraZeneca  infringed competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec.

TD
The E.U.  Commission also said the company attempted to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsule to tablet form and prevented importers and generic makers from buying the original capsule formula in countries where they could get it for low prices.

"Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of E.U. competition rules," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.
"Healthcare systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down," Kroes said. [
15-06-05 1003GMT ]

AstraZeneca  rejected the E.U.  Commission's charges and said it would appeal against the  fine in the courts.

"AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec," the company said.
The company said the  Commission failed to take into account  AstraZeneca  marketed the drug as
"just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders."

The company also faulted the complexity of  European patents regulation. Referring to the Commission's allegations about the company's motivation for introducing the tablet form, the company asserted that companies have rights to withdraw and introduce new products.

AstraZeneca  said the patent issues were so murky the  European Court of Justice took years to decide the case.

"The Court's judgment recognized the difficulty in interpretation of the (supplementary protection certificates) and had no criticism of the company."

Chief Executive Tom McKillop said: "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal position will confirm that the  Commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed." [ 15-06-05
1051GMT ]
E.U.  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said it decided not to levy the highest possible  fine
because it was the first time a company had been charged under new rules on patent extensions.

"The extra profit made by  AstraZeneca  as a result of keeping these generic competitors off the market was well in excess of the amount of the  fine," Todd said.


Page 75 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Competition  Commission doesn't aim to deny the company the profits derived from the alleged abuse, but to send a signal the  Commission stands ready to intervene in patent issues, Todd said.
"I think EUR60 million is quite a powerful signal," Todd said.

AstraZeneca's  first-quarter net profit surged 30% to $1.04 billion from the year-earlier level. Operating profit, the number most closely watched by analysts, rose 38% to $1.45 billion, beating forecasts by more than 10%.

Global revenue from Losec in 2002 was $4.6 billion, forming a quarter of the company's total revenue for that year.

At 1111 GMT,  AstraZeneca  shares were down 14 pence at 2,263 pence, and the broader market was also slightly lower.

HD           AstraZeneca  To Appeal EC's Losec Decision

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca  announced Wednesday that it does not accept the  European   Commission's decision that it infringed Article 82 EC during the marketing of Losec (omeprazole) in the 1990s, and said that it will appeal the decision to  fine the company EUR60 million to the Courts.

TD
In AstraZeneca's  view, the analysis by the  Commission in reaching this decision does not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders.

AstraZeneca  said it contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or Courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec.

Indeed this matter was so unclear that it was ultimately decided by the  European Court of Justice after several years of legal argument. The Court's judgment recognised the difficulty in interpretation of the SPC Regulation and had no criticism of the Company.

In addition,  AstraZeneca  will argue in its appeal against the decision that amongst other matters, companies are entirely within their rights to withdraw products; to introduce new products; and to deal with product registrations as may be necessary.

In this case the new Losec (MUPS) tablet formulation in fact offers benefits over the previous formulation. Moreover the  Commission fails to recognise that in any event generic companies could have obtained their own registrations of omeprazole on the basis of the extensive published literature already available at that time.

The Commission has failed to analyse properly the crucial issue of relevant market and the definition of dominance in the pharmaceutical industry. The  Commission's interpretation in this case could mean that any innovative product may be considered dominant retrospectively and hence subject to the ' special responsibility' of a dominant company.

This could impose unnecessary additional burdens which will adversely affect industry competitiveness, contrary to the express aspirations of the  Commission in particular in relation to the
'Lisbon' agenda.

This is a technically and legally complex case and  AstraZeneca  fundamentally disagrees with DG Competition's findings.

AstraZeneca  said it will challenge the  Commission's decision and appeal the case because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in  Europe. [ 15-06-05 1132GMT ]

LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca  should experience few repercussions from  European antitrust authorities' decision Wednesday to fine the company EUR60 million on patents for its ulcer drug Losec, analysts said.

The E.U.  Commission charged that the company made misleading statements to country patent authorities to extend Losec patent certificates by as much as five years in those countries.

TD
AstraZeneca  denied the charges, which involved Losec sales from 1993 to 2000, and said it would appeal the fine in the courts.

"AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec," the company said.

At 1111 GMT,  AstraZeneca's  shares were down 14 pence, or 0.6%, to 2263 pence, while the broader market was also slightly down.

Analysts said the  fine wouldn't have a material impact on  AstraZeneca  earnings because the company disclosed the case in its annual reports and the alleged infraction began before the 1999 merger of Astra Pharmaceuticals AB and Zeneca PLC.
Additionally, the EUR60 million  fine is only a small fraction of the company's operating profits, said
Michael Leacock, a Nomura analyst.

AstraZeneca's  first-quarter 2005 net profit increased to $1.04 billion from $799 million. Operating profit, the number most closely watched by U.K. analysts, rose 38% to $1.45 billion, beating forecasts by more than 10%.
Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright said the Losec case was too old to be significant now. "Such a historical event, that it is really catching up with some distant history, and has no ongoing
implications whatsoever," he added. "So in the main, from an investment point of view, totally ignore
it."

The Commission decided not to assess the highest possible  fine because it was the first time a company had been charged under new rules, competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses, such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the  Commission alleges the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

"The extra profit made by  AstraZeneca  as a result of keeping these generic competitors off the market was well in excess of the amount of the  fine," Todd said.

Still, Todd said, the  fine sent an important signal. The  Commission has since passed new rules to prevent similar abuses.
Page 79 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But AstraZeneca  said the law was so confusing and complex that it took the  European Court of
Justice years to make the first ruling in the case.

"The court's judgment recognized the difficulty in interpretation of the SPC regulation and had no criticism of the company," the company said.

Once the world's best-selling drug, with $4.6 billion revenue in 2002, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world, leading to a flood of cheaper, generic versions.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca  should experience few repercussions from  European antitrust authorities' decision Wednesday to fine the company EUR60 million on patents for its ulcer drug Losec, analysts said.

The E.U.  Commission charged that the company made misleading statements to country patent authorities to extend Losec patent certificates by as much as five years in those countries.

"It was the first time that we have found a clear-cut abuse based on systematic misuse of regulatory and public procedures," said Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the E.U. Competition  Commission.

AstraZeneca  denied the charges, which involved Losec sales from 1993 to 2000, and said it would appeal the fine in the courts.

"AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to Patent Offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for Losec," the company said.

HD          EC fines AstraZeneca  E60m

LP
The European Commission has imposed a fine of E60m on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant
AstraZeneca  for illegally pushing rivals of its stomach ulcer medicine Losec out of the market.

The commission said the company had delayed or blocked market access for generic versions of Losec and had prevented parallel imports of Losec from 1993 to 2000. It said its actions constitute "serious abuses of its dominant market position" and violated competition.

TD
Losec was once the world's biggest selling drug, generating annual sales of more than USD6bn in
2000. The introduction of generics and an improved version of the product, launched by  AstraZeneca
in part to counteract the impact of generic versions, hit sales, which fell to USD1.95bn by 2004.

According to the  commission, the company obtained supplementary protection certificates for Losec; a product which in the 1990s became the world's best-selling prescription medicine. The certificates extend the basic patent protection for medicines by a maximum of five years to register time spent between filing the patent and eventual product marketing.

HD     EU Fines AstraZeneca  $73 Million  in Losec Case; Company Will Appeal

LP
The European Union (EU) has fined AstraZeneca  $73 million for artificially inflating the price of its ulcer treatment Losec and misusing the EU's patent system to delay entry of generic competition for the drug.

The European Commission's (EC) Competition Commission, which levied the  fine, determined that, between 1993 and 2000, AstraZeneca  infringed EC and European Economic Area (EEA) competition rules by blocking or delaying market access to generic versions of Losec (omeprazole) and preventing parallel imports of the drug. The actions helped  AstraZeneca  maintain high prices for Losec, which, at the time, was one of the world's most profitable drugs. Global sales of Losec totaled roughly $4.6 billion in
2002.

TD
The EC identified two major abuses in the Losec case:

* AstraZeneca  provided misleading information to several national patent offices in the EEA resulting in AstraZeneca  gaining extended patent protection for Losec through so-called supplementary protection certificates, the EC said. As a result of the misleading information, the patent offices had to rely on misleading information to consider whether the product was innovative.

* The drugmaker misused EU rules and procedures by selectively deregistering the market authorizations for Losec capsules in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with the intent of blocking or delaying entry by generic firms and parallel traders, the EC said. At the time, generic products could only be marketed and parallel imports licensed if there was an existing reference market authorization for the brand product. By deregistering Losec capsules,  AstraZeneca  effectively prevented generic firms from obtaining marketing authorizations for their products, the EC alleged. The EU has since altered its regulations to prevent firms from using AstraZeneca's  tactics.

"I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection so that companies can recoup their R & D expenditure and be rewarded for their innovative efforts," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said June 15. "However, it is not for a dominant company but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate. Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules."

AstraZeneca,  meanwhile, contends it acted in good faith and never provided misleading information to EU patent regulators. "AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately," said Tom McKillop, the company's chief executive. "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal positions will confirm that the  commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed."

The company said it would challenge the EC's decision in court "because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in Europe."

AstraZeneca  took particular exception with the EC's allegations that it deregistered Losec capsules for the specific purpose of blocking generic competitors. "Companies are entirely within their rights to withdraw products, to introduce new products and to deal with product registrations as may be necessary," the company said in a June 15 statement. "In this case, the new Losec tablet formulation, in fact, offers benefits over the previous formulation."

The company also accused the EC of failing to properly analyze the crucial issues of market dominance. "The commission's interpretation in this case could mean that any innovative product may be considered dominant retrospectively and hence subject to the 'special responsibility' of a dominant company,"

PHARMACEUTICAL giant Astrazeneca yesterday vowed to challenge a  euros60m ( pounds 40m) fine from the European Commission, which says it has illegally pushed rivals selling stomach ulcer medication out of the market. The EC said that Astra, whose Losec stomach ulcer medication was once the world's best selling drug, had delayed or blocked market access for generic versions of Losec, also known as Prilosec. Neelie Kroes of the competition  commission said that  Astrazeneca "kept Losec prices artificially high'' by preventing competition for its drug. "I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection so that companies can recoup their R&D expenditure and be rewarded for their innovative efforts,'' she said. "However, it is not for a dominant company, but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate.

TD
Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules.'' The EC claimed  Astrazeneca claimed supplementary protection certificates - which give extra patent protection for medicines - for Losec by concealing from patent offices the date on which the company first received marketing authorisation for Losec. It added that the
company had deregistered the capsule form of Losec in Denmark, Norway and Sweden so that generic drug companies could not sell capsule forms of Losec, which were no longer under patent protection and so it could sell Losec tablets. If a drug is not registered in a country, it cannot be sold by generic drug companies. Astrazeneca moved swiftly to deny the conclusions of the EC. Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive of Astrazeneca, said: "Astrazeneca has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately. We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal position will confirm that the Commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed.'' The EC started looking at allegations brought against Astrazeneca by a generic drug company in 1999. In 2000, the Commission exercised its powers to obtain documents from Astrazeneca. In July 2003, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections. Astrazeneca rejected the Commission's allegations in December 2003. In February 2004,
at Astrazeneca's request, the Commission held an oral hearing at which Astrazeneca provided its own explanation of events and restated its objections to the case. Astrazeneca shares fell 30 to pounds
22.46. Analysts said that a  fine of this size would not have a large effect on Astra.

HD         AstraZeneca  to fight Euros 60m fine - ANTITRUST LAWS. BY        By TOBIAS BUCK and ANDREW JACK

AstraZeneca,  the Anglo-Swedish drugs group, yesterday vowed to appeal against a  fine of Euros 60m (Dollars 73m) for violating  European Union antitrust laws by abusing the patent system and preventing rival products from entering the market.

The ruling, the first in which the  European Commission targeted such an abuse, is likely to serve as a blueprint for future cases, especially in the pharmaceuticals industry.

TD
It underlines the  Commission's determination to crack down on companies that seek to manipulate the patent regime in order to prevent competition from generic drugmakers.

The Commission conceded that its ruling broke new legal ground, and said that the novelty of the charges had resulted in a reduction of the  fine.
The regulator can in theory impose  fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover - or about  Euros
214m in AstraZeneca's  case.

AstraZeneca  said the ruling would have an "important negative impact" on innovative companies in
Europe. Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive, said the case was "fundamentally flawed".

The Commission ruled that  AstraZeneca  had illegally been granted extended patent protection for Losec, its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug, after providing wrong information to several national patent offices.

It also found against the group for de-registering Losec's capsule formulation from several patent offices, after switching to a tablet version. This meant the capsules no longer had market authorisation, which prevented generic producers from entering the market with rival products.

Brussels-based competition lawyers said the ruling could mark the advent of a more steely approach towards the  European drugs industry.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, defended the ruling: "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate, and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules. By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

HD                 Drug giant to appeal against £40million fine

LP
Drugs giant AstraZeneca  was fined 60million euros (£40million) yesterday for blocking competition to its ulcer drug, Losec.
The European Commission, which conducted a sixyear investigation, ruled that the
Anglo-Swedish multinational had abused its dominant market position and misused the patent
system to protect Losec between 1993 and 2000.

TD
Abuse of a dominant market position can, in theory, trigger a  fine of up to 10 per cent of annual turnover.
But a Commission spokesman said the fine imposed is far less than the excess profits the
Anglo-Swedish firm had made from its illegal behaviour.

Europe's third largest drugmaker said the proceedings brought against it were "legally and factually flawed" and that it would appeal against the  fine in the European courts.

Losec, originally developed by Swedish legacy company Astra AB, was once the world's top selling drug although it now faces copycat competitors.

The EC found that Astra, , which has a factory in the West, hid from patent authorities the correct date of first marketing Losec, allowing the firm to extend its period of patent protection.

The EC said Astra also switched Losec to a tablet from a capsule and asked patent offices to deregister the capsule in a move to stop parallel traders - who ship drugs between EU markets - from selling the capsule.

Commenting on the 60million  euro penalty,  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said: "The point of the  Commission imposing a fine is not necessarily to deprive the company of all the profits it has made for abusing its position.

"The point is to send a signal - I think 60million  euros is quite a powerful signal." However, City analysts believe the  fine will have only a limited financial impact on  AstraZeneca,  which generated pre-tax profits of 4.9billion (£2.69billion) in 2004.

Michael Leacock of investment bank Nomura said: "We see modest impact on the stock given that this issue arose from Astra's practices in the previous decade and does not have any ongoing implications for the business."

News of the  fine follows heavy US criticism of Crestor, Astra's anti-cholesterol treatment, whose active ingredient is made in Avonmouth.

AstraZeneca  shares finished at £22.46, down 30p or 1.32 per cent.

HD             AstraZeneca fined pounds  40m for blocking drug copies

AstraZeneca,  Britain's second-biggest drug maker, was  fined euros 60m (pounds 40m) by competition regulators yesterday for misleading government agencies and trying to block the sale of copies of its ulcer drug Losec.

The European commission accused the firm of "serious abuses of its dominant market position" following a six-year investigation but it admitted that the anti-competitive behaviour was far more profitable than the amount the firm was  fined.

TD
In the late 1990s, sales of Losec - also known as the "purple pill" - were worth $6bn (pounds 3.3bn) a year.

The firm stood to lose more than a third of its revenue as the expiry of the drug's patent approached. When a drug goes off-patent and competition is introduced, the inventor's sales can fall by as much as 70% in a matter of weeks.
The company said it would appeal against the decision.

The EC said that  AstraZeneca  had made "misleading" applications to patent offices that gave the firm longer patent protection and exclusive rights.

It also said  AstraZeneca  had "misused" rules set by Scandinavian health regulators to block the launch of generic copies of the drug. The EC said that  AstraZeneca  had been "misusing the patent system".

However, it admitted that the profits  AstraZeneca  made from its illegal practices were "well in excess" of the  euros 60m fine. Brussels officials said: "The  fine is not necessarily to deprive the company of the profits it had made but to send a signal, and we think  euros 60m is quite a powerful signal."

It is understood that the penalty was made relatively lenient because of recent  European court of justice rulings. Under EU rules on abuse of market dominance, the company could have been  fined up to 10% of its turnover - last year's turnover was roughly $21bn (pounds 11.5bn).

Yesterday the court of first instance,  Europe's second-highest court, reduced fines for a cartel in graphite electrodes in the 1990s, cutting the penalty on SGL Carbon from euros 27.8m to euros
18.5m and that on Ihntech EDM from  euros 980,000 to  euros 420,000.

AstraZeneca  defended its conduct, saying it acted in good faith when applying to  European patent offices. It also said that as there were other ulcer treatments on the market, it could not be considered a "dominant" provider.

"AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately," the firm said in a statement. It said it would appeal "because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in  Europe".

AstraZeneca's  newer ulcer treatment, Nexium, is also controversial. The firm is being sued by US healthcare payers who claim that although the drug is marketed as being superior to Losec and is substantially more expensive, it is in fact no better.

AstraZeneca  can often get defensive when challenged, and yesterday's reaction to a  euros 60m fine for anti-competitive behaviour was no exception. The  European commission ruled that the firm behaved unfairly trying to delay generic competition to its best-selling ulcer drug Losec.  AstraZeneca denies all charges, arguing that branded drug companies such as itself cannot abuse a market position when there are other remedies available. In the case of Losec, there were several competitors, including Zantac and Zoton.

Yet the very concept of "competition" in branded drugs is a warped affair.  European pharmaceutical regulators allow prices that are well above the cost of manufacturing so firms can recoup the substantial cost of research and development. When the drug goes off patent, generic drug firms can come in and compete, and the price paid by state health services plummets.

TD
So a patent is a mini-monopoly in effect, one that can prove so lucrative that drug firms fight tooth and nail to retain it. In doing so, firms can overstep the mark in terms of legality and fairness, which is why we need regulators in the first place. AZ has been judged guilty. Perhaps it should look at itself rather than criticising others.

PartyGaming buzz masks hard reality

'In many countries, including the United States, the group's activities are considered to be illegal by relevant authorities." This admission yesterday by PartyGaming surely ranks as a first for a business trying to float on the London market and enter the FTSE 100 index.

TD
The company's defence of its legality rests largely on a 2002 federal case involving Mastercard in which the US Wire Act was held to apply solely to bets on sport.

However, as yesterday's prospectus also says: "Other US courts are not prevented from taking an alternate view" and "there is a significant risk that criminal or civil judgments may be sought against the group or the directors." Top marks for disclosure but would you buy shares in it at a price equivalent to
14 times last year's sales? Such a valuation takes us back to the days of dotcom madness and there is a fair argument that online poker is a similar investment bubble.

Yes, the websites are generating a ton of cash, but look how hard they have to work to get it; page 98 of the prospectus reveals that 70% of real-money players who signed up at Party Poker a year ago are no longer active.

Such a high rate of churn would murder most businesses (BSkyB, for example, keeps its churn at 10%) and it hints at trouble to come. Poker is a game of skill and only 20% of online players make money; another 20% break even and the remaining 60% lose.

It rather looks as if the biggest proportion of newcomers stop playing poker once they realise they're no good at it.

That fact is being masked at the moment by the sheer weight of new players but what happens when the pool is exhausted? It's a safe bet that the websites' fat operating margins will come crashing down as they compete to retain the loyalty of the hard core.

One has to wonder why British pension funds - the guardians of all our retirements - seem ready to invest in a company facing such legal uncertainties at such an astronomic valuation.

It's not as if PartyGaming needs the cash. Instead, roughly pounds 860m will go straight into the pockets of the four main shareholders.

Three of them - including the former porn princess Ruth Parasol and her husband Russ DeLeon - will retain the right to appoint a director to the board but refuse to make themselves available to the press.

Such is the current poker frenzy that the float will probably succeed but, in the long term, PartyGaming is an investment accident waiting to happen.
As you were

After the excitement engendered by the twin political productions of the French and Dutch referendums we are back to a diet of  euro-economic repeats. Yesterday, Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the

Page 94 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
eurozone finance ministers and Luxembourg's prime minister, said he and his colleagues should be more forceful in expressing their views to the  European Central Bank.

Mr Juncker then rather ignored his own advice by declining to tell a committee of MEPs whether that meant he was calling for a cut in interest rates - but the markets took the view that was what he meant.

By coincidence, as Mr Juncker was laying down the law to the  European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, the ECB's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was setting out his views in Le Monde. His bank, he said, could best serve the single currency zone by sticking to its mandate to maintain price stability; rates were surely low enough to encourage business to invest and it was up to the politicians to enact the structural reforms that were needed to improve the workings of  Europe's economy.

It is a stance which reflects that of Mr Trichet's predecessor Wim Duisenberg. Mr Juncker's remarks (and the unspoken demand for lower rates) reflect sentiments harboured in many a finance ministry almost from the day the ECB opened its doors. Plus ca change. . .

ASTRAZENECA vowed to appeal against a  European Commission judgment that it illegally tried to keep low-cost drugmakers from launching a cheap version of Losec, once the world's
biggest-selling medicine.

Europe's competition regulator  fined the Anglo-Swedish drugs group €60m yesterday after ruling that it had violated competition rules by abusing its dominance of the market.

TD
In particular, antitrust officials charged that the company had illegally tried to extend the patent protection on Losec, a stomach ulcer medicine, and that it had also tried to stop parallel importers from profiting from the trade in the drug.

The ruling, which comes after a six-year investigation, marks the first time that the  European        Commission has sought to apply Article 82 of the  European Community Treaty to the pharmaceuticals sector.
The article bars companies from abusing their dominance to keep rivals out of the market.

HD        Brussels fines AstraZeneca  EUR60m for manipulation of patent rights

LP
AstraZeneca,  the UK"s No 2 drug maker, has been  fined EUR60m (£40m) for misleading and manipulating European governments to prolong patent protection for its best-selling drug.

The European Commission handed down the penalty yesterday, accusing Astra of giving false information to patent offices to try to hold off the arrival of copycat competitors to Losec, its ulcer pill, at the end of the Nineties.

TD
The company said it would appeal and patent lawyers said the Commission"s ruling would set a precedent for other investigations into anti-competitive behaviour. The fine is the culmination of a six-year investigation by the  Commission, which raided Astra"s offices in 2000.

Astra hid the correct date of Losec"s first marketing approval from patent offices, allowing it to claim an extra period of protection, the  Commission found. The company also switched Losec from capsule to tablet form and asked regulators in Sweden, Denmark and Norway to withdraw authorisation for the capsules. That blocked copycat, or generic, competitors who had based their approval on the capsules, and stopped imports from lower- cost countries, according to the  Commission"s ruling.

Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, said: "Healthcare systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down and patients benefit from lower prices. By preventing generic competition  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

Astra said it acted in good faith and did not make misleading statements to patent offices. Indeed, the issues were so complex that they ultimately had to be decided in the  European Court of Justice after several years of argument, the company said.

Sir Tom McKillop, the chief executive, predicted a Court of Appeal would find the  Commission"s analysis to be "fundamentally flawed". He said: "AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately."

The Commission is able to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their turnover in competition cases, but said yesterday the EUR60m fine was significantly lower than the extra profits Astra made by holding generics companies at bay in Europe. It said it kept the  fine to a minimum because the ruling broke
new legal ground as was meant mainly as a "signal" to other pharmaceuticals companies.

The ruling is the first to take a  European competition inquiry into a company"s dealings with patent offices and drug regulators.

Marie Manley, at the law firm Bristows, said it could have wide implications. "In applying competition provisions in this way, the  Commission"s actions may result in undue interference with the commercial freedom enjoyed by pharmaceutical companies in navigating the complex regulatory framework."

Astra also argued that the ruling could stifle innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector, but the Commission countered that regulatory abuses of the kind it had found at Astra would discourage innovation.

HD           EU Officials Fine AstraZeneca  For Hampering  Generic Rivals

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust authorities  fined British pharmaceuticals company  AstraZeneca PLC 60 million euros ($72.2 million), saying the company artificially propped up prices for ulcer drug Losec, preventing generic competition.

The European Commission said that from 1993 to 2000  AstraZeneca  infringed competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec. The  European Union's executive arm said the company attempted to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsule to tablet form and prevented importers and generic makers from buying the original capsule formula.

TD
Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses, such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the  commission alleged the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

AstraZeneca  rejected the  commission's charges and said it would appeal. "AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to patent offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec," the company said.

Analysts said the  fine wouldn't have a material impact on  AstraZeneca's  earnings. The 60 million euros fine represents only a fraction of the company's operating profits, said Michael Leacock, a Nomura analyst.  AstraZeneca's  first-quarter operating profit was $1.45 billion.

Once the world's best-selling drug, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world. Global annual sales of Losec in 2002 totaled $4.6 billion, about a quarter of  AstraZeneca's  total revenue that year.

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the group decided not to levy the highest possible  fine
because it was the first time a company had been charged under new rules on patent extensions.

He said the commission doesn't aim to deny  AstraZeneca  the profit derived from the alleged abuse, but to send a signal that the  commission stands ready to intervene in patent issues. "I think 60 million euros is quite a powerful signal," Mr. Todd said.

ASTRAZENECA TO CONTEST 60 MILLION  EURO EU FINE

TD
Anglo-Swedish Pharmaceuticals giant  AstraZeneca  has vowed to appeal against a  European                  Commission judgement that it illegally tried to keep low-cost drug manufacturers from launching a cheap version of stomach ulcer medicine Losec. The ruling, after a six-year investigation, said  AstraZeneca violated competition rules by abusing its dominance of the market. The company denied allegations it misled regulators to gain longer patent protection on the drug, once the world's biggest-selling medicine, and insisted it would pursue the case as far as the  European Court of Justice.
WOLVES TO APPOINT RBS FOR 500 MILLION POUND FINANCING

Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries is near to appointing Royal Bank of Scotland to supervise a 500 million pound securitisation, which comes after a clutch of acquisitions of smaller rivals, which were principally funded by debt. In the past 12 months, Wolverhampton has purchased Wizard Inns for 91 million pounds and Burtonwood for 168 million pounds. On Wednesday it announced that its 67 million pound offer for Jennings Brothers had received 90 percent acceptance. Analysts estimate that a securitisation could enable Wolverhampton to cut the average interest it is paying from about 6.75 to 6.25 percent, a savings of about 4 million pounds a year.
VODAFONE ACCUSED OF DESPARATION OVER JAPAN RELAUNCH

Mobile communications firm Vodafone was accused of making a desperate effort to reverse the fortunes of its Japanese business, after announcing a relaunch of its pre-pay service. Vodafone has had five successive months of falling customer numbers and has the largest proportion of pre-pay customers on its books in Japan. The firm said on Wednesday it would launch an array of new pre-pay handsets, targeted
at different age groups, later this year. However, analysts expressed doubt the initiative would win over the notoriously fickle Japanese market, pointing out competitors such as DoCoMo had already decided the market had limited potential.

INVENSYS DIRECTORS' WAGES RISE BY 3 MILLION POUNDS

According to its annual report, ailing engineering firm Invensys has seen the wage bill for its directors rise from 1.7 million pounds in 2004 to 4.7 million pounds this year. Chief executive Rick Haythornwaite, due to retire in July, received a total package of 1.45 million pounds, compared to last year's sum of 989,000 pounds. New chief executive designate Ulf Henriksson was awarded a total of 2.18 million pounds. The share price of the firm has fallen to 11.25 pence at the close of trade on Wednesday from 250 pence this time last year.

OIL VETERANS CALLED IN TO RESCUE REGAL

A group of four former Amerada Hess executives has now taken over the reins at troubled oil company Regal Petroleum . Aim-listed Regal ran into trouble after it transpired that a key well in its Greek oil field was "non-commercial", prompting the resignation of chief Frank Timis. Sir Peter Heap has been appointed as interim non-executive chairman, with Richard Hardman becoming exploration director. Other
ex-Amerada appointments include new chief executive Rex Gaisford and finance director Roger Philips.

BT MAKES GRAB FOR MOBILE USERS

Telecommunications giants BT Group and Motorola have joined forces to launch the world's first phone service that works both as a mobile and a traditional fixed-line telephone. The firm said its Fusion service, which includes a free Motorola handset that can place calls over BT's fixed-line network, would generate the lion's share of an expected 1 billion pounds of revenue for the company within five years and anticipates "millions" of customers will sign up. BT said the service would make use of cheaper fixed-line tariffs and offer higher quality connections and coverage than mobiles, when used indoors.
JOHNSTON PRESS WARNS OF JOB ADVERTISING SLOWDOWN

Regional newspaper publisher Johnston Press has taken a hit from a weakening in recruitment advertising, which indicates employers are becoming less confident about their prospects. Johnston issued a pre-close trading statement on Wednesday, before it releases its interim results for the six months to the end of June later this month. The statement said that after advertising had grown by 2.6 percent in the first two months of the year, the trading environment had turned bearish, with growth to the end of April falling to 1.4 percent.
PARTYGAMING PRICE NEEDS TO GO EVEN LOWER, SAYS CITY

Online poker group PartyGaming, which is set to join the FTSE 100 this month, will have to lower its 4.8 billion pound float price even further, according to spread betting analysts and City sources. Firms like Cantor Index and IG Index believe that investors will not support the float at 127 pence per share, the top end of the range published on Wednesday by the Gibraltar-based gaming firm and Cantor thinks PartyGaming will not be able to sell shares at more than 116 pence, with IG putting a 123 pence top price on them. The price range announced on Wednesday by PartyGaming was a large reduction from the 5.5 billion pound valuation previously placed on the company.
BULGARIAN PROPERTY GROUP ORCHID TO FLOWER ON AIM

On Wednesday, Orchid Developments became the latest eastern  European firm to announce its intentions to float on the Alternative Investment Market. The firm, which invests in both commercial and residential property as well as operating hotels in Bulgaria, plans to raise 20 million  euros from the IPO, which it intends to use on financing existing products and to provide some working capital. Orchid has a wide-ranging property portfolio in Bulgaria, worth about 47 million  euros. Fellow eastern  European company Bulgarian Property Development floated on Aim in January and many Russian firms have also expressed a wish to float on Aim, with more than 40 Russian companies having attended a London Stock Exchange Roadshow in 2004. Many of those who attended are expected to list before the end of this year.

SUNDAY TIMES SETTLES BIN LADEN LIBEL

The Sunday Times has settled a libel action with a Saudi Arabian businessman who, it was alleged, had links with Osama bin Laden. Yousef Jameel, whose companies include the British car dealer Hartwell, agreed to withdraw the libel suit, after agreeing to settle on undisclosed terms. Jameel's counsel, James Price QC, representing him at the High Court in London, told Mr Justice Gray that the June 2003 article was headed, "Car tycoon 'linked' to Bin Laden". Following the settlement, Price said, "The Sunday Times accepts Mr Jameel's assurances that he has never, financially or otherwise, supported Osama bin Laden or al Qaida".

HD        EC fines drugs giant for abusing  position

DRUGS giant  AstraZeneca  was fined more than £40m yesterday for misusing its dominant position to block rival medicines entering the market.

The European Commission said the pharmaceutical firm"s actions discouraged rival groups from undertaking research and kept medicine prices artificially high.

TD
AstraZeneca,  which employs more than 6,500 people in Cheshire, was investigated over the steps it took to protect its ulcer drug, Losec.

Publishing her findings yesterday, the EC competition commissioner said the company abused its position by giving misleading information to a number of national patent offices and misusing rules and procedures applied by national medicines agencies which issue market authorisations.
Losec was once the world"s top-selling drug, but now faces copycat competition in major markets.

The enquiry found that from1993-2000, the Anglo-Swedish firm had breached EU competition rules by "blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec."

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fine amounts to far less than the potential benefit to the company of seven years of "serious abuses" of its strong market position.

AstraZeneca,  which is Europe"s third largest drug-maker, said it did not accept the EC"s decision and would appeal against the fine.

"Indeed this matter was so unclear that it was ultimately decided by the  European Court of Justice after several years of legal argument," the firm said.

Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive, added: "AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately.
"We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal position will confirm that the
Commission"s analysis is fundamentally flawed."

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection for their innovative efforts. However, it is not for a dominant company but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate."

She added: "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules.

"Health care systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices.

DRUGS manufacturer  AstraZeneca  was yesterday fined more than £40m, after it tried to block rivals from marketing a medicine similar to one of its own products.

The Competition  Commission found that the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group had actively stopped routes to market for a drug similar to its ulcer medication, Losec.

TD
The commission's inquiry found that, from 1993 until 2000,  AstraZeneca  breached EU competition rules
"by blocking or delaying the market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports
of Losec".

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Health care systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices.
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fine amounted to far less than the potential benefit to the company of seven years of serious abuses of its dominant market position.
Losec pioneered a new generation of medicines to treat stomach ulcers and other acid-related ailments. The drug initially received patent protection in  Europe in 1979 - and for a time Losec was the world's
best-selling popular medicine.

AstraZeneca  said it did not accept the EC's decision and would appeal against the  fine.

HD      FIRST CHOICE BASKS IN THE WARMTH OF BROKERS' PRAISE. BY       by MICKEY CLARK

TOUR operator First Choice certainly grabbed the imagination of City traders and investors with its interim results this week.

It recorded a pre-tax loss of £34 million during the six months that cover the traditionally quieter winter period but chief executive Peter Long was brimming with confidence about prospects for the rest of the year.

TD
He said summer trading was strong across all sectors with the group benefiting from the switch by holidaymakers from a fortnight on the Costa Brava to destinations such as Mexico, the Dominican Republic and North Africa. Next year, First Choice plans to offer Brazil for the first time.

The cost of two weeks in Spain has risen sharply in recent years and has eaten into margins - long-haul flights are more cost-effective and boost margins.

The benefits have not been lost on City brokers, who have been rushing to evaluate First Choice's prospects. ABN Amro has repeated its buy rating and lifted its target from 200p to 215p. It says: 'A remixed business is delivering growth, cash and consistency. Even the harshest bears should give credit where it is due.'

UBS has raised its pre-tax profit forecast for the full year by £5 million to £115 million. It retains a neutral rating and 170p target, encouraged by current trading. Rival Merrill Lynch has raised its earnings per share forecast by 3.5% to 12.8p this year, an increase of 20%. But it remains neutral on the shares, pointing out they are close to historic highs.

US broker Smith Barney has repeated its sell recommendation on Vodafone after a meeting with the company. But the mobile phone giant is favoured by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.

A principal trade went through in 26.62 million Rentokil Initial shares at 150p. Credit Suisse First Boston placed 10 million shares in BAE Systems at around 278p.

AstraZeneca  has been hit with a e60 million (£39.9 million) EU fine over market misuse surrounding its blockbuster stomach ulcer drug Losec. AZ was censured by the European Commission anti-trust authorities for illegally trying to prolong Losec's patent protection. It follows a six-year probe into allegations that the company misused national patent systems. But Seymour Pierce has repeated its buy recommendation, saying the penalty does not seriously harm its prospects. AZ plans to appeal.

Housebuilders have enjoyed a good run but broker Numis thinks it may be coming to an end. It has downgraded Bovis, Persimmon, Redrow, and Taylor Woodrow from hold to reduce. Wilson Bowden has also been cut from add to hold. Numis says house prices will continue to fall, and that will put builders under further pressure.

It was the first day on AIM for Granby Oil & Gas following a placing by broker Peel Hunt at 84p. The shares settled at 981/2p. Also making a debut on that market was Empire Online, which provides marketing services for online gaming, following a placing by Numis at 175p. The price touched 190p then settled at 1771/2p. AIM-listed software and services group Civica fell 101/2p to 224p after a placing of
4.7 million new shares at 210p.

Overnight in New York, investors managed to cling on to early gains and the Dow ended a lacklustre session up 18.80 at 10,566.37.
In the Far East today, trading lacked direction. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 closed just 0.5 points higher at
11,416.38, but in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index was down 62.81 at 13,851.49 by the end of the
morning.

DRUGS giant  AstraZeneca  plans to appeal against a £40m  fine for blocking rivals from marketing a drug similar to its stomach ulcer medication Losec.

The fine, imposed yesterday by the EC, amounts to far less than the potential benefit to the company of seven years of "serious abuses" of its dominant market position, said  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd.

Commission powers allow for fines against big companies guilty of impeding fair competition.

An inquiry found that from 1993 until 2000  AstraZeneca  breached EU competition rules "by blocking or delaying the market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec".

The Anglo-Swedish company, which employs more than 5,000 people at research and development and manufacturing sites at Alderley Edge and Macclesfield, said the decision by European competition
chiefs was "fundamentally flawed". In a statement the company said: "In AstraZeneca's  view, the analysis by the Commission in reaching this decision does not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by the company with regard to the use of Losec as just one of the treatments available for treatment of stomach acid disorders.

"AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to patent offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates."  AstraZeneca  said it was a technically and legally complex case.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Health care systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices.

"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high. Moreover, competition from generic products after a patent has expired itself encourages innovation in pharmaceuticals."

EUROPEAN antitrust authorities yesterday slapped AstraZeneca  with a E60 million (GBP 40m)  fine for blocking generic competition to a key ulcer drug, Losec. The European Commission, after a six-year investigation into the company's actions, said  AstraZeneca  had abused its dominant market position
and misused the patent system to protect Losec between 1993 and 2000.

But the amount of the fine was far less than the excess profits  AstraZeneca  had made from its illegal behaviour. The commission claimed AstraZeneca  used administrative procedures to abuse its position of dominance, but Europe's third-largest drugmaker claimed that the  commission's approach was "legally and factually flawed" and that it would appeal against the  fine.

TD
Losec, originally developed by Swedish legacy company Astra AB, was once the world's top-selling drug, although it now faces copycat competitors in major markets.
The European Commission started investigating steps taken by Astra to protect Losec's share in
1999, following a complaint from a generic drug manufacturer, and  AstraZeneca  was formally notified
of the objections in July 2003.

The EU's executive found the company hid from patent authorities the correct date of first marketing authorisation of Losec, thereby allowing it to claim an extension of the period for which patent protection is granted.

"Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules," said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."

ECONOMICS

* Claimant count unemployment rose for the fourth consecutive month in May, by 13,200. But the figures were inflated by 6,000 layoffs at MG Rover's plant in Coventry. The Government's preferred gauge, the Labour Force Survey, showed a fall of 15,000 in the numbers out of work in the February to April period, leaving the unemployment rate on this basis unchanged at 4.7 per cent.

* Headline growth in average earnings edged higher in April, with the three monthly average rate of increase rising to 4.6 per cent, from 4.5 per cent previously.
Wage pressures were greatest in private sector services, where the headline rate of increase rose to
5.2 per cent in April, from 5 per cent in March. But this was boosted by substantial City bonuses,
particularly in the financial services industry.

* The Office for National Statistics reported that in 2003-04 UK residents owned 231,000 second homes abroad, from 104,000 in 1994-95. The data also suggested that the value of these properties has more than doubled to about Pounds 23 million in the five years to 2003-04.

* The Bank of England announced that 325,000 counterfeit bank notes were taken out of circulation last year, representing 0.017 per cent of the stock of notes. It also announced that Pounds 29 billion of its customers' assets are accounted for by holdings of gold.

* Economic productivity was 1.7 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of last year, while manufacturing productivity rose by 2.3 per cent in the three months to the end of April -the worst performance since October 2002.
* Net inflows of capital into the United States in April rose to $47.4 billion (Pounds 26 billion), from
$40.6 billion in March, but was not enough to cover the US trade deficit for a second month in a row.
The US trade gap in April totalled $57 billion.

* US consumer prices edged lower in May for the first time in ten months. The US consumer prices index dropped by 0.1 per cent and the annual rate of US inflation dropped to 2.8 per cent, from 3.5 per cent in April.

* US industrial production rose twice as fast as expected in May, increasing by 0.4 per cent. Within this total, manufacturing output rose by 0.6 per cent.

* Peter Mandelson, the  European Trade Commissioner, called on China to open its markets to foreign imports and to play a more active role in international negotiations to liberalise global trade.
BANKING & FINANCE DOWN 0.6%



Page 112 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* JP Morgan, the US banking group, agreed to pay investors in Enron, the failed American energy group, $2.2 billion (Pounds 1.2 billion) to settle a lawsuit which claims that the bank had helped to defraud them. The agreement came just a week after Citigroup reached a similar $2 billion settlement.

* A trader with National Australia Bank has been jailed for more than two years for his role in a A$360 million (Pounds 150 million) foreign exchange currency scandal that rocked one of the country's biggest banks.

* Canaccord Capital, the Canadian stockbroker which has a slice of the City's mining and oil and gas market, has suffered departures of key staff that could derail crucial corporate mandates.

* Bear Stearns, the US brokerage, reported a 9 per cent rise in second-quarter revenues to $1.9 billion, helped by its equities business. Profits rose to $365.1 million, from $347.8 million last year.

* The cost to the Bank of England of fighting the Bank of Credit and Commerce International lawsuit is set to hit Pounds 100 million by next year. The case, which opened at the High Court in January 2004, has cost the Bank Pounds 19.5 million in legal fees in the year to February 2005.

* Lazard, the investment banking partnership which floated last month, said that Gerardo Braggiotti, the head of its Italian division, has offered his resignation.
* Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, saw the value of his pension pot rise by Pounds
581,000 to Pounds 2.7 million last year after the Bank corrected its underestimation of how long he is
likely to live.
CONSTRUCTION & PROPERTY UP 6.1%

HD         AstraZeneca  to contest  Euro 60m EU fine

AstraZeneca  vowed to appeal against a  European Commission judgment that it illegally tried to keep low-cost drug makers from launching a cheap version of Losec, once the world's biggest-selling medicine.

Europe's competition regulator  fined the Anglo-Swedish drugs group  Euro 60 million (Pounds 40 million) yesterday after ruling that it had violated competition rules by abusing its dominance of the market.

TD
In particular, antitrust officials charged that the company had illegally tried to extend the patent protection on Losec, a stomach ulcer medicine, and that it had also tried to stop parallel importers from profiting from the trade in the drug.

The ruling, which comes after a six-year investigation, marks the first time that the  European                 Commission has sought to apply Article 82 of the  European Community Treaty to the pharmaceuticals sector. The article bars companies from abusing their dominance to keep rivals out of the market.

AstraZeneca  reacted angrily to the decision, insisting that it would pursue the case as far as the European Court of Justice, the highest court in the EU, if necessary. The company said that the Commission's judgment was "legally and factually flawed" and that  AstraZeneca's  actions had been misconstrued. The appeal is likely to focus on the regulator's decision to bring the case under Article 82.

AstraZeneca  will argue that, in order to prove abuse of market dominance, the  Commission must first prove that the company had a stanglehold on the market for stomach ulcer drugs. The company's lawyers will argue that other treatments were widely available at the time of the  Commission's investigation, including Zantac, a rival medicine developed by GlaxoSmithKline.

The company denied allegations that it had misled regulators to gain longer patent protection on Losec. Drug companies may apply for an extension to patents for up to five years by obtaining so-called supplementary protection certificates (SPCs).

At the time that  AstraZeneca  was seeking an extension for Losec, it was unclear whether the extension would apply from the date on which the drug was first approved by regulators, or the date on which a pricing structure was agreed, which can be up to two years later.

AstraZeneca  said it filed for SPCs on Losec in the belief that convention would settle for the latter date, although an EU judge eventually ruled that the earlier date should apply. In its appeal,  AstraZeneca  will claim that it was acting in good faith in using the later cut-off date and that its intentions had subsequently been misconstrued. The company also denied the charge that it tried to frustrate parallel trade in Losec by changing the treatment's formulation from a capsule to a tablet. It said the move to tablet form represented a significant improvement in the treatment.

Competition officials said that by withdrawing the capsule from the market, the company restricted the ability of generic competitors to offer a cheaper verison of the drug.

Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said the  fine would deter other drug makers from abusing the patent system. "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection is a serious infringement of EU competition rules," she said.

CITY AND BUSINESS EDITED BY STEPHEN KAHN

ANGLO-Swedish pharmaceuticals giant  AstraZeneca  was fined .60million (£40million) yesterday for illegally trying to delay copycat competition to its ulcer drug Losec.

TD
The European Commission said Zeneca's actions constituted "serious abuses" of its dominant market position.

It found the drugs group, led by Sir Tom McKillop, gave misleading information to national patent offices during the 1990s, resulting in it receiving extended patent protection for Losec.

"Misleading regulators is a disincentive to innovate and a serious infringement of EU rules, " said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. Zeneca asked regulators to withdraw authorisation for Losec in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, preventing copycat versions of the drug from being marketed there, said the EC.

Zeneca said it "fundamentally disagreed" with the EC's findings and would appeal. It said it acted in good faith in obtaining extended patent protection. The shares fell 30p to 2246p.

HD       AstraZeneca  to Challenge 60 mil. Euro Fine in EC Anti-Competitive Ruling

LP
UK-based AstraZeneca  has vowed to challenge a 60 million  euro (US$72.7 million)  fine from the European Commission (EC), which claims the pharma company broke EC anti-competition laws by preventing rivals selling generic versions of its stomach-ulcer drug Prilosec/Losec (omeprazole). Preventing generic competition resulted in Losec prices being kept artificially high, according to the EC. As detailed yesterday by Global Insight (see United Kingdom: 15 June 2005:  AstraZeneca  Faces EU Fines over Losec Patent Misuse),  AstraZeneca  was accused of misleading regulators to gain extended patent protection for Prilosec/Losec. Among other things, the company is accused of obtaining supplementary protection certificates for the stomach ulcer drug by hiding the date on which the company received marketing authorisation for the drug from patent offices in several  European countries.

TD
AstraZeneca  swiftly denied the EC's conclusions, with CEO Sir Tom McKillop claiming that the company had acted in good faith. AstraZeneca  is to appeal against the  fine and what it considers a fundamentally flawed analysis by the Commission, which it says failed to to take into account substantial evidence submitted by the company.

Significance: The size of the imposed sanction is only a small fraction of the company's finances in light that AstraZeneca's  first-quarter 2005 operating profit rose 38% to US$1.45 billion. The  fine is also negligible compared with the profits the company generated from Losec sales by preventing the entry of generic competitors onto the market. Nevertheless, it is a powerful signal from the EC that despite understanding that future drug innovation and R&D can be affected by the entry of generic versions into the market, it is not up to pharma companies such as  AstraZeneca  to dictate the extent of patent protection.

HD         £40m fine over ulcer drug abuses

Anglo - swedish pharmaceuticals giant  AstraZeneca  was fined more than £40m yesterday for blocking rivals from marketing a drug similar to the company"s ulcer medication Losec. The  fine amounts to far less than the potential benefit to the company of seven years of "serious abuses" of its dominant market position, said  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd.

Commission powers allow for fines against big companies guilty of impeding fair competition and an inquiry found that from 1993 until 2000,  AstraZeneca  breached EU competition rules "by blocking or delaying the market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec."

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection for their innovative efforts,

"However, it is not for a dominant company but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate."

She went on, "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules.

"Health care systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices.
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high."
Losec pioneered a new generation of medicines to treat stomach ulcers and other acid-related diseases
- so-called proton pump inhibitors.

The drug initially received patent protection in  Europe in 1979 - and for a time Losec was the world"s best-selling popular medicine.
The Commisison

said the company abused its position by giving misleading information to several national patent offices and misusing rules and procedures applied by national medicines agencies.

HD            AstraZeneca  to Pay 60 Million  Euros For Hindering Generic Rivals

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust authorities  fined British pharmaceuticals company  AstraZeneca PLC 60 million euros, saying the company artificially propped up prices for ulcer drug Losec, preventing generic competition.

The European Commission said that from 1993 to 2000  AstraZeneca  infringed competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec. The  European Union's executive arm also said the company attempted to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsule to tablet form and prevented importers and generic makers from
buying the original capsule formula.

TD
Usually, antitrust officials gather evidence of abuses, such as price manipulation or licensing restrictions. In  AstraZeneca's  case, the  commission alleged the company misled regulators during the patent-extension process.

AstraZeneca  rejected the  commission's charges and said it would appeal. "AstraZeneca  contends that it acted in good faith and did not make misleading misrepresentations to patent offices or courts to obtain supplementary protection certificates for Losec," the company said.

Analysts said the  fine wouldn't have a material impact on  AstraZeneca  earnings. The 60 million  euro fine represents only a small fraction of the company's operating profits, said Michael Leacock, a Nomura analyst.  AstraZeneca's  first-quarter operating profit was $1.45 billion (1.21 billion  euros).
Once the world's best-selling drug, Losec has lost patent protection in most areas of the world.

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said it decided not to levy the highest possible  fine because it was the first time a company had been charged under new rules on patent extensions. He said the commission doesn't aim to deny the company the profit derived from the alleged abuse, but to send a signal that the  commission stands ready to intervene in patent issues. "I think 60 million  euros is
quite a powerful signal," Mr. Todd said.
In London yesterday,  AstraZeneca  shares fell 1.3% to end at GBP 22.46 (33.73  euros) each.

Brussels, 15/06/2005 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday the  European Commission fined
Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca  €60 million for misusing the patent system and the procedures for
marketing pharmaceuticals to block or delay market entry for generic competitors to its ulcer drug Losec.
The competition spokesperson explained that from 1993 to 2000  AstraZeneca  infringed EC and EEA
competition rules by blocking or delaying market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing
parallel imports of Losec.  AstraZeneca  did this by: giving misleading information to several national
patent offices in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom;
misusing rules and procedures applied by the national medicines agencies which issue market
authorisations for medicines by selectively deregistering the market authorisations for Losec capsules in
Denmark, Norway and Sweden with the intent of blocking or delaying entry by generic firms and parallel
traders.

The spokesperson indicated that the Commission had taken into account the new aspects of the application of competition rules to amend the fine, whose amount, in effect appears to have no connection with the additional profits made by the company through these practices. In the 1990s, Losec was the prescription medicine with the highest sales in the world.

HD     EU's Barroso  suggests using antitrust fines to fund aid for Africa

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday suggested using hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) in fines slapped on companies that violate antitrust rules to fund an increase in EU aid to Africa.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday suggested using hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) in fines slapped on companies that violate antitrust rules to fund a doubling of EU aid to Africa.

TD
He proposed the idea while appealing to leaders of the  European Union's 25 nations to throw their weight behind plans for the bloc to double development aid to the world's poorest nations over the next 10 years.

EU regulators have hit leading companies with huge fines, including a record  euro497 million (US$600 million) penalty levied on Microsoft last year and euro60 million (US$72 million) imposed Wednesday on British pharmaceutical company  AstraZeneca.
"These  fines could go directly to aid funding," Barroso said.

His spokeswoman, Francoise Le Bail, said the idea was being studied by EU experts. "We have to see if it presents any legal problems," Le Bail said. She said the idea could be adopted "rather quickly" if cleared by the experts.

The issue could be sensitive since such  fines are currently plowed into the EU's coffers, enabling nations to reduce their contributions to bloc's budget -- the key issue at the summit.

Barroso appealed national leaders to look beyond their differences over the budget and the EU's stalled constitution plans to back a plan endorsed by European development ministers to take the EU's  euro46 billion (US$57 billion) annual development aid to over euro90 billion (US$111 billion) by 2015.

"I hope that here in Brussels ...  European leaders will confirm at the highest political level their determination to put the Union on track to double aid," Barroso said ahead of an EU summit.

He hopes a new drive to help the world's poor could rekindle public support for the EU following the rejection of the bloc's constitution plans by French and Dutch voters.

Barroso was joined by Belgian pop star Axelle Red in presenting an eight-floor high white banner hanging from the EU's headquarters building in support of a global campaign against poverty backed by leading music artists and movie stars.
Similar giant white banners are expected to be hung from other  European landmarks including the
Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and the Coliseum in Rome.

"This campaign ... is a reminder to EU leaders to remember the wider world as they grapple with internal issues," he said.


Page 126 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He urged European nations to take a lead on aid before next month's G-8 meeting of the world's economic powers in Scotland, where aid to the poor is expected to top the agenda.

EU leaders are expected to back the plan to double aid. However, Germany, Italy and Portugal have expressed reservations, citing their own economic problems.

Campaigning singer Axelle Red is among the stars to perform at the five-city Live 8 concerts next month to push governments to find a solution to African poverty.

"The leaders of  Europe have an opportunity today to get closer to their citizens by taking decisions of which they can be proud," she said. "Nine out of 10 people want more action against poverty."
The EU is already the world's biggest aid donor, but only four of its members -- Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands and Sweden -- currently meet a 1970 goal for developed nations to commit 0.7 percent of
their gross national income to development aid.

HD            AstraZeneca fined £40m for blocking drug rivals

Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group  AstraZeneca  was yesterday fined more than £40 million for blocking rivals from marketing a drug similar to the company"s ulcer medication Losec.

The European Commission said the fine, believed to be one of the highest ever imposed on a corporation, reflected the company"s "serious abuse" of its dominant market position over a period of seven years.

TD
But the penalty was far less than the potential benefit to the company, a spokesman added.

Commission powers allow for fines against big companies guilty of impeding fair competition and an inquiry found that from 1993 until 2000,  AstraZeneca  breached EU competition rules "by blocking or delaying the market access for generic versions of Losec and preventing parallel imports of Losec".

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection for their innovative efforts,

"However it is not for a dominant company but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate."

She went on: "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules.

"Health care systems throughout  Europe rely on generic drugs to keep costs down. Patients benefit from lower prices.
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept Losec prices artificially high.

"Moreover, competition from generic products after a patent has expired itself encourages innovation in pharmaceuticals."

The Commission said the company abused its position by giving misleading information to several national patent offices.

IT'S THE BUSINESS

ANGLO-SWEDISH pharmaceuticals giant  AstraZeneca  was fined £40 million yesterday for illegally trying to delay copycat competition to its ulcer drug Losec.

TD
The European Commission said AstraZeneca's  actions constituted "serious abuses" of its dominant market position. It found the drugs group gave misleading information to several national patent offices during the 1990s that resulted in it receiving extended patent protection for Losec.

AstraZeneca  asked regulators to withdraw authorisation for its Losec capsules in Denmark, Norway and
Sweden, preventing copycat versions being marketed there, said the EC.

AstraZeneca  said it "fundamentally disagreed" with the EC's findings and would appeal. The group said it acted in good faith over extended patent protection.
Losec used to be the world's biggest-selling drug.

AstraZeneca  has been fined by the European Commission for illegally extending the patent life of stomach ulcer drug, Prilosec. Officials fined the company E60m (GBP40m) after a six-year investigation into allegations that it illegally obtained a five-year patent extension.  AstraZeneca  is to appeal.

The fine relates to marketing practices in the 1990s, and is unlikely to hurt the shares. Of more concern are analysts' fears that new diabetes drug Galida, which reported Phase II data this week, is no better than Glaxo's drug, Avandia. High enough.

The European Union has fined Britain-based  AstraZeneca  about $73 million for "misleading regulators in order to delay competition to its Prilosec ulcer medicine, once the world's best-selling drug," Bloomberg/Philadelphia Inquirer reports. According to the  European Commission, AstraZeneca  gave "misleading information" -- including incorrect dates on its patent applications -- to patent offices to extend Prilosec's patent protection in seven countries between 1993 and 2000. In addition,  AstraZeneca  misused drug-authorization procedures, the  commission said (Rega/Sargent, Bloomberg/Philadelphia Inquirer,
6/16). The company also sought to extend the patent by switching the drug from capsule to tablet form and preventing importers and makers of generic drugs from purchasing the original capsule formula, the commission said (Park, Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal, 6/16).

TD
"By preventing generic competition,  AstraZeneca  kept (Prilosec) prices artificially high," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said on Thursday. The company said it will appeal the ruling. According to the Bloomberg/Inquirer, the case "marks the first time [European] regulators have  fined a drug maker for abusing registration procedures to keep a dominant market position in a type of treatment." Christoph Feddersen, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels, said, "This is a truly exceptional decision. There could be a lot more cases if the  commission looks at whether companies' registration policy is an abuse of dominance" (Bloomberg/Philadelphia Inquirer, 6/16). Analysts said the  fine would not have a material impact on AstraZeneca's  bottom line. The company posted operating profit of $1.45 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal year. EC spokesperson Jonathan Todd said the  commission decided not to levy the highest  fine because it was the first time a company had been charged under new rules on patent extensions. He said the fine sends a "powerful signal" that the  commission will intervene in patent cases (Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal, 6/16).

HD     PHARMACEUTICALS: ASTRAZENECA FINED EURO 60 MILLION FOR ABUSING ITS DOMINANT POSITION

LP
The European Commission has fined Anglo-Swedish group  AstraZeneca euro 60 million for misusing the patent system and the procedures for marketing pharmaceuticals to block or delay market entry for generic competitors to its ulcer drug Losec between 1993 and 2000. The decision, announced on June
15, closes proceedings launched in July 2004 in response to a complaint lodged in 1999 by two British generic drug makers.

The Commission accuses AstraZeneca  of giving misleading information to several national patent offices in the European Economic Area (EEA) enabling the company to extended patent protection for Losec through so-called supplementary protection certificates (SPCs). These certificates extend basic patent protection for drugs by a maximum of five years in order to take account of the period between the filing of a patent request and marketing authorisation for a patented product.

TD
Under the terms of EU law (Regulation 1768/92), products already on the market when the legislation entered into force - as is the case with Losec - are only eligible for additional protection if the initial marketing authorisation was granted within certain deadlines.  AstraZeneca  failed to reveal to national patent offices the correct date on which it received the original marketing authorisation for Losec, permitting it to secure additional protection for the drug in certain countries, a right it would not have enjoyed had patent offices been accurately informed. These practices concern Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Moreover, AstraZeneca  misused rules and procedures applied by the national medicines agencies which issue market authorisations for pharmaceuticals by selectively deregistering the market authorisations for Losec capsules in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with the intent of blocking or delaying entry by generic firms and parallel traders. At the time, generic products could only be marketed and parallel importers
only obtain import licences if there was an existing reference market authorisation for the original corresponding product (namely, Losec). AZ delayed the entry onto the market of generic version of Losec and prevented parallel imports of the drug in place of its Losec capsules (the original formula) in tablet form, demanding that certain national agencies cancel authorisations for the marketing of capsules.

The Commission emphasises that its decision does not prohibit  AstraZeneca's  dominant position on the proton pump inhibitor (a new generation of drugs used to treat stomach ulcers), market but the company's abuse of that position. Losec was originally granted patent protection in  Europe in 1979.
--

This is the first time the EU has acted against the abuse of a dominant position due to misuse of the regulatory procedures applicable to the sector. The  fine imposed by the Commission on AstraZeneca  is intended to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement.

HD      COMPETITION: COMMISSION CONSIDERS GIVING CARTEL FINES FOR DEVELOPMENT AID WC     477 words

The European Commission is considering using the money it receives from  fines imposed on companies found guilty of breaking competition rules to support the global campaign against poverty. Speaking at news conference on June 16 announcing the EU's support for the Global Call to Action Against Poverty campaign, Commission President José Manuel Barroso said that the Commission had already discussed the idea of using the fines to bolster its development efforts. The Commission's legal team is now assessing whether the move would be possible.

President Barroso said that the idea was one of several designed to find alternative sources of funding for development aid and that it had been debated at the  Commission meeting on June 15, the same day as pharmaceutical giant  AstraZeneca  was fined euro 60 million for abusing the patent system to delay the market entry of lower-priced generic drugs.

TD
"This is something new and concrete", he said. "We launched the debate yesterday at the  Commission, and I hope that the  Commission will be able to support the idea that these  fines - which amount to billions of euros - can be given directly to development aid."

A spokesperson confirmed that the  Commission had debated the issue, and that while there appeared to be no barrier to it from a budgetary point of view, it was not necessarily guaranteed.

"The Commission's legal service is looking into whether this would be possible. If it were, it would not necessarily need a formal decision, and as I understand it, it could be implemented rather quickly."

However, the spokesperson added that the  Commission's Legal Service was also assessing whether the EU executive could make such a decision on its own, or whether it would need to be approved by the European Parliament and the member states.

The European Union already donates  euro 46 billion in overseas development aid, and the  Commission has recently set ambitious new targets for increasing aid to 0.56% of member states' gross national product by 2010, which would see this sum increase to  euro 66 billion. The measures were expected to
be approved by EU leaders at the  European Council on June 16-17.
--

The euro 60 million imposed on AstraZeneca  was relatively low compared to some of the fines handed down by the Commission over the years. Microsoft holds the record for the biggest single fine - some euro 497.2 million - imposed in 2004 for abuse of dominant market position, while a group of vitamin producers, including BASF and Hoffman-La Roche, were fined a collective Euro 855 million for a
price-fixing cartel in 2001. And Volkswagen had picked up a euro 120 million fine back in 1998 for restricting sales of cars to Italy, but got it reduced to 90 million on appeal.

It plans to reward its customers for being good comparison shoppers, allowing them to claim the difference in price on items such as televisions, sofas and DVDs if they later find the same item elsewhere for less.
WEDNESDAY:

Concern over possible tax avoidance puts Deloitte & Touche, MG Rover's auditors, in the crosshairs for a potential investigation. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Mervyn King, 57, the Governor of the Bank of England, saw the value of his pension fund shoot up by Pounds 581,000 after the Bank corrected an error in its estimation of how long he is likely to live. The independence of PartyGaming's non-executive directors is called into question after revelations that they will receive big payments when it floats for Pounds 4.76 billion.

The European Commission has fined pharmaceuticals group  AstraZeneca  EUR 60 M for breaking European competition laws. However this fine is smaller than the 10% of turnover (which for AstraZeneca was $21.4 bn in 2004) the Commission has the right to demand. Meanwhile  AstraZeneca has announced plans to appeal against the division. The  fine relates to a case dating from 1999 brought by 2 generic drugs manufacturers. The  Commission decided that between 1993-200 AstrZeneca had abused pharmaceuticals patenting and marketing procedures in order to prevent or delay the market
launch of products likely to compete with its ulcer drug Losec. According to the  commission                     AstraZeneca provided national patent offices within  Europe with misleading information in order to
extend Losec's patent protection.

On 15 Jun 2005,  AstraZeneca  was fined EUR 60 M by the  European Commission at the conclusion of a case brought by two generic drug manufacturers in the UK. The company was found guilty of misusing the patent system and pharmaceutical marketing procedures to block or delay the entry of generic competition into the market dominated by its antiulcerial, Losec. Supplementary protection certificates were obtained in several countries in the European Economic Area by the submission of misleading information on Losec. This enabled AstraZeneca  to extent patent protection there for up to five years. Incorrect dates for the original marketing authorisation were given in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK, thus allowing supplementary protection to be granted. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the market authorizations for Losec capsules were deregistered by the company so that it could block or delay the entry of generic competing products.

An appeal is to be made by  AstraZeneca  against the EUR 60 M  fine levied on it by the  European           Commission which found it guilty of misusing patents and procedures for the authorisation of drugs in order to block or delay competition from generic versions of Losec, its antiulcerial. Previously, Losec was the leading drug worldwide in terms of sales. National patent offices were misled by the company over
1993-2000 which enabled it to obtain supplementary protection certificates, thus extending the patent protection for Losec. This resulting in artificially high prices for the drug.

HD         AstraZeneca  gets dose of Brussels law: Drugs companies are in race against ticking clock of patent expiry, writes Andrew Jack.

Some of Europe's leading pharmaceutical companies and their lawyers may have a sinking feeling in the days ahead as they await the written version of a surprising ruling from the  European Commission last week.

At stake is a pioneering foray by antitrust regulators into one of the EU's most obscurely and technically regulated industries.

TD
The case highlights the intense competition between branded drug companies and their generic rivals, and raises questions over  Europe's regulatory regime for medicines, and the special status of pharmaceutical products.

The Commission fined AstraZeneca,  the Anglo-Swedish group,  Euros 60m (Dollars 74m) arguing that it maintained a position of market dominance with Losec, its pioneering ulcer medicine, by deceiving European regulators in patent extension filings and by withdrawing an older formulation of the drug from some national markets.
"By interfering, the  Commission may have the effect of chilling innovation," warned a spokesman for
AstraZeneca,  which is vigorously appealing the judgment.
The saga dates back a decade, when  European legislation was introduced to mirror initiatives in the US
and Japan.

It granted pharmaceutical companies the right to extend their exclusivity, to compensate them for the lengthier period between initial patent filing and final marketing authorisation than exists in most other innovative industries.

The new law gave drugs companies the right to seek "supplementary protection certificates" of up to five years, allowing them a maximum of 15 years exclusivity before rivals can produce medicines based on the original patent.

AstraZeneca  made such requests to  European patent offices for Losec, interpreting the law as meaning it could seek a five-year extension from the date of approval from national health systems for prescription reimbursement - the moment when it began marketing the drug.

Under the European system, this reimbursement decision can sometimes come many months after a national drug regulator has technically approved a new drug as safe.

However, AstraZeneca's  interpretation was challenged and overturned in the German courts, where E Merck, owner of a generic drug manufacturer, was pushing for the Losec patent to expire as quickly as possible so that it could begin marketing an equivalent medicine of its own.



Page 144 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Later, AstraZeneca  took the decision in some markets to withdraw Losec in its original capsule form, replacing it with pellets it believed were easier for patients to absorb. The practice is widespread in the industry, and can allow a further extension of exclusivity when a new formulation is protected by a more recent patent.
However, the company's generic challengers claimed the effect was to stifle competition.

AstraZeneca  claims that its attempt to seek supplementary protection from the reimbursement date of Losec was a matter of interpretation of legislation that should rightly be judged in the courts, not as an anti-trust case.

It says antitrust regulators should not be involved, and that it did not have a "dominant position" because of the variety of competing gastro-intestinal drugs.

It is this final definition of dominance that causes broader nervousness in the industry. Given the intense fight between generics companies and their branded rivals over patent deadlines, the pressure on the Commission to consider other cases as antitrust matters is likely to grow.

"The use of dominant position in the pharmaceutical sector is ground-breaking," says Howard Cartlidge, a competition lawyer with Olswang in London.

"But to say the ruling will stifle innovation is over-egging the pudding. Dominance is a relatively unusual position, and even then you would only be judged if you acted abusively."

A more important concern for  European policymakers - and patients - might be why their medical systems remain so slow in granting reimbursement approval to innovative medicines once approved on health grounds as safe and effective.

SUMMARY

The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. The Hungarian judicial system operates under clearly specified guidelines. Even so, some reforms are still needed to harmonise Hungarian law with EU standards; the transparency of the legal system is inadequate; and delays in processing court cases are a major problem. As a result, contract disputes are
unlikely to be dealt with speedily. Regulatory disputes have arisen over the government's use of price caps in certain sectors. In particular, foreign pharmaceutical companies have complained in the past about their treatment at the hands of the government. The Socialists, who came to power in 2002, have been slow to address the wrongs of past administrations. More worryingly, the Socialist-led government has whittled away the powers of some nominally independent regulatory bodies in an effort to replace officials with individuals more loyal to the sitting government.
ANALYSIS
Judicial reform is delayed, keeping the courts overburdened and slow (Moderate Risk)

The court system is overburdened and scarce budgetary resources are making it difficult for remaining judicial reforms that would help streamline procedures to be implemented. Depending on the issue and the court, firms can wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. After years of delay, however, the Socialist-led administration has finally established five Courts of Appeal at the county level, which should help alleviate the Supreme Court’s substantial backlog of cases. But the  European Commission has noted that a lack of adequate funding is still hampering the establishment of additional regional courts, which would streamline processes further. Businesses will want to pursue accelerated procedures that are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for intellectual property violations. Businesses may also want to include in their contracts that disputes be settled by binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The government fails to streamline regulations that are hindering competitiveness (Moderate Risk)

A recent survey by the World Bank praised Hungary for its simple rules for setting up a new business, but the same report shows that Hungary is falling behind some of its central  European peers, most notably Slovakia. Despite the simple rules for business start-ups, the process of setting up a business in Hungary is relatively costly and takes longer than in most other countries in the region. Registering property is also much more expensive than elsewhere. With other countries in the region quickly improving their business environments there is a risk that Hungary could see its share of foreign direct investment (FDI) decline.
That said, inflows of FDI into Hungary were strong in 2004, and the World Bank survey notes that
Hungary's strict investment data regulations offer investors more protection than anywhere else in the
Page 146 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
region. Businesses should stress the need for further streamlining of business regulations, but also be aware that action is unlikely until after the 2006 general election.
BACKGROUND
(Background material is updated twice yearly. Last update: July 27th, 2004) Enforceability of Contracts
Contract disputes may be taken to court, but the court system is severely overburdened. Depending on the issue and the court, firms might have to wait more than a year for a final ruling on a contract dispute. Accelerated procedures are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for
intellectual property violations and for other economic crimes. The courts’ burdens were alleviated with the introduction of regional courts under Act XXII of 2002. This law established regional courts in Budapest, Szeged and Pecs beginning July 1st 2003; others will be created in Gyor and Debrecen on July 1st 2004.

Contracts may also provide for settling disputes through binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Independence of the Judiciary

The Hungarian judicial system is adequate, apart from delays in processing court cases, and it operates under clearly specified guidelines. The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. Some reforms must still be made to harmonise Hungarian law with EU requirements.

The efficiency, reliability and integrity of public-sector employees vary, and corruption is not unknown. Personal connections can considerably accelerate and improve the chances of success in bureaucratic and many other processes. A study by Gallup, in co-operation with the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations, has shown that 32% of small and medium-sized enterprises had encountered corruption in the course of business. This was most common in relationships with other companies, however, rather than
with government bodies. For state organisations, corruption was found to be most common in
public-procurement procedures, customs procedures and obtaining government permits. According to a
2003 survey by Transparency International, 54% of Hungarians perceived public officials as corrupt.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

Hungary welcomes foreign direct investment (FDI) and implements policies to encourage it. Nevertheless, the previous government’s statements and behaviour have somewhat tarnished Hungary’s image as an investor-friendly haven in central  Europe. It generally supported domestic capital and sometimes directed unfriendly rhetoric towards foreign companies. Price caps also hurt the profitability of foreign investors, and they were known to complain of occasional discrimination over public-procurement contracts. Compared with the previous government of Victor Orban, official attitudes are now improving.

The Medgyessy government has promised to lure back foreign investors, since Hungary is experiencing a decline in FDI as emerging markets vie fiercely for investment. Besides competition from other countries, local factors are also eroding growth in FDI: local labour costs are rising, there are fewer potential acquisition targets and the bulk of privatisation is now complete. To make matters worse, EU accession forced modifications to Hungary’s corporate tax-holiday scheme, and some measures were completely scrapped.

These factors, coupled with a global stockmarket downturn, caused a noticeable slowing of foreign portfolio investment in 2002, and foreign direct investors followed suit. Total FDI inflow to Hungary amounted to Euro1bn in 2002, which is only 40% of the inflow in 2001, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport. But uncertainties over the outcome of the military action in Iraq and rising oil prices also had an adverse effect, and FDI in the first four months of 2003 hit its lowest point, totalling  Euro39m--compared with Euro181m in the same period of 2002, according to the central bank. The months of February and
April saw negative FDI figures as capital left the country.

In terms of per-capita FDI, Hungary has lost the regional lead it held between 1996 and 2000. Per-capita FDI in Hungary totalled US$127 in 2002, far below the average for Central and Eastern  Europe, according to preliminary figures from the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Per-capita FDI inflows amounted to US$936 in Slovenia, US$880 in the Czech Republic and US$706 in Slovakia in 2002. Tangible evidence of an FDI slowdown also included announcements by companies on specific projects suspended or cancelled.

Nevertheless, Hungarian authorities are generally well aware of the need for capital from abroad. The government continues to offer a range of incentives to attract investment. Meanwhile, Hungary was forced

Page 147 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
to put an end to the tax waivers for major foreign investments prior to joining the  European Union. The government also introduced new investment incentives of a similar size as existing ones that are compatible with EU rules. The medium-term investment incentives programme, Smart Hungary, for example, aims to reverse the slowing influx of foreign capital in order to modernise the country’s business structure and boost its employment and income-generating capacity.

Overall, Hungary remains one of the most positive environments for foreign investors among  Europe’s transition countries (with the temporary exception of industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals). Most of Hungary’s FDI inflows are in high-technology production industries, and almost all are greenfield investments.

The attitude of the business community and the general public towards foreign investment is generally positive. Local businesses welcome foreign participation as a way to access more-developed technology, export markets and critical working capital. Majority foreign ownership and decision-making is increasingly accepted in the Hungarian business community.

Hungary is the only transition economy in  Europe to have entered a post-privatisation phase of foreign investment. Although privatisation is still the dominating force in FDI statistics in Poland and the Czech Republic, the process has all but ended in Hungary.

The largest foreign investor in 2002 was the Netherlands, with Euro438m, followed by Germany (Euro158m), the United States (Euro104m), Sweden (Euro103m) and Austria (Euro62m). Although 51% of the FDI inflow in 2002 went to production industries, the largest investments during the fourth quarter were in real estate, business services and equipment manufacturing. Foreign-owned companies produce more than one-third of GDP and account for more than one-quarter of employment. The government depends on a consistent FDI inflow of US$1.5bn-2bn as a crucial part of its economic planning.

There are no general local-content requirements that discriminate against foreigners. However, under the requirements of the tender for the two commercial television stations sold by the National Radio and Television Board, at least 35% of programming must be Hungarian produced. Parliament modified Act I of
1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) by Act XX of 2002. The amendment adjusts the legislation to EU requirements, requiring that 50% of all programming be  European in origin. The EU has expressed dissatisfaction, however, with the clause setting the minimum of Hungarian-made programming at 7% instead of the originally proposed 5%.

Although there are no Hungarian local-content requirements, exporters to the  European Union must consider EU rules. For example, Magyar Suzuki, the local automotive manufacturing subsidiary of Suzuki (Japan), had to pay the EU some  Euro32m in retrospective customs duties, plus interest, that it failed to pay in 1994-97. The  European Anti-fraud Office found that Suzuki used false declarations of Hungarian origin involving 58,000 vehicles during this period. Under the previous customs agreement between the EU and Hungary, car exporters were exempt from customs duties if combined Hungarian- and EU-origin content accounts for at least 60% of the value of the finished product. Suzuki failed to comply with these requirements in 1994-97 but still claimed the exemption.
Unfair Competitive Practices

A part of the economy remains strongly influenced by large state-owned or formerly state-owned enterprises that are sometimes monopolies. And because of the relatively small size of the Hungarian market (the population is about 10m), producers tend to establish dominant market positions rapidly, becoming monopolists or duopolists from economies of scale.

Hungarian competition policy is governed by Act LVII of 1996 on the Prohibition of Unfair and Restrictive Market Practices. This law, commonly known as the Competition Act, includes provisions against unfair competition, consumer deception, collusive and trust practices, and abuse of market dominance. The law also regulates mergers and acquisitions; it provides for their supervision by the Office of Economic Competition (OEC), which reports directly to parliament. Modelled on Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, the OEC is the chief regulatory body for competition policy in all sectors.

In a June 1998 decision, the Constitutional Court stated that the OEC may not directly apply the laws and practices of the  European Union without their first being incorporated into Hungarian law.

The Competition Act introduced several changes to align Hungarian policy with that of the EU, and it more clearly defined the functioning and responsibilities of the OEC. The most significant aspects of the law include the following:

Parliament modified the Competition Act in December 2000, introducing changes in February 2001 to harmonise Hungarian regulations with EU standards and to clarify the wording of certain parts. Although the structure and fundamental regulations of the law remained intact, the changes extended the scope of

the law and the authority of the OEC and simplified certain procedures. Major changes have been made on provisions on the prohibition of agreements restricting competition. Although under previous regulations,
the total joint market share of the parties to minor agreements could not exceed 10%, the market share now held by companies controlled by the parties must also be considered when assessing the limit. If the market share still remains below 10%, the agreement will be exempt.

The changes to the Competition Act also give the OEC new licence to monitor market processes. If in any market sector pricing tendencies or other circumstances indicate that certain businesses have entered into an agreement restricting competition or that a business is abusing its dominant position, the OEC’s chairman may request information from businesses involved in that sector.

Act X of 2002 came into force on April 1st 2002, introducing certain EU norms into the Hungarian legal system. These new norms must be applied in cases where the content of cartels or the abuses of dominant market position affect free trade between the  European Union and Hungary.
Price controls are provided for by the Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990).

The Consumer Protection Act (CLV of 1997) affects competition policy with its requirements for product safety and consumer information. The legislation reflects further harmonisation of Hungarian law with EU norms. Government Decree 89/1998 establishes the scope of authority and procedures for the Central Consumer Protection Supervisor, which implements the law. If an entity achieves unfair market advantages by breaching provisions of the act, competitors whose market positions are jeopardised may assert a claim under the provisions of the Competition Act (in addition to an action before the Central Consumer
Protection Supervisor).

Amendments to Act IV of 1959 on the Civil Code, which came into force on March 1st 1998, set legal requirements on the general terms and conditions in contracts between businesses and their customers, providing customers with more effective civil law remedies against abusive contractual arrangements dictated by businesses.

The Commercial Advertising Act (LVIII of 1997) comprehensively regulates advertising. For comparative or other advertising that qualifies as unfair competition or consumer deception, the act refers to the provisions of the Competition Act. Under the Competition Act, the courts or the OEC decide whether an advertisement is anti-competitive or deceptive. The Commercial Advertising Act was modified in December 2000 in line with EU regulations. Changes included a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media from July 1st 2001 and in the outdoor media from January 1st 2002, and stricter regulations on comparative advertising.

Rather than prohibiting monopolies and market dominance per se, the Competition Act bans abuse of a dominant position that restricts competition. Under the act, a dominant position occurs when goods reasonably substituting those of a company cannot be acquired, or can be acquired only under conditions substantially less favourable; when a company’s goods cannot be sold to another party, or can be sold only to a party under substantially less favourable conditions; or when a company can pursue its economic activities in a manner substantially independent of other participants in the market or without having to consider the attitudes of its competitors, suppliers, customers or other business partners.

The act includes the following non-exclusive list of agreements or concerned practices that might be considered impermissible if they have, as their object or effect, the prevention, restriction or distortion of economic competition:

Nevertheless, agreements between companies to engage in the practices listed above are not forbidden if the combined market share of the parties to the agreement does not exceed 10% or if the companies are not independent from each other (that is, if one controls the other or if both are controlled by the same owner). In 2002 the Office of Economic Competition (OEC)  fined Matav, the dominant telecoms provider, Ft5m and Magyar Posta Ft20m for abusing their dominant market positions. In early 2003 the OEC  fined Auchan (a French retailer) and Hungarian Cetelem Bank Ft1m and Ft2m, respectively, for deceiving customers with misleading advertisements. The OEC also  fined Tesco Global Stores (UK) Ft5m for similar reasons. Among the companies under scrutiny in mid-2003 were Henkel (a German household goods manufacturer), Tetra Pak (a Swedish packaging company) and EMKTV (a Hungarian cable provider).

In total, the OEC imposed Ft15m in  fines in the first six months of 2003. Most penalty decisions related to unfair influence on customers.

Hungary opened its electricity market on January 1st 2003. Consumers using at least 6.5 gwh per year may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice. Local distribution companies still have monopolies on their own territories; further market liberalisation measures will be gradually introduced over future years. The natural gas market will be liberalised in January 2004.

Hungary liberalised its telecoms market with the passage of the Unified Telecommunication Act on June
12th 2001. It established the framework for a liberalised telecoms market; this took effect on December
23rd 2001, when the monopoly rights of Matav, the dominant fixed-line provider, expired. The act regulates
and ensures competition in different segments of the telecoms market, including telecoms, postal activities,
broadcasting and programme distribution. The act is forcing dominant market players to unbundle their
networks and provide local-loop access to smaller market players for two years after their concession
expires, if they receive a relevant offer from other service providers. Fixed-line telephone rates and access
charge to the Internet remain regulated, and this rule is extended to the rates charged for calls from
fixed-line networks to mobile networks.

Hungary now has local monopolies in wire-based voice-telephone services, established by concession contracts concluded between telecoms providers and the former Ministry of Transport and Water. Besides its monopoly to provide local telephone services in 39 of the 54 primary areas, Matav (the formerly
state-owned giant) held a monopoly on providing domestic long-distance and international voice-telephony services until December 23rd 2001. The monopoly concessions of the providers in the remaining 15 primary areas expired on November 1st 2002. The new firms attempting to challenge Matav’s status as dominant provider have opened business in most areas of competition, including closed-network and
intra-company services. At present, Matav (Hungary), Vivendi Telecom Hungary (now owned by US-based
AIG Emerging  Europe and GMT Communications Partners), Monor Telephone Company (of United
Pan-Europe Communications based in the Netherlands), Emitel (a subsidiary of Matav) and Hungarotel
provide land-line phone services.

Competition has been slow to develop, however, and rivals accused Matav of blocking real competition by charging high prices for interconnecting its network with competitors. The Association of Alternative Telecom Service Providers decided in July 2002 to challenge Matav’s reference interconnection offer (RIO) in court. The organisation called for immediate government involvement in redefining the conditions of competition and in eliminating the interconnection pricing mechanism of the former monopoly.

The telecommunications arbitration panel ruled in May 2003 that Matav must lower its interconnect fees by an average 28%, and further declines followed as Hungary prepared for EU membership in May 2004

To address additional issues that have arisen, the IT and telecoms ministry drafted a fully EU-compliant new Unified Telecommunication Act, which was submitted to parliament in the autumn and took effect January 1st 2004. The new law introduced number transferability for fixed-line phones from January 2004 and for mobile phones from May 1st; reduced fees charged for terminating calls from fixed-line networks to mobile networks; reformed the financing of universal-access telecom services and narrowed the range of those eligible to use them. It also set up a new Communications Council.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial designs and models are all legally recognised. Legislation on intellectual property rights is comparable to that in western  European countries, but foreign producers still cite local piracy of software, music, branded apparel and pharmaceutical patents as problem areas for enforcement. However, much has already been done to improve respect for intellectual property rights, as required by the EU, OECD and WTO. Patents are protected for 20 years from the date of filing the patent application; an annual fee is required to maintain the patent. The Act on the Protection of Inventions by Patents (XXXIII of 1995) conforms to EU legislation.

The law includes detailed provisions against infringement. A patent holder or licenser that suspects patent infringement may file a lawsuit at the Budapest Metropolitan Court (Fovarosi Birosag) and may request an injunction to halt the alleged abuse, an award of compensation and damages, or confiscation of the goods produced under the infringing activity. Cases may be appealed to the Supreme Court (Legfelsobb Birosag). Disputes may be settled by either direct ruling or trial. A licensee also may sue an infringer in court. It
should be noted that Hungary’s overburdened court system often leads to lengthy delays in pursuing legal remedy, and even injunctions against infringing activity can be difficult to obtain. Holders of copyrights and trademarks suffer frequent infringement, and industry groups have been set up to lobby the government and assist authorities.

Hungary joined the  European Patent Convention (EPC) on January 1st 2003, when Act XXXIX of 2002 modified Act XXXIII of 1995 and fully integrated the Hungarian patent system into the EPC.  European patents can now be applied for at the Hungarian office in Hungarian. The Hungarian Patent Office (HPO) said the changes will not slow the patent process or increase costs.
Act XLVIII of 2001 codified the protection of industrial designs.

Act LX of 1995 extended the availability of interlocutory injunctions (temporary restraining orders) to intellectual property matters. The applicant must file a written claim showing that, without the injunction,

Page 150 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
imminent and direct damages cannot be avoided, the status quo giving rise to the dispute cannot be preserved or the position of the applicant requires protection. An interlocutory injunction may be requested only within the context of an existing litigation. The applicant must also show that the advantages of the injunction would probably outweigh its disadvantages. If granted, an injunction takes effect on the day following the date of receipt of the order on the injunction or on the date determined by the court; it remains in force until it is revoked or until judgment is passed on the merits of the case.
Increasingly, foreign firms are registering their patents in Hungary, according to the annual report of the
HPO. The number of patents registered has risen steadily since 1990; 5,906 patents were registered in
2002, and only 842 of these belonged to Hungarian companies. In 2001, domestic companies submitted
842 patent applications, and foreign companies filed 5,064 claims. Main growth areas for patent
applications were pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry and biotechnology.

The Highest Court dismissed a patent infringement case brought by Merck, a US pharmaceuticals producer, against Richter, a domestic pharmaceuticals producer in February 2003. Merck filed its suit in
1995, claiming that Richter used its patented compound in Richter’s Ednyt blood-pressure medicine. Richter said it used its own patented ingredients.
The HPO revoked one of Merck’s patents on simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering compound in February
2003, and the company appealed against the move at the Budapest Municipal Court. Merck is also suing
Teva-Biogal, an Israeli-owned pharmaceuticals producer, in a patent-infringement case related to
simvastatin.

The HPO is planning to encourage local SMEs to apply for patents through new tax cuts. The cost of registering a patent is already deductible from pre-tax profits, but SMEs making little or no profit would be allowed to write off costs as expenses. In the HPO’s estimate, about 60,000 Hungarian companies could be competitive on the global innovation market with the help of the measure instead of the 3,000 at present. The HPO’s new strategy will go before the government for approval in September.

Copyrights are protected by the Copyright Act (Act LXXVI of 1999). This strengthened protection by providing the courts with authority to decide on issuing injunctions for alleged copyright violation within 15 days of receiving the request if certain conditions are met. The act came into force on September 1st 1999 and fully harmonised Hungary’s copyright law with EU standards. It also modernised copyright provisions to account for the spread of information technologies and incorporated the provisions of international
copyright treaties.

Following the first award for damages to a foreign copyright owner (Microsoft of the US) for illegal use of software in the first half of 1999, another landmark court case in November 1999 saw the first imposition of (suspended) prison terms on two individuals for copyright infringement. Additional cases were successfully completed or launched in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to defend software copyrights. In February 2003 a Budapest court sentenced the managing director of Philos Laboratories, a Hungarian software developer, to one year in prison, the first such sentence for illegal software use in Hungary. Co-operation with the authorities reduces sanctions, but violators face up to eight years in prison for copyright infringement.

The Business Software Alliance (BSA), a private industry group, helps its members defend their copyrights, in part by initiating legal action against illegal use. The BSA says that software morality is improving; it estimates that software piracy rates dropped to 45% in 2002, from 48% in 2001, 51% in 2000 and 76% in
1994. Still, this far exceeds Western  Europe’s average of around 35%.

The Hungarian Association of Record Producers (Mahasz) estimates that 18% of the recorded works sold in Hungary in 2002 were illegal copies and that about Ft2bn in revenues was lost to the rightful copyright holders. The Audiovisual Copyright Foundation estimates that the video industry suffers Ft2bn-3bn in lost revenues per year because of pirated videos.

Act I of 1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) requires cable operators to complete contracts or obtain contract waivers from the broadcasters whose programmes they transmit. The operators must also register their programme offerings with the National Radio and Television Board (the ORTT). The ORTT must allow any broadcaster to check the registry for information regarding their programmes retransmitted by the cable operators and the protection of copyrights.

The Copyright Act of 1999 prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain decoding devices used illegally to view pay-television programming (such as HBO). Industry associations believe the number of those illegally viewing premium cable-TV programming to be about equal to the number of paying subscribers. Act LXXVII of 2001 modified the law to include electronic databases as well.

Trademarks are covered by Act XI of 1997 on Trademark Protection, which further harmonised Hungarian intellectual property legislation with EU and international norms. The act expanded trademark protection
(for example, to protect colours, voices, numbers and letters), added more precise definitions for distinctive
Page 151 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
symbols and denied protection for illegally obtained trademarks. It also strengthened the rights of trademark holders by accelerating legal proceedings on trademark infringement. The court must decide on the infringement claim within 15 days of submitting the claim. Temporary measures in trademark infringements may be enforced. The protection of geographic indicators is also allowed under the Act on Trademark Protection, in limited circumstances. Hence, names such as Tokaj (where Hungary’s famous dessert wines are produced) are protected from forgeries. Act CXXI of 1997 on Grape Growing and the Wine Economy also introduced strict rules protecting Tokaj wines, including a precise definition of the right to use of the name Tokaji. The act also tightened customs regulations to prevent the importing of counterfeit products.

In February 2003 the Budapest Municipal Court ruled against Hid Radio, a US publishing company, in a trademark-infringement case brought against it by Ringier of Switzerland, a rival publisher. Ringier claimed Hid Radio’s tabloid Szines Mai Lap greatly resembled the format and design of Mai Nap, the Ringier
group’s tabloid. Under the court ruling, Szines Mai Lap must change its logo and pay a certain amount from its profit generated during the period in question to Ringier. Hid Radio has appealed against the verdict.
Price Controls

The Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990) provides for price controls. Hungary’s economic reform has liberalised the prices of most products and services offered by private concerns. Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport Decree 30 of May 9th 2003 regulates natural gas prices; Decrees 58 and 61 of December 29th 2002 regulate the prices of retail electricity services and district heating. Decree 3 of January 21st 2002 of the Prime Minister’s Office regulates telecom tariffs for 2003. Government Decree 175/2001 required former monopoly Matav to come up with a reference interconnection offer (RIO), which lays out the key terms and conditions for making interconnections with other providers, including tariffs. The Telecommunications Authority’s arbitration panel, a regulatory body
established by the Telecommunication Act, approved Matav’s RIO on July 18th 2002, but the Association of
Alternative Telecom Service Providers challenged the RIO in court.
Internet charges are regulated by Decree 3/2003 of the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications.

The government took a strong anti-inflationary stance in 2002. As in previous years, this created strong controversy over price controls, affecting energy, telecoms and pharmaceuticals.

In pharmaceuticals, the prices of non-subsidised drugs are not supposed to be regulated (only a notification requirement exists). In 2000, international and domestic producers signed a three-year pricing pact over subsidised drugs with the government. However, the Medgyessy government postponed the agreed average 5% hike from July 1st 2002, intending to renegotiate the three-year deal and sign a four-year agreement instead. A deal finally materialised on February 1st 2003, when the price of subsidised drugs rose by an average of 4.5%. The hike was set at a fixed amount for drugs that cost less than Ft550, thus benefiting domestic manufacturers, which sell large quantities of low-priced generic drugs, such as Richter, Egis and Chinoin.

Under the three-year agreement, subsidised drug prices rose by 3.7% in July 2002, but this hike was postponed until February 2004. At the same time, the government increased the 2003 drug budget by Ft26bn but capped the amount of monthly subsidies on medications until the end of 2003. The government is planning to introduce a new subsidy system in 2004 that would altogether eliminate price talks with manufacturers, a move opposed by the Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in
Hungary (AIPM), which represents drug importers. Among the many foreign companies affected by the dispute are AstraZeneca  (UK), Bayer (Germany), GlaxoSmithKline (UK), Merck (US), Novartis (Switzerland) and Pfizer (US).

The Ministry of Health also capped pharmacies’ profit margins from July 1st 2001, limiting them to no more than Ft630 on medications that cost more than Ft3,500. The Hungarian Pharmacist Chamber announced in early 2003 that it is turning to the Constitutional Court over the estimated Ft4bn drop in revenue the sector has suffered since the margin cut in 2001. The chamber submitted a similar complaint in August 2001, with no results so far.

The government will have the power to freeze pharmaceutical prices for up to 12 months, according to a bill approved by the parliamentary economic committee. Under the existing legislation, the government can freeze prices for no more than six months -- as it actually did from the start of April this year. The bill also authorises the government to ban any producer or distributor of drugs and nutrition supplements from increasing prices for up to 12 months in case of a temporary disturbance in the market. The cabinet can
also prevent producers and distributors from increasing wholesale prices for up to one year. The two MPs who tabled the bill argue that the supply of pharmaceuticals is closely related to the constitutional rights to life and health.


Page 152 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Matav, the national telecoms provider, was allowed to raise the price of its subscription packages by 10% and the tariffs for local calls by 6% from January 1st 2003. However, it chose to increase its prices by an average of only 4.3% from February 1st in an attempt to ward off competitors.

The government approved an average 10% electricity price hike on February 1st 2003. Retail prices rose by an average 8.7%. The government also decided to lift the price caps that caused power distributor Hungarian Electricity Works (MVM) to accumulate Ft73bn in losses by end-2002, according to the Hungarian Energy Office.

The Electricity Act (Act CX of 2001), which parliament passed on December 18th 2001, is gradually introducing competition to the electricity market between January 2003 and 2010. About 35% of the market was liberalised in the first step, involving about 200 large consumers that used 6.5 gwh of electricity a year. These consumers were freely able to choose suppliers but only for up to 50% of their total electricity needs.

Natural gas retail prices did not rise in 2002, but were hiked by 12% on May 15th 2003. Gas prices for large industrial consumers rose by 5.2% on July 1st 2002, affecting about 350 companies, and have remained unchanged since then.

Parliament adopted a new natural-gas-supply law (Act XLII of 2003) in June 2003, aligning the gas market with EU norms. Under the new law, domestic natural gas prices will be pegged to world market prices, and discount household gas prices will be subsidised by higher mining fees for MOL, the oil and gas company. The law will open a part of the market to a selected group of gas users, who together consume about 40% of the total, as from January 1st 2004.

MOL welcomed the new law, saying it would enable the company to operate its gas business profitably from 2004, putting it on equal footing with other market players. But MOL’s natural-gas division expects to register a loss again this year because of the price caps, which are forcing the company to sell gas for less than it costs to import it. Nevertheless, the company expects losses far lower than the Ft120bn amount in
2001.

The European Union (EU) has fined AstraZeneca  $73 million for artificially inflating the price of its ulcer treatment Losec and misusing the EU's patent system to delay entry of generic competition for the drug.

The European Commission's (EC) Competition Commission, which levied the  fine, determined that, between 1993 and 2000, AstraZeneca  infringed EC and European Economic Area (EEA) competition rules by blocking or delaying market access to generic versions of Losec (omeprazole) and preventing parallel imports of the drug. The actions helped  AstraZeneca  maintain high prices for Losec, which, at the time, was one of the world's most profitable drugs. Global sales of Losec totaled roughly $4.6 billion in
2002.

TD
AstraZeneca  provided misleading information to several national patent offices in the EEA resulting in AstraZeneca  gaining extended patent protection for Losec through so-called supplementary protection certificates, the EC said. As a result of the misleading information, the patent offices had to rely on misleading information to consider whether the product was innovative.

AstraZeneca,  meanwhile, contends it acted in good faith and never provided misleading information to EU patent regulators. "AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately," said Tom McKillop, the company's chief executive. "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal positions will confirm that the  commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed."

AstraZeneca  was fined EUR 60 M after the  European Commission (EC) accused it of violating antitrust laws to prevent the launch of a generic version of its ulcer drug Losec. According to the EC, when Astra applied for Supplementary Protection Certificate, it provided misleading data to some national drug regulators about the date Losec obtained  European marketing authorisation. Consequently, Losec gained an undeserved additional protection. Astra claimed it was unsure when it applied for the SPC whether
date for supplementary protection would start from the time marketing authorisation was given or when pricing structure was determined. The company also attempted to extend Losec's patent by changing the drug from capsule to tablet form, de-registering the capsule and withdrawing marketing authorisation. Generic producers are then prevented from penetrating the market.

AstraZeneca  is to challenge a £40 million  European Commission fine after it was found guilty by the organisation of abusing drug patent laws.

The company blasted an EC ruling that it had deliberately hampered generic versions of its blockbuster drug Losec as "legally and factually flawed".

TD
AstraZeneca  will appeal against findings that it breached Article 82 of the  European Community Treaty for the pharmaceuticals sector, which aims to prevent firms illegally profiteering from market dominance.

The EC also found  AstraZeneca  guilty of misleading regulators to prolong its Losec patent and slowing generic versions of the drug by swapping its formula from capsule to tablet.

Neelie Kroes, EC competition commissioner, said: "Misleading regulators to gain longer protection is a serious infringement of EU competition rules."

However, AstraZeneca  stated that it acted in "good faith" when marketing what was once one of the world's best-selling drugs.  AstraZeneca  chief executive Sir Tom McKillop added: "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal position will confirm that the  Commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed."

THE chief executive of  AstraZeneca  has warned that the pharmaceutical industry will direct more of its future investment to the US and Asia if the current uncompetitive climate persists in  Europe.

Sir Tom McKillop, who runs the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant valued at pounds-37 billion, said he wasn't threatening to move his company, but pointed out that the continent faced "slow atrophy" as the sector raced ahead in other destinations.

TD
He said the UK and Scotland are "increasingly becoming an unattractive place to be" for his industry, adding that Britain was one of the slowest adopters of new medicines and products in the developed world.

Scottish-born McKillop added: "The UK market is a dog. It's less than 3-per cent of the world market. It's not responsive to innovation.

When we go to other countries [to sell our products] and they say 'you're not even using it in your own country', it's not a great advertisement."

The pharmaceutical industry is being squeezed on several fronts, with generic companies challenging drug patents earlier; regulators becoming more risk adverse and drug development costs soaring with the demand for larger clinical trials to prove the safety of products. Faced with mounting public health bills, Western governments are also trying to drive down prices paid for new medicines.

AstraZeneca  has also had other setbacks, the latest being a  euros 60million fine from the European  Commission for misusing the patent system and procedures for marketing drugs in order to block or delay the market entry of generic competitors to its ulcer drug Losec. It plans to appeal.

HD     EU Fines AstraZeneca  for Blocking Generic Competition for Losec

The European Union (EU) has fined AstraZeneca  $73 million for artificially inflating the price of its ulcer treatment Losec and misusing the EU's patent system to delay entry of generic competition for the drug.

The European Commission's (EC) Competition Commission, which levied the  fine, determined that, between 1993 and 2000, AstraZeneca  infringed EC and European Economic Area (EEA) competition rules by blocking or delaying market access to generic versions of Losec (omeprazole) and preventing parallel imports of the drug. The actions helped  AstraZeneca  maintain high prices for Losec, which, at the time, was one of the world's most profitable drugs. Global sales of Losec totaled roughly $4.6 billion in
2002.

TD
The EC identified two major abuses in the Losec case:

* AstraZeneca  provided misleading information to several national patent offices in the EEA resulting in AstraZeneca  gaining extended patent protection for Losec through so-called supplementary protection certificates, the EC said. As a result of the misleading information, the patent offices had to rely on misleading information to consider whether the product was innovative; and

* The drugmaker misused EU rules and procedures by selectively deregistering the market authorizations for Losec capsules in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with the intent of blocking or delaying entry by generic firms and parallel traders, the EC said. At the time, generic products could only be marketed and parallel imports licensed if there was an existing reference market authorization for the brand product. By deregistering Losec capsules,  AstraZeneca  effectively prevented generic firms from obtaining marketing authorizations for their products, the EC alleged. The EU has since altered its regulations to prevent firms from using AstraZeneca's  tactics.

"I fully support the need for innovative products to enjoy strong intellectual property protection so that companies can recoup their R&D expenditure[s]," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "However, it is not for a dominant company but for the legislator to decide which period of protection is adequate. Misleading regulators to gain longer protection acts as a disincentive to innovate and is a serious infringement of EU competition rules."

AstraZeneca,  meanwhile, contends it acted in good faith and never provided misleading information to EU patent regulators. "AstraZeneca  has not made misrepresentations or behaved inappropriately," said Tom McKillop, the company's chief executive. "We believe that a proper evaluation on appeal of all the facts and legal positions will confirm that the  commission's analysis is fundamentally flawed."

The company said it would challenge the EC's decision in court "because of the important negative impact on future competitiveness that this narrow analysis of dominance will have on innovative industry in Europe."

AstraZeneca  took particular exception with the EC's allegations that it deregistered Losec capsules for the specific purpose of blocking generic competitors. "Companies are entirely within their rights to withdraw products, to introduce new products and to deal with product registrations as may be necessary," the company said in a June 15 statement. "In this case, the new Losec tablet formulation, in fact, offers benefits over the previous formulation."

The company also accused the EC of failing to properly analyze the crucial issues of market dominance. "The commission's interpretation in this case could mean that any innovative product may be considered dominant retrospectively and hence subject to the 'special

responsibility' of a dominant company,"  AstraZeneca  said. "This could impose unnecessary additional burdens which will adversely
affect industry competitiveness." Release date: June 29, 2005

Country Profiles
Belgium

Sector Overview
Belgium has a reputation as a leading vaccines producer. Its pharmaceutical sector is one of the country's strongest industries and a driving force behind its economy. There are about 150 pharmaceutical companies operating in the country, which include major foreign manufacturers such as Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Homegrown pharmaceutical companies such as Solvay SA and UCB Group are also leading global drug companies
The healthcare system in Belgium is quite strong, but with the increase in life expectancy resulting in an ageing population, healthcare expenditure has risen sharply and is placing financial pressure on the Belgian Government. As a result, the Government has implemented cost-containment measures such as restricting the healthcare budget to curb growing expenditure. According to IMS, Belgium's health budget in 2004 was roughly "16.3 billion (US$19.7 billion), a growth of 5.97% compared with the budget in the previous fiscal
year. However, growth has slowed compared with the country's health budget in 2003, which recorded a 6.46% increase over the previous year.
Industry Size and Value
With a long tradition in healthcare and medicine, the pharmaceutical sector of Belgium has grown tremendously over the years. The EFPIA says that Belgium's pharmaceuticals market is currently worth more than "3 billion (US$3.6
billion). Pharmaceutical products also make up a large part of the country's exports. In 2002, Belgium was the largest medicine exporter among  European
nations with total exports worth "23.1 billion (US$27.9 billion). R&D also

plays an important part in the Belgian pharmaceutical industry with sector
Page 173 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
R&D accounting for nearly 30% of all industrial R&D activities in the country.
According to the Belgian Pharmaceutical Industry Association (Pharma.be), R&D expenditure increased sixfold from "183.3 million (US$221.9 million) to "1.28 billion (US$1.55 billion) from 1990 to 2002.
Leading Companies
Solvay SA (BXS: SOL)
Solvay SA is an international chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which employs 30,000 people. It is considered one of the top 40 pharmaceutical firms in the world with a diversified portfolio of products.
In fiscal 2004, sales revenue for Solvay totaled "7,877 million (US$9,536 million), up by 4% or "320 million (US$387.4 million) from 2003. Of the total, revenues from the pharmaceutical sector contributed "1,745 million
(US$2,112 million). Pharmaceutical sales shrank by 5% compared with 2003, due to the negative impact of debates over female hormone therapy and contract renegotiations with its primary American distributors, which reduced
its US sales. In addition, the weakness of the US dollar and pressure on

European prices also contributed to the fall.

Source: Solvay SA
Despite a small increase in the group's sales revenue, net income surged by
26% from 2003 to "541 million (US$654 million). It was the first time Solvay had achieved net income exceeding half a billion. In line with the good performance of the group's net income, earnings per share (EPS) rose from "4.78 (US$5.78) to "5.92 (US$7.17).
In March, Solvay signed a MOU with Fournier Pharma to acquire the privately owned company for "1.3 billion (US$1.57 billion). Fournier is a French research-based pharmaceutical company and a global leader in fenofibrate, a
successful cardio-metabolic product for treating raised blood lipids. The

Page 174 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
acquisition may be completed this summer and will immediately enhance the
group's profitability as its pharmaceutical business sales will expand by more than a third.
UCB Group (BXS: UCB)
UCB Group, based in Brussels, is a global leader in pharmaceutical and chemical specialties. In pharmaceuticals, it specializes in the fields of oncology, allergy and respiratory diseases, immune and inflammatory
disorders, and central nervous system disorders. UCB Group employs more than
8,300 people in more than 100 countries.
For fiscal 2004, UCB Group reported turnover of "3,068 million (US$3,714 million), an increase of 3% compared with its "2,966 million (US$3,591 million) turnover for the fiscal year 2003. Revenue growth was largely attributed to rising sales of its new anti-epileptic drug Keppra, which rose in
the US by 29% and  Europe by 38%. Net income after taxes grew by 7% to "361 million (US$437 million) and EPS based on adjusted net income reached "2.60 (US$3.15), up by 11.6% from the previous fiscal year.
UCB began divesting its non-pharmaceutical businesses last year and acquired Celltech Group Plc, a leading biotechnology company based in the UK, to fully focus on its biopharmaceutical activities. On March 1, UCB completed the sale of its surface specialty business to Cytec Industries Inc (NYSE: CYT), a global technology leader in specialty chemicals and materials, for "1,415 million (US$1,713 million), of which "1,190 million (US$1,440 million) was in cash
and "225 million (US$272.4 million) in Cytec shares. The sale was first announced in early October last year. The transaction is part of UCB's initiative to transform itself from a hybrid industrial group to a pure biopharmaceutical leader.
The group expects its financial results for the current fiscal year to show growth, with the divestment of the surface specialty business resulting in a substantial capital gain. The growth of the pharmaceutical business will be able to offset the absence of revenues from the specialty chemical business and the films business, which it divested at the end of the third quarter of
2004.
Market Outlook
It is expected that Belgium will slowly experience a shift in its population. The number of elderly people will rise as life expectancy increases. The Government's Belgian Stability Program, announced in 2004, shows that by

Page 175 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
2030 30.6% of the population will be aged 60 and above, compared with only
21.8% in 2003. The ageing population will have a major impact on the country's healthcare expenditure, which has already put pressure on the Government's budget. Despite weighing on the country's expenditure, an increased ageing population also means that medicine consumption is expected to go up, ultimately giving a further boost to the domestic pharmaceutical industry. According to EFPIA, the Belgium pharmaceutical market is anticipated to be worth more than "4 billion (US$4.84 billion) by
2008. France
Sector Overview
France has one of the strongest pharmaceutical industries in  Europe. The country produces 7% of the world's pharmaceutical output and ranks as the third biggest pharmaceutical manufacturer globally. The country also has one of the highest per capita drug consumptions as its people have easy access to doctors and medications – resulting in high levels of pharmaceutical expenditure and drug prescription. Drugs alone account for more than 20% of France's healthcare expenditure. Consequently, in a bid to drive down
escalating pharmaceutical spending, the French Government has implemented cost-containment measures, which have adversely affected the industry. Industry Size and Value
Despite the Government's measures, France still has one of the highest levels of pharmaceuticals expenditure in the world. Annually, the French
Government spends more than 9% of its GDP on healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Almost one in five French adults takes mood-altering medicines, according to the Observatoire Francais Des Drogues et des Toxicomanies (French Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction), a public body involved in monitoring, analyzing and disseminating knowledge relating to drugs and drug addiction.
Besides being one of the highest spenders on pharmaceuticals, France is also one of the biggest pharmaceutical producers. According to EFPIA, France produced about "30.4 billion (US$36.8 billion) worth of pharmaceuticals in
2002, the highest pharmaceutical production in  Europe. Drug sales have increased along with production. A report by IMS Health, a pharmaceutical business intelligence provider, said that in the 12 months from April 2004 to
March 2005, drug sales through retail pharmacies rose by 12% to US$21.7

Page 176 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
billion (US$26.3 billion). France had the fourth highest sales after the US,
Japan and Germany. Leading Companies
Sanofi-Aventis (EURONEXT: SAN)
Sanofi-Aventis is  Europe's number one pharmaceutical group and the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world. The company was known originally as Sanofi-Synthelabo but changed its name after merging with another leading French pharmaceutical firm, Aventis SA, in April last year. Sanofi-Aventis specializes in seven core therapeutic areas – cardiovascular, central nervous system, thrombosis, oncology, diabetes, vaccines and internal medicine.
The company recorded solid growth for the first three months of 2005, generating "6.42 billion (US$7.77 billion) in net sales, up by 8.4% compared with the first three months of 2004. Of the total, the pharmaceutical business earned "6.06 billion (US$7.34 billion), while human vaccines generated "360 million (US$435.8 million) in sales. The company's 15 leading products saw nearly 19% growth in sales over the past year. Growing use of the company's anti-diabetic drug Lantus, particularly in the US, continued to stimulate sales growth. The drug recorded the highest growth among Sanofi-Aventis' leading products, 55% over the previous corresponding quarter.
General and R&D expenditures went up by a slight 0.7% and 0.3% respectively because of promotional costs for products and restructuring plans. Despite a rise in expenses, operating income amounted to "2.14 billion (US$2.59
billion), 27.9% higher than in the first three months of 2004. Cerep SA (EURONEXT: CER)
Cerep SA is a drug discovery company, which specializes in using a broad platform of technologies and services. The company's headquarters are in Paris with sales offices located in Japan and the US. Cerep provides its services to pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies and has worked with international pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. In the first quarter of 2005, consolidated sales revenues for Cerep were "12.11 million (US$14.7 million), an increase of 4.6% compared with "11.58 million (US$14.02 million) for the first quarter of 2004. Around 70% of sales revenues came from drug discovery services and collaboration activities, while the rest was from clinical service activities. Sales revenues were below the company's
expectations, affected by slower-than-expected performance of the drug

discovery service and collaboration activities segment, and the implementation
of a new and reduced price policy. However, Cerep expects its performance will pick up as there will be a significant number of large contracts coming in during the second half of the year.
Despite the rise in sales revenues, the company experienced a loss of "2.18 million (US$2.64 million). This was partly due to a high provision for expenses relating to a projected lay-off plan in itsin vivopharmacology division, which
has suffered recurring losses. Other contributory factors included new office opening expenses and lower production of inventoried products. The company will introduce and market new pharmacology products and services this year to address the industry's needs, such as specific profiles paired with data from Cerep's BioPrint, a database resource for decision-making at various stages of the drug discovery process. Cerep anticipates sales revenue for the year to be between "52 million (US$62.9 million) and "56 million (US$67.8 million),
after taking into consideration the loss of revenue resulting from the closing of thein vivopharmacology unit.
Market Outlook
According to the GERS Group of Generic Producers, sales of generic drugs in
2004 totaled "1.1 billion (US$1.33 billion), an increase of nearly 50% compared with 2003. The overall good performance of the generic drugs market in France last year is expected to continue this year. The key driver behind this is current favorable legislation. With the French Government seriously concerned about overwhelmingly high pharmaceutical expenditure, efforts are being made to reduce national healthcare costs and these include promoting the use of generic drugs. In addition to favorable legislation, the patents of several blockbuster drugs such as Pfizer's anti-depressant drug, Zoloft, and Merck's lipid-lowering drug, Zocor, will lapse this year. Some generic drug makers have predicted that the French generics market will be worth more than "2 billion (US$2.42 billion) by 2008.
Germany
Sector Overview
Germany has one of the strongest pharmaceutical industries in the world. It is the largest pharmaceutical market in  Europe and the third largest globally, with a value of more than "40 billion (US$48.4 billion). It is particularly strong
in pharmaceutical production, exports and imports and R&D. According to IMS
Health, key drug purchases in the 12 months to March totaled "21.2 billion

Page 178 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(US$25.7 billion), up by 11% from "19.08 billion (US$23.1 billion) in the 12
months ended March 2004.
However, the industry started to weaken two years ago, following the global economic recession and reforms of the country's healthcare system. The reforms, which took effect at the beginning of 2004, were aimed at cutting escalating healthcare costs (including costs of pharmaceuticals). From 1993 to
2003, health expenditure increased by 40% from "2,070 (US$2,506) to "2,900 (US$3,511) per capita. The healthcare reforms involve mandatory manufacturer discounts by pharmaceutical companies and certain costs being passed on to patients. Through the reforms, the Government expects to save more than "20 billion (US$24.2 billion) in healthcare costs in three years. However, they have been unpopular with the industry as they seriously affect sales. IMS Health estimates that they cost the industry more than "1 billion (US$1.21 billion) in revenues last year.
Leading Companies
Celesio AG (FSE: CLS)
Celesio AG is  Europe's leading pharmaceutical distribution company. The group, which trades in pharmaceutical products and services, comprises three main divisions – Celesio Wholesale, Celesio Pharmacies and Celesio Solutions. With a presence in 15 countries, it employs around 32,000 people throughout

Europe.
In May, the group announced first quarter revenues of "4.9 billion (US$5.93 billion), 6.2% higher than in the same quarter in 2004. The rise was due in
part to growth in business and to the acquisition of two wholesale companies, Portugal's Soquifa-Medicamentos and Slovenia's Kemofamacija. Without the acquisitions, revenues would have risen by only 3.3% instead of 6.2%.
Net profits grew by 17.3% to "79.2 million (US$95.9 million), thanks to consistent cost management, improvements in operations and gross profit margins. The group's earnings per share (EPS) rose 17.9% from the first quarter of 2004's "0.78 (US$0.94) to "0.92 (US$1.11). Celesio is confident about the current fiscal year's performance – it anticipates double-digit growth and is expecting the European pharmaceutical market to grow by 5% this year.
Merck KGaA (FSE: MRK)
Merck KGaA is one of the oldest pharmaceutical and chemical companies in the world and is a leading pharmaceutical company in both Germany and

Europe. It is a research-driven company that produces both patented and

generic drugs as well as consumer healthcare products.
For the first quarter ended March 31, Merck reported steady growth in its financial results, driven by its pharmaceuticals sector and helped by lower taxes. The group achieved sales of "1.38 billion (US$1.67 billion), up by 7.6% from the same quarter in 2004. The pharmaceutical sector was the major contributor to the Group's sales growth, contributing 65% ("900 million (US$1.09 billion)) of total sales. The branded and generics divisions reported double-digit sales growth of 13% and 11% respectively, while the consumer healthcare division's sales rose 5.4%. Sales of new cancer drug Erbitux continued to drive growth in all of Merck's territories. Erbitux, which is
currently marketed in 35 countries worldwide, has received positive responses from doctors and colorectal cancer patients who have used the drug. Erbitux sales in the first quarter totaled "42 million (US$50.8 million), up by 17% compared with sales in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Merck reported operating income of "198 million (US$239.7 million), an increase of 17% from the same quarter last year, while profits after tax leaped
20% to "122 million (US$147.7 million). This year, Merck expects continued positive improvement in both of its business sectors. It will be seeking approval to use Erbitux to treat head and neck cancer patients, while clinical trials will be conducted on using it to treat other types of cancer. If these are successful, Merck can expect a big boost to its sales revenue.
Alliance Activities

Page 180 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Forming alliances have become a popular business strategy for German
pharmaceutical companies. In January, Schering AG announced joint research with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis Pharma AG on a novel oral angiogenesis inhibitor known as PTK787⁄ZK222584 (PTK⁄ZK). The companies will join forces to maximize the full potential of PTK⁄ZK, which could
significantly advance clinical approaches to colorectal cancer. According to Schering, the drug will play an important role in the expansion of its oncology business worldwide. In February, Schering announced a licensing agreement with world-leading pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. Pfizer will have exclusive development and marketing rights to the preclinical oral
anti-platelet compounds portfolio developed by Schering's US affiliate, Berlex Inc. In return, Schering will receive upfront fees, royalties and milestone payments from Pfizer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Market Outlook
The outlook for the German pharmaceutical industry this year appears uncertain as the industry continues to be hampered by the slow-moving economy. The German Institute for Economic Research reported that the country's economy this year is expected to remain sluggish and this will affect many local industries, including pharmaceuticals. The new reference pricing system that came into effect this year is expected to have a negative impact on the sector. Patented drug manufacturers will incur huge losses if their drug prices are lowered to the level of generic drug prices, which will consequently affect the sector's revenues. With such a system, drug makers may be less willing to invest in drug R&D as they will not be able to acquire back a reasonable return on their investment.
Spain
Sector Overview

Spain has the world's seventh largest and  Europe's fifth largest pharmaceutical market. There are more than 350 pharmaceutical companies dealing in registered medicines and
270 of them have manufacturing facilities, according to FarmaIndustria, Spain's National Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry. Many big-name international pharmaceutical companies are operating in Spain, including the UK's GlaxoSmithKline and Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis. The sector employs more than 39,000 people.
Industry Size and Value
Latest figures provided by EFPIA show that in 2003, the value of the Spanish pharmaceutical market was "9.9 billion (US$11.98 billion) (at ex-factory prices). In the past few years, the annual growth rate was more than 10%. As in other European countries, prescription drugs, including generics, hold a

Page 181 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
bigger share of the market than over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. According to
IMS Health, drug sales through retail pharmacies amounted to "8.5 million (US$10.3 million) in 2004, an increase of 17%, compared with 2003. Drugs from the cardiovascular therapeutic class were the highest seller, accounting for 22% of total sales.
After Spain joined the EU in 1986, pharmaceutical investment began to rise dramatically with the entry of international pharmaceutical companies into the market. As a result, the Spanish Government developed the National Pharmaceutical Program Scheme to encourage more investment in R&D and this has proven to be quite successful. Part of the scheme was to provide support to pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of a financial aid such as zero interest loans. EFPIA and FarmaIndustria reported that before 1990, annual investment in pharmaceutical R&D was below "150 million (US$181.6 million). It increased during the 1990s and is fast approaching "500 million (US$605.3 million) per annum.
Leading Companies
Almirall Prodesfarma SA

Almirall is renowned as the first pharmaceutical multinational company in Spain. With more than 3,200 employees, the company conducts its own drug R&D. It has six manufacturing plants and four R&D centers and branch offices in the main cities of Spain as well as subsidiaries in Europe and Latin America. It sells its products in more than 80 countries.
For the fiscal year 2004, the company reported sales of "900 million (US$1.09 billion), which included "562 million (US$680.4 million) from domestic sales.
In spite of the slight growth of only 1.6% over the previous year's "886.1 million (US$1.07 billion), Almirall maintained its spot as the leading domestic pharmaceutical company in Spain with more than 6% of the total market. Research is the company's core activity and it invested "88 million (US$106.5 million) in R&D last year.
Almirall forecasts that sales revenue for the current fiscal year will be around "946 million (US$1.15 billion)– with 60% of sales coming from the domestic market and 40% from the international market. Almirall will be investing around "500 million (US$605.3 million) in R&D over the next five years, which
will be the largest research investment ever made by a Spanish pharmaceutical company.
Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve SA
Laboratorios del Dr Esteve SA (Esteve) is one of Spain's biggest
chemical-pharmaceutical companies and has been in business for more than
70 years. The group's main activity is research into and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals,  fine chemicals and veterinary products. Financial results for
2004 showed a slight decline, with sales down by 3.2% from "844 million
(US$1.02 billion) in 2003 to "818 million (US$990.3 million). This was due primarily to the drop in sales in the  fine chemicals segment, from "294 million

Page 182 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(US$355.9 million) to "251 million (US$303.9 million). Exports were also
down by 5.4% to "224 million (US$271.2 million). However, the pharmaceutical division's sales rose by 3.1% to "567 million
(US$686.5 million), compared with "550 million (US$665.8 million) in 2003. Market Outlook
The Spanish pharmaceutical market will most likely continue to enjoy double-digit growth this year, supported by increasing foreign direct investment (FDI). Lured by the country's strategic location, excellent infrastructure, low costs and availability of highly educated personnel, pharmaceutical multinationals continue to regard Spain as an attractive center for investment. Spain also has a large untapped patient population and a broad investigative pool, making it an ideal market for clinical research. This should attract international drug manufacturers to produce their drugs and conduct clinical trials, increasing the inflow of FDI and at the same time creating more job opportunities.
Switzerland
Sector Overview
The highly successful Swiss pharmaceutical industry has more than a hundred years of experience and is renowned internationally for its innovativeness and active participation in R&D. This has placed Switzerland on the world map as a manufacturer of high-quality drugs, vitamins and healthcare products. Two of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies – Novartis AG and Roche AG – are based in Switzerland.
Industry Size and Value
The Swiss Society of Chemical Industries (SSCI) is the country's umbrella organization for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and has around 200 active member companies. According to SSCI, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry is Switzerland's second most important industry, as pharmaceutical products account for 25% of the country's product exports. The sector's trade balance is a key indicator of its performance. In 2003, it
exported close to "20.3 billion (US$24.6 billion) worth of pharmaceutical products. Imports totaled "10.5 billion, leaving a healthy trade surplus of "9.8 billion (US$11.9 billion). EFPIA reported that in 2003, Switzerland had the second highest pharmaceutical trade surplus, after Ireland.
Swiss companies are very much research-driven and account for about 5% of the world's pharmaceutical R&D. SSCI says that the chemical and pharmaceutical industry employs around 23% of total research staff in the country, making it one of Switzerland's most

Page 183 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
important research staff employers. The R&D laboratories of Swiss drug makers develop an average of three new active substances each year. Their consistent performance is due to their willingness to spend a large percentage of their revenues on R&D. For example, Novartis spends an average of 15% of its sales revenue on research each year. In 2003, the country's pharmaceutical R&D expenditure came close to "2.3 billion (US$2.78 billion). This made it the fourth largest pharmaceutical R&D spender among  European nations.
Leading Companies
Novartis AG (SWX: NOVN)
Novartis was the result of one of the largest mergers in history, between two great Swiss-based life sciences companies, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, in 1996. Currently, Novartis is a world leader in drug R&D and is one of the world's fastest growing pharmaceutical companies. Operating in more than 140 countries, the group offers drugs, generics and consumer health products and
services through its three business divisions – Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz and Novartis Consumer Health.
In 2004, Novartis had another successful year with strong double-digit growth in net sales and earnings. Net sales totaled "23.3 billion (US$28.2 billion), an increase of 14% compared with the previous year, due to the buoyant performance of its pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions, which reported 15% and 10% growth respectively. Hypertension treatment Diovan remained the best-selling drug with sales of "2.56 billion (US$3.1 billion), a surge of 28% over 2003. Novartis reported that sales of other leading products such as Gleevec⁄Glivec, Lamisil, Zometa, Lotrel, Sandostatin and Trileptal
also showed robust double-digit growth. In line with good sales performances, operating income climbed 11% to "5.37 billion (US$6.5 billion), while net income rose from "4.13 billion (US$5 billion) in 2003 to "4.79 billion (US$5.8 billion). Despite increases in various categories of operating costs, many
expenses expressed as a percentage of sales were down when compared with those in 2003. This positively affected the operating margin, which in turn resulted in an increase in operating income.
Regarded by industry experts as having one of the best pipelines, Novartis invested "3.47 billion (US$4.2 billion) in R&D in 2004. Up to 75 projects are currently in development, with many late-stage projects progressing on schedule. The group hopes to make five key submissions in the US and EU this year and expects to deliver another competitive performance, with record
sales and strong earnings. It anticipates high single-digit net sales growth, with further expansion in market share, particularly in pharmaceuticals.
Roche AG (SWX: RO)


Page 184 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Founded by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche in 1896, the company has now grown into
one of the top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world. With more than
100 years of experience, Roche has been active in the discovery, development and manufacturing of novel healthcare products and services.
As in previous years, the performance of Roche's pharmaceuticals division in fiscal 2004 remained impressive, with a 10% increase in sales revenue over the previous year to CHF21.7 billion (US$17.07 billion). The strong growth was driven by the group's oncology, virology and transplantation franchises. Its
anti-cancer drugs Avastin and Tarceva have been highly successful. Tarceva was the only drug in its class able to prolong the survival of late-stage lung and pancreatic cancer patients. Operating profit for the year amounted to CHF5.57 billion (US$4.38 billion), a surge of 19% compared with a year earlier. The operating profit margin rose 1.9% to 25.7% from 23.8% in 2003. Roche forecast that its pharmaceutical sales in 2005 will continue to outpace market growth and that operating profit will be in line with that in 2004. Mergers and Acquisitions
Novartis is looking to grab a share of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) market. In April, the Swiss pharmaceutical major transacted one of the biggest deals in the UK biotech sector to buy a global license for a combination COPD drug and inhaler device, PowderHale. Under the agreement, Novartis will pay a total of CHF476.6 million (US$375 million) to
Arakis Ltd, which developed the COPD drug, and Vectura Group Plc (LSE: VEC), which developed the inhalation device. Both UK companies are currently in
Phase II trials and the device could reach the fast-growing COPD market in
2010. The current market for COPD drug therapy is worth "3.3 billion (US$4 billion) per annum and could grow to "8.26 billion (US$10 billion) by 2010. On June 6, Novartis completed the acquisition of German-based generic
pharmaceutical company Hexal AG. Novartis is also in the process of acquiring
67.7% of shares of Hexal's US sister company Eon Labs Inc (NASDAQ: ELAB). If clearance from US regulators is given, Novartis will be paying around "6.85
billion (US$8.3 billion) to buy both companies. The deals will make Novartis' generic drugs division, Sandoz, a world leader in the generic drugs market. Market Outlook
With the Swiss pharmaceutical industry continuing to concentrate on innovation, R&D investment in search of revolutionary products is likely to
increase. Swiss companies are heavily focused on the international market, as

Page 185 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the domestic market is relatively small. As a result, there is likely to be more
M&A activity as the year progresses, as mergers and acquisitions are the key strategies by which pharmaceutical companies can enter and expand their share of foreign markets.
United Kingdom
Sector Overview
The UK is one of the world's largest producers of pharmaceuticals and is home to some of the most successful pharmaceutical companies. More than 70,000 people are employed in the UK industry, which has developed more than 100
of the world's top-selling medicines.
As one of the country's leading manufacturing sectors, the industry is hugely important to the UK economy. According to the ABPI, pharmaceuticals had a trade surplus of £3.4 billion (US$6.19 billion) in 2004. Britain exported an estimated £12.2 billion (US$22.22 billion) worth of pharmaceutical and medicinal products last year – an increase over 2003's £11.8 billion (US$21.5 billion). Key pharmaceutical export markets include the US, Canada, Japan and several European countries.
However, the health of the UK pharmaceutical industry is causing some concern. Despite the sector being research driven, pharmaceutical R&D investment has dropped. In 2003, it went down by £0.1 billion (US$0.18 billion) from 2002, to £3.2 billion (US$5.83 billion), according to ABPI. This was the first decline in more than ten years. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies have reduced capital expenditure – spending only £753 million (US$1.37 billion) in 2003, compared with the past five years' annual average of £925 million (US$1.68 billion). Several factors were highlighted as the main contributors to the declining figures: the parallel trade problem,
growing competition from Eastern  European countries for pharmaceutical R&D, high costs of clinical trials and the continuing poor take-up of new medicines. Nevertheless, the industry remains positive as the UK Government has pledged its support for medicine research by providing an additional £100 million (US$182 million) a year by 2008, of which part will be used to set up research institutes.
Leading Companies
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (LSE: GSK)
GlaxoSmithKline is a leading global research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare company. As  Europe's largest drug manufacturer, GSK is estimated

Page 186 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
to hold 7% of the world's pharmaceutical market and employs around 100,000
employees in more than 37 countries. Its range includes prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare products.
For the first quarter ended March 31, 2005, GSK reported turnover of £5.036 billion, up by nearly 4% compared with £4.85 billion (US$8.83 billion) in the previous corresponding period. Operating profit for the quarter was £1.75 billion (US$3.19 billion), a surge of 17% compared with the first quarter of
2004. The excellent performance was mainly due to buoyant sales of the company's key products in the US and  European markets. Sales for GSK's biggest selling product, Seretide⁄Advair, a treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rose 22% to £690 million (US$1.26 billion), while sales of its diabetes treatment, Avandia⁄Avandamet, which
was its second largest selling product, went up by 25% to £287 million
(US$522.8 million).

AstraZeneca  Plc (LSE: AZN)

AstraZeneca  is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies. It was
formed in 1999 as a result of a merger between Astra AB of Sweden and Zeneca Group Plc of the UK – two companies with similar science-based cultures and a shared vision of the pharmaceutical industry. With a group turnover of more than £8.23 billion (US$15 billion) last year,  AstraZeneca  is

Europe's second largest drug maker.
Its sales in the first quarter of 2005 were £3.15 billion (US$5.74 billion), up by 9% compared with the first quarter of 2004. The improved sales revenue was backed by strong performances by its key products in various categories, such as Nexium, Crestor, Symbicort, Casodex, Seroquel and Arimidex. Nexium, a gastrointestinal drug, was the biggest seller with £581 million (US$1.06 billion) in sales, whereas sales of Crestor, a drug used to lower cholesterol, recorded the most significant growth with an increase of 106% over the corresponding quarter last year. On the other hand, some key products did not perform well, with sales of anti-cancer drug Iressa down by
15% to £44.5 million (US$81 million). Prescriptions for Iressa dropped considerably after the company announced in December that the drug does not prolong the lives of lung cancer patients. Since then,  AstraZeneca  has withdrawn its application to sell Iressa in  Europe and has stopped actively selling the drug in the US.
Apart from improved sales revenue, the company also saw the quarter's

Page 187 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
operating profit soar by 34% to £795 million (US$1.45 billion). Similarly,
EPS rose 33% to reach £0.34 (US$0.63) from the first quarter of 2004's £0.26 (US$0.47). Proper management of expenditure resulted in a reduction of the company's R&D as well as general administration costs by 4% over the previous corresponding quarter. With an excellent performance in the first quarter,

AstraZeneca  is confident that it will be able to deliver another strong
financial performance this year. Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances
The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) is a not-for-profit and public-private partnership for the development of affordable and effective tuberculosis (TB) treatments. On March 21, GSK and TB Alliance announced that they would be working jointly on a drug discovery program to improve the treatment of TB. The main objective of the joint research program is to enhance the global TB drug pipeline with the addition of several novel classes
of compounds that use new mechanisms of action. With the partnership forged between the two parties, both experts in their own fields, it is hoped that new and shorter therapies can be developed to replace current TB drugs, which have seen no new developments in more than 40 years.
In April, GSK announced that it had agreed to buy Corixa Corporation (NASDAQ: CRXA), a US-based company which is active in the development of vaccines and products that regulate immunity. Both GSK and Corixa have been collaborating on various drug discoveries. GSK will acquire all of Corixa's scientific programs, assets and all of its related rights through the acquisition. This includes Corixa's Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL) adjuvant technology.
GSK has been using MPL in its pipeline of products. With the acquisition, GSK will no longer need to pay royalties or any other costs on future sales of its vaccines containing MPL. The buyout, a cash for stock transaction, is valued
at approximately £164.6 million (US$300 million) and is expected to close
later this year.

Europe's pharmacy giant Alliance Unichem Plc recently bought Spanish
pharmaceutical wholesaler Farmaceutica Central SA (Farmacen). Farmacen is one of Spain's largest pharmaceutical wholesalers with an annual turnover of more than "250 million (US$302.7 million). Alliance Unichem first announced the £33 million (US$60.1 million) acquisition in late February this year and completed it on May 11. According to Alliance Unichem, the acquisition is part of its strategy of developing a geographical presence throughout Spain. It will

enable it to service efficiently a greater proportion of  Europe's fifth largest
pharmaceutical market. Market Outlook
Every year, the NHS spends billions of dollars on medicines. Population increases and the rapid upward spiral of medicine costs have weighed heavily on the country's healthcare budget. According to the Health Department, the NHS spends approximately £11 billion (US$20 million) on medicines each year. However, with the PPRS agreement that came into effect in January this year, the NHS will be able to save more than £1.8 billion (US$3.28 billion) over the following five years. The pharmaceutical industry will benefit as well from the increased R&D allowance and financial incentives from the NHS for the introduction of innovative medicines. It is anticipated that with the increased NHS R&D allowance and the additional £100 million (US$182 million) research funding from the Government, pharmaceutical R&D investment will increase
and help to secure the competitiveness of the UK pharmaceutical industry. Currency Conversion Table

Current Environment
Sector Overview
The once flourishing pharmaceuticals industry in  Europe continued to face significant challenges during the first half of 2005. Strict industry and pricing regulations continued to restrict sector development and hence investor interest. This was partly blamed for continuing low levels of research and development expenditure, compared to previous years, and the trend towards pharmaceutical companies moving their manufacturing operations to North America and Asia, especially to China, Singapore and India.  European drug
makers have also criticized the delays for drug approvals. These factors helped slow growth in the sector over the last year, with year-on-year growth in 2004
at 17.9%, compared with 22% in 2003.

Another major challenge  European drug makers faced was high escalating
costs. These have unrelentingly restricted the innovation and competitiveness in Europe's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. By the end of 2004, two out of the ten top-selling medicines in the world derived from  Europe, as compared to six in 1992. Investment growth in research and development (R&D) dropped considerably in the past five years and is still declining. From
1980 to 2000, the average annual growth rate of pharmaceutical R&D expenditure in Europe was 66%; since 2001 it has been only 5% a year – a drastic decline. This has been due to the rising trend of medicine research costs, as higher costs bring a greater reluctance to invest. In 2001, the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University reported that the cost of producing a new drug in Europe was "870 million (US$1.05 billion); it is now about "1 billion (US$1.21 billion).
In the past six months, merger and acquisition activities have been frequent. Leading companies regards M&A as the most apt business strategy to expand their businesses and capture a wider market share. The M&A trend has been to acquire or work with a foreign company. The acquired company is usually an established company of the same sector and has an extensive reputation, technology or clientele which will benefit the buying company. For example, leading Belgian pharmaceutical company, Solvay SA (BXS: SOL) bought Fournier Pharma, a French-based laboratory. The acquisition will benefit Solvay greatly
in terms of market presence and revenues with Fournier Pharma present in over 30 countries and annual sales totaling more than "500 million.
But despite the challenges, the  European pharmaceutical industry was provided with opportunities with the accession of ten new  European Union (EU)
members in May 2004. According to analysts, with the inclusion of the new EU members, the industry's average annual growth rate has grown to 15%, compared to the previous 8%, when the EU only consisted of its original 15 members. The boost created by the accession of these new countries was that their low cost structure provides an opportunity for pharmaceutical companies to establish clinical trials and outsource, while remaining in the EU regulatory system. Recruiting patients is easier in  Europe and the market for sales is still largely unexploited. These opportunities could make the market more
attractive to foreign investors. Leading Companies
Leading European pharmaceutical companies were able to perform strongly

Page 190 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and report considerable growth in sales revenues despite the tough  European
business environment. One of the reasons was because many of these pharmaceutical companies have made strategically smart decisions to widen their business and market share by actively participating in M&A deals. In addition, their sales revenues do not depend on the domestic market but a large percentage comes from foreign markets i.e. the US, where the industry is not governed by tight pharmaceutical pricing regulations. For example, approximately 68% of pharmaceutical sales from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) derived from international markets with only 32% of sales revenues coming from Europe. Even for Merck KGaa and Novartis, more than 50% of their
turnover was from products sold in the US, Asia-Pacific and other international markets.
Strong growth in sales for the first quarter of 2005 gave Belgium's leading chemical-pharmaceutical group Solvay SA confidence for the year ahead.
The group reported consolidated sales revenue for the quarter of "2.09 billion (US$2.53 billion), an increase of 14% from the corresponding quarter the previous year. There was significant improvement across all its business sectors, particularly chemicals and plastics. Solvay is looking to accelerate the growth of its pharmaceutical activities and is achieving its objective through several key acquisitions. The most recent is Fournier Pharma, a privately owned French company, which Solvay is buying for "1.3 billion
(US$1.57 billion).
Newly-transformed, UCB Group (BXS: UCB) is now fully operational under a single organization. The former pharmaceutical and specialty chemical leader has become a pure biopharmaceutical company, after completing the divestment of its surface specialties division in February. The division accounted for approximately half the group's "3.1 billion (US$3.75 billion) turnover for fiscal 2004. Despite losing this revenue, UCB is optimistic about this year's financial results as its biopharmaceutical business is expected to perform well, enabling it to offset the loss of income.
Buoyant sales of pharmaceuticals and human vaccines boosted the financial performance of French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis SA in the first three months
of 2005. Its pharmaceuticals and human vaccines business generated net sales of "6.42 billion (US$7.77 billion), up by 8.4% from "5.9 billion
(US$7.14 billion) in the first three months of 2004. Gross profit was "4.96 billion (US$6 billion), 9.9% higher than in the first quarter of 2004. Sanofi's
best-selling cardiovascular drug Lovenox enjoyed 18.2% growth, or "500
Page 191 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
million (US$605.3 million), in net sales. However, sales of Lovenox may fall
once generic versions of the drug produced by US-based Amphastar Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TEVA) are approved for sale in the US market. Sanofi-Aventis has been in a US patent fight with Amphastar and Teva since 2003. It is now appealing a June 15 ruling by a US District Court in favor of the generic drug makers.
Cerep SA (EURONEXT: CER) made a loss in the first quarter of 2005, despite a
4.6% increase in sales revenues to "12.11 million (US$14.7 million). The French drug discovery firm attributed the "2.18 million (US$2.64 million) loss to provisions for staff lay-offs in its in-vivo pharmacology division that has
endured recurring losses. Cerep anticipates the current year's sales revenues to grow by up to 9% from last year, as the company plans to put a new range of products onto the market.
Despite a weakened pharmaceutical industry following healthcare reforms, companies in Germany continued producing strong financial results. An expansion in business resulting from two major acquisitions last year contributed an additional 2.9% in revenue growth to major pharmaceutical distributor Celesio AG. In the first quarter of 2005, the company reported "4.9 billion (US$5.93 billion) in revenues, an increase of 6.2% over the
corresponding quarter in 2004. Revenues would have increased by just 3.3% if not for the acquisitions. The pharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA
(FSE: MRK) posted double-digit growth in the first quarter ended March 31. Sales of pharmaceuticals amounted to "900.2 million (US$1.09 billion), an
11.3% improvement over the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Merck's pharmaceutical sector is made up of the ethical, generics and consumer healthcare divisions.
Financial results for leading Spanish drug manufacturers in fiscal year 2004 showed mixed performances. Almirall Prodesfarma SA, Spain's leading pharmaceutical firm, saw sales grow by only 1.6%, or "13.9 million
(US$16.8 million), to "900 million (US$1.09 billion) from "886.1 million (US$1.07 billion) in 2003. Sales in the domestic market totaled "562 million (US$680.4 million), while the international market contributed "338 million (US$409.2 million). Last year's figures for Laboratorios del Dr Esteve SA, one of Spain's biggest pharmaceutical companies, showed a drop in sales revenue from "844 million (US$1.02 billion) in 2003 to "818 million
(US$990.3 million). This was due to the decline in both export value and sales

of fine chemicals (active ingredients).
Swiss drug makers continued to report excellent overall growth in sales and financial performances because of their rich pipeline of products. In the first three months of 2005, Novartis AG recorded "6.06 billion (US$7.34 billion) in sales, up by 11% compared with the first three months of 2004. The
double-digit growth was mainly driven by solid sales of its pharmaceuticals and generics segment (Sandoz) that contributed 65% and 11% of total group sales. The group's net income advanced 16% to "1.24 billion (US$1.5 billion) from "1.07 billion (US$1.3 billion) a year earlier. This year, Novartis expects to
gain further market share, maintaining its position as one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies. A series of successful product launches and strong market demand contributed to the increase in earnings for Roche AG. In the first quarter, Roche recorded sales of CHF8.1 billion
(US$6.37 billion), a surge of 17% over the corresponding period in 2004. The cancer treatment Avastin, which was launched in  Europe early this year, posted first quarter sales of CHF260 million (US$204.5 million). The influenza drug Tamiflu recorded CHF424 million (US$33.6 million) in sales – an
impressive threefold increase due to high demand at the start of the flu season. Leading British pharmaceutical companies got off to a positive start in 2005.
For the first three months ended March 31, GlaxoSmithKline Plc reported that sales of its pharmaceuticals division went up by 6% to £4.3 billion (US$7.83 billion), compared with the first quarter of 2004. GSK's key pharmaceutical growth drivers included Seretide (asthma), Avandia (diabetes), Lamictal (epilepsy), Valtrex (Herpes) and Coreg (cardiovascular) – all of which had sales growth of between 22% and 50%. From the second quarter onwards, GSK expects to launch several new products, which include treatment for restless
leg syndrome – Requip; childhood vaccine – Boostrix; post-operative ileus
(intestinal obstruction) treatment – Entereg; and flu vaccine – Fluarix.

AstraZeneca  Plc (LSE: AZN) achieved £3.13 billion (US$5.7 billion) in sales in
the first quarter, compared with £2.8 billion (US$5.1 billion) in the previous corresponding period. Sales performances in and outside of the US were equally strong – up by an average of 10%. In terms of value, sales in the US remained the highest, totaling £1.37 billion (US$2.5 billion) in the first quarter.
Sector Performance
In the first half of 2005 ended June 30, 2005, most  European pharmaceutical

Page 193 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
stocks advanced in share prices while some stock performances were
disappointing. Approximately 16 major  European pharmaceutical companies are included on the FTSE  European Pharmaceuticals Index with total market capitalization valued at "475 billion as at July 2005. During the six months
period from January 1 to June 30, 2005, Merck KGaA recorded a 40% rise in its share price, with other advancing stocks including GlaxoSmithKline, Roche
AG and Sanofi-Aventis, whose share prices gained 10.5%, 11.5% and 5.75%
respectively. In the same period, stocks that did not perform well include

AstraZeneca  Plc, which saw a 6% dip in its share price, and Schering AG, whose
share price tripped 16%.
For the twelve months ended June 2005, the FTSE  European Pharmaceuticals Index progressively rose 19.5% to reach its 52-week high of 804.16 points on June 1, 2005 from its 52-week low value of 672.6 points on November 30,
2004. The November 30 index value was a result of a flurry of bad press over pharmaceuticals during the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily relating to drug safety concerns and pressure for lower drug prices that had affected the entire global pharmaceuticals sector. However, as the sector progressed in 2005, consumer confidence gradually returned, and along with reports of robust pharmaceutical sales and strong financial results from  European drug makers, investors regained their confidence and boosted its performance.
Sector Investment
Due to increasingly challenging environments and rising production costs in

Europe, many large European companies recently began to look to Asia, where
the market is large and operating costs are low. In January, Merck KGaA
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Governor of Gyeonggi Province relating to an expansion of its South Korean facility located in Poseung. According to the MOU, Merck will invest approximately "8.26 million (US$10 million) over the next five years and will hire residents of the province
as employees as well as co-operate with local small and medium enterprises. In return, the Provincial Government will provide Merck with hiring and education incentives, priority assistance and any consultation required for the expansion plan.
Swiss drug maker Novartis is further strengthening its presence in Asia and, in
March, began the construction of its tablet production facility in Singapore. The "148.6 million (US$180 million) facility will have a capacity of 3.5 billion units and will manufacture at least three of Novartis's blockbuster products –

Page 194 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Diovan for blood pressure, cancer treatment Glivec and Zelnorm to treat
irritable bowel syndrome. This latest investment will enhance its existing network of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants.
One of the EU's new members, Hungary, will soon enhance its flourishing pharmaceutical industry. On March 15, Teva Hungary, a subsidiary of one of the world's leading generics companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, announced that it would build an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production plant in the town of Sajobabony. The project will cost Teva "75 million (US$90.8 million), provide up to 100 jobs and further boost Hungary's pharmaceutical exports.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliance Activities
This year, a number of  European pharmaceutical companies continued efforts to buy foreign companies in an attempt to enhance and expand their market positions abroad. Despite the subdued level of M&A activities by leading German pharmaceutical firms, one German company was particularly active in the market. Stada Arzneimittel AG is a health company that focuses on three
core segments – generics, branded products and special pharmaceuticals – and on off-patent active ingredients, known as multi-source products. In the past
six months, the company completed three major acquisitions. In January, Stada successfully completed its acquisition of 97.47% of the shares of the fourth largest Russian pharmaceutical company Nizhpharm OJSC. The anticipated buyout price, when the agreement was signed last November, was between "80 million (US$96.8 million) and "85 million (US$102.9 million). In April, Stada bought Ciclum Farma Unipessoal LDA, a Portuguese generics supplier, for "31 million (US$37.5 million). Ciclum is the sixth largest
company in the Portuguese generics market. As Stada does not have a presence in Portugal, the buyout will enable the company to leverage existing product approvals for generics through Ciclum's sales structure. On May 11, Stada strengthened its presence in China through the acquisition of 58% of Beijing Center-Lab Pharmaceutical Company Ltd (BCP) from Center International
Group Ltd for "3.5 million (US$4.24 million). The three acquisitions were important, strategic steps, reflecting a major part of the international expansion of Stada's activities.
In May, Lithuania's largest pharmaceutical producer⁄manufacturer, AB Sanitas, bought the Slovak drug maker Hoechst-Biotika, a successful joint-venture between Slovakian pharmaceutical company BIOTIKA Slovenská ¼upèa, one of Slovakia's leading pharmaceuticals producers, and Aventis Pharma GmbH. The transaction was worth an estimated "12.7 million (US$15.4 million).

European companies also recently exhibited greater enthusiasm for alliance
and partnership activities. In April, UK-based drug delivery company Skyepharma Plc (LSE: SKP) formed a strategic partnership with UK-based Mundiphama International Ltd to market and distribute its novel pain-control formulation DepoBupivacaine. This is an improved aesthesia drug, the effect of which can be extended up to four days, compared with current formulations
that last only eight to 12 hours. Skyepharma expects to receive up to "61
million (US$73.8 million) and a percentage from sales of the formulation in

Europe and other markets.
On June 4, leading  European healthcare group Alliance Unichem Plc
(LSE: AUN) formed a strategic partnership with Portugal's National Association of Pharmacies (ANF). ANF will pay "49 million (US$59.3 million) for a 49% stake in Alliance Unichem's Portuguese wholesale business, Alliance Unichem Farmaceutica SA. The partnership will benefit Alliance Unichem greatly, due
to ANF's exclusive position in the Portuguese market. Both ANF and Alliance Unichem will invest an additional "15 million (US$18.2 million) each to allow Alliance Unichem Farmaceutica to take full advantage of opportunities available under the partnership.
Industry Profile
Industry Size and Value

Europe has the second largest pharmaceutical industry in the world after North
America. In 2004,  Europe's sales of pharmaceutical products, which included direct and indirect purchases from pharmaceutical wholesalers and manufacturers, totaled "126.4 billion (US$153 billion) or close to 30% of the global total, according to IMS Health, a firm that provides information and strategies relating to the drug and healthcare industries. Year-on-year growth in 2004 was 17.9%, compared with 22% in 2003.
Belgium's small population has one of the highest per capita pharmaceutical expenditures in the world. From approximately US$400 in 2001, it is expected to reach close to "495.6 (US$600) this year. Due to rising healthcare and pharmaceutical costs, the Belgian Government has resorted to
cost-containment measures to curb soaring expenditure. Belgium is the largest importer and exporter of pharmaceutical products, according to the  European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). In 2003, it imported "23.2 billion (US$28.1 billion) worth, while exports amounted to
"22.6 billion (US$27.4 billion).

France has the fourth largest pharmaceutical market in the world, with
100,000 people working in various areas of the industry and more than 15% working in research. In 2003, the market was worth "21.3 billion (US$25.87 billion), a 7% increase over "19.9 billion (US$24.1 billion) in 2002. France also performed strongly in pharmaceutical import and export sales, with exports worth "14.5 billion (US$17.6 billion) in 2003. This was much more than the
"8.6 billion (US$10.4 billion) of pharmaceutical imports, leaving a healthy
trade surplus of "5.9 billion (US$7.14 billion). French citizens have easy access to medicines and healthcare services and the country's drug consumption rate and expenditure is one of the highest in the world.
Germany has the largest pharmaceutical market in  Europe and ranks among the top three in the world. Some of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies are German, including Merck KGaA, Schering AG (FSE: SCH) and Bayer AG (FSE: BAY). The pharmaceutical business has exhibited weaker growth in the past few years – affected by severe constraints imposed by the German Government such as the reference-pricing system and mandatory rebate on drugs, which were initially implemented to reduce rising healthcare expenditure. According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, healthcare costs represent more than 10% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) each year.
In the EU, Spain is the fifth largest pharmaceutical market, with a value of more than "10 billion (US$12.1 billion). The country is also a growing center
for pharmaceutical R&D. Spain's Ministry of Industry and Commerce says that more than "600 million (US$726.4 million) is spent on R&D each year as Spanish pharmaceutical companies allocate more than 5% of their total sales to research. Between 1990 and 2004, pharmaceutical R&D investment grew by more than 200%, according to FarmaIndustria, the National Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry in Spain, making pharmaceuticals the most innovative industry in the country.
Switzerland has a very mature and successful pharmaceutical industry with a high degree of specialization in the area of diagnostics and vitamins. Swiss pharmaceutical companies have produced more than 30,000 products, which are marketed worldwide. Although the domestic market is comparatively small, worth about "3 billion (US$3.63 billion), the country's pharmaceutical exports are among the highest in  Europe. In 2003, Switzerland was the third
largest European exporter of pharmaceuticals, after Belgium and Germany,

Page 197 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
selling "20.3 billion (US$24.6 billion) worth to international markets. The
pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland employs around 30,000 people and has established its international presence in more than 100 countries.
The UK is one of  Europe's leading pharmaceutical markets with innovative and research-driven companies having produced close to a quarter of the world's
top-selling drugs. Every year, more than a third of their sales revenues are spent on R&D. Some of the major developments pioneered in the UK include semi-synthetic penicillins and new treatments for cancer, asthma, HIV⁄AIDS, migraine, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, hypertension, schizophrenia and fungal infections. The pharmaceutical sector is one of the UK's most dynamic industries, playing a key role in the country's economy. In 2004, the UK exported an estimated £12.2 billion (US$22.22 billion) worth of
pharmaceutical products, which brought in a trade surplus of £3.4 billion
(US$6.2 billion), according to ABPI. Research and Development
As one of the most lucrative industries, the pharmaceutical sector is a key
asset of the EU economy. Research, as always, is the industry's core activity, as it is important for it to be able to develop new and effective drugs to maintain
its competitiveness. The EFPIA reports that pharmaceutical research accounts for 15% of total EU business R&D expenditure. It is estimated that in 2004, a total of "21.5 billion (US$26 billion) was invested in R&D, a 4.9% increase over
2003. However, the level of research investment has dropped considerably in the past five years with only single-digit annual growth, where before, R&D
expenditure grew by a double-digit percentage each year.

Europe used to be at the forefront of pharmaceutical research but this changed
when the industry's R&D investment level started falling. In the early 90s,

Europe was the world-leading inventor of medicines and accounted for more
than 40% of the total number of new drugs developed, more than double the number produced by the US. However, the number of new  European inventions has fallen and it now lags behind its main competitor, the US. Rising R&D expenditures, a strict pricing scheme and industry regulations have seriously affected the industry, pushing pharmaceutical companies and drug makers to move their manufacturing operations to North America and Asia, especially
India, China and Singapore.

Source:  European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Apart from spiraling research costs,  European drug makers have been discouraged by what they see as a rigid regulatory system governing the entire EU. There are more than 3,000 laws that cover drug pricing, manufacturing standards, corporate compliance and other aspects. In addition,  European regulators often delay the approval of new medicines, a huge setback to drug makers who spend years and billions of dollars to produce them.  Europe needs to step up its efforts to improve research innovation to remain competitive in
the pharmaceutical industry. One of the many ways to achieve this would be to improve the current strict regulatory environment and overcome
sales-hampering problems such as parallel trading. Regulatory Environment
In many parts of  Europe, the sector is constrained by heavy regulation. It is the regulatory regimes that have been blamed for, among other things, a lack of innovation and investment over the last few years. In Germany, for example, a new reference pricing system was implemented and went into effect on
January 1, 2005. Under the new system, drugs are categorized by pharmacological equivalence. Hence, patented and generic products are listed under the same group, and reference prices are set based on the difference between the cheapest and most expensive drugs. This means that a generic and a patented drug may be priced similarly because they have similar functions. Thus, patients may be paying generic drug prices for patented drugs. Though patients will benefit from this system, the industry and patented drug manufacturers will experience a loss in revenues. In addition, the market will
no longer be competitive as generic and patented medicines are equivalently priced.
A new pricing scheme was also implemented in the UK. The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) came into effect at the beginning of this year. The PPRS is a voluntary scheme between the British Government and the pharmaceutical industry, represented by ABPI. The scheme will run for five years from January 2005 and aims to balance the National Health Service's
Page 199 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(NHS) cost control measures while supporting the research-based industry. NHS
is an organization under the Department of Health that looks after the health and welfare of the population. Under the PPRS, branded medicines covered by the NHS will undergo a 7% price reduction. Doing so, the NHS will be able to save more than £1.8 billion (US$3.28 billion) over the next five years. Apart
from the savings, PPRS also includes an increased allowance for R&D (up to 28% of NHS sales) with financial incentives for the introduction of innovative medicines including those for children.

·Most leading  European pharmaceutical companies performed exceptionally well in the first quarter of 2005 with good growth in sales and profits.
Sanofi-Aventis SA (EURONEXT: SAN), Celesio AG (FSE: CLS), Novartis AG (SWX: NOVN), Roche AG (SWX: RO) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (LSE: GSK), each reported sales revenue of more than "4 billion.
·Drug makers in Europe continued to target Asia as a preferred investment destination. Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Novartis AG spent "148.6 million (US$180 million) to construct a production facility in Singapore, to further strengthen its presence.
·In 2004, sales of pharmaceutical products in  Europe grew by nearly 18% to achieve a total of "126.3 billion (US$153 billion).
·In the past six months alone, German healthcare company, Stada Arzneimittel AG (FSE: SAZN) bought pharmaceutical companies in Russia and Portugal as well as more than half of the shares of a Chinese pharmaceutical company. Industry Profile
·The EU holds 28% of total global pharmaceutical sales and is the second largest pharmaceutical industry in the world.
·The UK is one of the few EU countries with a positive trade surplus each year. According to the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), the UK pharmaceutical's trade surplus in 2004 amounted to £3.4 billion (US$6.2 billion).
·In Germany, rising expenditures and a new reference pricing system is adversely affecting the competitiveness and innovation of the industry.
·In the past five years, the annual growth rate of  Europe's pharmaceutical

Page 200 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
research and development (R&D) expenditure has gone down from double-digit
growth to single-digit growth.
·It is estimated that pharmaceutical research expenditure in 2004 rose by 4.9%
from 2003 to reach "21.5 billion (US$26 billion). Market Trends and Outlook
·The take-up of generic drugs in  Europe is rising, following a change in drugs use driven by lower costs and the promotion of generic drugs by  European governments.
·The European generic drugs sector was worth approximately "7 billion (US$8.47 billion) in 2003 and is expected to go up to "15 billion (US$18.2 billion) by 2010.
·Research on nanotechnology has been heavily emphasized in the healthcare
and pharmaceutical industry over the past two years. For 2002 to 2006, the

European Commission has allocated "1.3 billion (US$1.57 billion) in funding
for nanotechnology research.
·Healthcare costs are expected rise significantly and further burden
hard-pressed European governments as the population in  Europe continues to age rapidly. However, drug makers should benefit as this means that demand for drugs will rise.
The profitability of the  European industry is at risk as a result of falling
investment in drug R&D. Apart from a proposed increase in R&D funding,

European regulators are considering taking away drug price control regulations.

The generic drugs sector in  Europe has grown stronger over the years. With prices of pharmaceutical products rising rapidly year over year, governments and patients have turned to using generic drugs, which have proven to be as effective as brand-name drugs but at the fraction of the cost. For example, a comparison made between a cholesterol reducing drug, Zocor by Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK), and its generic version, Simvastatin, shows a price difference of nearly 40%. Zocor costs "0.60 (US$0.73) per unit while Simvastatin costs "0.38 (US$0.46) per unit. In some cases, generic drugs can be cheaper than brand-name drugs by as much as 80%.

Generics account for 60% to 75% of medicines by volume in Central and Eastern  Europe, and 40% to 55% in Northern  Europe (Denmark, Germany, the UK, etc), according to the European Generic Medicines Association (EGA). In 2003,  Europe's generic drug sector was valued at around "7 billion (US$8.47 billion). The take-up of generics will rise as more
European countries implement cost-cutting initiatives in national healthcare systems and as consumer awareness becomes keener due to generic drug promotions. In addition, patents are expiring on blockbuster drugs, which in turn benefits generic drug makers. Some of the world's top-selling drugs that will lose patent this year include Pfizer Inc's (NYSE: PFE) antibiotic Zithromax, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BME) hyper-cholesterol treatment Pravachol and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) painkiller Duragesic. These drugs have
an average annual sales turnover of "825 million (US$1 billion) each. By 2010, the European generic drug sector is projected to be worth more than "15 billion (US$18.2 billion).
Growing Importance of Nanotechnology R&D
Page 203 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nanotechnology is proving to have various applications within the  European healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, particularly in areas involving targeted therapy, drug development and discovery. The technology uses tools and materials created from molecular and
atomic-sized particles, also known as nanoparticles, which are too small to be seen with a conventional laboratory microscope. Nanotechnology can create faster and more effective drug delivery systems. For example, in cancer therapies, the use of nanoparticles ensures that the treatment reaches the targeted cancerous cells only, leaving healthy cells undamaged.
In the past two years, the EU has placed great importance on nanotechnology
and has been investing heavily in research. In 2002, the  European Commission introduced the Sixth Framework Program for Research and Technological Development (FP6). The objectives of FP6 are to strengthen the scientific and technological bases of industry and encourage its international
competitiveness, while promoting research activities in support of other EU policies. The program, which runs from 2002 to 2006, has a total budget of "17.5 billion (US$21.1 billion), including "1.3 billion (US$1.57 billion) for nanotechnology. The Seventh Framework Program (2007 to 2013) is under preparation and funding for nanotechnology research could be twice the amount in FP6. EU governments have recognized the importance of this
technology and are consequently allocating more funds for research in the area. For example, France, increased its nanosciences and nanotechnologies funding in 2004 to "70 million (US$84.7 million) a year. Germany and the UK
earmarked "50 million (US$60.5 million) and "130 million (US$157.4 million)
respectively for their nanotechnology initiatives.

Europe's strong participation in nanotechnology research activities may take
the region's R&D to the next level and improve productivity. According to a report by Lux Research, a leading nanotechnology research and advisory firm, nanotechnology could help solve the  European pharmaceutical industry's pipeline problems by improving the delivery and efficacy of developmental and marketed drugs.

European Population Ageing
The populations of  European nations are experiencing a demographic change as the number of elderly people rises. Global consultancy firm McKinsey & Co says that over the next 20 years, the number of people aged more than 65 is expected to surge by 16% compared with 2002. This means that by 2025, one in every five Europeans  will be aged over 65. The main factors behind this are increasing life expectancy and low birthrates. Thirty years ago, the median
age of the population in the UK and Germany was only 33 and 35 respectively.
It is likely that by 2025, the median age in the UK will rise to 41 while that in

Page 204 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Germany will climb to 47.
Ageing further burdens already hard-pressed government healthcare schemes. In the UK, total expenditure on healthcare for older people in 2000 was close
to £12.9 billion (US$23.5 billion). With the ageing population, it is likely that the healthcare expenditure for the elderly will increase to £53.9 billion (US$98.2 billion) by 2051. Many governments worldwide have been under
budgetary pressures as a result of spiraling healthcare expenditures. Measures to try and contain the costs have included reference pricing schemes which control the prices of pharmaceutical products. Although bad for governments, the ageing of the population should benefit the pharmaceutical industry as
there will be a greater demand for drugs and pharmaceutical products to treat diseases common among older people.
Market Outlook
The pharmaceutical industry in  Europe has reached a major turning point and is facing some tough challenges. The product pipeline of drug manufacturers is falling, due to the lack of activity and investment in drug research. Between
1990 and 2003, investment in R&D in  Europe grew by only 2.6 times, compared with the fourfold rise in the US, according to EFPIA.  European drug makers are hesitant to invest in drug research, as they may not recover their investment
due to regulations, such as Germany's reference pricing system. However, the product pipeline could grow as the  European pharmaceutical industry enters
the era of nanotechnology research.

Europe may well see its pharmaceutical industry regain its former success
thanks to a new strategy recently proposed by the EU Industry and Enterprise

Commission. Under the strategy, which aims to improve the competitiveness of
the pharmaceutical industry within the EU, the  Commission proposes to increase R&D spending to "73.2 billion (US$88.6 billion) under the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). Authorities are examining other ways to allow pricing flexibility within the industry, such as lifting pricing controls for medicines and tackling parallel trade problems within the industry.

AstraZeneca  has been fined EUR 60 M by the  European Commission after it charged the company with serious abuse of its dominant market position in relation to its ulcer drug Losec. The ruling was reached after a six-year investigation into the extension of Losec's licence and the company's attempts to prevent release of the drug's copies to market. Astra was proven guilty of feeding misleading data to some national drug regulators and prevented generic copies of the drug from emerging by misusing Scandinavian health regulator rules.

More than 70 per cent of financial advisors arranging equity release plans fail to gather enough
information about their clients to know whether the products they are sell are suitable, an FSA study finds.
And, once the lifetime mortgage has been sold, consumers are being advised to invest some of the equity
released in products that are not suitable for their needs and may unnecessarily expose them to risk. The
FSA is to distribute an advice leaflet on the products.

Depolarisation comes into full effect: where previously advisers were 'independent' - advising on products from the whole of the market - or 'tied' to the products of only one provider, now advisers can also offer
'multi-tied advice' using a panel of providers. New disclosure rules will require advisers to provide two
'keyfacts' documents on services and costs, with a 'menu' of  commission rates. Independent advisers will
have to offer consumers the option to pay for advice by a fee.
Communications

that claims to make hair 'spring back to life', while a TV ad for a new KFC salad, which shows people singing with their mouths full, prompts record levels of complaints.
29 April

Ofcom concludes that MKD Holdings, the owner of Kitchens Direct UK, has breached guidelines for the second time by making silent telephone calls to households, that is, automated calls made for which there is no operator available when the call is answered. The regulator has given the company formal notification that it must cut the number of such calls, by reducing the number of outward-bound calls that are silent to the agreed guideline of no more than 5 per cent by the end of May.
17 May
A study carried out in Sweden has concluded that mobile phone users who live in the countryside are
more likely to develop brain tumours than those in towns or cities. The researchers claim the finding is due
to handsets operating at greater power levels when they are further away from transmitters (transmitter
masts are more spaced out in the countryside). Mobile phone manufacturers reject the findings, noting
that all mobile phones operate at power levels that are within international safety limits.
24 May

Ofcom's new broadcasting code, which comes into force on 25 July, says broadcasters must take 'all reasonable steps to protect people under 18', going further than the traditional 9pm watershed, which is aimed at protecting the interests of children under 15 and remains in place. The ban on product placement also remains, though there will be a consultation on this later in the year. In June, the ASA's new
guidelines on TV, print and poster ads tightens the rules on drink advertisements, with provisions including a ban on any reference to sex and on ads that 'reflect the culture of under-18s.

Ofcom is to extend current controls over termination charges (what mobile phone companies can charge for connecting calls from other mobile networks or fixed-line operators) until March 2007. The  European Regulators Group is currently concerned about 'roaming' charges for calls made when the owner is abroad.
8 June

In its response to the government's green paper on the renewal of the BBC's royal charter, Ofcom backs the creation of an independent regulator to oversee the BBC and the public service obligations of other broadcasters. It also says the TV licence fee should be increased and the money shared out between the BBC and its commercial rivals.

the OFT for price-fixing on a range of toys between 1999 and 2001 were fair, though the  fines themselves
are cut. Both firms are considering an appeal. In May, the tribunal orders Manchester United and several
leading sportswear firms to pay more than £16m in  fines for fixing the price of replica football shirts,
though again it cuts the OFT's  fines on Man Utd, JJB Sports and Umbro while increasing the  fine levied
on retailer Allsports. JJB Sports says it plans to appeal against the tribunal's ruling.

Fifa has changed the way that football supporters can buy tickets for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with supporters now able to make a bank transfer in their local currency rather than the original methods of either paying by MasterCard credit card or paying the international bank transfer surcharge. The
change follows a Which? complaint to the  European Commission over the exclusive deal struck between FIFA, MasterCard and the German Football League. Fans who incurred additional administrative costs will be reimbursed.
19 May

A 10-month investigation by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) into private, voluntary and council care homes says that residents are often saddled with hidden costs, arbitrary fee increases and top-up
charges. One in five homes charged those who are paying their own fees hiqher rates than a state-funded residents receiving identical care. The investigation was prompted by a 'super-complaint' lodged by
Which? on behalf of a coalition of charities including Help The Aged. The OFT called for fairer treatment of the elderly, as well as better standards of advice and greater openness, in particular on contracts and
price lists.
24 May

British banks announce that they will reduce the time it takes to transfer money from one account to another, from three days to one, but claim it will take two years to achieve the change in automated payments such as direct debits and standing orders and in phone and internet banking. The move follows agreement with the OFT's payments systems taskforce.

Microsoft is to release an EU-approved version of its Windows XP system (without Windows media player) to comply with last year's  European Commission ruling that the company was abusing its dominant position. The company has already made concessions to enable rivals to supply software for servers that will 'inter-operate' with the company's Windows program.

AstraZeneca  is fined £40m by the European Commission for misleading government agencies and trying to block the sale of copies of its ulcer drug Losec in the late 1990s. The EC accused the firm of

Postal regulator Postcomm proposes a price cap that would see first-class stamps rise from the current 3p to no more than 34p and second-class from 21p to no more than 23p by 2010. The proposals, which are subject to consultation, also include tougher penalties for missing delivery targets. Royal Mail says that, unless the proposals are 'substantially' changed, it will make a complaint to the Competition  Commission.
6 June

MEPs vote to approve a draft EU directive that would lead to the mandatory installation of 'smart meters' that show exactly how much energy you use, when you use it. The meters can also be read remotely and would mean the end of estimated billing by energy suppliers.

At trade liberalisation talks in Paris, the EU offers a deal on how to define agricultural tariffs that would make it possible for all countries to compare accurately the size of their respective tariffs so they can agree by how much to cut them as part of the Doha round of global trade talks.

The ECJ says it has no jurisdiction to rule on the parallel trade in drugs. GlaxoSmithKline stopped supplying Greek wholesalers with certain drugs in late-2000 after the wholesalers re-exported the drugs to exploit differences in prices in the EU, only to start supplying them again (but in smaller quantities) after a ruling from the Greek competition  commission. The latter asked the ECJ to rule on whether such limits
on parallel trade were lawful, which the ECJ has now declined to do. Further legal cases are likely to ensue.

ECONOMICS:

* Hopes for a cut in interest rates this week faded after business activity in the services sector edged up in June, according to the latest CIPS purchasing managers' survey. The survey's headline reading rose to 55.8 for last month, from May's 55.1 -any figure over 50 indicates expanding activity. The rise in June was driven by a gain in new business, to its highest in three months, while business expectations also reached their best levels since March.

TD
* More doubt over an imminent rate cut was also sown by a rebound in the British Retail Consortium's barometer of high street activity. The total value of sales in June rose 3.5 per cent compared with a year earlier -stronger than the 1.4 per cent year-on-year gain in May. However, like-for-like sales, adjusting
for changes in retailers' floor space, still fell by 0.5 per cent in June compared with a year before.

* The UK construction sector grew at its fastest pace in six months in June, according to a CIPS survey of the industry. The purchasing managers' index of construction activity rose to 55.8 for last month, from May's 52.6.

* The dollar remained in buoyant form as markets continued to focus on expectations of more rises in US interest rates. The dollar's revival saw the  euro drop below $1.19 for the first time since May last year, with the single currency falling as far as $1.1888. Sterling also came under pressure, with the pound dropping to 14-month lows just above $1.75 before closing at $1.7612. Sterling was little changed against the  euro.

* Pressure on the  euro was increased by reports of remarks by Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, in which he said that it was possible for  eurozone member states to quit the single currency. However, M Noyer, in paraphrased remarks to the French National Assembly, said that such a move would carry risks and would call into question a country's EU membership.

* Activity in the  eurozone services sector slowed in June, according to NTC's purchasing managers' index, which fell to 53.1 for last month, from May's seven-month high of 53.5.

* Eurozone producer prices dropped by 0.2 per cent in May, in their first monthly fall this year,  Eurostat said. Year-on-year, prices for goods leaving  eurozone factories rose 3.5 per cent, the lowest pace of increase this year.
BANKING & FINANCE: UP 0.17%
* Britain's largest insurers have almost Pounds 27 billion more than they need to cover their promises to with-profits policyholders. The amount insurers set aside in excess of their liabilities rose by 16 per cent in the second half of last year, the Financial Services Authority said.

* AXA Real Estate Investment Management has won what is thought to be Britain's biggest property mandate to run the Pounds 2.5 billion external property fund portfolio owned by Co-operative Insurance Society.

* Britannic Group shares made a strong return from suspension as investors backed the company's plans to merge with Resolution Life, the closed funds group. The shares rose 101p to 610p.
* HSBC has poached Robin Down and Peter Toeman, top banking analysts, from Morgan Stanley, the
US investment bank, in addition to hiring Nigel Grinyer, an equity salesman, from the same bank.

* Morgan Stanley has appointed Tony Archer, a director of AXA Rosenberg, as head of its Asia-Pacific investment management business, to lead the group's expansion in mainland China and India.
CONSTRUCTION & PROPERTY: DOWN 0.3%
* Travis Perkins, the building materials group, cut its profit forecasts because of slower consumer spending and a lacklustre housing market. First-half like-for like sales fell 0.5 per cent, knocking its shares.

* The Central London hotel at the centre of the Ashley Cole "tapping-up" affair, has been put up for sale. Artesian Property Partnership is selling the Royal Park Hotel as part of the Pounds 30 million sale of its Argyll Townhouse Hotels business.
* Kier Group, the construction company, said it expects to deliver full-year profits at the higher end of
City forecasts, as public and private sector investment projects boosted its construction business and its
building maintenance business lifted services revenues.
CONSUMER GOODS: UP 0.06%
* The jobs of 1,600 workers at Christie Tyler Group are on the line after the collapse of Courts and Allders, the furniture retailers, forced the sofa maker into administration. Ernst & Young will kick-start a programme today to sell the company's operating units.
* Investors in Allied Domecq, the spirits group, gave their backing to the proposed $7.6 billion (Pounds
4.3 billion) takeover approach by Pernod Ricard, its French rival.

* Grampian Country Food Group, the UK's biggest meats business, has put pressure on Britain's leading supermarkets to pay 6 per cent more for pork pies and chicken drumsticks because of the soaring oil price. The move is a reversal of the traditional margin squeeze applied by supermarkets to their suppliers.

* Scottish & Newcastle, the drinks group that bought Bulmers in 2003, is to launch a premium brand cider to exploit the growing demand for cider drinks.
ENGINEERING: UP 0.04%
* IMI, the engineering group, is close to selling its Polypipe business, which makes toilet seats and garden furniture, among other things, to Castle Harlan, a US private equity firm, for about Pounds 300 million.
HEALTH: DOWN 0.22%

DOWN 0.84%

* Jurgen Hambrecht, the head of BASF, the German chemicals group, stuck by the group's internal financial goals for the year, despite the group's expectations of weaker third-quarter results.
LEISURE: DOWN 0.61%
* Urbium, the bar and nightclub operator, gave warning that difficult trading conditions are likely to continue this year as it reported a 1 per cent fall in first-half like-for-like sales against the same period last year. Last month the group rejected a proposed takeover offer from rival Regent Inns.

* Greene King, the pubs operator and brewer, has agreed a Pounds 45.6 million cash deal to buy TD Ridley & Sons, a smaller rival. The deal will give Greene King 73 mostly freehold pubs in Essex.
MEDIA: UP 0.54%
* Aegis Group, the advertising group, reported patchy growth in advertising spending in some parts of Europe but said it was on course to meet full-year expectations. The group said its results would be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year than last year.

* Worries about the health of the economy prompted ZenithOptimedia, the advertising forecaster and media buyer, to slash forecasts for advertising revenue growth. The agency cut its prediction for UK growth in 2005 to 2.9 per cent from 4.9 per cent, after a sharp downturn in advertising spending.
* Huntsworth, the marketing and communications group, is in talks to sell some of its businesses to
Media Square. The talks are at an early stage.

* JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has been  fined Euro 10 million (Pounds 6.8 million) by French competition authorities over compliance with a 1998 ruling on its French contracts. The group will appeal against the  fine, arguing that it complied with the ruling.
* Bonnier Group, the Swedish newspaper publisher, has bought a 50 per cent stake in Pari, the
Bulgarian financial newspaper.
NATURAL RESOURCES: UP 2.72%
* Paladin Resources, the London-based company, has won government approval for the Pounds 165 million development of the Blane North Sea oilfield, in which Dana Petroleum and Roc Oil also have a stake.

* Sibneft, the oil company controlled by Roman Abramovich, has tried to play down speculation that it is negotiating to be taken over by Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, and Royal Dutch Shell.
RETAILING: DOWN 0.78%
* Partners in the Baugur-backed consortium bidding for Somerfield met last night to discuss whether the Icelandic firm would stay on board after the emergence of fraud charges against some executives, including Jon Asgeir Johannesson, Baugur's chief executive.

* The number of shoppers in London on Saturday plunged 22 per cent compared with the same day last year, as people boycotted the high street to watch Live 8 and international sporting events on television, according to figures from SPSL, the retail analysts.

* Shares in James Beattie rose 4 per cent as the department store group, which has recommended a Pounds 69 million takeover by House of Fraser, said that it had received a second takeover approach, thought to be from Debenhams, the rival department store group.

* Asda, the giant supermarket chain, is poised to cut around 1,300 jobs as part of a cost-cutting review. Around 300 jobs are expected to go at its headquarters in Leeds with a further 1,000 throughout the stores.
SUPPORT SERVICES:
Page 219 of 221 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DOWN 0.12%

* Sir Peter Gershon, the former GEC director who became chairman of Premier Farnell in March, has wasted little time stamping his mark on the struggling electronics distributor after announcing the departure of its chief executive, John Hirst.
TECHNOLOGY: UP 0.32%
* Statpro Group, the software and computer services group, has agreed a deal worth up to Pounds 4 million to buy Delve, which provides software to the investment management industry.
TELECOMMS: UP 0.14%
* British companies such as BT could seize contracts worth millions of pounds from French rivals even if Paris wins the right to stage the 2012 Olympics.  European Union procurement rules dictate that, even if Paris wins the prize, it cannot simply hand major contracts to home-grown companies.
TRANSPORT: UP 0.34%
* The Office for National Statistics is resisting attempts to force it to reveal documents that could help
49,000 former investors in Railtrack prove their claim against the Government. The department has
refused to disclose documents relating to its classification of the proposed "company limited by
guarantee", which formed the basis of Network Rail.

* BAA, the world's biggest airport operator, is to spend more than Pounds 3 billion upgrading Heathrow over the next ten years, on top of the Pounds 4.2 billion cost of building Terminal 5.
