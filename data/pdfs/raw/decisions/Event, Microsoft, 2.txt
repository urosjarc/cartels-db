HD           EU states back Monti in standoff with Microsoft: Time running out for deal

BRUSSELS - The European Union's 15 member states yesterday backed the  European                    Commission's case against  Microsoft Corp.'s alleged  abuse of its Windows monopoly, making a commission decision against the software giant more likely.

Several big member states, led by Britain and Germany, specifically called for the Brussels watchdog to rule against  Microsoft rather than reach a last-minute deal, say people following the closed-door meeting. "The member states have unanimously backed the commission's draft decision," said a spokeswoman for Mario Monti, the  competition commissioner.

TD
However, one other person following the case said some countries were concerned that a Brussels decision would apply only to the EU and other European states. By contrast, a possible deal with Microsoft might apply worldwide, at least in part.

Brussels argues Microsoft has unfairly leveraged its dominance over personal computer operating systems into other markets, such as those for servers and for media player programs. It is due to rule on the case by March 24, when it plans to demand that  Microsoft share more information with rivals and give PC makers a choice of versions of Windows with and without its Media Player software.
Brussels also wants to impose a  fine -- understood to be in the 100-million-200-million
(US$122.3-million-US$244.7-million) range, although some lawyers think it could be more. The  fine is
set to be discussed by member states on March 22.

Yesterday's consultations with national  competition bodies are non-binding, but could have made life difficult for Mr. Monti if they had not backed his approach. By contrast, the national authorities' support for Mr. Monti now means it would be hard for him to reach a deal that differs substantially with his draft decision.

"Given the broad support for the commission proceedings among the member states, we certainly hope the commission will issue a decision imposing an effective remedy," said Dave Stewart, deputy legal counsel at RealNetworks Inc., one of  Microsoft's chief foes in the case.

Microsoft, which argues that other companies have limited rights to its intellectual property and that Media Player is an integral part of Windows, says it is working closely with Brussels to reach a deal. But time is running out.

Microsoft, which argues that other companies have limited rights to its intellectual property and that Media Player is an integral part of Windows, says it is working closely with Brussels to reach a deal. Talks continued throughout the weekend.

But time is running out for a deal, particularly because it would be difficult for Mr Monti to agree a settlement with  Microsoft if member states back a  fine as they may do next Monday.

Even before then the Commission would probably need to test any settlement with third parties such as computer manufacturers and the complainants in the case.
Two people following the case said that only 24 to 36 hours remained for negotiations.

However, others argued that the two sides still had the remainder of this week to reach a compromise deal.

Computer giant  Microsoft was yesterday staring at the possibility of a £2billion  fine for alleged market abuse after members of the  European Commission unanimously endorsed an action plan.

Brussels is getting impatient for action from the world's biggest software maker over the way it bundles its products together with the effect of excluding rivals.

TD
The EC wants  Microsoft to share some of the code for its Windows software with its competitors and stop bundling in other programmes such as media players.

A panel of EU experts is expected to discuss possible sanctions against  Microsoft as early as next week.

Microsoft avoided huge fines in the US in 2001 in a deal which allowed it to keep its Internet
Explorer programme bundled with Windows under certain conditions.

The European Commission scored a preliminary victory against  Microsoft Corp. as regulators from European Union member nations backed plans to punish the software giant for violating European antitrust law. The backing clears the way for the commission, the EU's chief  antitrust authority, to impose a fine and other sanctions against  Microsoft on March 24, more than five years after it began investigating the company's business practices. Barring a settlement, the decision would prohibit Microsoft from forcing computer makers in Europe to use its Windows Media Player audio-visual software and force  Microsoft to give other companies more information on how its Windows software works.

EU competition watchdogs remain "on track" to rule against software giant  Microsoft in a long-running probe next week, officials said Wednesday amid last-ditch talks seeking to resolve the row.
Negotiations late Tuesday between the US firm's chief executive Steve Ballmer and EU  Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti ended without a settlement of the anti-trust case.

TD
Monti's spokeswoman Amelia Torres reiterated that the talks "were continuing," but added: "We are on track for an announcement next week which was always the plan."

Ballmer met Monti in Brussels a week ahead of an expected ruling by the commission over its probe into alleged abuses of  Microsoft's overwhelmingly dominant position in the personal computer market.
Ballmer's unannounced trip to Brussels came a day after anti-trust experts from EU member states met
European Commission regulators and agreed to back the EU executive's appraisal of the case.

Monday's talks were about what anti-trust violations  Microsoft is guilty of and what remedies it should be compelled to undertake.

A further meeting next Monday will decide what  fines, if any,  Microsoft should face before the commission announces its final verdict in the five-year investigation two days later.

Although the EU could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, Monti has said he is mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of  Microsoft's domination in PC software.
In Microsoft's case, sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows
Media Player from the Windows operating system, which is used on 90 percent of PCs.

The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.

The EU investigation represents the last hope for  Microsoft's rivals after the company largely settled its anti-trust problems in the United States.

ATTENTION - UPDATES ///

Last-ditch talks between EU  competition watchdogs and Microsoft were locked in stalemate Wednesday, making it likely that the US software giant will be fined for monopolistic behaviour, sources said.

TD
Negotiations between  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, in Brussels on an unannounced visit, and EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti continued through the evening but were bogged down, sources close to the case said.
The European Commission is expected to announce on March 24 its long-awaited verdict on whether
Microsoft has unfairly abused its overwhelming dominance in software for personal computers.

Monti's spokeswoman Amelia Torres said earlier in the day that talks with  Microsoft "were continuing". But she added: "We are on track for an announcement next week, which was always the plan."

After five years of investigation, the European Union's executive branch is set - barring a last-minute settlement with  Microsoft - to order changes to the all-conquering Windows operating system.

The EU investigation represents the last hope for  Microsoft's rivals after the company largely settled its anti-trust problems in the United States.

Monti this week won the unanimous backing of EU member states for his draft verdict in the investigation and next Monday will decide with the governments the level of  fines - possibly running into hundreds of millions of euros.

"The likelihood of settlement seems remote. Politically speaking, Monti has no reason to settle because he has the unanimous backing of EU member states," one well-informed source told AFX News, AFP's financial news subsidiary.

Without a settlement,  Microsoft will be ordered to detach the Windows Media Player from its operating systems.

The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.
Rival companies such as RealNetworks and Apple complain that their media players cannot compete
fairly because of  Microsoft's practise of attaching its player to Windows, which comes pre-installed on 90
percent of PCs.

According to the draft decision cited by the sources, the company will also be ordered to provide interface information to its rivals in the low-end server market, so that their products can interact with those of Microsoft.

Low-end servers provide e-mail and intranet services to multiple users and handle large filing and printing tasks.


Page 12 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ballmer is understood to be offering a deal whereby  Microsoft would agree to offer interface information to its rivals but wants to continue offering Media Player as an integral part of Windows.
A settlement would avoid the prospect of the commission facing a drawn-out and costly battle as
Microsoft challenges its decision in the courts.

Monti has faced a series of embarrassing legal setbacks at the European Court of Justice over past anti-trust rulings.
But a partial settlement is out of the question, said the source.

"Microsoft is already giving more than it wants to on the interface information. If they take the commission to court over Media Player they might as well fight it all."

The company fears that being forced to unbundle Media Player from Windows could complicate the addition of future software to its operating system.

"Microsoft is strictly against offering an unbundled version. Its business model is to integrate all applications," the source said.
"Agreeing to unbundling sends a signal that this business model might not be successful in the future." ed-jit/nh.

HD       Microsoft, Monti reaching  stalemate in antitrust settlement talks - source. WC     536 words

BRUSSELS (AFX) -  Microsoft Corp and EU competition commissioner Mario Monti are reaching a stalemate in their bid to settle the EU's antitrust investigation into the software giant, said a source close to the case.

The European Commission is expected to announce on March 24 its decision on the Microsoft probe, and according to sources will rule that the company has breached EU law and must therefore be fined.

TD
According to the draft decision, the company will be ordered to provide interface information to its rivals in the low-end server market so that their products may interact with those of  Microsoft.

The company will also have to sell computer manufacturers a stripped-down version of its operating systems without Windows Media Player. The company is considered to be breaking EU law by selling these as a bundle.

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer is in town in a bid to reach a settlement with the commission to resolve the dispute. Otherwise, the company will seek to challenge the decision in court.
A source close to the case said its not in Monti's interests to settle.

"The likelihood of settlement seems remote. Politically speaking, Monti has no reason to settle because he has the unanimous backing of EU member states," the source said.

Microsoft's Ballmer meanwhile is cobbling together a deal whereby the company will agree to offer interface information to the company's rivals but wants to continue offering Media Player as an integral part of Windows.
A partial settlement is out of the question, said the source.

"Microsoft is already giving more than it wants to on the interface information," the source said. " If they take the commission to court over Media Player they might as well fight it all."

The source added: "If the company gives the interface information, then it wants to at least have something on the bundling front."

The company is staunchly defending its Media Player not because of the value of maintaining the software in the operating system but because this sets a legal precedent which could complicate the addition of further software.

"Microsoft is strictly against offering an unbundled version. Its business model is to integrate all applications. Agreeing to unbundling sends a signal that this business model might not be successful in the future."

Furthermore, said the source, this remedy would "set a precedent and will make the Windows operating system into some kind of public utility that would be used by its rivals".

Meanwhile, Monti, who has been criticised for previous decisions which have been overturned in court, is said to be keen to take a decision against the company, and has stressed that he has the EU behind him.
"There is nothing so unifying as a common enemy," said a source.

While the commission must be seen to be listening to the company, sources said that neither side is prepared to give any further.

A Microsoft spokesman told AFX that negotiations are ongoing but declined to comment further about the nature or content of the discussions.
Today's talks are set to go on until around 8 pm. emma.davis@afxnews.com

HD           EU Regulators Try To Get Concessions From Microsoft

BRUSSELS -- With a week to go before an expected decision in the European Commission's case against Microsoft Corp., Chief Executive Steve Ballmer met with top European antitrust regulator Mario Monti. But the two parted without announcing any progress in settlement talks.

Rather than compromise with  Microsoft to avoid an extended court battle, a person familiar with the commission's thinking said, Mr. Monti's team is trying to wring more concessions in a settlement than they would order in an official ruling against the company.

TD
For instance, in its draft ruling that  Microsoft violated antitrust law, the commission would order changes in how Microsoft offers its Media Player software in European computers, the person said. But in a settlement, the regulators were insisting that the changes apply world-wide. Regulators are presenting that difference as the price the company would pay for avoiding a finding that it abused its dominant position, possibly along with a hefty  fine.

The commission also wants  Microsoft to agree to be bound by the terms of any settlement just as it would by a formal commission decision, according to people familiar with the case.

Both Microsoft and the commission said talks between the two -- which  Microsoft says have been almost constant in recent weeks -- were likely to continue. Neither would comment on their substance. It wasn't clear if Messrs. Ballmer and Monti would meet again today. Also attending yesterday's meeting was Brad Smith,  Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs.

The meeting came a day after  antitrust advisers from the 15 European Union member governments approved the commission's draft ruling that the software titan had broken  antitrust law. That group reconvenes Monday to consider the size of a  fine. Absent a settlement, the commission is expected to conclude its five-year-old case a week from today with a far-reaching cease-and-desist order.

The EU wants  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player to give rivals such as RealNetworks Inc. a better shot at getting their players onto consumer desktops. It also would demand that  Microsoft release more basic Windows code to improve "interoperability" with competing networking software made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and others.

The main difference between a settlement and a decision is that under a settlement  Microsoft would admit to no wrongdoing and the commission would find none. Under current EU law, a settlement can't be challenged in court because it is not a formal administrative decision. But a provision in new rules that go into effect May 1 would allow the commission to follow a settlement, which can't be challenged, with a "settlement decision" that could be.

The industrial landlord bought co-owner Uniting Church out of its half stake in Sydney's Homebush Corporate Park for $34 million.

MGM is considering paying investors between $US6 and $US9 ($8.11-$12.16) a share -- the equivalent of about one year's revenue for the company -- in a one-time special dividend. The dividend would cost the Hollywood studio between $US1.4 billion and $US2.1 billion based on the approximately 235 million MGM shares outstanding. Billionaire financier Kirk Kerkorian and his investment firm Tracinda own about three-quarters of MGM's shares.

The European Commission is on track to make an announcement next week on the results of its landmark antitrust probe into Microsoft, a Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday as 11th-hour talks continued. "What I believe is that we are on track ... for an announcement next week, which was always the plan," spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a news conference, adding that settlement talks were still going on. She was responding to a question about discussions on Tuesday between European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti,  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and chief counsel Brad Smith. People familiar with the case said an announcement next week did not preclude the possibility of a settlement. If there were a settlement, the Commission would discuss it on March 24. After that third parties would have approximately one month to comment. The final compromise would not be officially completed until after May 1.

TD
On May 1, a new law takes effect which would permit a so-called "settlement decision", which allows a formal Commission finding of  abuse of dominance as part of a negotiated settlement. But Monti has already got support from EU governments for a draft ruling that would find  Microsoft broke antitrust law and require it to change the way it sells audio-visual software. On Monday, the 15 states are due to endorse a fine expected to run into hundreds of millions of euros. The final Commission decision is due on March 24.

MICROSOFT CORP chief executive officer Steve Ballmer and general counsel Brad Smith held talks with the European Commission yesterday in an effort to settle row over the world’s largest software maker allegedly abusing the dominance of Windows to stifle  competition.

TD
Negotiations ended yesterday evening, and will continue today, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, told reporters in Brussels. She declined to discuss the talks further. A ruling is due as early as March 24, according to people familiar with the matter.

"It’s always preferable to have a settlement than have any regulatory body rule against them," said Don Gher, chief investment officer at Bellevue, Washington-based Coldstream Capital Management, which owns shares of Microsoft among its $525 million under management. "Reducing uncertainly is the main goal here. That’s what the market wants to see and an agreement would reduce the uncertainty," he said. The software maker, whose products power about 95% of personal computers, is illegally using Windows to seize control of markets for servers and audio and video players, the commission alleges. Regulators are preparing to fineMicrosoft, force it to disclose proprietary information to rivals and give PC manufacturers the option of dispensing with its Windows Media Player, according to people familiar with the matter. The Financial Times reported talks earlier yesterday.

EU governments gave unanimous backing to the commission’s plans to sanction  Microsoft during a closed-door meeting in Brussels yesterday. Member States will meet again on March 22 to discuss the level of the  fine, people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have said.

EU antitrust fines can be as high as 10% of sales. The biggest levy the EU has imposed was €462m ($566m) on Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG in 2001, or less than 2% of sales. A  fine of similar size could amount to more than $500 million for Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft.

HD     SOFTWARE: MEMBER STATES BACK DRAFT COMMISSION ANTI-TRUST RULING ON MICROSOFT

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has managed to secure unanimous support from national
anti-trust regulators, meeting behind closed doors in Brussels on March 15, on a draft decision against
Microsoft, confirmed spokeswoman Amelia Torres. But she would not be drawn on the contents of the
proposed ruling, which is being kept a closely-guarded secret by the Brussels executive, or what it might
mean for the software giant. The Commission is expected to slap  Microsoft with a hefty  fine and propose
some significant changes to the way in which it distributes its software. Anti-trust regulators will reconvene
on March 22 to discuss the size of the  fine, a few days before the Commission is expected to formally
decide on the case (on March 24).

TD
Due to the complexities of the case, the meeting of national regulators on March 15 had been forecast to drag on all day, but was over by noon with all parties in agreement, said the spokeswoman. It is not the thought of being  fined that worries the US computer giant, but rather the possibility that parts of Windows may have to be "unbundled" and sold separately.  Microsoft is also concerned that it could be compelled by the Commission to release details of how its Windows software works, to allow rival software developers to compete on a more equal footing. It is this fear of excessive intervention by the Commission that has prompted  Microsoft to step up efforts to suggest remedies of its own - as one lawyer, quoted by the Wall Street Journal, put it, to choose its own "method of execution".

The Commission would be happy, too, if  Microsoft came up with a satisfactory proposal about how it should be punished, as this would limit the likelihood of a lengthy and possibly embarrassing appeals process in the European Courts. This would take a year or longer, during which time the EU's Court of First Instance could elect to suspend sanctions against  Microsoft. Mr Monti is also conscious that, if the case does go to appeal, he will have to watch the process from the sidelines, as he is due to step down
as head of the  Competition Directorate-General by November, which would make the embarrassment of a successful appeal all the worse.
There are expected to be two core elements to the Commission's decision on March 24:

- Media Player. There has been much speculation that  Microsoft will be forced to ship two versions of Windows to computer makers - one with Media Player, its proprietary audiovisual software, tied in and one without. The aim is to provide computer retailers to sell Windows bundled with rival media-playing software, such as RealPlayer from RealNetworks.

- Information.  Microsoft could also be forced to release more details of how its Windows operating system works, so that rivals are able to develop applications capable of competing with the efficiency of Microsoft's own products.

Under EU law, the  European Commission can, as well as proposing remedies, levy a  fine on Microsoft of up to 10% of its annual turnover - about Euro 2.6 billion - although in practice it is unlikely that the penalty imposed would be this high. Even so, it would not make much of a dent in the US software giant's solid financial base.

The European Commission accuses US software giant  Microsoft of abusing its market dominance by squelching competitors to its Windows Media Player and to its low-end servers.

Herewith details of the EU executive's case against  Microsoft, along with the Commission's proposed remedies, following the failure of settlement talks with the company Thursday:

TD
MEDIA PLAYER

Microsoft pre-installs Media Player on personal computers (PCs) using the Windows operating system - nine out of 10 of all PCs in use - which the EC says unfairly hinders rival programs such as RealPlayer and Apple QuickTime.

The EC last year surveyed about 50 corporate users of the Media Player, which allows music and video to be played on a Windows PC. The respondents were typically contents owners and providers.

The replies of the respondents "highlighted that the ubiquity of Windows Media Player on PCs artificially skews their development incentives in favour of  Microsoft", the Commission said.

"This confirms the Commission's preliminary conclusion that  Microsoft's tying of Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system weakens  competition... stifles product innovation, and ultimately reduces consumer choice."
SERVERS

In its survey last year, the EC also sought responses from more than 100 companies across Europe that use Microsoft's low-end servers, which allow the firms to connect their staff's PCs to a corporate network.

The key issue here is "interoperability". The Commission says that Windows cannot "talk" to low-end servers made by competitors because  Microsoft refuses to reveal programming code to its rivals.

"An overwhelming majority of customers responding to this market enquiry highlighted that Microsoft's non-disclosure of interface information... did indeed artificially alter their choice in favour of Microsoft's server products," the  European Commission said.
"This behaviour is detrimental to  competition on the merits." PROPOSED REMEDIES
MEDIA PLAYER

The Commission has proposed two alternatives to head off its complaints about the music and video program.
The first and more likely would be for  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Media Player
("untying"), which Brussels has said is "the normal remedy for a tying infringement".
The second would be a "must-carry" provision, obliging  Microsoft to offer competing media players with
Windows.

Page 35 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SERVERS

Microsoft must give its competitors in the low-end server market the necessary programming
("interface") information to enable them to make their products work with Windows PCs.

This would enable rival vendors of low-end servers "to compete on a level playing-field with  Microsoft", Brussels said last year.

Following the failure of this week's last-ditch talks, the commission will present its final verdict to a five-year investigation next Wednesday.

Microsoft faces the prospect of multi-million-euro  fines and enforced changes to Windows.
However, Microsoft said Thursday it would appeal against the commission ruling. jit/hd.

LONDON (AFX) - Mario Monti, the  European Commission's antitrust chief, is close to making "a short statement" regarding  Microsoft Corp., an EC spokesman said, AFX reported from Brussels.  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has been in Europe, reportedly to seek a settlement to the Commission's long-running antitrust case. Barring a deal, the Commission was expected to announce its decision, and possibly any fines, on March 24.

Monti said he will urge the  European Commission to adopt his ruling on the case, including  fines, at its meeting next Wednesday.
"A settlement to the  Microsoft case has not been possible," he said.

"I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues in the commission on Wednesday to adopt a decision, which has already received the unanimous backing by member states," he said.
He added: "A proposal concerning  fines will also be on the table of the commission next Wednesday." Monti said the talks foundered over the two parties' failure to agree on commitments for future conduct. "In the end I had to take a decision as to what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he
said.

"It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market," he said.
He said he would give further details on Wednesday after the commission meets. vm/ed/cmr.

NEW YORK (AFX) -  Microsoft has failed to reach a settlement in antitrust talks with  European              Commission regulators, it said earely Thursday. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO, said in a news release that the company was "unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future. " Ballmer said the company "worked hard" to resolve these issues without litigation but added that "perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage." Brad Smith, general counsel for  Microsoft, said, "We have to ensure that the law is not just about competitors' complaints about the impact of new features. There needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers for new innovations. Consumers must be part of the equation. Perhaps the courts will provide the clarity that is necessary to resolve these issues. Today is just another step in what could be a long process."  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company had no
estimate of any  fines it may have to pay.

(ANSA) - BRUSSELS, March 18 - Microsoft, the software giant led by Bill Gates, announced its decision to appeal the European Commission's antitrust ruling before the EU Court of Justice, a spokesman for the company said following failure of the negotiations with the EU competition regulators. The  antitrust ruling of the EU is expected to be issued on Wednesday, March 24, 2004, EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said. A spokesman for  Microsoft in the company's headquarters in Brussels told ANSA the company would turn to the EU court of justice. He said that this decision was necessary to clear up the case in everyone's interest. According to community issue experts the appeal will probably freeze the sanctions the EU  antitrust regulators intend to impose on the U.S. software giant. Besides a huge  fine
the sanctions include the obligation to change some trade practices concerning the Windows operating system. (ANSA) krc

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP:  Microsoft will likely face hefty  fines from the
European Union as settlement negotiations fall apart. Stocks editor Greg Clarkin has that story.
Hi, Greg.

TD
GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn STOCKS EDITOR, STREET SWEEP: Hi there, Christine, thank you. That`s
right. This is a decade long battle that appears to be coming to a head between the European                
Commission and Microsoft. This morning it was announced that talks have broken down between Mario
Monti. He`s the head of the competition committee for the  European Commission and Steve Ballmer,
the CEO of  Microsoft.

What really is the catalyst this time around and the issue here is the bundling issue and that basically has Microsoft wanting to bundle their real media player with their operating system. Now, what we have seen over the last 10 years or so in Europe is that cases will be settled on a case by case basis. What the European commission is looking for this time specifically is  Microsoft to change the way its does business fundamentally in Europe. So the two sides somewhat agreeing on some of the core issues here but they could not agree on just how  Microsoft could change their business practices going forward in Europe. Mario Monti, as we mentioned, he is the chief of the  competition committee for the  European   Commission, he says at this point he is still hopeful that they may be able to come up with some kind of clear resolution. That`s what this issue is needed here he believes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARIO MONTI, E.U.  ANTITRUST CHIEF: I believe that  competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent. It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

CLARKIN: Now, Steve Ballmer is the CEO of  Microsoft. What he had to say this morning in response to all this news was that he is still hopeful.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVE BALMER, CEO,  MICROSOFT: Microsoft worked very hard to try to resolve these issues without litigation. Because of the tremendous value Microsoft attaches to our relationships with governments all across Europe, we made every possible effort to settle the case and I hope that perhaps we can still settle this case at a later stage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

CLARKIN: So what happens next? Next Wednesday, that is the twenty-fourth, that`s when the final decision will be handed into the  European Commission. It is expected they will levy some pretty steep fines against Microsoft. The range that is being talked is anywhere from $100 million up to $1 billion. Microsoft has vowed to fight this on in European courts. At least the next development expected that there will be stiff  fines levied against Microsoft.

Christine, we should point out  Microsoft still dealing with some legal battles in the U.S. as well. They have a lawsuit from RealNetworks . They also have a lawsuit from Sun Microsystems as well as some class action suits to deal with.
ROMANS: All right, Greg Clarkin on  Microsoft, thanks, Greg.

The European Commission and Microsoft Corp. on Thursday failed to reach a settlement to a landmark antitrust case over the way the U.S. software giant sells its Windows operating system, a top EU official said.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a press conference after three days of talks with Microsoft that although the talks were constructive, he had no choice but to make the decision in the interest of consumers in Europe.

TD
The development paves the way for the European Commission to impose a fine on Microsoft next
Wednesday following a landmark antitrust ruling backed by EU antitrust regulators Monday.

The ruling takes issue with the way  Microsoft sells Windows Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating systems.

The draft ruling requires  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to computer makers for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would include Windows Media Player as in the current system and the other would have it removed.

The commission, the executive body of the EU, could set the  fine anywhere from $100 million to $1 billion, according to media reports. Europe accounts for about 30% of  Microsoft's sales.

HD     EU says settlement talks with Microsoft fail in antitrust case, ruling  due next week

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union announced its intention Thursday to crack down on Microsoft Corp. after the U.S. software giant balked at demands that could have prevented it from adding new features to future versions of Windows -- a restriction it avoided in the landmark U.S.  antitrust case.

Frenzied settlement talks that accelerated this week with the arrival of  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer in Brussels collapsed over the EU's insistence on a broader deal in exchange for allowing Microsoft to avoid being found guilty of monopolistic behavior.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said he would now proceed with a precedent-setting ruling against the world's largest software company as planned on Wednesday.

"We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Monti said. "It was impossible to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of setting a precedent."

Hours later, Ballmer said he believed agreement on the issues in the current case -- involving digital media players and the server software market -- had been reached.

"But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," he said in a statement.

Microsoft lawyers also reiterated the company's determination to take any negative decision to European courts. "It's clear that we'll all benefit from the clarity that the courts can bring to these questions," general counsel Brad Smith said.

An EU order could force  Microsoft to change its business practices in a matter of months unless it wins a suspension from the court pending appeal, which can take years.
The EU also plans to hit  Microsoft with a fine expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars.

Monti will present the figure Monday to an advisory committee of national regulators before going to the full European Commission, the EU's executive branch, on Wednesday for a final decision.

After winning unanimous backing from the 15 EU governments last week, the ruling is expected to pass easily.

Microsoft is accused of unfairly grabbing market share from rival companies by "bundling" its own Media
Player with Windows -- the operating system in nearly every personal computer worldwide.

Microsoft says that benefits consumers, but rivals claim it's unfair  competition intended to drive them out of business.

The charge was similar to the 1990s Internet browser war in the United States, where  Microsoft was found guilty of using illegal means to protect its Windows monopoly. But a 2001 settlement with the Bush administration allowed it to continue integrating its Internet Explorer with Windows.
Page 48 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sources familiar with the case say the EU's draft ruling also finds  Microsoft guilty of monopolistic behavior -- setting a precedent in Europe -- and goes beyond the U.S. remedies.

The ruling demands  Microsoft offer computer makers in Europe a discounted version of Windows without Media Player so that rivals like RealNetworks Inc.'s RealOne Player and Apple's QuickTime have a better shot at reaching consumers.

In addition, the draft is expected to require the company to release more underlying Windows code so rival server software companies like Sun Microsystems Inc. can interface as well with computers running Windows.

In exchange for a settlement, Monti was seeking commitments that could have made the impact more global and helped resolve other EU  antitrust cases pending against  Microsoft, sources familiar with the case said on condition of anonymity.

The EU last year began investigating new charges from Microsoft competitors that the latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

Microsoft's next version of Windows, due in 2006, is expected to include a Web search engine and other features.

"What the Commission apparently wants to avoid is a repeat performance," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former Commission legal director now in private practice. "It wants to have some sort of undertaking on the part of  Microsoft that will obviate the need for starting proceedings again."

Since a ruling usually only addresses past or current behavior, not future actions, "from a policy point of view, a good undertaking would have been better," he said.

Lee Patch, vice president of legal affairs for Sun Microsystems, the original complainant against Microsoft in the EU, said a formal decision was "an important precedent-setting step by the Commission if Microsoft was unwilling to agree to a strong future-looking settlement with enforcement mechanisms."
He said the Commission's ruling would be valuable for the legal principle it establishes if it orders
Microsoft to be more open when it is dominant in a particular field.
Sources said Microsoft had made a last-minute offer to include rival media programs with Windows,
along with its own, to settle the case and avoid an "unbundling" order that could interfere with its business
strategy.

Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief lawyer in Europe, refused to comment on what  Microsoft had offered.

But he said the company resisted the Commission's attempt to come up with a "a simple rule" that would apply to "every conceivable instance of product integration or innovation in the future. ...

"In assessing product improvement issues, there needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers, developers and competitors," he said in an interview. "The balance will be very likely different depending on the particular issue you are considering."

Both sides took pains, however, to praise the other's "cooperative spirit" and "professionalism," in contrast to the rancor that often characterized the last high-profile, trans-Atlantic  antitrust case: the EU's blocking of GE's merger with Honeywell in 2001.
Ballmer said he still hoped for a settlement "at a later stage."

But Microsoft critics praised the Commission for sticking to its guns and dismissed  Microsoft's arguments against future commitments as disingenuous.

"That's a little like a bank robber saying, 'I agreed to give the money back but they're telling me I can't rob any more banks,'" said Ed Black, head of the Washington-based Computer and Communication Industry Association.

"One of the most fundamental anticompetitive tactics that  Microsoft uses is the bundling of really separate products into their monopoly product," he said by telephone. "This (ruling) raises serious questions about whether that is a tactic they can continue to use without it being seen as presumptively illegal."

Another trade group that supports  Microsoft, the Washington-based Association for Competitive Technology, expressed disappointment at the failure of the settlement talks and warned the EU against "creating the kind of regulatory environment that can choke innovation."

HD     EU Set to Sanction  Microsoft in Europe

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union announced its intention Thursday to sanction  Microsoft Corp. after the software giant balked at demands that could have prevented it from adding new features to future versions of Windows -- a restriction it avoided in the landmark U.S.  antitrust case.

Frenzied settlement talks that accelerated this week with the arrival of  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer in Brussels collapsed over the EU's insistence on a broad deal in exchange for allowing Microsoft to avoid being found guilty of monopolistic behavior.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said he would now proceed with a precedent-setting ruling against the world's largest software company on Wednesday. The EU also plans to hit  Microsoft with a fine expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars.

"We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Monti said. "It was impossible to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of setting a precedent."

Hours later, Ballmer said he believed the issues in the current case -- involving digital media players and the server software market -- had been resolved.

"But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," he said in a statement.

Microsoft lawyers said the company would appeal any negative decision to European courts.
An EU order could force  Microsoft to make costly changes in its software -- potentially on a global scale
-- in a matter of months unless it wins a suspension from the court pending appeal, which can take years.
In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  Microsoft shares were down 44 cents, 1.75 percent, at
$24.69.

Monti will present the proposed fine Monday to an advisory committee of national regulators before going to the full European Commission, the EU's executive branch, on Wednesday for a final decision.

After winning unanimous backing from the 15 EU governments last week, the ruling is expected to pass easily.

Microsoft is accused of unfairly grabbing market share from rival companies by bundling its own Media
Player with Windows -- the operating system in nearly every personal computer worldwide.

Microsoft contends that benefits consumers, but rivals claim it is unfair  competition that stifles innovation and aims to drive them out of business.

The charge was similar to the 1990s Internet browser war in the United States, where  Microsoft was found guilty of using illegal means to protect its Windows monopoly. But a 2001 settlement with the Bush administration allowed it to continue integrating its Internet Explorer with Windows.

Sources familiar with the case say the EU's draft ruling finds  Microsoft guilty of monopolistic behavior -- setting a precedent in Europe -- and goes beyond the U.S. remedies.

The EU is demanding that  Microsoft offer computer makers in Europe a discounted version of Windows without Media Player so that rivals like RealNetworks Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. have a better shot at reaching consumers.

In addition, the draft is expected to require the company to release more underlying Windows code so rival server software companies including Sun Microsystems Inc. can interoperate better with computers running Windows.

In exchange for a settlement, Monti was seeking commitments that could have affected  Microsoft's business not just in Europe but globally -- and helped to resolve other EU  antitrust cases pending against the company, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

The EU last year began investigating new charges from Microsoft competitors that its latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

In this week's settlement talks, the EU was anticipating that the next edition of Windows, which isn't expected until at least 2006, will include search engine capabilities and other features that could compete with rival products.

Sources said Microsoft had made a last-minute offer to include rival media programs with Windows, along with its own, in hopes of avoiding an "unbundling" order that could interfere with its business strategy.

Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief lawyer in Europe, refused to comment on what  Microsoft had offered. But he said the company resisted the commission's attempt to define "a simple rule" that would apply to "every conceivable instance of product integration or innovation in the future."

"In assessing product improvement issues, there needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers, developers and competitors," he said in an interview.

Both sides took pains, however, to praise the other's "cooperative spirit" and "professionalism," in contrast to the rancor that often characterized the last high-profile, trans-Atlantic  antitrust case: the EU's blocking of GE's merger with Honeywell in 2001.
Ballmer said he still hoped for a settlement "at a later stage."

Microsoft critics praised the commission for its firmness and dismissed  Microsoft's arguments against future commitments as disingenuous.

"That's a little like a bank robber saying, `I agreed to give the money back but they're telling me I can't rob any more banks,'" said Ed Black, head of the Washington-based Computer and Communication Industry Association.

"One of the most fundamental anti-competitive tactics that  Microsoft uses is the bundling of really separate products into their monopoly product," he said by telephone. "This (ruling) raises serious questions about whether that is a tactic they can continue to use without it being seen as presumptively illegal."

HD        EU, Microsoft fail to agree on deal; The European Commission and Microsoft have been unable to reach a settlement on the landmark  antitrust case, the top EU regulator said.

Microsoft's last-ditch talks aimed at reaching a settlement with the European Union and avoiding
antitrust action have failed, paving the way for a landmark legal ruling next week.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had flown in earlier this week for talks with EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. But those talks collapsed Thursday, and Monti said in a statement that the two sides had failed to agree on commitments for  Microsoft's future business practices.

TD
"A settlement to the Microsoft case has not been possible," Monti said. "In the end, I had to decide what was best for competition and consumers in Europe. I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent. It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market. "

EU antitrust regulators have concluded that the software giant violated  competition rules by "tying" its media player to Windows. Now they're weighing remedies that could go as far as forcing  Microsoft to offer computer makers two different versions of its operating system, one with audio and video playback features and another without them.

In a statement,  Microsoft expressed its hope that it would be able to reach a settlement as the case enters its next phase.

"I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case," Ballmer said. "But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future."

"We worked very hard to try to resolve these issues without litigation," said Ballmer. "Because of the tremendous value we attach to our relations with governments all across Europe, we made every possible effort to settle the case, and I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage."

If the talks had been successful, it would have meant  Microsoft agreeing to change the way it conducts its business in Europe. The settlement would have helped the company avoid a legal finding against it that could make any future  antitrust lawsuits easier to pursue.

Instead, the EU is now set to impose a massive  fine with a formal legal ruling on March 24 that's expected to say  Microsoft illegally abused its dominant market position in operating systems to give it an advantage over companies offering media player software.

In essence, that means  Microsoft could be forced to open up its proprietary, top-secret Windows source code to rivals as well as providing an alternative stripped-down version of the operating system that doesn't come with media software bundled in.

"The key to the current decision is to establish principles and not simply solutions to individual issues," said David Wood, a  competition lawyer for antitrust law firm Howrey Simon in Brussels.
Details of the settlement

Microsoft's settlement proposal focused on two areas: Media player software, and increasing the interoperability of Windows with competing software by making more technical information available to rivals, according to Jim Desler, a  Microsoft spokesman.
Page 54 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The software giant did not offer to sell two distinct versions of Windows--one with Media Player and one without--as the EU had reportedly suggested as a potential remedy.

Instead, the software maker proposed that during the installation of Windows, competing media player software would be placed on PC hard drives. Those programs--presumably from Real Networks and other competitors--would not be integral to the operating system, as Media Player currently is.

Also, Microsoft's settlement offer would have applied worldwide, Desler said. Any remedy handed down by the EU will only apply to the European economic area.

"We were willing to go beyond what was required in order to achieve an amicable resolution of these matters. We made concessions that we hoped would achieve a settlement," said Desler.

The settlement offer also included discussion of issues surrounding Windows Server, and how it interoperates with competing software. Desler would not comment on those discussions.

What's unclear is how any potential remedy will affect future products and technologies, such as Microsoft's upcoming release of Windows, code named Longhorn, which is expected to include more advanced media handling technologies. "Both parties agree that further clarity by the court will be instructive here," said Desler.

Microsoft plans to appeal what it expects to be a negative ruling by the court next Wednesday, said
Desler.

Antitrust lawyer Wood said he was not surprised by Monti's decision to announce that the negotiations had failed.

"I suppose he felt there was no prospect of a rapid resolution of the case based on past interviews, and he didn't want to prolong anybody's agony. This hasn't just cropped up. Whatever proposal they could have made tomorrow, they could have made last year," said Wood.

It's not unusual for corporations to try to get a last-minute settlement in  competition cases, but treating a public policy wrangle like a business deal is rarely effective, said Wood.

"One of the recurring themes of confrontation between the  Competition Commission and business is that corporate leaders don't understand that the commission is a bit like an ocean liner--it takes time to turn around, and you can't blame an ocean liner for being slow," said Wood.

Fines, features and the fast track

Most observers agree that the court will likely find against  Microsoft, and that big  fines are now in the cards.

"I don't think there is any doubt whatsoever that there is going to be a  fine. It could be anything up to 10 percent of  Microsoft's turnover, which is about 3 billion pounds," said James Governor, principal analyst at RedMonk. "It's unlikely to be anything like that, but I think it will be substantial."

Microsoft's vast resources make the issue of  fines secondary to the larger issue of the company's market power, Wood said.

"The EU will impose  fines, but who cares about that? The most important thing is what will it do to future issues? We do see a pattern of behavior by  Microsoft, and the commission wants to break that. They want to deal with the combination of market power in the OS market and the exercise of that power in other markets," said Wood.
Wood sees the present case dealing with the market for server software and media player as a test
case for dealing with the broader issue of establishing how  Microsoft behaves when it moves into other
markets.

"The area of consumer electronics is one that particularly concerns people. It's one thing to have monopolized the office market, it's another to monopolize the home. Anyone who likes audiovisual content using their computer must start to feel anxious that any content would only be accessible via Microsoft products," said Wood.

European regulators argue that a 2001 ruling in the case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and state attorneys general did not go far enough in restraining  Microsoft's allegedly anticompetitive conduct.


Page 55 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In that lawsuit, a federal appeals court overturned an earlier ruling from U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordering that  Microsoft be carved into two different companies. Eventually a new judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, was appointed and levied less stringent remedies including publishing details of key software interfaces and restrictions on what kind of contracts  Microsoft could enter into.

Richard Donovan, a partner at Kelley Drye who chairs the firm's  antitrust practice, said European regulators might welcome the chance to pick up where the U.S. Justice Department left off. "Unless Microsoft were to change its position at the last minute, it seems like they're ready to go forward," Donovan said.

"It's possible that the EU would look here to be able to step out on the world stage and be the first ones to really hit  Microsoft hard."

Donovan warned, however, that such a decision would just be the beginning of a lengthy set of proceedings. "They're somewhat on new ground here," he said.

"There hasn't been a proceeding analyzing conduct like this before. The commission has been reversed by the (court of first instance) several times over the last few years, primarily in merger cases. But still there is precedent for the court not being willing to follow the interpretation of the commission."

Appeals from the Court of First Instance go to the European Court of Justice, which is the highest court in the European Union.

DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEY & MARKETS: Our stocks editor Greg Clarkin joins us now with a look at some more of the day`s big movers for us. Hi, Greg.

GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hi there David. We want to begin with Kmart which is really quite a turnaround story. The company emerging from bankruptcy last May. This most recent quarter they post their first quarterly profit since emerging from bankruptcy. They registered 278 in earnings. Also the company disclosing that they have a fairly good amount of cash on hand, about $2.1 billion. It was only expected Kmart would have about $1.8 billion.

TD
What do they owe their financial strength to in the most recent quarter? Well they say tighter inventory management. They have spruced up many of their stores. That has all led to the healthy overall at the moment, at least, financial situation for Kmart. Also, a lot of folks were wondering just what impact maybe the verdict, the guilty verdict, for Martha Stewart has been on some of Kmart`s branded Martha Stewart items that they sell. Well, Kmart is saying in a statement that to date, we have not experienced any significant adverse impact from this matter on the sales of Martha Stewart everyday brand products.

The company is not able to determine the potential effects that these events may have on the future sales of its Martha Stewart everyday brand products and that kind of does echo what we heard before, days before the verdict was released when Martha Stewart`s company basically said that their branded items
are still selling strong, despite the legal problems that its founder was experiencing. At the moment at least that seems to be the ongoing situation there. Kmart shares by the way up about 7 percent on the day. This is a stock that was down around 12 bucks back when it emerged from bankruptcy. Got up close to 40 and today trading over $37 a share.

Now I want to move to Microsoft a bit this morning. News coming that talks between the European Commission and Microsoft over the bundling issue, the latest  antitrust problem for Microsoft in Europe have broken down. What`s likely to result here is next Wednesday, on the 24th of the month, it is expected that Microsoft will be issued some pretty steep  fines from the European Commission. This morning, Mario Monti, he`s the chief  competition, the head of the competition committee for the  European         Commission saying that basically after three days of talks with CEO Steve Balmer that the two sides
were unable to reach an agreement.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARIO MONTI, EU  ANTITRUST CHIEF: I believe that  competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent. It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

CLARKIN: We should point out that announcement was something of a surprise. Basically Monti popping into what was a routine press briefing for the competition committee, for the  antitrust folks over there and making that announcement. Steve Balmer, CEO of Microsoft for his part at least saying at this stage he`s still hopeful that possibly they can come to some resolution.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

Page 64 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
STEVE BALMER, CEO,  MICROSOFT: Microsoft worked very hard to try to resolve these issues without litigation. Because of the tremendous value Microsoft attaches to our relationships with governments all across Europe, we made every possible effort to settle the case and I hope that perhaps we can still settle this case at a later stage.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

CLARKIN: And what really is at issue here is the bungling issue, is basically,  Microsoft bundling its operating system along with the real windows, the media player and that is what has European officials concerned. They say that what they`re looking to do basically is kind of break the 10-year pattern of bringing various antitrust actions against Microsoft reaching a settlement and going on to the next one. What they`re hoping to do is change Microsoft`s behavior in the future and that`s where the two sides can`t come to any agreement and the bundling issue is really what the catalyst is here for this latest dispute.

Microsoft on the day down about 1 percent, but watch it next Wednesday. That`s when it is expected that the dollar figure of the  fines will be issued and it could be anywhere from $100 million up to $1 billion, at least that`s the range that is being talked about and  Microsoft has vowed to fight this on in the European courts. David.
HAFFENREFFER: Lots of big money. Thank you, Greg. Greg Clarkin.

MADELEINE BRAND, host:
I'm Madeleine Brand in Los Angeles, and this is DAY TO DAY.

TD
Settlement talks between  Microsoft and the European Commission broke down today. Now the technology company could face heavy  fines as the EC's top antitrust regulator says he's ready to rule against it. Joining us from the "Marketplace" newsroom in Los Angeles is Tess Vigeland.
Tess, what exactly is  Microsoft accused of? TESS VIGELAND reporting:
Well, in the European case, it's really only about the integration of the Windows Media Player. That's what you use if you want to listen to music or watch a video clip on your computer. The US case was much bigger than that. It covered the integration of any kind of software into the core operating system, Internet Explorer or any kind of application. The European case is just about Windows Media Player and forcing Microsoft to include competitor products like RealPlayer.

BRAND: And they were in settlement talks with the EC  antitrust regulator, and the talks broke down. Why?

VIGELAND: Well, Mario Monti, the EU official, said basically things broke down over how  Microsoft was going to guarantee that this  antitrust issue wouldn't come up again sometime in the future. Here he is speaking with reporters in Brussels today.

Mr. MARIO MONTI (European Union): We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct.

VIGELAND: So, again, they came to agreements on remedies for  Microsoft's past antitrust abuses, but not on how to avoid more in the future.
BRAND: So was that a surprise for  Microsoft?

VIGELAND: Probably not. Most analysts have been kind of predicting that this would happen. And obviously, after the talks the last couple of days, they must realize that the discussions are now over.
BRAND: So if the ruling does go through against  Microsoft, how will it affect the company? VIGELAND: Well, there are a couple of things that could happen in terms of punishment, if you will, for
Microsoft. And I asked Simon Yates, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, to lay those out.

Mr. SIMON YATES (Forrester Research): They're either going to impose a  fine or force Microsoft to separate the Media Player out from Windows, which means that  Microsoft may not be able to sell their operating system in Europe for a quarter or so. And, you know, that'll probably have, like, a 10 percent hit on their quarterly earnings.

VIGELAND: And, again, that's because the company will have to stop selling Windows bundled with its Media Player while it makes it possible for competitors to get in on the action. So that's really where the revenue loss comes in. But Yates says it's really not a significant hit to the largest software maker on the

planet. But again, in this case, instead of a settlement, they're looking at a finding that they are a monopoly, a potential  fine of more than $3 billion and it's a PR and marketing loss.

And today in the "Marketplace" newsroom, we're looking at temping in the NBA. And, yes, we're talking about the players.

BRAND: Tess Vigeland of public radio's daily business show "Marketplace" joins us regular at this time for discussions about money and business. And "Marketplace" is produced by Minnesota Public Radio.
Thanks a lot, Tess.
VIGELAND: Thank you, Madeleine.

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and European  antitrust regulators broke off last-ditch settlement talks Thursday, setting the stage for a court battle that could set limits on the software company's expansion in new markets such as handheld devices and smart phones.

TD
A formal decision in the European Commission's five-year-old  Microsoft case isn't expected until Wednesday, but commission antitrust chief Mario Monti said a settlement "hasn't been possible" despite three days of high-level meetings involving  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

The sticking point, in the end, was Monti's insistence that a settlement not be restricted to the current case, which alleges that the software titan is using its near-monopoly in the market for operating systems for personal computers to dominate media and networking software. Monti also is seeking to resolve at least one other pending complaint that alleges  Microsoft illegally leverages its Windows operating system to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices.

"We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Monti told a news conference in Brussels. He added that he is seeking "a strong precedent" that would "establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market."

Microsoft's critics cheered Monti's announcement. "I'm hopeful that our case now will move to center stage and get accelerated attention," said Ed Black, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Computer & Communications Industry Association, which urged European Union  antitrust authorities in January 2003 to investigate the pending case involving next-generation software. The association's members include not only  Microsoft competitors such as Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW), but also Microsoft business partners such as Fujitsu Ltd. (6702.TO) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).

Regulators also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree to unfair technology licensing terms. "There are a lot of complaints in our files and others' files, and we really have to set some guidelines for the future," said Europe's No. 2  antitrust official, Philip Lowe.

The immediate effect of a failure of marathon settlement talks likely will be an appeal by the Redmond, Wash., software company to the EU's highest courts. The company not only can appeal the commission's finding that it violated European  antitrust law, but it also can ask the
Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance to suspend the commission's decision pending the outcome of an appeal.

"Today is just another step in what could be a long process," said Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel. "We'll all benefit from the clarity that courts can bring to these questions."

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement with EU regulators, with Ballmer spending the week in Brussels overseeing the company's negotiating tactics. He met Monti a third time Thursday morning before Monti made his announcement.
Page 68 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The settlement talks' failure is a big blow for  Microsoft, which could have avoided any finding of guilt and payment of headline-grabbing  fines by striking a deal with Monti.

Monti, encouraged earlier this week by unanimous support from  antitrust authorities in the EU's 15 member states, said he would meet with his fellow European commissioners Wednesday to discuss imposing a fine on Microsoft for its alleged misconduct and possible orders to change  Microsoft's business practices.

The fine is expected to come to more than 100 million euros, but people familiar with  Microsoft say that - and the other changes to Microsoft's business practices that the commission is seeking - won't significantly slow down Microsoft in the market.

More troublesome than any  fine for Microsoft would be expected EU demands that  Microsoft offer computer makers a version of Windows without its own multimedia software. Monti also is likely to demand that the company publicly release enough of its code to allow rival server software companies, such as Sun Microsystems, to interface as well with computers running Windows.

Probably the most painful issue for  Microsoft is "unbundling" its Media Player. Such an order would complicate Microsoft's business strategy of integrating new functions into Windows, including Web search engines and other consumer-friendly features.

Microsoft could appeal any orders to the Court of First Instance and later to the European Court of Justice for a final ruling, a procedure that could take several years.  Microsoft also could ask the court to freeze any order to change its behavior pending a final ruling by the judges.

Despite the failure to reach a settlement, Monti praised the "constructive and cooperative spirit" and "high degree of professionalism" of the  Microsoft negotiating team, which over the past days included Ballmer and himself.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stocks finished lower, but well off their lows after reports that Pakistani troops may have surrounded al-Qaida's number-two official. While the news was taken as a positive, there were still decliners, notably Intel and  Microsoft, which tugged at both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Nasdaq lost 14.32 points, or 0.72%, to 1962.44, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
4.52, or 0.04%, to 10295.78 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 1.44, or 0.13%, to
1122.31, with the latter still positive for the year.

TD
"You had reports of a potential capture and that gave us a definite boost," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Co. "But you don't want to get too excited because captures, like when Saddam Hussein was caught, have an immediate impact but the market tends to give it back."

Intel lost 59 cents, or 2.1%, to 27.20, part of a generally weak semiconductor group that had helped to lead Wednesday's rally.

Microsoft fell 24 cents, or almost 1%, to 24.89. Settlement talks related to an antitrust case brought by the  European Commission have broken down, leading to a probable fine and other punishment against the world's largest software company.

United Technologies, a Dow industrial average member, dropped 97 cents, or 1.1%, to 87.83. The diverse industrial manufacturer reaffirmed 2004 earnings in the range of $5 to $5.30 per share,
with the low end below analysts' expectations of $5.22.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.36 billion shares. Down volume exceeded up,
763 million to 575 million, and decliners beat advancers, 1,825 to 1,461. [ 03-18-04 1613ET ]

On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,450 issues advancing, 1,805 declining and 177 unchanged.
NYSE volume totaled 1,357,580,490 shares, compared with 1,490,113,780 Wednesday.
The NYSE Composite Index was 6562.33, down 5.39. The average price per share fell 2 cents. [
03-18-04 1624ET ]

Kmart (Nasdaq) jumped 2.38, or 6.9%, to 37.06. The retailer posted a fourth-quarter profit, its first since emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in May of 2003.

Herman Miller (Nasdaq) tumbled 2.07, or 7.2%, to 26.76. Fiscal third-quarter earnings rose, but the office products maker projected fourth-quarter earnings lower than Wall Street expectations.

HD     CAGW: Don't Look to Europe for Technology Policy Guidance;  Failure to Settle Microsoft Case
Shows EU Ready to Shun Innovation

"The failure to reach a negotiated settlement is a setback for technology and innovation across Europe and will also reverberate around the world," CAGW President Tom Schatz said. "In the United States, the courts did not set the same overbearing restrictions on future technology contemplated by the Commission. The Commission's proposed decision contradicts what happened in the U.S. and will set back technology across all of Europe."

The European Commission began antitrust investigations against Microsoft in 1999. It contended that by including its Windows Media Player with its operating system, Microsoft had an advantage over other manufacturers of media players. The Commission also claimed Microsoft did not disclose enough technical data about its operating systems that would allow competitors to manufacture compatible programs.

TD
The Commission was asking  Microsoft to give up too many of its rights to its intellectual property, which would set a dangerous precedent and hinder further growth," Schatz continued. "Furthermore, the Commission wants to regulate future developments in the industry. In essence, it wants to put the cart before the horse.  Microsoft was right not to agree to such a compromise. The last thing consumers and technology companies need is the government designing software. Free-market  competition may be a tough business, but innovation, not litigation, benefits society most in the long run."

CAGW tracked the  antitrust case in the United States and monitored the $35 million cost to taxpayers. It works closely with taxpayer groups in Europe such as Contribuables Associis in France and The Taxpayer Alliance in England.

"As the rest of the world continues to grow technologically, Europe will lag behind if it does not change its mindset," Schatz concluded. "The technology industry seems to be doing just  fine following the settlement of the Microsoft case in the U.S. The  European Commission should not be trying to undo that
agreement and control the future."

INTRO: The  European Commission and software giant  Microsoft have not been able to settle anti-trust charges, meaning a landmark ruling against the company could be adopted next week, that would target it as an abusive monopoly. Douglas Bakshian has more from Luxembourg.

TEXT: European Union  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters in Brussels that, after several days of talks, no settlement was possible.
[MONTI ACT]

We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct. In the end, I had to take a decision - to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe.
[END ACT]

The E-U decision, which is to be adopted next week, will require  Microsoft to supply a second version of its Windows operating system, without the built-in audiovisual software, called Media Player. The Commission has said this unfairly hurts rivals such as RealPlayer.

Brussels will also order  Microsoft to share information with rival server makers, and impose a  fine that could be hundreds-of-millions of dollars.

In addition,  Microsoft will be found to have abused its dominant market position in the E-U, which could clear the way for additional legal action against the company in all E-U countries. The E-U expands to 25 nations in May.

In a statement,  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said the two sides were not able to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future. But he expressed hope that perhaps the case can be settled at a later stage.
Commissioner Monti said he wants the case to send a message. [MONTI ACT 2]
I believe that  competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent. It is essential to have a precedent, which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market.
[END ACT]
Commissioner Monti also praised what he called the constructive and cooperative spirit of the  Microsoft
negotiating team.

Microsoft can appeal against any  European Commission decision on sanctions in E-U courts. (SIGNED)

INTRO:  Microsoft Corporation and European Union regulators failed to agree Thursday on an  antitrust settlement over the company's Windows program, which runs ninety-five percent (95%) of the world's personal computers. Talks broke down over whether an accord between  Microsoft and the E-U will apply to future conduct.              has more:

TEXT: The European Union wants  Microsoft to disclose secret programming information to rivals and offer personal computer makers the option of dispensing with the Windows Media Player, in favor of competing products such as RealPlayer. Mark Schechter is an  antitrust lawyer who previously negotiated a
settlement with  Microsoft as a U-S Department of Justice attorney. He explains why  Microsoft probably objected to the European Union's demands for future controls over the company's products:
[ACT 1 SCHECHTER]

Their whole business model is built on bundling (including) new applications into their software, and trying to create value in their software by new bundled products, and they're probably nervous about the notion that there will be ongoing regulatory oversight of their business practices.
[END ACT]

[OPT] Attorney Mark Schechter says that  Microsoft would have problems producing software for Europe that might be different from what it sells elsewhere:
[ACT 2 SCHACHTER]
It's a real difficult problem for them to try and produce different products, or different software (and)
different operating systems in different parts of the world.
[END ACT [END OPT]]

The collapse of talks between Microsoft and the European Commission, the E-U's regulatory body, may lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines against the software maker. Representatives from the bloc's
15 member states will meet soon (Mon. 3/22) to discuss the level of the penalty. The  Microsoft case can be viewed as an attempt by the  European Commission to show that it is serious about carrying out its regulatory responsibilities - that's according to James Macmillan, head of European equities at the London branch of the financial firm Merrill Lynch:
[ACT 3 MACMILLAN]

They way I see it, it is (the  Microsoft case) a kind of baring of the teeth, showing big corporates, big multinationals that there is serious regulatory oversight done in Europe.

[END ACT]

Page 79 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Union has said a settlement reached between U-S regulators and  Microsoft in 2001 over this same issue is insufficient. In the United States, the company agreed to give computer makers the option to promote rival software such as RealPlayer and requires  Microsoft to disclose some information to enable competing products to operate with Windows. But as James Macmillan says, the regulatory climate for  Microsoft is not the same in Europe as it is in America:
[ACT 4 MACMILLAN]

One of the issues you're looking at here is greater political backing for U-S companies in their home market, and the need for compromise, whereas within the E-U, that is not necessarily the case.
[END ACT]

If the European Union does post a  fine against Microsoft, the potential dollar figure could be huge. EU antitrust fines can be as high as 10 percent of sales. The biggest  fine the E-U has imposed was $566 million dollars against Swiss drugmaker Roche in 2001, or less than 2 percent of sales. A similar  fine against Microsoft would amount to more than $500 million dollars.  Microsoft says it will appeal any decision on its case made by the European Union. I'm                     .

Microsoft Corp. chief executive Steven A. Ballmer held a second day of talks with  European              Commission officials in Brussels on Wednesday aimed at crafting a last-minute settlement to the agency's antitrust case against the software company.

"We remain actively engaged with the commission in the hopes of amicably resolving these issues," Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said. "Discussions are ongoing." He declined to elaborate on the talks.

TD
On Monday,  antitrust officials from the European Union's 15 member countries gave unanimous approval to a proposal from commission staff members to find  Microsoft in violation of the union's competition laws. The case concerns features of its near universal Windows software and secrecy of certain programming code.

On Tuesday, Ballmer flew to Brussels to join the  Microsoft negotiating team in talks with Mario Monti, the European  competition commissioner. If no settlement is reached, the full commission is scheduled to issue a ruling Wednesday.

Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for Monti, confirmed that talks were underway. At the same time, she said the commission was "firmly on track for an announcement next week, as was always the plan." She declined to comment further.

With a population of 370 million -- set to expand to 450 million on May 1 with the induction of 10 new member countries -- the European Union is one of  Microsoft's largest markets. The company has been struggling to find a solution to the four-year-old case, but on terms it can accept.
In a series of preliminary decisions, Monti's office has upheld two main claims against  Microsoft:

* That the company's practice of including a media player -- software that can play video and sounds -- as a standard feature of its Windows operating system unfairly impinges on other companies' ability to sell media players.

* That technical details of  Microsoft software for large computers known as servers is not sufficiently public to allow other companies to make programs that will work well with the  Microsoft software.

According to people familiar with the case, the commission staff favors requiring  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without the built-in media player, on the grounds that this would help other
media-player companies compete. In the past,  Microsoft has argued that such steps are technically difficult and would harm the interests of consumers, who find the multiple functions of Windows useful.

The commission would also impose  fines on Microsoft and require that it disclose more technical details of its server software.

Page 81 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Since Windows' release in 1985,  Microsoft has steadily added new features to the operating system, such as Internet browsing software and the media player. Because Windows is used on most personal computers in the world, critics say that including these new features unfairly disadvantages other companies that sell similar software -- RealNetworks in media players, for example. People won't buy their software, the logic goes, if something similar is a standard feature on Windows.

Microsoft has been in and out of court since the early 1990s in the United States, fighting allegations of market abuse. The U.S. litigation focused on allegations that inclusion of Internet Explorer software
in Windows violated U.S.  antitrust laws. That case was eventually settled with the Justice Department, though state governments continue to appeal it on the grounds the settlement was insufficient.

David Wood, an attorney at the Brussels office of the antitrust law firm Howrey Simon, said that in fighting  antitrust cases in Europe, companies such as Microsoft are often willing to make major concessions to avoid formal, legal findings of market dominance. There is nothing illegal in itself about dominance, but "once you've been tarred with the brush of dominance, you're held to a higher standard" on such things as pricing and rebates, he said.

Wood said he thinks  Microsoft has probably lost this fight and may be trying now to head off an additional finding that it abused its market dominance. Such  abuse is illegal and could bring serious sanctions.

Microsoft, he said, may have to make concessions related to its media player as part of any settlement. But, it likely does not "want to do anything that makes concessions as regards future bundling of software," said Wood, who is not involved in the case.

Microsoft's team in Brussels faces an uphill battle, he said. Given varying views in the United States of Microsoft's economic power, Monti may feel relatively little political pressure to back off, Wood said. "The sun is already setting on this decision."

Software giant  Microsoft this afternoon said it would appeal the  European Commission's antitrust ruling. "We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," chief executive Steve Ballmer said.

Company legal counsel Horatio Jutierrez told AFX News that the company now fully expected a negative decision from the Commission on Wednesday March 24.

TD
He said, "Both parties fully accept the need for the court to provide clarity."

Jutierrez said the Commission and the company were able to agree on solutions to the issues in the present case but not on future conduct. He said, "Where we failed to agree was on a single formulation for issues in the future." Earlier, EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti said he will urge the Commission to adopt his ruling on the case, including  fines, at its meeting next Wednesday. "I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues in the Commission on Wednesday to adopt a decision, which has already received the unanimous backing by member states," he said.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti this afternoon said he has failed to reach an  antitrust deal with software giant  Microsoft.

Monti said he will urge the  European Commission to adopt his ruling on the case, including  fines, at its meeting next Wednesday.

TD
"A settlement to the  Microsoft case has not been possible," he said. "I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues in the Commission on Wednesday to adopt a decision, which has already received the unanimous backing by member states," he said.

He added, "A proposal concerning  fines will also be on the table of the Commission next Wednesday." Monti said the talks foundered over the two parties' failure to agree on commitments for future conduct. "In the end I had to take a decision as to what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he said. "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market," he said. He said he would give further details on Wednesday after the Commission meets.

MADELEINE BRAND, host:
I'm Madeleine Brand in Los Angeles, and this is DAY TO DAY.

TD
Settlement talks between  Microsoft and the European Commission broke down today. Now the technology company could face heavy  fines as the EC's top antitrust regulator says he's ready to rule against it. Joining us from the "Marketplace" newsroom in Los Angeles is Tess Vigeland.
Tess, what exactly is  Microsoft accused of? TESS VIGELAND reporting:
Well, in the European case, it's really only about the integration of the Windows Media Player. That's what you use if you want to listen to music or watch a video clip on your computer. The US case was much bigger than that. It covered the integration of any kind of software into the core operating system, Internet Explorer or any kind of application. The European case is just about Windows Media Player and forcing Microsoft to include competitor products like RealPlayer.

BRAND: And they were in settlement talks with the EC  antitrust regulator, and the talks broke down. Why?

VIGELAND: Well, Mario Monti, the EU official, said basically things broke down over how  Microsoft was going to guarantee that this  antitrust issue wouldn't come up again sometime in the future. Here he is speaking with reporters in Brussels today.

Mr. MARIO MONTI (European Union): We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct.

VIGELAND: So, again, they came to agreements on remedies for  Microsoft's past antitrust abuses, but not on how to avoid more in the future.
BRAND: So was that a surprise for  Microsoft?

VIGELAND: Probably not. Most analysts have been kind of predicting that this would happen. And obviously, after the talks the last couple of days, they must realize that the discussions are now over.
BRAND: So if the ruling does go through against  Microsoft, how will it affect the company? VIGELAND: Well, there are a couple of things that could happen in terms of punishment, if you will, for
Microsoft. And I asked Simon Yates, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, to lay those out.

Mr. SIMON YATES (Forrester Research): They're either going to impose a  fine or force Microsoft to separate the Media Player out from Windows, which means that  Microsoft may not be able to sell their operating system in Europe for a quarter or so. And, you know, that'll probably have, like, a 10 percent hit on their quarterly earnings.

VIGELAND: And, again, that's because the company will have to stop selling Windows bundled with its Media Player while it makes it possible for competitors to get in on the action. So that's really where the revenue loss comes in. But Yates says it's really not a significant hit to the largest software maker on the

planet. But again, in this case, instead of a settlement, they're looking at a finding that they are a monopoly, a potential  fine of more than $3 billion and it's a PR and marketing loss.

And today in the "Marketplace" newsroom, we're looking at temping in the NBA. And, yes, we're talking about the players.

BRAND: Tess Vigeland of public radio's daily business show "Marketplace" joins us regular at this time for discussions about money and business. And "Marketplace" is produced by Minnesota Public Radio.
Thanks a lot, Tess.
VIGELAND: Thank you, Madeleine.

Recently my colleague Matthew Rippon has looked at Apple's shaping of the perception of computer technology in our culture.

Yet while Apple is computing's media darling, a quick stroll into an average office will show a picture. In place of Apple's machines, you'll almost certainly find a variety of black and beige boxes running one version or another of the de facto operating system for business -  Microsoft Windows.

TD
Microsoft fought off rival operating systems from industry giants, such as IBM, and smaller start-ups like Be Inc by getting PC makers to bundle Windows with their computers to the exclusion of other operating systems.

It pitted its "Internet Explorer" web browser and "Outlook Express" email program against offerings from rival Netscape and won - this time by bundling these programs with Windows. Why bother downloading and installing software to enable you to do something you can already do with the software which came with your PC?

Microsoft even includes "Windows Media Player" with Windows - a program which can play a wide variety of music and video files. Naturally, this means that other software companies selling rival products - such as Real.com with its RealOne Player - find it hard to compete.

It's hardly surprising  Microsoft's trade practices caught the attention of European Commission competition law. The Commission is next week expected to impose a fine of £200m on Microsoft, as well as ordering the company to offer a version of Windows without Media Player to PC manufacturers.
What effect would such measures have on the average consumer?

Arguably little, as there is unlikely to be much, if any, price differential between versions of Windows with or without media player. As  Microsoft has tended towards converging functions from other applications into the Windows operating system itself, it seems more likely that any real effects will only be seen much further down the line - perhaps when the next major version of Windows - codenamed "Longhorn" - is released.

But it could mean the next Windows PC you buy will have icons for RealOne Player and Apple's iTunes sitting alongside the icon for Windows Media Player.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chances of a settlement between Microsoft (MSFT) and European antitrust regulators have dimmed significantly, as Mario Monti, Europe's antitrust chief, is now demanding further concessions from  Microsoft as the price for a settlement, people close to the talks said, The New York Times reported in its Thursday editions.

Monti held a brief meeting with Steven A. Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive on Wednesday morning, after spending four hours with him and  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Bradford L. Smith, on Tuesday, a person close to the talks said, adding that they parted without reaching any agreement, the Times reported.

TD
Another face-to-face meeting between Monti and Ballmer is "unlikely," the paper reported this person as saying.

If no settlement is reached between now and next Wednesday, the  European Commission is expected to adopt a ruling that finds Microsoft to be an abusive monopolist, the Times reported. The commission's order would force Microsoft to offer two versions of its Windows operating system in Europe, and is also expected to order Microsoft to license more secret code in Windows, along with a EUR100 million ($122 million)  fine.

BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) -  Microsoft failed on Thursday to reach a deal with the  European  Commission, setting the stage for a landmark  antitrust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist.
It will be  fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media
Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software. Its shares were down
1.8 percent at $24.68 in midday U.S. trade.

TD
The decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the
Commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush smaller rivals.

This time the Commission wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, putting an end to a pattern of bringing one case after another and getting new settlements each time.

"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said as he made a surprise appearance at the EU executive's daily news briefing.
Monti met Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer three days in a row, once for four hours.

"We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," Ballmer said in a statement.

A major issue in the case had been  Microsoft's efforts to damage rival makers of audio-visual software by allegedly tying its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system.

Microsoft itself was willing to go further than a Commission plan requiring it to supply a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiosivual software.

Microsoft was also willing to sell information to rival makers of server software so their products, which run on Linux and Unix operating systems, could work more easily with Windows.
NEED TO SET PRECEDENT-MONTI
But in Monti's view, the heart of the case went deeper than today's problems. Two more  Microsoft
cases are already under investigation, again focusing on the question of  abuse of monopoly power.

Next Wednesday  Microsoft will be formally held to have abused its dominant market position in the European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling in the eeu4P0company is seen to be competing unfairly.
"We're talking about an issue of enforcing respect for the rules," said Michael Reynolds, a lawyer with
Allen and Overy who filed the first complaint in the case for Sun Microsystems in 1998.



Page 90 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft said it has given up hopes of a settlement for now and expects a drawn-out fight on appeal. It announced plans to take the Commission to court after the formal decison next week.

"Today is just another step in what could be a long process,"  Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said in a statement.

"I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage," Ballmer said.  Microsoft settled with the U.S. Justice Department, but only long after a final court decision found that it had abused monopoly power.

The Commission draft proposal calls on  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows to computer makers, one with Windows Media Player embedded and one without it.

Microsoft contends it cannot do so without crippling Windows to the point where it doesn't work properly.

But a rival audio-visual software maker, RealNetworks, gave a demonstration to the Commission at a hearing to argue that Windows Media Player could be removed without harm.

The exact size of the  fine will be approved by a meeting of member states on Monday. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor and Aine Gallagher).

BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) - The European Commission and Microsoft (MSFT.O) failed to reach a settlement on Thursday to a landmark antitrust case against the U.S. software giant.
EU and U.S. regulators have been involved in legal battles for more than a decade, charging  Microsoft
with blocking competition. Here is a chronology:

TD
1994

July 15: European Commission and U.S. Justice Department reach a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges that the company used licensing policies to block  competition, in particular by software maker Novell, then a rival.  Microsoft agrees to modify licensing policies.
1995

April:  Microsoft drops acquisition of Intuit (INTU.O), maker of personal finance package Quicken, in face of U.S. Justice Department lawsuit.
1997

November 24: European Commission reaches a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges the company used licensing policies to block competition, this time against the Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix software maker.  Microsoft agrees to waive contract provisions.

December 11: U.S. Justice Department says Microsoft broke the 1994 agreement and is blocking competition. U.S. judge later orders Microsoft to unbundle Internet Explorer browser from its ubiquitous Windows operating system, but it does not. Instead, company permits computer makers to install Windows without Internet Explorer icon.
1998
May: U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia rules in favour of  Microsoft, exempting Windows
98 from the U.S. judge's order.
2000

February:  European Commission says it is investigating if  Microsoft blocked competition by bundling features in Windows 2000 to the disadvantage of rival makers of servers.
April 3: U.S. judge rules  Microsoft used its monopoly power to block  competition, later orders
Microsoft be broken up.
July 7: In face of Brussels objections,  Microsoft give up plan for joint control of British cable company
Telewest Communications (TWT.L).

August 3: European Commission says in first Statement of Objections that  Microsoft used its licensing policies to block competition, refusing to supply essential information to Sun Microsystems.

2001
Page 92 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
June 28: U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejects Microsoft break-up and faults judge for failing to hold hearings on the matter. But it rules unanimously that Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to block competition.

August 30: European Commission sends second Statement of Objections charging that  Microsoft tried to block competition against rival audiovisual software by bundling Windows Media Player into Windows, also that it tried to block  competition against low-end servers by withholding information from rivals.
2002
November 1: U.S. judge endorses remedies agreement between Justice Department and  Microsoft
which are aimed at increasing  competition through licensing and other means.
2003

August 6:  European Commission sends Microsoft highly unusual third Statement of Objections, laying out a case that the company blocked competition. Commission warns it may  fine Microsoft, may require company to unbundle Media Player or carry rival audio-visual software, and may require it to provide more information to rival makers of low-end software.
2004
March 15: Antitrust experts from all 15 EU member states endorse Commission draft decision on
Microsoft case.

March 16-17: Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and General Counsel Brad Smith meet EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a bid for a last-minute settlement. Sources say  Microsoft offers to require computer makers to carry rival audio-visual software alongside Media Player.
March 18: Monti announces that "a settlement on the Microsoft case has not been possible", says full
European Commission will rule against company's abuse of dominant market position on March 24,
2004, including a proposed  fine.

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are poised for slight declines at the market's open on Thursday as investors pull back after two days of gains and a spike in oil prices prompted inflation worries.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) may also drag on the markets following news that it and the  European     Commission failed to reach a settlement in a landmark  antitrust case.

TD
"We had two triple-figure days up in a row," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "The high oil prices continue to be an issue and that plays into inflation fears."

Brent crude futures for May fell 25 cents to $33.28 a barrel after a rise of more than 80 cents the previous session. Crude closed in New York on Wednesday at $38.18, its highest close in 13 years.

S&P 500 futures fell 3.80 points to 1,118.70, futures for the Dow industrials lost 40 points to 10,238 and futures for Nasdaq 100 dropped 8 points to 1,423.50.

Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, suffered a blow on Thursday when the top European Union regulator said the  European Commission and the company failed to reach a settlement of monopoly charges. The EU executive will now rule against  Microsoft, which is expected to receive a fine.

Before the U.S. market opened, shares of  Microsoft fell on the Inet electronic brokerage to $24.75 from a close of $25.13.
Before the market opens a key earnings report is expected from brokerage firm Morgan Stanley
(MWD.N), while athletic shoe maker Nike Inc. (NKE.N) is due to report after the market closes.

A host of economic reports are expected, including a reading on U.S. employment. Job growth has been a laggard in the economic recovery, causing some to question its sustainability.

U.S. weekly jobless claims are due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) and economists polled by Reuters estimated claims rose to 345,000 in the week ended March 13 from 341,000 a week earlier.

The U.S. Labor Department's producer price index report is expected to show an increase of 0.4 percent in January. The core PPI, the index without its more volatile food and energy components, is expected to be up 0.1 percent for January. The report is also due at 8:30 a.m.
Other data due on Thursday includes leading indicators for February at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) and the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's March business activity survey at noon (1700 GMT).

Stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday, pushing the blue-chip Dow to its biggest daily percentage gain in five weeks, after solid earnings from key companies and a tame inflation report reassured investors the economic recovery is on track.


On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  ended up 115.63 points,

Page 94 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
or 1.14 percent, to 10,300.30, its largest percentage gain since Feb.
11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index        added 13.08 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,123.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index        added 33.67 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,976.76.

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are poised for slight declines at the market's open on Thursday as investors pull back after two days of gains and a spike in oil prices prompted inflation worries.

Microsoft Corp. may also drag on the markets following news that it and the  European Commission
failed to reach a settlement in a landmark  antitrust case.

"We had two triple-figure days up in a row," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "The high oil prices continue to be an issue and that plays into inflation fears."

Brent crude futures for May fell 25 cents to $33.28 a barrel after a rise of more than 80 cents the previous session. Crude closed in New York on Wednesday at $38.18, its highest close in 13 years.

S&P 500 futures fell 3.80 points to 1,118.70, futures for the Dow industrials lost 40 points to 10,238 and futures for Nasdaq 100 dropped 8 points to 1,423.50.

Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, suffered a blow on Thursday when the top European Union regulator said the  European Commission and the company failed to reach a settlement of monopoly charges. The EU executive will now rule against  Microsoft, which is expected to receive a fine.

Before the U.S. market opened, shares of  Microsoft fell on the Inet electronic brokerage to $24.75 from a close of $25.13.

Before the market opens a key earnings report is expected from brokerage firm Morgan Stanley, while athletic shoe maker Nike Inc. is due to report after the market closes.

A host of economic reports are expected, including a reading on U.S. employment. Job growth has been a laggard in the economic recovery, causing some to question its sustainability.

U.S. weekly jobless claims are due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) and economists polled by Reuters estimated claims rose to 345,000 in the week ended March 13 from 341,000 a week earlier.

The U.S. Labor Department's producer price index report is expected to show an increase of 0.4 percent in January. The core PPI, the index without its more volatile food and energy components, is expected to be up 0.1 percent for January. The report is also due at 8:30 a.m.
Other data due on Thursday includes leading indicators for February at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) and the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's March business activity survey at noon (1700 GMT).

Stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday, pushing the blue-chip Dow to its biggest daily percentage gain in five weeks, after solid earnings from key companies and a tame inflation report reassured investors the economic recovery is on track.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 115.63 points, or 1.14 percent, to
10,300.30, its largest percentage gain since Feb. 11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 13.08

points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,123.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 33.67 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,976.76.

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are poised for slight declines at the market's open on Thursday after two days of gains as a spike in oil and prices of U.S. producer goods sparked inflation worries.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) may also drag on the markets following news that it and the  European      Commission failed to reach a settlement in a landmark  antitrust case.

TD
"I think after a two-day rally, some weakness in the European markets,  Microsoft being a big player in the indexes and the weakness in the dollar ... all combined to make for a weaker market," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.
A jump in energy prices pushed U.S. wholesale prices up sharply in January, according to a
long-delayed report from the Labor Department. The producer price index, which measures prices paid
to farms, factories and refineries, climbed a steeper-than-expected 0.6 percent in January. Without
food and energy costs, PPI rose a higher-than-expected 0.3 percent.

The number of Americans filing for initial jobless benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than three years last week, the government said in a report that pointed to a brightening job market.
First-time claims for state unemployment insurance benefits dropped by 6,000 from the prior week to
336,000 in the week ended March 13 - well below analysts' forecasts and the lowest for any week since
Jan. 13, 2001.

Brent crude futures for May fell 25 cents to $33.28 a barrel after a rise of more than 80 cents the previous session. Crude closed in New York on Wednesday at $38.18, its highest close in 13 years.

European markets also showed weakness. A disappointing batch of earnings from blue chips such as drugs and chemicals giant Bayer (BAYG.DE) and leading insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) pushed European shares lower on Thursday.

Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, suffered a blow on Thursday when the top European Union regulator said the  European Commission and the company failed to reach a settlement of monopoly charges. The EU executive will now rule against  Microsoft, which is expected to face a possible a fine.

Before the U.S. market opened, shares of  Microsoft fell on the INET electronic brokerage to $24.89 from a close of $25.13.

Investment bank Morgan Stanley (MWD.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit before the open, helped by a rebound in investment banking and equity businesses and a record quarter for its Discover Card unit.
Other data due on Thursday includes leading indicators for February at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) and the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's March business activity survey at noon (1700 GMT).

HD          NEWSMAKER-EU's Monti unflinching in Microsoft case. BY          By David Milliken

LP
BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) - European  competition supremo Mario Monti showed an iron resolve on Thursday when he rejected a tantalising last-minute deal with software giant  Microsoft to uphold his view of consumer interests.

The European Commission's marathon antitrust case against Microsoft has been the defining event in Monti's five-year term as EU Competition Commissioner, which ends on October 31.

TD
The deadpan Italian former economics professor, who turns 61 on Friday, showed his determination to change the U.S. firm's business practices fundamentally after past deals struck by his predecessors failed to alter  Microsoft's ways.

"In the end I had to take a decision, to decide what was best for competition and consumers in Europe," Monti told a news conference. "And I believe that competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."

The full 20-member Commission is now expected to rule next week that  Microsoft abused its dominant market position,  fine the company several hundred million euros and order it to change the way it sells and licences software to give rivals a fairer chance to compete.

The courteous, grey-haired Monti has not flinched from confronting the world's biggest companies and some of Europe's most intransigent governments.
Aside from taking on  Microsoft, he blocked U.S. conglomerate General Electric's takeover of
Honeywell International in 2001, drawing political flak from the United States.

He challenged French government aid to state-owned utility Electricite de France and troubled engineering firm Alstom, and forced conglomerate Lagardere to sell key assets before he would approve its government-favoured takeover of Vivendi Universal's publishing arm.
NON-IDEOLOGICAL?
But Monti, the only serving commissioner who did not have a political career before joining the EU
executive, has always defined his work as non-ideological.

Summing up his tenure, he told the European Parliament in February that economic liberals and socialists alike could share his goals of lower prices and more choice for consumers.

While few could dispute those ends, individual decisions by Monti's  competition authority have come under attack.

The European Court of Justice has ruled three times in the last two years that the Commission overreached its powers when blocking mergers. Two of the decisions were on Monti's watch.

The Luxembourg-based judges also found that the Commission had insufficient evidence to  fine a group of ocean shippers 273 million euros for price fixing.

Page 102 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There is doubt too over whether regulators can act speedily enough to be effective in fast-moving high tech markets.

Routine competition work should go more smoothly once new EU legislation proposed by Monti after regulators became swamped during the merger wave of the late 1990s comes into force in May. Monti also prides himself on forging closer coperation with U.S.  antitrust authorities, and on shaking up EU antitrust law.

The competition department's commercially sensitive work means Monti keeps a profile more like a guarded central banker than that of his more political Commission colleagues.
He has made clear he would be keen to stay in Brussels and take another Commission portfolio in
November, perhaps the role of Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner.

But political sources in Rome said Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was under pressure to appoint a coalition politician, European Affairs Minister Rocco Buttiglione, as Italy's sole commissioner.

BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) -  Microsoft faces a likely European Commission fine of hundreds of millions of euros next week after the failure of settlement talks on Thursday, but it may not be the biggest ever levied by Brussels.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters he would propose a fine as part of a ruling to be adopted by the 20-member EU executive next Wednesday that will order Microsoft to change its business practices. He gave no figure.

TD
The biggest  antitrust punishment so far was a 462 million euro ($566 million)  fine imposed against
Roche Holding of Switzerland in November, 2001, for its role in a series of vitamin cartels.

Fines are far more common for cartels, in which companies conspire to fix prices, than for anti-competitive practices.

The Commission computes  fines by taking into account the duration and gravity of a violation, the impact on the market and the size of the market. Repeat offenders and those who refuse to co-operate with EU investigations pay more. Sometimes  fines are meant to exceed gains, when the gains can be calculated.

Once a fine is calculated the Commission measures it against a legal ceiling, which is 10 percent of company turnover in the year before the decision. Few come close to that amount.

The European Commission says the following are the largest  fines it has imposed on individual companies for abuse of dominant position or cartels, all in euros:

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan forces may have al Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahri surrounded in a remote tribal region near the border with Afghanistan, a Pakistani government official said.

"A pitched battle is going on there. The way these people are resisting, we think there is someone important over there. We think al-Zawahri may be holed up there," the official told Reuters.

PRISTINA, Serbia and Montenegro - Albanians set fire to Serb churches in Kosovo in a second day of attacks as NATO boosted its force by 1,000 warning it would stamp out ethnic violence with "robust" action.
The call for reinforcements followed the worst day of ethnic clashes in Kosovo since NATO and the
United Nations seized control of the province from Serbia in 1999.

MADRID - Spanish police picked up five more suspects including a Spaniard and four Arabs in connection with the Madrid train bombings, sources in the investigation said, as the death toll hit 202.

The arrests bring the number of detainees to 10 since the blasts on rush-hour trains a week ago, believed linked to al Qaeda and the first Islamist militant strike in the West since September 11, 2001.

BAGHDAD - Two Baghdad hotels used by foreign contractors, businesspeople and media organisations were shaken by explosions but U.S. soldiers at the scene said there did not appear to be serious injuries.

Nine civilians were killed in fresh violence in Iraq when guerrillas mounted attacks two days before the first anniversary of the start of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein.

WARSAW - President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Poland, a staunch supporter of last year's
U.S.-led war on Iraq, felt misled into believing that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

He said, however, that he believed the U.S.-led intervention had turned Iraq into a better place and that Poland had no intention of pulling out its troops there.

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan will be named a major non-NATO ally by the United States, making it easier for the country to acquire U.S. arms, despite U.S. unease about how much officials knew of nuclear leaks by a Pakistani scientist.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell announced the decision as he met Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf for talks.

NICOSIA - The prime ministers of Greece and Turkey will attend U.N.-backed Cyprus reunification talks in Switzerland on March 28, officials said, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the thorny negotiations.

Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders have so far made little progress on their own in the talks, which aim to reunite the east Mediterranean island on the basis of a U.N. peace plan before it joins the European Union on May 1.

BRUSSELS - Microsoft failed to reach a deal with the  European Commission, setting the stage for a landmark antitrust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist.
It will be  fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media
Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software. Its shares were down
1.8 percent at $24.68 in midday U.S. trade.

MILAN - Prosecutors investigating Italian food group Parmalat called for 29 executives and three financial institutions to stand trial for crimes in the multi-billion-euro scandal, a judicial source said.

On the list were Parmalat founder Calisto Tanzi and the Italian affiliates of Bank of America and auditors Deloitte & Touche and Grant Thornton, for their dealings with the now-insolvent multinational, the source said.

BATUMI, Georgia - Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili cut a deal with the leader of the rebel Adzhara region, agreeing to lift a blockade on an oil-exporting port in return for more of a say in local affairs.

The deal marks the defusing of a five-day crisis that had threatened to spill into armed conflict and had strained relations with former Soviet master Russia. It will also allow oil shipments to the
Mediterranean from Batumi port to resume.

LONDON/PARIS - A fake bomb near Paris held up rail traffic to northern France and London, unsettling Europe's already jittery financial markets exactly a week after the devastating train bombings in Madrid.

The "bomb" turned out to be an empty oxygen canister with the words "Whatever you do, do not touch me" painted on it as well as the name of a shadowy group that has threatened to blow up parts of the French railway.

COLOMBO - Sri Lanka's president called a split in the Tamil Tiger rebels a dangerous situation but said she was determined to quickly restart peace talks if her party wins next month's general election.

The break away of a strong faction in the Tamil Tigers complicates efforts to end the island's 20-year war that are already in turmoil because of feuding between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that led to the election being called on April 2.

HD           Microsoft reprising U.S. legal strategy  in Europe. BY           By Reed Stevenson

SEATTLE, March 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) failure to clinch an 11th-hour settlement with the European Commission is part of a legal strategy that, ultimately, could mean business as usual for the world's largest software maker, legal experts said on Thursday.

Although  Microsoft could be fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player when the Commission issues its decision next week,  Microsoft is expected to appeal and push for a stay of any punitive measures.

TD
European regulators wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, but in talks with  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti,  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer ceded little ground, leading to a formal end to settlement talks earlier on Thursday.
"Why should they settle now, if Monti is asking too much, and risk setting a precedent?" said Layne
Kruse, an  antitrust partner at the Houston office of Fulbright & Jaworski LLP.

Instead, Microsoft will likely tie up the case in appeals, employing a strategy similar to the one it adopted in its antitrust trial with the U.S. government, which spared the company from being split in two and resulted in relatively mild remedies aimed at increasing  competition.

"Microsoft fought hard all the way (on DOJ), and ultimately settled on favorable terms," Kruse said, "They're willing to go all the way in Europe."

Part of that strategy may hinge on waiting for Europe's political climate to become more favorable to big business, much as it did in the United States in 2002 when  Microsoft settled its decision under U.S. President George W. Bush's administration.
NO IMPACT FROM  FINES

Any European Commission fines, which are capped at 10 percent of revenues over the past 12 months, are not likely to have an impact on  Microsoft's business, since it is sitting on a cash position worth $53 billion.
"Even the maximum (fine) wouldn't have a material impact on the company's business," said Charles
Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

At stake is whether  Microsoft would agree to uncouple its Windows Media Player, used for playing audio and video content on personal computers and over the Internet, from Windows.

Microsoft, like many other software makers, adds improvements to its software by bundling in new features. A similar issue was at the heart of Department of Justice case over the Web browser, and whether Microsoft quashed its main competitor Netscape by including its Internet Explorer in Windows.

If Microsoft gave in to the  European Commission on the Windows Media Player, it could create a precedent that could be used by opponents in Europe and in the United States in future disputes over software features.
Page 117 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft's Ballmer said that the two sides were "unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future.
"I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage," he said in a statement.

Seattle-based RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK.O), which has a digital media player that competes against Microsoft and is embroiled in a private  antitrust suit with its cross-town rival, voiced support for an EU decision that would give "PC makers, enterprises and consumers a choice of media players."
"It's time to restore fair  competition to digital media through an effective remedy that addresses
Microsoft's illegal tying," said RealNetworks spokeswoman Erika Shaffer, in a prepared statement.

DAVID BROWN, anchor:

Microsoft's attorney says the process of negotiations with the Europe Union was very constructive, very cooperative and very professional. He judiciously left out very disappointing. But the folks at Microsoft must be less than happy with European regulators. On this March 18th, talks with the EU over antitrust
abuse allegations broke down. All that remains between the software giant and a multimillion euro fine is a vote from the  European Commission next week. As MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott reports, all 15 member countries are on the record supporting the sanctions plus new demands over how the company markets its operating system.

TD
AMY SCOTT reporting:

Though the terms aren't final, one thing is clear:  Microsoft's Media Player monopoly is in jeopardy, at least in Europe. Eben Moglen teaches software and law at Columbia University.

Mr. EBEN MOGLEN (Columbia University):  Microsoft will no longer be able to say to the content industries everywhere in the world, `We basically control how content reaches the eyeball and the eardrum of the multimedia consumer.'

SCOTT: Piracy-wary companies like Disney have been strong  Microsoft allies. Microsoft designed its Windows Media Player to prevent file sharing. The company says it will appeal any unfavorable ruling in Europe. But capitalism, not the legal system, could pose the biggest threat. This week, Hewlett-Packard said it would begin shipping PCs to Asia, installed not with Windows but with its Open Source competitor
Linus. Forrester Research recently surveyed 140 businesses that use Windows. Analyst Ted Schadler says that more than 10 percent said they might switch to Open Source.

Mr. TED SCHADLER (Forrester Research): So that means that there are 16 companies that last year were not at all thinking about leaving  Microsoft, this year are thinking about leaving  Microsoft.
SCOTT: Schadler said  Microsoft isn't going anywhere. The company reported record earnings last
quarter. It's sitting on more than $50 billion in cash. But he says as regulators and competitors chip away at
Microsoft's dominance, customers will benefit from more choices and lower prices. In New York, I'm Amy
Scott for MARKETPLACE.

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Getting set to ring the opening bell at the Big Board, executives from Sunset Financial. The company is celebrating its initial public offering. New trading day on the way. First words from the floor and Susan.

SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, MARKET CALL: Good morning, Rhonda. Well the Dow Jones industrials coming off their biggest percentage gain in five weeks and yesterday`s rally actually was the first time that the three major averages scored back to back victories, that is rallies, in a month. But, of course, observers note that the market`s been in a corrective phase and the soaring price of oil is certainly not something to bolster bullish sentiment.

TD
We`ve got some earnings to tell you about in the retail sector. Starting with Williams-Sonoma, which not only owns its flagship Williams Sonoma store but also Pottery Barn Stores. Coming in 2 cents, 1 cent better than the estimate. Net income up 28 percent. Retail net sales overall up 12 percent. Comp store sales up 4 percent. Revenue up 17 percent. Its CEO says the company will continue to drive earnings growth by adding 30 new retail outlets.

Barnes & Noble, the big player in the book publishing arena, also out with its earnings, 16 cents better than the consensus. Net income up 17 percent to $130 million. Overall sales up 10 percent. Comp store sales up better than 6 percent. The company citing the success of best-sellers, combined with the continued growth of its membership program.

Finally, keep an eye on shares of Royal Dutch/Shell and shelltransport, Shell Transport & Trading. More bad news from this company. Once again, reclassifying its oil reserves and delaying its annual report, schedule for Friday until late May. The group re- categorized further 215 million barrels of oil, equivalent to the end of 2002. In January, the company reclassified 20 percent of its proven reserves. And the market is lower in the first few minute of trading.
Back to you, Rhonda.
RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: As was your voice, Susan. LISOVICZ: I did that for dramatic effect.
SCHAFFLER: It was very dramatic. Hey, if you want to know drama, we go to the Nasdaq MarketSite. Greg, it`s always exciting there, is it not, all the noise, the hubbub.
GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, MARKET CALL: Yes, the non-stop drama here, Rhonda.

Let`s talk a little bit about the composite. After a couple nice opens, what we`re looking at now is a slight drop, about 9 points on the downside, 1967 is the level. Of course, the drama this morning, the news concerns Microsoft They have had ongoing talks with the  European Commission over the bundling issue, basically bundling their Windows Media Player with their operating system.

They have failed to come to an agreement on that. Talks concluding this morning. We heard from Mario Monti, the EC`s  competition chief, a little bit earlier saying that this was an issue that he really hoped there would be some kind of clear-cut resolution on.


Page 122 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now as far as Microsoft`s rebuttal, the CEO there, Steve Ballmer, he`s been saying that they kind of agreed on some of the core principles here. What they could agree on was how to regulate future behavior. But still he does hold out some hope that possibly this is something that they can resolve.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVE BALLMER, CEO,  MICROSOFT: Microsoft worked very hard to try to resolve these issues without litigation. Because of the tremendous value Microsoft attaches to our relationships with governments all across Europe, we made every possible effort to settle the case. And I hope that perhaps we can still
settle this case at a later stage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

CLARKIN: Now the next key date to keep an eye on here is next Wednesday, the 24th. That`s when the full finding of Monti and his staff will be hand up to the full  European Commission. It`s expected that Microsoft will be hit with some pretty steep  fine. The range that is being talked about is anywhere from
$100 million to $1 billion.  Microsoft, for its part, has said that they will battle this on in European courts after those  fines are issued. But, at this point, that`s the next key thing to look for is next Wednesday.

Let`s take a look at how the stocks is reacting.  Microsoft shares, at the moment, down 0.8 percent. It`s losing 19 cents, $24.93 is the level. So, again, the battle is not over yet. But at this point, at least, Microsoft stands to be hit with some  fines in less than a week`s time from the EC.

Shifting gears, over to SportsLine.com. It is up 7.1 percent. This company will be marketing the webcast of the NCAA Men`s Basketball Tournament, known as March Madness, which begins today. They also have specific advertisements only available on the webcast to that. So that targets that much coveted audience of young male and that demographic with all that discretionary income. And the stock of SportsLine is up
8.3 percent on the feeling that potentially this could be a real big event for them.

Over here to Kmart up 13 percent. The company post their first quarterly profits since emerging from bankruptcy last May. Also Kmart saying they have not seen any significant adverse impact to the sales of those Martha Stewart branded products since the verdict in her trial was reached.
Right now, Rhonda, we are looking at the Nasdaq lower by about 6.66 points. Right at 1970. Back to you. SCHAFFLER: Greg, that`s always a please. We`ll see you later. Thanks so much.
CLARKIN: Sure.

SCHAFFLER: That`s the first word on stocks, back to the "Roundtable." By my side, our guest host, Barry Hyman, equity market strategist, Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. Also here in the studio, Jim Ellis, chief of correspondents, love the title, "BusinessWeek." In Albany, Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. And the viewers were clamoring for Phil Flynn, Alaron Trading, CBOT.
Phil, it`s a pleasure to see you.

PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING: I`m glad to be here. I think the leprechauns were playing with the equipment. We were having a hard time here.

SCHAFFLER: You have no idea what drama you caused around here. There we people in suits, e-mails were flying. So we`re very glad that you`re on this show because we have all this economic news to talk about.
FLYNN: Keep the e-mails coming, that`s what I say.

But I`ll tell you, it was exciting down here, even with all the action. Boy, I`ll tell you, these bond traders - boy, if you want to be bullish bonds, they hated these number. Listen, look at that PPI. All that inflation. The bonds got whacked. They`re down 20 points. I don`t think I can remember the time the bonds have been down 20. It seems like a hundred years anyway.

And the other thing, of course, was the weekly employment claims. They loved those number because, guess what, this is a very strong sign that the jobs market is coming back. But, of course, we`ve heard that story before, Rhonda, as you know.

But, you know what, just when we start getting optimistic about jobs, that`s when they surprise us. But these are some good news. Maybe, finally, this month`s unemployment report`s going to be a great one.
SCHAFFLER: Finally. We keep saying that. You never know.

Page 123 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FLYNN: I hope so. I mean the signs are there. Come on. Let`s keep it coming. Signs of spring and signs of jobs.
SCHAFFLER: Hey, at least we got the PPI, though. Can`t get everything at once.

FLYNN: Yes, I know. I wish we got both of them at once. I think we ought to do a PPI every week. Let`s really have some fun.
SCHAFFLER: We might actually do a whole PPI special here on MARKET CALL, Phil, just for you. FLYNN: I`m ready. That would make my day. I mean, when I look over at the soybean pit and beans and
all that stuff, it will be a lot of fun.
SCHAFFLER: Soybeans are big for programming too. Phil, we`ll come back to you in a moment. FLYNN: Right. Thanks.
SCHAFFLER: We did missed you earlier.

Interesting story that Greg Clarkin mentioned, Jim, on Kmart. Now Martha Stewart`s stuff is still selling just fine and she`s on the cover of everything at all times. And all the speculation is what happens to the company, which is one issue, but what happens at Kmart, which does rely somewhat on some of her
sale? So an interesting signs of times, that Kmart says things are  fine.

JIM ELLIS, CHIEF OF CORRESPONDENTS, "BUSINESSWEEK": Well, I think that a lot of it depend on whether the shopper base that they attract really seems to care about her sort of financial and legal problems and so far it seems that they don`t. And, remember, they`re not saying that there`s no impact but it`s not a substantial impact. Now what their definition of substantial is, I don`t know.

But I don`t think people are running away from the brand. Because one thing that they didn`t notice earlier is that a lot of the consumers who shop at Kmart think that the brand is very high quality, particularly compared to a lot of other things that are sold there. So as long as they can keep the quality up, at least they have a shot since the customer base doesn`t seem to really care about her own personal problems.

SCHAFFLER: Interesting. Retailing, in general, is one of those other areas, Barry, we always track to see what the consumer`s doing. We`ve got oil price going up. It hasn`t impacted so far. But you just get the sense here the consumer`s never going to give up. That`s why they say, shop until you drop, I guess.

BARRY HYMAN, EHRENKRANTZ KING NUSSBAUM: They`re in debt and they`re going to remain in debt. And when you look at the drops in interest rates recently, who would have thought that another refinancing boom was going to hit the market? We thought that ended in mid 2003 but here we are again, another refinancing boom, which just puts more dollars back in the pocketbooks of the spender and that`s why you`re not going to see probably the consumer really drop off here. So they`re still solid, we`ve just got to get more job.

I mean Alan Greenspan allude to this yesterday. I thought that was a dramatic statement that he made on Tuesday. And then worrying about jobs growth. Basically saying that, you know what, very likely that 2.6 million jobs promised by the Bush administration just is not going to occur. So if Alan Greenspan`s worried, I`m a little bit worried.
SCHAFFLER: Hugh, are you worried?

HUGH JOHNSON, CIO, FIRST ALBANY: Well, I`m always worried. I think it`s a congenital defect. But, no, actually, I think when I look at the jobs situation, which is what we`re talking about, is the most important economic variable this year. First of all, looking at the jobless claim, I`m sort of a nerd and love to number crunch and did I that this morning. And what it statically tells me is that the next payrolls number, and
don`t write this number down, but the next payroll number is going to show an increase of about 156,000, which would be, I think, good news for the market and the Bush administration.

Overall for the year, I think we`re going to look at 1.1 percent growth in jobs and that`s an average of about 160,000 jobs per month, starting on the low side, ending on the high side. So that also, I think, will be good news for the markets, good news for the Bush administration. And if it`s good news for the Bush administration, I suspect that`s good news for the markets because we want to preserve that 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividend.

So, yes, you bet I`m worried because the numbers haven`t come in as expected. But I honestly believe that we`re going to start to see better economic, better employment numbers, over the next few months. It looks like it`s in the numbers.

SCHAFFLER: On that note we`re going to move to "Last Call." We go to Chicago and Phil.
You get extra time today, Phil.

FLYNN: Oh, I don`t need extra time but I`ll tell you this, it`s kind of interesting, everybody`s worried about high gasoline prices. Even Senator Barbara Boxer, she`s worried about high gas price, which is kind of funny considering just about every vote she`s ever made in the Senate has raised gasoline prices.

We`re talking gas taxes, environmental regulation. She`s jumping on the bandwagon to propose - to stop filling the strategic petroleum reserve. The problem with that is, it sounds good on paper but just because the U.S. government doesn`t buy that oil, it doesn`t mean it will end up on our coffers. So it will probably end up in China.
SCHAFFLER: Hugh, your "Last Call."

JOHNSON: Well, Rhonda, we worry, we talk a lot about corrections. Think about the fact that there`s never been a cyclical bull market in the post- war period where there wasn`t a 5 percent plus, even 10 percent correction in stock prices. So the fact that we get pullbacks in stock prices or correction shouldn`t worry anyone.

It`s really, quite frankly, from a chronology point of view, way too early about the end of this bull market. And so long as money conditions are OK, leading indicators for the economy are pointing up, investor should continue to be - have a full allocation to equities. That`s where the best returns are going to be, in my judgment, over the next year to two.
SCHAFFLER: Jim.

ELLIS: The administration`s spending a lot of time now worrying about sort of the jobs numbers and about the level of employment. I do think that we`re right in saying that jobs are going to come back. The
problem is that jobs aren`t going to come back at the rate the administration says.

But, more importantly, that the types of jobs that we`re going to be creating as the year goes forward are going to not be as high paying as the jobs that we actually lost over the last two years. As we get closer to the end of the year, that`s going to be the real issue. That`s not unemployment. We`re going to start
talking about underemployment.
SCHAFFLER: Barry.

HYMAN: Where there`s a problem in one sector, there`s always an opportunity elsewhere. And in the Royal Dutch Shell story, it lead to the opportunity in selective oil service stocks because it`s going to add, we believe, into some marginal increased capital expenditure and there is some stocks in that sector that are going to benefit.

SCHAFFLER: That is our "Roundtable." Barry Hyman sticks around as our guest host. We`ll say good-bye and thanks now to Phil Flynn in Chicago, Hugh Johnson in Albany, Jim Ellis here with me in New York. We`ll see everyone again soon and on time tomorrow.

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Oil prices hovering near 13- year highs, but
OPEC plans to tighten supplies anyway. It`s all fueling fears of a major summer supply crunch.

Iraq counting down to the first anniversary of the war, and more violence and more confusion the day after a massive bombing in Baghdad.

TD
And later, splitting the roles of CEO and chairman is all the rage, but will the change really boost corporate governance? We`ll make the "Tough Call."

Good morning, and welcome to MARKET CALL. I`m Rhonda Schaffler. It is Thursday, March 18. We`re about 30 minutes away from the opening bell on Wall Street. Stock futures, for the moment, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street.
First the headlines for you.

Inflation at the wholesale level jumping six-tenths of a percent in January, according to a long delayed government report. It`s the biggest jump in three months attributed, in large part, to a jump in energy prices.

Jobless numbers out as well. The number of new claims fell for the third straight week, pushing claims to their lowest level in three years.

OPEC is concerned about high oil prices. This, after light sweet crude approached a 13-year high. The president of the oil cartel says producers will go ahead with production cuts next month.

Turmoil continues at oil company Royal Dutch/Shell. This morning, the company downgraded its oil reserves again. Shell also says it will delay the publication of its annual report due out this Friday until May.

Microsoft has yet to cut a deal with EU  antitrust regulators. European sources say commitments on future software bundling practices are a sticking point in negotiations. The commission is expected to impose
fines on Microsoft next Wednesday.

A spike in oil prices could give investors a reason to sell today after a couple of gains, two days worth, in fact.

For more on what we can expect from the market, we turn to our "Roundtable." By my side, our guest host today, Barry Hyman, equity market strategist, Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. Also here in the studio, Jim Ellis, chief of correspondents, "BusinessWeek." Joining us from Albany, Hugh Johnston, chief investment officer at First Albany.
Good to see everyone here.

Barry, let me start with you, you and I actually talked yesterday as the market was rallying in the midst of all that drama in Iraq. We look to be a little bit weak at the open here. Is it due to the economic data that came out earlier, would you say?

BARRY HYMAN, EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, EHRENKRANTZ KING NUSSBAUM: I think it`s partly that. You know two good days in a row, we`re entitled to a little bit of profit-taking.

Page 126 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the PPI number is getting to be somewhat concerning. It was a little bit greater than expected on both the core and on the non-core number. And you have got to look at the price of oil as a problem going forward. It`s there`s no comfortability in $37, $38, $39 or $40 a barrel oil. It takes away from discretionary spending from other vehicles and does create the problem.

And it all feeds into everything in terms of, well, if oil prices are high, how are companies going to compete? It feeds into the offshoring problem of more  competition, productivity. And I do think it`s a concern. We do believe that we`re going to get it lower over time. But for now, it is a concern and will weigh on the market.

SCHAFFLER: Hugh, a question for you. We just had, of course, that meeting from the Federal Reserve where inflation wasn`t a problem. Have they not gone up to fill up their cars and gas tanks? Or, you know, why is this going unnoticed by the Fed? Does oil matter or not?

HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIRST ALBANY: Oil matters. The producer price index, as Barry has suggested, does matter.

But what they`re really focused on is, other than the deflators that come out with the GDP reports, is the consumer price index. And when you look at those numbers on a year-over-year basis, Rhonda, the consumer price index was 1.7 percent, so below that 2 percent magical number, and the core rate was 1.3 percent. So just looking at the year-over-year consumer inflation numbers, the Fed has, I think, justifiable reason to be somewhat patient.

But Barry is absolutely right, you`ve got rising energy prices, rising material prices, wholesale prices, there`s upward pressure there. You have to watch this very, very carefully.

SCHAFFLER: Jim, this economy continues to show us all sorts of interesting twists. I don`t remember too many people a couple of months ago predicting $38 a barrel on oil.
JIM ELLIS, CHIEF OF CORRESPONDENTS, "BUSINESSWEEK": Right. Right.

SCHAFFLER: In fact, a couple of months ago, I think everyone was predicting that we`d have all this job growth that we still don`t have.
ELLIS: Yes, we`re still waiting. I think that... SCHAFFLER: Still waiting on that one, yes.
ELLIS: ... it`s very confusing right now, because we`ve been saying for a year now that we don`t really have a precedent for this type of a recovery. Well it seems to get crazier and crazier.

I think that the real issue for the market right now is, you know, how many investors are going to start becoming spooked by, you know, rising inflation and then sort of persistently high oil prices? I mean we got good unemployment numbers this -- or we should say we got good employment numbers this morning. That`s a good thing.

The problem is that the issue now is job creation and sort of -- that`s the issue that`s really going to affect the election. That`s also something that`s going to start worrying the markets. And so I think it`s sort of difficult, even with very strong earnings growth that we have now, it`s sort of difficult for investors to say we are there yet.

SCHAFFLER: It`s also interesting that with some confusion about the economy, the markets themselves seem to be a bit confused over the last couple of days, but all over the map here. A lot of selling last week, obviously. This week, now, a bounce back, a little bit more selling here. Barry, do you have a feel for what this market is up to or where the mind set is or where consensus is?

HYMAN: You know I think it`s very simple, we did not have a 5 percent correction over year and -- over a year and the anticipation of waiting for that correction Fed saw more selling when we got close to that percent number. And I don`t see the problem here.

Interest rates are low. Earnings are still going to come out decent when we see these first quarter numbers. I think there was an overreaction in terms of the mentality of the investor to believe that something greater
is on the horizon in the near term, and I don`t think that`s the case. I think it`s just a natural pullback. I
won`t even use the word correction, because correction means greater than 10 percent. This is just normal
market behavior. I still think we`re going to see the good numbers.

The Fed is not in the equation right now. And I still feel optimistic that on any significant drop from here, if we should get anything due to further terrorism, that you can buy the market because those terrorism reactions are usually very emotional and fleeting.

SCHAFFLER: Futures are telling us we`re in for a bit of weakness here. Let`s go to the Chicago MERC
where they trade those futures. Bob Iaccino of Spike Trading joining us now.
Hello, Bob, good to see you.
BOB IACCINO, SPIKE TRADING: Good morning, good to see you, too.

SCHAFFLER: Give me a feel for what they are saying there in Chicago, a little bit of selling at the open. Is it a little bit that stays with the market and then buyers come back in or should we expect worse?

IACCINO: Well I think the appropriate word is a little bit of selling. We don`t see a lot of volume going through on the sell side.

And I agree with the last speaker, I`m very confident this market is going to go back up, whether it be in toward the end of this week or as the earnings come out strong. There`s been a conspicuous absence of earnings warnings with this approaching earnings season. And the overall basis to the economy to me is very, very strong.

As we saw in this morning`s numbers, jobless claims at a three-year low. I think we`re seeing numbers come out -- every single number come out strong, except for the critical non-farm payrolls number that we get once a month. So I`m pretty confident about the direction overall.

SCHAFFLER: So in general, would you say market participants are willing to give that particular lack of confirmation a slide and say eventually we`ll get some positive jobs data on the household survey?

IACCINO: I do. I mean I think that the jobs number is a little bit understated. I have been reading a lot about that lately and I tend to agree with it. I just find it hard to believe that we`re growing at the pace we are and the job market continues to be as weak as it is. It seems like kind of a disparately to me that doesn`t make any sense.

But you know I want to caution investors against watching what we do down here on a day-to-day basis and looking at it in terms of their overall investments, we trade, we don`t necessarily invest down here. So when you see the S&P or the Nasdaq futures being negative for a day, it` not critical. We`re looking at overall trends and overall strength in terms of investing. And in my opinion, the American economy, the strength is there to buy and hold.
SCHAFFLER: Bob Iaccino, good to see you here. Thanks so much. We`ll see you again. IACCINO: Good to see you, too. Thank you.
SCHAFFLER: "Roundtable" continues. By my side, our guest host Barry Hyman; also here in the studio, Jim Ellis; in Albany, Hugh Johnson.

Jim, you know it`s an interesting story out there. If I say the word "wildcatting" -- when I say wildcatting, I don`t think of the SEC. But there is this story out there that the SEC is going to be investigating entire industries and sectors when a particular problem comes up with a company. I`m wondering if they have the manpower to do that? I guess they think they do.

ELLIS: Well, actually I don`t think they have much choice. The problem is that so many people are starting to now question, you know, sort of the credibility of management, the credibility of, sort of, accounting, the credibility of statements. I mean basically they`ve got, you know, sort of a crisis of confidence in the -- on the horizon.

So what they have got to do is to sort of get ahead of this. They`ve got to say we`re going to now start sort of looking for trouble. We`re going to start like looking under the cushions whenever there is a sign that there`s one industry that could be, you know, sort of could be doing something wrong. I think that that`s really a reaction to sort of what we saw after the boom.

I mean when the bust came, everybody sort of took notice that, you know, there were lots of wrong things in the marketplace. And if we don`t go ahead and sort of do something about that, then investors start to lose confidence.
SCHAFFLER: You know management credibility is one of my favorite topics to talk about... ELLIS: Yes.
SCHAFFLER: ... in many ways. Do we have enough of it out there?


Page 128 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ELLIS: No. I think that basically right now probably the worst thing you could be is a lawyer or a politician or a CEO. I mean I really do think that people think very little...
SCHAFFLER: But they`re making so much money.

ELLIS: They make a lot of money, but it`s just another question of -- you know this is an example that money and how much one is paid certainly has nothing to do with one`s ethics. It has nothing to do with, you know, one`s right or willingness to sort of do what`s right. I actually think that you know a lot of people pooh-pooh the notion that investors are losing confidence in the system. But if we don`t get our hands around this, it really does affect long term, you know, what we can expect in investment markets here.

SCHAFFLER: Let`s find out what investor sentiment is at the very moment. Linda Jay from LaBranche & Company standing by on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Hello, Linda. How are you?
LINDA JAY, LABRANCHE & COMPANY: I`m well, Rhonda, yourself?
SCHAFFLER: Doing well. Market had a good day yesterday. What`s in store for us today?

JAY: It looks like we`re going to open a little to the downside. But I`m really still kind of liking the action a lot. I mean they bounced right where they should have bounced. And I think that, you know, you may want to look at this morning`s opening as a buying opportunity.
SCHAFFLER: At this point, can the market regain the losses we saw all of last week, do you think?

JAY: Yes, I think it can. I think it can. Not only that, but I think it goes higher. I think that that was a nice -- not a nice correction. I mean corrections are always sort of painful, but that`s just what we needed to happen. It was, you know, just about a 5 percent correction, and the breadth was decidedly, decidedly negative. That`s just the sort of thing that you want to see. They held where they needed to hold, and now I think that you know you see them rally back up.

SCHAFFLER: Linda Jay, LaBranche & Company, hanging out on the floor, we`ll talk to you again tomorrow. Thank you so much.
JAY: OK.
SCHAFFLER: Susan Lisovicz hangs out at the NYSE, too. We`re going to her next. Hello, Susan.
SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Rhonda.

We want to continue a theme that we have had for the last couple of days, we have brokerage earnings. This one from Morgan Stanley. Again, continuing that theme as well, exceeding estimates by a wide margin. Net income up 35 percent to $1.2 billion for Morgan Stanley. Net revenues up 14 percent to $6.2 billion. Morgan Stanley citing sales and trading of securities and its Discovery card business, also citing strong revenue in its investment banking business.

Jabil Circuit is out with its quarterly report card. Excluding charges, also exceeding estimates, just by a narrow margin, two cents. Operating income up better than 50 percent. Net income of $40 million. Revenue up 30 percent. Jabil Circuit citing strong demand for the quarter, and it expects momentum to continue into the next quarter.

And then finally, let`s talk about food. A restaurant chain you know well, Rhonda. We`ve talked about it a lot, Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Red Lobster and Olive Garden, out with its report card. A penny better than the estimates. Net revenue up better than 30 percent. The company citing exceptional performance at its Olive Garden chain and improved performance at Red Lobster for the boost.

Red Lobster sales, by the way, actually declined. The sales actually decline 5 percent, but the company said restaurant traffic declines moderated from the decline experienced in the second quarter. And, Rhonda, there is a new Red Lobster in Times Square, just blocks away from our Midtown offices. Rhonda, maybe we should...

SCHAFFLER: What has happened to Times Square? Can we just talk about that for a moment? It`s become this chain store mecca. It`s like going to a mall when you go to Times Square.

LISOVICZ: That`s because the real estate is so expensive, that`s the -- those are the only kind of businesses that can afford to be there.

Page 129 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCHAFFLER: Well I thought those pawn shops did pretty well and some of those other movie theaters they used to have in Times Square.

LISOVICZ: Until Disney moved in. When Disney moved in, it cleaned everything out. Just moved it a few blocks south and west, closer to our office, actually.
SCHAFFLER: Yes, it`s fascinating, Susan. LISOVICZ: See you at the opening bell. SCHAFFLER: I look forward to that.
Let`s go to the Nasdaq market site where, believe it or not, we knew the neighborhood was going downhill when Greg Clarkin started hanging out out there.
Hello, Greg.

GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, guys. You know that Red Lobster note, that restaurant is very big, and there`s a big lobster that hangs from the front of it. So interesting sight here in Times Square.

But I want to talk about Microsoft this morning. A few moments ago, Microsoft confirming that indeed talks have concluded with the European Commission and their head of competition there, Mario Monti, over the settlement of Microsoft`s bundling issue with the EU.
So basically the talks here have broken down. They have failed. And that does pave the way for the
European Commission to assess fines to Microsoft.

Now at the core of the debate is the bundling of  Microsoft`s multimedia player. That is called Windows Multimedia Player with the Windows Operating System. So it`s a bundling versus non-bundling problem here. The two sides couldn`t agree on this. The EC is set to release the specific findings next Wednesday on the 24th.

Now Mario Monti this morning saying that this issue, after months of negotiations, really is something that he believed really needed a very clear-cut resolution.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARIO MONTI, EU  COMPETITION COMMISSIONER: I believe that  competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent. It is essential to have a precedent, which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CLARKIN: Now the commission can  fine up to 10 percent of global sales, which would be the equivalent of
$3.2 billion. Nobody really believes it`s going to come close to that. The range that we`ve read a lot about
and heard a lot about is anywhere from $100 million to $1 billion.  Microsoft saying that they will contest
this in court.

What we`ve seen here this morning in a statement from  Microsoft is Steve Ballmer, the CEO, saying "I believe we reached an agreement on the issues of the case, but we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future." Ballmer goes on to say, "we worked very hard to try to resolve these issues without litigation because of the tremendous value we attach to our relations with governments all across of Europe."

So again, the talks break down. The 24th is the next key date in this ongoing saga where the EC will issue their findings and possibly issue the dollar amount on the  fines that they plan on slapping on  Microsoft. But you can bet that  Microsoft will indeed contest this.

Let`s shift gears here a bit, look at Kmart. The company turning their first quarterly profit since emerging from bankruptcy last May, $2.78 per share in the fourth quarter. And by the way, Kmart saying that they see no adverse significant impact on the sale of those Martha Stewart branded items since the verdict in that case was announced almost two weeks ago. Kmart shares up 15 percent this morning.

Rhonda, Microsoft shares, for their part, down just 0.04 of 1 percent. So not a big reaction from what was really kind of an unexpected outcome, for the moment, at least in this battle with the EC.
Back to you.

SCHAFFLER: More violence breaks out across Iraq the day after a massive bombing destroys a Baghdad hotel. That story tops our "News Now" headlines.
The latest from Walter Rodgers now. He is live from Baghdad, Walter.
WALTER RODGERS, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Rhonda.

Well, the latest site of a car bomb was in the southeastern Iraqi city of Basra, that`s in the British sector. It`s a port city. Earlier this afternoon, a car bomb went off, not as powerful as Baghdad last night, but it went off again in a hotel district. We`re told by Iraqi police that between four and five people may have been killed in that blast. Still, it was nothing like what was experienced and what shook Baghdad just about 22 hours ago.

Here behind me the neighborhood where that bomb, the car bomb in Baghdad went off last night. It was murderous. At least 17 people were killed. Those figures have been revised downward. And all day today people have been walking through this neighborhood, Arabs saying "leish, leish (ph)," "why, why?" There does not appear to be any answer to that question.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

The acrid smell of smoke hung over much of Baghdad, even when the sun came up, 12 hours after a car bomb destroyed a mixed residential and commercial neighborhood. The destruction and visions of death will remain long after the scorched smell is washed away.

Many people are listed as having been killed. Over 40 injured in Wednesday night`s blast, said to have been caused by 1,000 pounds of plastic explosives packed into a vehicle. U.S. military authorities believe the explosives may also have detonated a large artillery shell in the car.

As far as a kilometer away, buildings rumbled on their foundation. At the site of the vehicle bomb outside the Mount Lebanon Hotel a deep crater has now filled with water from fire trucks trying to extinguish the blaze ignited by the blast.

Reportedly, it took fire trucks half an hour to reach the scene. Iraqi police seem to have lacked discipline and did not have a recovery plan, according to one eyewitness. When U.S. soldiers came to help, raging Iraqis at first tried to drive them off. The Arab street needed someone to blame and the U.S. soldiers were convenient.

American authorities responsible for security in Baghdad now believe the murderous car bomb was the work of Islamic militants, out to thwart American efforts to establish order and a civil society. The fingers all seem to point at Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi`s group, or another Islamic group, Ansar Al Islam. Predictively I overheard one Iraqi at the bombsite this morning blaming the Israelis.
The neighborhood seemed an unlikely target for an attack. It is a mixed Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish area. It`s a given among U.S. officials here in Iraq now that this violence is not only going to continue, it`s going
to increase in the coming weeks. And looming above all this now is the specter that the United States is
now involved in a long-term guerrilla war with Islamic militants in this part of the world with no visible exit
strategy. Rhonda.
SCHAFFLER: Walter Rodgers, joining us from Baghdad, appreciate that.

Iraq is also becoming an increasingly bitter battleground in the presidential campaign. The two sides hammering each other yesterday on President Bush`s handling of the war. Senator John Kerry wants an international summit to coordinate efforts against terror and strengthen the coalition in Iraq.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JOHN KERRY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We`re still bogged down in Iraq. And the administration stubbornly holds to failed unilateral policies that drive potential significant important, long-standing allies away from us.

DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The president has made very clear, there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few. The United State will seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.

SCHAFFLER: Welcome back, "The Roundtable" continues, by my side, our guest host Barry Hyman. Also here in the studio, Jim Ellis. Joining us from Albany, Hugh Johnson. We apologize normally Phil Flynn is joining us from the CBOT, but we`re having some technical difficulty. I know we`ve had a couple this week on the show. Again we apologize to our viewers for that.

Hugh let me go out to you. Interesting story out there, you know we`re focusing a lot on what`s happening with oil, the price is going up. There`s rumbling that continues between Royal Dutch Shell and what`s happening with the oil reserve. Now they`re delaying their annual report. Just a general word of wisdom for investors. If a company`s delaying an annual report, or, again, there`s some issue there, do you steer clear of this stock or hold it if you own it?

JOHNSON: Boy, that`s a tough one. Because it really depends on the underlying company and how well or poorly they`re doing. What are the reasons why there is the delay? We`ve seen in many instances, more recently that there`s been the restatement of financial statements. There are some folks that have lost their jobs because of it. And obviously they didn`t want to disclose some information.

They really changed the information. So it really depends on the company. In the case of Shell, I would be very, very careful. If you own the company, I suppose you can hold it, but I don`t think if you`re a new investor, thinking about buying, I think I would avoid it and I would look elsewhere in the energy sector.

SCHAFFLER: Barry this is what makes investing on Wall Street sometimes so treacherous. You think everything is going along  fine. Another case in point would be, let`s say, Tyco or Enron. And the fear is always that when there`s a little problem, is it going to blow up into some huge thing?

HYMAN: Right, well you know, this Shell story -- Shell is not the only company that has made these comments. There have been some relationships with other oil and gas companies who have said -- who have downgraded their reserves as well. It is a problem, because and how do you value this? The way you value oil companies, amongst many analysts in the community, is you value them based on the reserves in the ground. And you discount that future value to a currant price.

And if are going to change that future value of the assets in the ground, that changes the currant price. And it could provide an opportunity at some point when the stock gets washed out and we get the whole story, but the question from an investor point of view, is this an endemic story, which I think why the SEC might
be stepping in here.

Trying to take a lead role to look at something before it possible happens and discover are other companies are involved in this type of analysis as well and see where it falls. I think the SEC is doing the right thing.

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stock futures were weaker Thursday as European stocks drifted lower. Reports that Microsoft had failed to reach a settlement with European  antitrust regulators may weigh. Europe's antitrust chief Mario Monti told reporters in Brussels that a settlement to his long-running  antitrust case against Microsoft has not been possible, AFX reported. Shares were marked a few cents lower at $25.10 as the reports circulated, dealers said.  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been in Brussels this week to try a deal before the Commission wraps up with a decision Wednesday. Monti said that the European Commission and Microsoft had been unable to agree on future practices, AFX said. The Commission is expected to consider whether to levy fines against Microsoft on Wednesday. Earlier this week, member states backed the Commission's antitrust finding vs. Microsoft.

European shares were lower as some disappointing German corporate results surfaced after two solid days of market gains. Tokyo stocks gained overnight. The Dow industrials futures were down 26 points at
10,252 ahead of 7 a.m. Eastern. The S&P and Nasdaq futures were also a couple of points lower. "The bears look ready to take control once again. Europe is struggling to keep the gains from (Wednesday)," said Tom Hougaard of London financial spreads bettor City Index. The dollar was weaker vs. the yen and the European currencies as market confidence grows Japan officials are ready to pull back on

Last Wednesday, Merck said a trial showed postmenopausal women taking its Fosamax maintained or continued to experience increases in bone mineral density at the hip and spine through 10 years of treatment. In techs, SAP Chairman Henning Kagermann told the Cebit tech show that order intake in the U.S. is "very good," while this is not yet the case in Europe, AFX reported from Hanover. Also at the show, Motorola President Mike Zafirovski said the company expects to grow its market share in Europe this year with the introduction of UMTS. "In the last few years we've had a market share in Europe of 9 percent to 10 percent. This year that's going to change, significantly and positively," Zafirovski said in an interview with DPA-AFX. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing
suspicious trading in call options of InVision Technology, which agreed to be acquired by GE this week. In a pending lawsuit, the SEC claims the unknown defendants engaged in illegal insider trading.

Michael Gollogly were put on a paid leave of absence until a financial review is completed. "We feel that Beatty's departure indicates the audit of Nortel's past results could be substantially widened. The risk is that gross margins for 2003 could be revised downward, which would mean our 2004 assumptions are too high."

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of  Microsoft were down 13 cents, or 0.5 percent at $25.00 in pre-market trading, but off their worst levels after the  European Commission said talks to settle breaches of European competition rules have failed, paving the way for Europe to  fine the software giant for market abuses."Nobody expected them to be able to reach a settlement with the EU, so that didn't come as a surprise," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co. "The bad news is that the case still still remains an overhang on the stock as there is obviously some money that is going to have to be paid to resolve the issue." Hogan said  Microsoft's position is very similar to that of tobacco companies. "Tobacco companies run great businesses...but their stock prices remain underwater for the most part because of the potential for litigation liability."

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stocks were poised stumble out of the gate Thursday as the failure of  Microsoft to reach a settlement with European  antitrust regulators tripped up the software giant's shares in the
pre-open. Weakness in European bourses also provided a negative backdrop. The outlook for the open worsened after U.S. producer prices were said to rise by a higher-than-expected 0.6 percent in January. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3 percent vs. expectations of a 0.1 percent increase. Investors fear that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Europe's  antitrust chief Mario Monti told reporters in Brussels that a settlement to his long-running  antitrust case against Microsoft has not been possible. The stock, a component of the Dow industrials, eased 17 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $24.96 in pre-open trading. The stock hadn't traded below the $25 level since Nov. 17, and hasn't closed below that level since June 13.

Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been in Brussels this week to try a deal before the Commission wraps up with a decision Wednesday. Monti said that the  European Commission and Microsoft had been unable to agree on future practices, AFX said. The Commission is expected to consider whether to levy fines against Microsoft on Wednesday. Earlier this week, member states backed the Commission's antitrust finding vs. Microsoft. The "Diamonds", a tracking stock for the Dow
industrials, fell 46 cents to $102.80 ahead of the bell. The blue chip barometer had gained 197 points over the prior two sessions. The S&P 500 tracker lost 46 cents to $112.58 and the Nasdaq 100 tracker traded
19 cents lower at $35. 31. Among some technology heavyweights seeing early activity, Intel slipped 12 cents to $27.67, Cisco Systems eased a dime to $23.40, Oracle lost 8 cents to $11.77 and Qualcomm was
3 cents lighter at $64.69. European shares were lower as some disappointing German corporate results surfaced after two solid days of market gains. Tokyo stocks gained overnight. "The bears look ready to
take control once again. Europe is struggling to keep the gains from (Wednesday)," said Tom Hougaard of
London financial spreads bettor City Index. The dollar hit a 1-month low vs. the yen and slipped against
the European currencies as market confidence grew that Japan officials are ready to pull back on
dollar-defending interventions. Focus stocks Royal Dutch shares dropped $1.45, or 3 percent, to $46.86
ahead of the open after the oil giant reduced the volume of proved reserves it planned to book in 2003 by
approximately 220 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves, including volumes from Ormen
Lange. Morgan Stanley eased 2 cents to $60.44 despite reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue
that exceeded analyst expectations (). Lucent Technologies eased 4 cents to $3.89 after the company said
late Wednesday that it will pay a $25 million  fine as part of its settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission over accounting issues. Shares of Tibco Software, a maker of application integration
software, surged 53 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $8.30 after posting late Wednesday fiscal first-quarter net
income of $8.53 million, or 4 cents a share, up from $1.66 million, or 1 cent, in the same period a year
earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned $10.1 million, or 5 cents a share. By that
measure, analysts polled by Reuters Research had been expecting earnings of 3 cents a share, on
average. Revenue rose to $74.4 million, up from $63.7 million a year earlier. The Dow's Merck shares
were up around 4 cents at $44.43. Late Wednesday, Merck said a trial showed postmenopausal women

PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: A frantic day in the nation`s oil markets as events half a world away keep traders on their toes. Oil prices are near 13 year highs and that has American drivers wary as prices at the gasoline pump inch ever higher.

LINDA O`BRYON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Those high fuel prices are a challenge for the nation`s airlines, already in a financial slump. We talk with the chairman of Continental (CAL), Gordon Bethune, about what`s ahead for the carrier.

KANGAS:  Microsoft (MSFT) is about to be branded as a monopolist by the  European Commission. But the software company says that`s not true and it`s going to fight the finding. We`ll have that story.

O`BRYON: Then, meet the man who combed through the wreckage of Enron and charged $90 million to do it. He says that fee is just a drop in the bucket compared to the huge amount of money already recovered from what`s left of the bankrupt energy giant.
KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas. O`BRYON: And I`m Linda O`Bryon. Susie Gharib is off tonight.
This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 18. Good evening, everyone.
Crude prices continued to trade today near their highest level since before the first war with Iraq in 1990. News that al Qaeda`s number two official may be trapped in Pakistan caused prices to slip a bit, settling just below $38 a barrel. But with OPEC threatening production cuts, are prices likely to spike further?
Erika Miller reports.

ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At the New York Mercantile Exchange today, trading was bustling as crude oil futures continue to flirt with 13 year highs. And many traders predict prices will head even higher.

RAYMOND CARBONE, OIL TRADER, PARAMOUNT OPTIONS: $40 could easily happen, and we`re very close to it already. We`ve moved $3 since Friday morning, to the present levels. That gives you an idea of the volatility of this market.

MILLER: Traders blame much of that volatility on the bombings in Spain, which heightened fears that terrorism could soon escalate in the Middle East and possibly disrupt oil exports from the region. Analysts say another reason for the spike in prices is rising demand as the world economy improves.

JAMES STEEL, OIL ANALYST, REFCO: Demand is so strong, not just in the United States, but globally. We`ve had very good demand in China. China has now replaced Japan as the second largest consumer of oil in the world.

MILLER: Another factor contributing to the market`s nervousness is a proposed cut in oil production by
OPEC. Last month, the cartel said it would slash output by about a million barrels per day, starting April 1.

Page 138 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And in recent days, many OPEC ministers have vowed to carry out the announced cuts. But oil analysts are skeptical the effort will work since OPEC has already tried slash overproduction since the beginning of March with little success.

STEEL: The data we`ve had so far is that they`ve been unsuccessful in clearing away their current overproduction. So it`s difficult to estimate that they`ll be able to tackle this one million.

MILLER: Adding to market jitters is data showing crude oil and gasoline inventories are dwindling. Gasoline stockpiles are now five percent below their five year average. And the prices at the pump keep inching up
to near record levels.

Motorists should get ready for even higher gasoline prices. Some analysts predict they could rise to as high as $3 a gallon, just in time for the summer driving season.
Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.

KANGAS: On Wall Street, investors took some profits after two days of solid. gains. Inflation concerns were kindled by news that January producer prices rose 6/10 percent, when a 4/10 percent rise was expected. Another negative was February`s Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which showed no change instead of a small expected increase.

But this afternoon the market recovered most of its steep losses on news that a top al Qaeda leader may be surrounded by Pakistani troops. The result was a narrowly mixed close.
The Dow Industrial Average lost just 4 1/2 points, at 10,295.78. The NASDAQ Composite ended down 14 1/3 points, at 1,962.44.
The Standard & Poor`s 500 Index fell just 1.43 points, ending at 1,122.32.
Over on the bond market, the 10-year note slid 11/32, to 101 32/32, putting the yield at 3.76 percent. United Airlines needs more time to come out of bankruptcy. This afternoon, the company filed a status
report with a U.S. bankruptcy court saying it needs more time to file a plan to exit Chapter 11. United had
hoped to be back on its feet June 30. Now, the airline says it needs until the end of August because the
government still hasn`t approved its request for a $1.6 billion loan guarantee. United filed for bankruptcy in
December of 2002 and despite slashing costs, it still lost nearly $3 billion last year.

O`BRYON: United isn`t the only airline facing challenges. The entire airline sector is under pressure due to surging oil prices, terrorism fears and intense  competition.
Our guest tonight is Gordon Bethune, Chairman and CEO of Continental Airlines. Welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.
GORDON BETHUNE, CEO, CONTINENTAL AIRLINES: Thanks, Linda. Nice to be here.
O`BRYON: Let`s begin with rising fuel prices. How are they affecting Continental?

BETHUNE: Well, they`ve pretty much wiped out all the efforts we made last year to get another $500 million of our expenses without seeking employee concessions. The price of oil moves about $38 million per $1 cost of a barrel. So we`re up $500 million just in excess expenses due to oil.

O`BRYON: Well, volatile oil prices are certainly not new. What does Continental do to try to hedge against this problem?

BETHUNE: Well, you`ve got to get somewhere to where some predictability to get on to the other side of hedge. And we do have some hedges in place, but it makes it awfully difficult when the price of oil outstrips everyone`s kind of forecast. So you don`t know what to get in and when to get out.

O`BRYON: Now, fuel generally represents about 12 to 15 percent of total operating expenses for airlines. Are you planning to cut other costs to make up for those fuel increases?

BETHUNE: Well, that`s a problem. You know, we`ve taken $900 million out in what we call non-value added costs, things that we can do without asking for wage give backs or laying off more people. And certainly we`ve already had some layoffs. So this puts us in a quandary. We`re kind of out of ideas. And


Page 139 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this rapidly increase in price of oil, while we continue to pump oil into the strategic petroleum reserve, which further exacerbates the price, perplexes us.

O`BRYON: Well, another worry for the airline industry as a whole is the renewed terrorism fears following last week`s train bombings in Madrid.
What is your view of the airline industry`s anti-terrorism efforts?

BETHUNE: Well, I think the safest place to be today is on an airplane. We`ve got more security than any place that you`ll find in any train station or theater or any other public meeting place. So I think that`s OK. And we can`t talk about the unreasonable fears. But the price of oil is added to by other fears that the public, you know, generally have, and that certainly adds to it.

O`BRYON: Let`s switch gears for a moment and talk about Continental`s stock, which has dropped considerably since its peak in October.
Have oil prices been the biggest factor pulling down the stocks in general?

BETHUNE: I think, Linda, that is true. Also, the yields or the average ticket price or because of the flood of competition, low cost carriers and then people flying too many airplanes because they can`t afford to park anymore, all of that exacerbates the P&L, which is dropping revenues and increasing expenses. So the market takes a look at that and reacts.

O`BRYON: Well, earlier in this program we heard a story about United Airlines and its efforts to emerge out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. I understand that some of UAL`s competitors have been protesting the loan guarantee that UAL is requesting. Is Continental among those objecting?

BETHUNE: I don`t think we`re objecting. We`ve said, and I have always said, because we didn`t object when others had a business plan that works -- and if United has a business plan that works, I think they should get the loan guarantee. The problem of making any business plan work today is this rising cost of oil really making the plans just not work anymore.

O`BRYON: Let`s go back to the cost side of the equation. How are you going to deal with that quandary you talked about in terms of cutting costs?

BETHUNE: Well, you`ve got only a few. You can either start shrinking and reducting the size of your fleet, reducing the size of your employment base, because today it doesn`t work. We need to either increase the fares to cover the price of oil, which you may have known that Continental tried to add a fuel surcharge a couple of times and was unsuccessful. So we`ve got an environment where it just doesn`t work, Linda.

O`BRYON: All right, and one final question about the  competition you mentioned. Any thoughts there, the low cost carriers?

BETHUNE: Well, you know, we`re only as good as our dumbest competitor. There`s a huge race for that honor and I`m not sure where that`s going to end. But it`s a difficult time to predict what your  competition is going to do. I think we`re going to stick with flying a really good airline, being on time and safe and reliable, and try to cut costs to where they don`t affect those things and ride this one out.
O`BRYON: All right, thank you very much. BETHUNE: You bet.
Thanks, Linda.
O`BRYON: Gordon Bethune, Chairman and CEO of Continental Airlines.

As we told you last night, today the United States filed a formal complaint against China at the World Trade Organization. The case challenges China`s tax policies, claiming those policies put up an unfair barrier to semiconductor chips imported into the Asian nation. But experts say the case goes beyond chips, drawing the line at discrimination against all American goods. Now, this is the first case of its kind against China at the WTO.

Meanwhile, in Europe next Wednesday, a landmark antitrust ruling is expected to be handed down against software giant  Microsoft. The European Commission will fine the firm and order it to offer a slimmed down version of its Windows operating system to computer makers in Europe. Microsoft and the E.U. have been wrangling for months trying to settle the matter, but talks broke down today. Microsoft will appeal the decision, taking the  European Commission to court.

And finally, Florida Banks (FLBK) moved up $2.75. It`s going to be acquired by Self Financial Group for stock worth about $22.50 a share.
Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Linda?
O`BRYON: Well, Paul, the finances in the case of bankrupt energy giant Enron are becoming more and more complex. Published reports today say former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling has already paid his legal team $23 million, a payment made before the government froze his assets. Meanwhile, the man the bankruptcy court hired to investigate some of Enron`s deals says he has found $10 billion that could eventually be repaid to creditors.
But as Darren Gersh reports, the price tag for that investigation is raising some eyebrows.

DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Two weeks before filing for bankruptcy in late 2001, Enron dropped a bombshell at a meeting with its bankers. The company announced it had discovered $25 billion in debt it had never disclosed before and $14 billion of that was hidden away in off the books partnerships called special purpose entities.

NEAL BATSON, ENRON BANKRUPTCY EXAMINER: And I think there was a group of officers involved in these deals who understood what they were doing.

GERSH: The Enron bankruptcy court hired Atlanta lawyer Neal Batson to examine those off the books deals. He would not comment on the pending criminal trial against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, but Batson`s report found no clear paper trail tying special purpose entities to Enron top management.

BATSON: We did not find a lot of documentary evidence, either e-mail traffic or other documents, that would really tell us what they either knew or didn`t know with respect to what was going on at lower levels of the company.

GERSH: Batson did find cause for Enron to demand former Chairman Kenneth Lay return $94 million in loans that were repaid with now worthless Enron stock. That`s in addition to findings that Lay and other senior executives violated their fiduciary duty to the company.

BATSON: I think the ultimate lesson is that there was an integrity failure at certain levels within Enron and that until there is a restoration of integrity in business organizations in this country, I don`t think that the confidence of the investing public is going to be restored.

GERSH: Is it a kind of integrity failure when you have secretaries, utility lineman who have lost their life savings and you have the accountants and lawyers who are resolving the Enron bankruptcy are going to be paid close to a billion dollars?

BATSON: I don`t know that the billion dollar number is accurate at the -- will be accurate at the end of the day. Of course, the case has not concluded. But the fact of the matter is, I think if you look at Chapter 11 cases, at reorganization cases in this country, you will find that those proceedings are very expensive.

GERSH: Batson`s own report cost $90 million. But he says that figure has to be compared to the billions of dollars at stake.

BATSON: When you think in terms of those kinds of numbers and you say to yourself, OK, the examination cost $90 million, but they`ve already recovered over $500 million and they stand to recover hundreds of millions, if not billions, more, you have to put that, it seems to me, in perspective.

GERSH: The bankruptcy court limited Batson`s investigation to Enron`s off the books deals. But more than three years after this spectacular corporate collapse, Batson believes there are still unanswered questions about the extent of Enron`s international operations and trading activities.

KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday market monitor guest is John J. Hughes, President of Quantum Capital
Management.

O`BRYON: Clairol is weighing a move south of the border. The maker of hair care products is looking at relocating its Stamford, Connecticut, manufacturing center to Mexico. But the City of Stamford and the State of Connecticut are trying to persuade Clairol to stay by offering hefty tax incentives. Clairol was bought by Procter & Gamble (PG) last year and closing the plant would cost the state almost 800 jobs.

KANGAS: A new survey shows three out of four Americans can get onto the Internet in their jammies. The latest survey by measurement service Nielsen Net Ratings shows 204 million people, or 75 percent of all Americans, have Internet access at home. That`s up nine percent from last year. The survey also found that women have more access to the Net than men.

O`BRYON: Most people just have one job, but tonight`s commentator says sometimes it`s better to have two, especially when you`re leading a company.
Here`s Barbara Hackman Franklin, President of Barbara Franklin Enterprises and former U.S. Secretary of
Commerce under President George H. Bush.

BARBARA HACKMAN FRANKLIN, PRESIDENT & CEO, BARBARA FRANKLIN ENTERPRISES: Two weeks ago, the Disney Company (DIS), in the wake of a shareholder revolt against CEO Michael Eisner, split the chairman and CEO jobs. This week, MCI, formerly WorldCom, made the same change as part of its bankruptcy agreement.
The question I`m being asked is, is this a trend and will other companies rush to split the two roles?

The answer, I think, is no. The reason? Both Disney and MCI, formerly WorldCom, are unique situations. The Disney case is complex: two dissident ex-directors, shareholders concerned about sub par performance and a hostile takeover threat. And, of course, MCI is in bankruptcy.

So the split will continue to happen, as it has in the past, case by case, when there is a transition from one CEO to another, or when conditions dictate that the CEO focus solely on running the company, with the chairman running the board.

It also can happen when there`s trouble, and a better system of checks and balances is needed. One step in the direction of more checks and balances is the requirement for a presiding director who leads the independent director executive sessions of the board. Perhaps this change will prove as effective as splitting the two roles.

There`s more discussion today about separating the chairman and CEO jobs, but there`s no consensus about it in corporate America. Only time will tell whether a new consensus will emerge.
I`m Barbara Hackman Franklin.

KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, stocks end the day pretty much where they began it. The Dow fell 4 1/2 points. The NASDAQ slipped 14 points.
And please be sure to join us at our worldwide Web site, nbr.com.
O`BRYON: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 18.
We`d like to remind you that this is the time of year that your public television station seeks your support. KANGAS: Support that makes programs like NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT possible.
O`BRYON: Thanks for joining us and don`t forget to support your public television station. I`m Linda O`Bryon. Good night, everyone. And good night to you, too, Paul.
KANGAS: Good night, Linda. I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys. END

HD       Microsoft's Bundle of Trouble

LP
United States, 2004 Mar 18 (NB). In the high-stakes poker match between and the , it's hard to tell who's bluffing.
Filter awoke to news this morning that last-minute  antitrust settlement talks, which featured a hasty
trans-Atlantic flight this week by  Microsoft CEO -- had broken down over the age-old issue of "bundling."
The EU wants  Microsoft to produce two versions of its operating system -- one with its Media Player,
one without. The company says that's just not possible. So who's gonna blink first?

TD
, the EU's top  antitrust regulator, today announced the breakdown in negotiations, setting the stage for an announcement of major penalties against the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant as soon as next week. "We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct. In the end, I had do decide what was best for competition and consumers in Europe. I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent," Monti said in prepared remarks.

Ballmer, in a video clip circulated to the media this morning, said the talks broke down "because we were unable to agree on a set of consumer-driven principles on issues that might arise in the future. ... These forward looking issues proved intractable." A statement posted on the  Microsoft Web site included this dig at the EU from general counsel : "We have to ensure that the law is not just about competitors' complaints about the impact of new features. There needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers for new innovations. Consumers must be part of the equation. Perhaps the courts will provide the clarity that is necessary to resolve these issues. Today is just another step in what could be a long process."

So is Monti looking to go down in history as the man who finally stood up to Bill Gates? "Monti isn't going to accept a settlement that will be a façade," said , an  antitrust lawyer at , according to Bloomberg. "He has no political debts and won't want to go down as someone who bowed completely before  Microsoft."

The Financial Times, in explaining more on the failure of the settlement talks, noted that "Monti said on Thursday that it was important to set a legal precedent for the case, despite an offer from  Microsoft on Wednesday to include its rivals' programmes on personal computers sold throughout the world." More from the FT: "Mr Monti was faced with the choice of whether to accept concrete measures offered by Microsoft on Wednesday or formally rule that the company has broken European law, so setting a historic precedent. The software giant had promised to ask all computer manufacturers in the European Economic Area to include two media player programmes specified by the Commission on the hard discs of PCs. Such programmes, used to play video and music clips, are at the core of the fight between Microsoft and the Commission, which alleges that the company has leveraged its virtual monopoly over Windows into other markets."

The Times Online of London offered a similar report: "While Mr Baller is reported to have suggested that computer makers be required to carry rival packages as well as his company's Windows Media Player, the commission said that the  Microsoft package should not come as standard."

The Wall Street Journal reported "Mr. Monti had been insisting that any settlement with  Microsoft go beyond the draft ruling in changing the U.S. software giant's business tactics as the price for avoiding a precedent-setting finding of monopolistic abuses, people familiar with the case said. Rather than compromise with Microsoft to avoid an extended court battle, a person familiar with the European

Commission's thinking said, Mr. Monti's team was trying to wring more concessions in a settlement than they would order in an official ruling against the company."

, an analyst with , said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" this morning that  Microsoft isn't going to stop fighting anytime soon. "They will go on and try to appeal as much of it as they can," Barnicle said. "We will see them stonewall this as long as they can." And that could take years, he indicated.

Now Microsoft faces stiff  fines and threats against its current business strategy. In an article that appears to have been written before Monti's press conference calling the settlement talks dead, the New York Times said: "If no settlement is reached between now and next Wednesday, the  European             Commission is expected to adopt a ruling that finds  Microsoft to be an abusive monopolist. The commission's order would force  Microsoft to offer two versions of its Windows operating system in Europe: one with  Microsoft's music and video software and one with Media Player stripped out of the operating system and sold separately. The ruling is also expected to order  Microsoft to license more secret code in Windows to allow rivals to build software that works smoothly with Windows, and to  fine   Microsoft 100 million euros ($122 million) to 1 billion euros."

Microsoft can't be looking forward to next week. A European Union  competition panel is "expected to endorse a fine of hundreds of millions of euros against  Microsoft, although not until a second meeting scheduled for 22 March. The Commission's final decision will be made on 24 March," said BBC News Online, which continues to run a picture of a wincing a key to its ongoing coverage of the  antitrust flap.

So what's the big deal about bundling?  Microsoft has repeatedly made clear that it is unwilling to give ground on the issue, as today's Washington Post notes in an article written before Monti's announcement. The Post noted that  Microsoft has argued that producing a version of its software that
does not include its Windows Media Player would be "technically difficult and would harm the interests of consumers, who find the multiple functions of Windows useful." The other side sees it very different, as the newspaper explained: "Since Windows' release in 1985,  Microsoft has steadily added new features to the operating system, such as Internet browsing software and the media player. Because Windows is used on most personal computers in the world, critics say that including these new features unfairly disadvantages other companies that sell similar software -- in media players, for example. People won't buy their software, the logic goes, if something similar is a standard feature on Windows."

When I wrote about the  antitrust case earlier this week, reader , an assistant professor at the , sent this e-mail: "I have not made up my mind quite yet whether the EU remedy will be effective. Forcing Microsoft to offer two versions (one with the media player and one without) might be problematic. It is akin to competing with yourself at a game of checkers: You know well in advance which side is going to win, no matter how fair you attempt to be in your play. Allowing  Microsoft to set up the terms of competition among its two products will eventually lead to consumers seeking the integrated windows version as Microsoft hamstrings the other version. And  Microsoft may have tremendous incentive and ability to hamstring the stripped version, depending on the language of the Commission's final order."

Meanwhile, back home in the states,  Microsoft is hoping to nix one of several remaining antitrust cases by showing its human side. The Los Angeles Times noted that "[d]espite settling antitrust lawsuits with the Justice Department, corporate rivals, more than a dozen states and millions of consumers, the company's representatives have never apologized for its rapacious behavior. That streak ended in Minneapolis, when a  Microsoft attorney conceded to a jury that the company had been overly
aggressive in defending its turf. A  Microsoft attorney conceded to a jury that the company had been overly aggressive in defending its turf. 'Yes, we acknowledge that and we apologize for it,' lawyer David Tulchin said. Though he insisted that no laws were broken, he acknowledged that "the conduct involved competition that went over the line," the article said. The Associated Press completes the quote: "The conduct involved competition that went over the line. The question for you is whether or not consumers were overcharged." Now, don't hold your breath for an apology of this sort across the pond.

In an effort to ramp-up the security of its products,  Microsoft yesterday put out another version to update its operating system. The update "includes several significant changes from the test version released last year. RC1 versions of software releases are typically bridges between the beta and the final release, incorporating changes based on tester feedback. The final version of SP2 is set for release in the second quarter of this year," CNET's News.com reported

, Europe's big annual electronics expo, kicked off last night in Germany. Expect a slew of interesting tech products to be unveiled. "This year some of the bullishness of previous years has returned thanks to the growing success of wifi, renewed interest in mobile phones and the growing role of the PC as the heart of the digital, hi-tech home. Also on show will be the usual slew of nifty gadgets including a paper computer, a camera lens that works like the human eye and a Swiss army knife that doubles as a portable memory card," BBC News Online reported.

ZDNet UK said this year's show, which was started with a keynote by German Chancellor , has higher security than in the past, "following last week's terrorist attacks in Madrid. Regular show visitors have noticed a large increase in the number of police officers patrolling the Hannover show ground," the article said.

Microsoft used Cebit to introduce a handheld music and video player. "The first handheld gadgets to play music and movies on Microsoft's 'iPod killer' software will be available in Europe in the second half of 2004, the company said Thursday. ... The gadgets will run on  Microsoft's yet-to-be-unveiled software in a direct assault on , 's hot-selling digital music player," Reuters reported. The International Herald Tribune said Microsoft hopes the new plans "will give it an edge against Apple and others in the market for portable media devices. At the same time, Sony stepped into the potentially lucrative market for
hand-held media players, announcing details for a pocket-sized music-only gadget and its new online music service, called ."

More details on the new  Microsoft gadget from BBC News Online: "The Portable Media Center has an operating system which is similar to  Microsoft desktop Media Center software and uses Windows media. It will also play MP3 files. It will synchronise with a Windows XP computer to transfer video, music or photos. A device with a 40 gigabyte hard drive would be able to hold 175 hours of video, 10,000 songs or
100,000 pictures. The battery would last long enough to let you watch one of the three-hour instalments of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy or listen to 12 hours of music."

might be looking for a new home by the end of the year. "People familiar with the thinking of Chief Executive say one of his top priorities this year is to evaluate whether keeping the online-services unit makes strategic sense for the media giant," The Wall Street Journal reported today. "People familiar with the situation say Time Warner hasn't made a firm decision on AOL's future, but it is in the midst of its annual strategic-planning process in which it evaluates all its businesses."

The Journal article follows a piece in The New York Post yesterday, which indicated a sale of AOL could be in the offing. "Time Warner is considering strategic alternatives for its America Online (search) division, including a possible sale, spin-off or a significant restructuring of the business," the newspaper said yesterday.

Hollywood has been working fast and furiously to battle the online pirating of movies, but it turns out Asian piracy rings aren't the only ones to blame. "Two employees of have been terminated after the company's discovery of illegally downloaded movies and software on a Fox computer network server. The titles found on the server included 'Bringing Down the House,' 'Daddy Day Care,' 'Old School,'
'Daredevil,' 'Deliver Us From Eva,' 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'X2: X-Men United,'" The Los Angeles
Times said in an article that cited a report from Web site.

The Wall Street Journal said the "incident is particularly embarrassing for Fox, which among the studios has taken one of the most strident stances in Hollywood's crusade to halt piracy before it ravages the film business as it has the music industry. President has been a strong voice in favor of strong antipiracy measures."

LP
BRUSSELS, March 17 -- The chances of a settlement between Microsoft and European antitrust regulars have dimmed significantly, as Mario Monti, Europe's antitrust chief, is now demanding further concessions from  Microsoft as the price for a settlement, people close to the talks said Wednesday.

Mr. Monti held a brief meeting with Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive on Wednesday morning, after spending four hours with him and Microsoft's chief lawyer, Bradford L. Smith, on Tuesday, a person close to the talks said, adding that they parted without reaching any agreement.

TD
Another face-to-face meeting between Mr. Monti and Mr. Ballmer is ''unlikely,'' this person added.

If no settlement is reached between now and next Wednesday, the  European Commission is expected to adopt a ruling that finds  Microsoft to be an abusive monopolist. The commission's order would force Microsoft to offer two versions of its Windows operating system in Europe: one with Microsoft's music and video software and one with Media Player stripped out of the operating system and sold separately.

The ruling is also expected to order  Microsoft to license more secret code in Windows to allow rivals to build software that works smoothly with Windows, and to  fine Microsoft 100 million euros ($122 million) to 1 billion euros.

To avert such a ruling, Mr. Monti is asking  Microsoft to agree not to distort  competition by bundling peripheral software programs in Windows in the future. ''Such a legal undertaking could simulate the effect of a precedent-setting legal ruling,'' said a Brussels-based lawyer close to the talks, adding that after making such a commitment in writing,  Microsoft could be challenged on its motives for bundling other software into Windows.

In addition to Media Player,  Microsoft also bundles its Instant Messenger Service and Outlook e-mail program into Windows. It is also planning to bundle a search engine, which would compete with Google, later this year.

Microsoft declined to comment on Mr. Monti's terms for a settlement. A company spokesman said efforts to reach a settlement were continuing.
The commission also declined to comment on what Mr. Monti is seeking from a settlement.

Mr. Monti held a meeting with his team of antitrust officials Wednesday afternoon informing them of the tough stance he is adopting with Microsoft ahead of the ruling next week.

One person present said the commissioner looked very confident. ''The support from the advisory committee meeting on Monday meant a lot to him,'' the person said, referring to a meeting of top

Page 148 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
regulators from the European Union's 15 member nations. Some of the national regulators at that meeting had urged Mr. Monti not to duck away from setting a legal precedent, the person said.

''Some of them said the ruling could be tougher,'' the person said. ''It looks like that's what Monti thinks, too. ''

The bundling question is a major sticking point for the settlement talks.  Microsoft argues that adding functions like Media Player to Windows is what computer users want and has based much of its business model around developing Windows in this way. It has also argued that to remove Media Player would harm Windows.

The commission, as well as rival software makers, have argued that bundling programs like Media Player into Windows is anticompetitive, because it puts rival music and video players like RealOne Player by RealNetworks and Quicktime by Apple at a disadvantage.

The second strand of the  European Commission's case on licensing Windows code is expected to be easier to resolve, but people close to the talks said that this issue had not been resolved yet.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti has said that he will urge the commission to adopt his ruling on the case, including  fines, at its meeting next Wednesday.

The association's president, Jonathan Zuck, said: "The breakdown in negotiations is disappointing but understandable" .

In the US,  Microsoft previously reached a settlement to end an ongoing  antitrust investigation, agreeing to uniformly license its operating systems and allow manufacturers to include competing software with Windows.

DAVID BROWN, anchor:

Microsoft's attorney says the process of negotiations with the Europe Union was very constructive, very cooperative and very professional. He judiciously left out very disappointing. But the folks at Microsoft must be less than happy with European regulators. On this March 18th, talks with the EU over antitrust abuse allegations broke down. All that remains between the software giant and a multimillion euro fine is a vote from the  European Commission next week. As MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott reports, all 15 member countries are on the record supporting the sanctions plus new demands over how the company markets its operating system.

TD
AMY SCOTT reporting:

Though the terms aren't final, one thing is clear:  Microsoft's Media Player monopoly is in jeopardy, at least in Europe. Eben Moglen teaches software and law at Columbia University.

Mr. EBEN MOGLEN (Columbia University):  Microsoft will no longer be able to say to the content industries everywhere in the world, `We basically control how content reaches the eyeball and the eardrum of the multimedia consumer.'

SCOTT: Piracy-wary companies like Disney have been strong  Microsoft allies. Microsoft designed its Windows Media Player to prevent file sharing. The company says it will appeal any unfavorable ruling in Europe. But capitalism, not the legal system, could pose the biggest threat. This week, Hewlett-Packard said it would begin shipping PCs to Asia, installed not with Windows but with its Open Source competitor Linus. Forrester Research recently surveyed 140 businesses that use Windows. Analyst Ted Schadler says that more than 10 percent said they might switch to Open Source.

Mr. TED SCHADLER ( Forrester Research): So that means that there are 16 companies that last year were not at all thinking about leaving  Microsoft, this year are thinking about leaving  Microsoft.

SCOTT: Schadler said  Microsoft isn't going anywhere. The company reported record earnings last quarter. It's sitting on more than $50 billion in cash. But he says as regulators and competitors chip away at Microsoft's dominance, customers will benefit from more choices and lower prices. In New York, I'm Amy Scott for MARKETPLACE.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(Dow Jones)--Stocks finished lower, but well off their lows after reports that Pakistani troops may have surrounded al-Qaida's number-two official. While the news was taken as a positive, there were still decliners, notably Intel and  Microsoft, which tugged at both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Nasdaq lost 14.32 points, or 0.72%, to 1962.44, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.52, or
0.04%, to 10295.78 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 1.44, or 0.13%, to 1122.31, with the latter
still positive for the year.

"You had reports of a potential capture and that gave us a definite boost," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Co. "But you don't want to get too excited because captures, like when Saddam Hussein was caught, have an immediate impact but the market tends to give it back."
Intel lost 59 cents, or 2.1%, to 27.20, part of a generally weak semiconductor group that had helped to lead
Wednesday's rally.

Microsoft fell 24 cents, or almost 1%, to 24.89. Settlement talks related to an  antitrust case brought by the European Commission have broken down, leading to a probable  fine and other punishment against the world's largest software company.

United Technologies, a Dow industrial average member, dropped 97 cents, or 1.1%, to 87.83. The diverse industrial manufacturer reaffirmed 2004 earnings in the range of $5 to $5.30 per share, with the low end below analysts' expectations of $5.22.

Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.36 billion shares. Down volume exceeded up, 763 million to 575 million, and decliners beat advancers, 1,825 to 1,461.

Sydney - Friday - March 19: (RWE) - Rumours of terrorist attacks gripped financial markets overnight and produced some erratic movements during the session.
Wall Street's Dow Jones was up about 29 points at one stage, but then fell back into negative territory.

TD
An early report of a major Dow rise was incorrect.
The key blue-chip barometer ended 5 points behind, the S&P 500 came off 1, the Nasdaq lost 14 and
100 index closed 11 lower.

Investors were influenced by a report that Pakistani troops had surrounded the deputy leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman Al Zawahri in northern Pakistan and a fierce battle was still in progress.
But no further news has emerged from the scene.

A bomb scare on the French Euro train line shook European markets as well, with market traders thinking about the recent Spanish train horror.

The parcel on the line turned out to be a false alarm, although a man was arrested in Dover soon after, which also turned out to be nothing.
The US dollar took a dive early in the day, mostly on security worries.
The greenback slumped almost one-and-a-half yen to 106.59 yen compared with yesterday. It also dropped against the sterling and surprisingly the euro, despite the train incident. Bonds fell on the Pakistan report after earlier gaining on some soft business activity figures. The 10-year cash paper yield rose 3 points to 3.75 per cent.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's measure of business activity fell to 24.2 in March from 31.4 in
February.
It caught the market by surprise with analysts predicting a figure around 30. However, there were some signs of inflation in the wings.
The delayed Labor Department Producer Price Index, which measures prices paid to farms, factories and refineries, rose more than anticipated with a 0.6 per cent rise in January against a 0.2 per cent movement in the previous month.

It was the sharpest gain in wholesale prices since a 0.7 per cent advance in October 2003, and was again underestimated by economic forecasts.
The state weekly jobless insurance benefits claims were more encouraging.

For the week ended March 13, Americans seeking financial help fell by 6000 to 336,000, well down on analysts' predictions.

Page 155 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It was the lowest level since January 2001, according to the Labor Department report.
In the market  Microsoft appeared to be moving into troubled waters again over  antitrust laws.
The corporation failed to reach an arrangement with the  European Commission, which will rule whether
Microsoft is "an abusive monopolist".

According to a Reuters story,  Microsoft could be fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.

WALL STREET ... has settled 4.52 points lower at 10,295.78 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The broadly-based S&P 500 finished 1.47 lower at 1122.31. The Nasdaq composite lost 14.32 to
1962.44 and the 100 index ended 11.12 lower at 1417.77. Treasuries were hit by security fears and attack rumours. The 10-year cash paper fell 9/32 ticks to 102 1/32, lifting the yield 3 points to 3.75 per cent.

US DOLLAR ... was also hurt by terrorist worries, falling sharply on the yen and other major currencies. The dollar fell to 106.75 yen in New York compared with 108.28 yesterday.

[ Including Australian sharemarket ]

Sydney - Friday - March 19: (RWE) - Rumours of terrorist attacks gripped financial markets overnight and produced some erratic movements during the session.

TD
Wall Street's Dow Jones was up about 29 points at one stage, but then fell back into negative territory.
An early report of a major Dow rise was incorrect.

The key blue-chip barometer ended 5 points behind, the S&P 500 came off 1, the Nasdaq lost 14 and 100 index closed 11 lower.

Investors were influenced by a report that Pakistani troops had surrounded the deputy leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman Al Zawahri in northern Pakistan and a fierce battle was still in progress.
But no further news has emerged from the scene.

A bomb scare on the French Euro train line shook European markets as well, with market traders thinking about the recent Spanish train horror.

The parcel on the line turned out to be a false alarm, although a man was arrested in Dover soon after, which also turned out to be nothing.
The US dollar took a dive early in the day, mostly on security worries.
The greenback slumped almost one-and-a-half yen to 106.59 yen compared with yesterday. It also dropped against the sterling and surprisingly the euro, despite the train incident. Bonds fell on the Pakistan report after earlier gaining on some soft business activity figures. The 10-year cash paper yield rose 3 points to 3.75 per cent.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's measure of business activity fell to 24.2 in March from 31.4 in
February.
It caught the market by surprise with analysts predicting a figure around 30. However, there were some signs of inflation in the wings.
The delayed Labor Department Producer Price Index, which measures prices paid to farms, factories and refineries, rose more than anticipated with a 0.6 per cent rise in January against a 0.2 per cent movement in the previous month.

It was the sharpest gain in wholesale prices since a 0.7 per cent advance in October 2003, and was again underestimated by economic forecasts.
The state weekly jobless insurance benefits claims were more encouraging.

For the week ended March 13, Americans seeking financial help fell by 6000 to 336,000, well down on analysts' predictions.
It was the lowest level since January 2001, according to the Labor Department report.
In the market  Microsoft appeared to be moving into troubled waters again over  antitrust laws.
The corporation failed to reach an arrangement with the  European Commission, which will rule whether
Microsoft is "an abusive monopolist".

According to a Reuters story,  Microsoft could be fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.

WALL STREET ... has settled 4.52 points lower at 10,295.78 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The broadly-based S&P 500 finished 1.47 lower at 1122.31. The Nasdaq composite lost 14.32 to 1962.44 and the 100 index ended 11.12 lower at 1417.77. Treasuries were hit by security fears and attack rumours. The 10-year cash paper fell 9/32 ticks to 102 1/32, lifting the yield 3 points to 3.75 per cent.

US DOLLAR ... was also hurt by terrorist worries, falling sharply on the yen and other major currencies. The dollar fell to 106.75 yen in New York compared with 108.28 yesterday. The euro rose to 1.2387 against the previous figure of 1.2240. Sterling rose to 1.8338 compared with 1.8164 previously.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR ... has traded higher on the back of the US dollar weakness. It is currently changing hands at US75.14c, up 72 points on last night's local close. High for the session was 75.30c and low 74.16c. The dollar is changing hands on the crosses at 80.22 yen (prev 80.22), 0.6065 euro (prev
0.6055) and 40.97 pence (40.79).

AUSTRALIAN SHAREMARKET ... is likely to be struggling today. The market finished lower in erratic trading yesterday with the All Ordinaries down 7.7 to 3424.6 (after touching a record 3448.5 early) and the ASX 200 off 9 to 3429.4. In overnight futures trading the June SPI 200 was steady at 3452 and
September up 7 to 3469. Today's economic data is housing finance for owner-occupied dwellings in January. In the sharemarket, TAB will be under the spotlight after its Sky Channel ceased broadcasts of Sydney thoroughbred races following the collapse of negotiations with horse-racing bodies. Also, Qantas is reportedly looking to invest in a new low-cost airline in Asia. There are three new listings today. Hunter Hall Global Value, an investor in international and Australian shares, will see its $1 shares (with 1-for-1 free attaching options) open at 11am. At midday, 50c shares in biomedical developer Tissue Therapies will make their debut. And Great Western Exploration's 20c shares come on at 1pm.

HD     EU set to fix sanctions on Microsoft ; Expected penalties  aimed at gaining  access to future
Windows  applications

After last-ditch negotiations failed, the European Union said Thursday it plans to go forward with major sanctions against  Microsoft Corp. for abusing its monopoly power in the computer software business. The EU is expected to try to force  Microsoft to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in  fines and drastically change the way it sells its products in Europe. A final ruling detailing the penalties is set for next week, although Microsoft can appeal.

But, more broadly, the European action might finally force the world's biggest software company to seriously start considering how it bundles different applications into future versions of its Windows operating system.

TD
"What  Microsoft has that no other software vendor has is the ability to integrate a huge range of technology together and make it universal," said Rob Helm, research director at Directions on  Microsoft, an independent research company in Kirkland, Wash. "But they may have to start thinking about offering PC manufacturers a more modular form of Windows -- perhaps a stripped-down Windows" that lacks programs such as Internet browsers or media players, Helm said.
Certainly,  Microsoft doesn't want to take such drastic measures unless it's forced. On Thursday the
Redmond, Wash.-based software giant indicated it would file a lawsuit aimed at thwarting the EU action.

"Today is just another step in what could be a long process,"  Microsoft senior vice president and general counsel Brad Smith said in a statement. "Perhaps the courts will provide the clarity that is necessary to resolve these issues."

The European complaint centers on the Windows Media Player software, used to watch movies and listen to music on PCs. Competitors and regulators say they fear  Microsoft could use the software to extend its monopoly into a wide variety of new applications and devices, from entertainment center computers to handheld media players.

"In the end, I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement. "I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent . . . which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position in the market."

For starters, the EU wants  Microsoft to offer PC makers separate versions of its Windows software, one with the media player and one without it.

Microsoft apparently was willing to do that, but it apparently wouldn't agree to make its Windows code more accessible for applications -- everything from built-in search engines to programs - - that  Microsoft hasn't even dreamed up yet.

"I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case,"  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in a statement. "But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future."

As recently as a few days ago, it looked like  Microsoft and the EU were coming to terms, in part because of last-minute negotiating by Ballmer himself. Early Thursday morning, however,  Microsoft and the EU announced talks had broken off.

Details of  Microsoft's settlement offer weren't disclosed. But  Microsoft attorney Smith contended that they would have gone a long way toward resolving the concerns of regulators not just in Europe, but elsewhere. The  European Commission's pursuit of more far- reaching changes to the Windows operating system, Smith suggested, could have harmed consumers more than helped them.

EU meets to step up security after Madrid attack

BRUSSELS - European Union countries will discuss creating a database of terror suspects and other measures at emergency talks on Friday to beef up security after last week's suspected al Qaeda attack in Madrid.

EU interior and justice ministers are expected to boost cooperation rather than establish new security bodies, as Europe faces up to the fact it may now be a target for Muslim militants fighting for or linked to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda.
Other plans drafted by the  European Commission in the wake of the Madrid train bombings that killed
201 people and wounded nearly 1,700 include a register of convicts and better tracing of weapons and
explosives.

"It's not a question of reinventing the wheel in relation to how we deal with terrorism..., it's a question of making the wheel turn a bit faster," Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, whose country holds the EU's presidency, said on Thursday.

EU, Microsoft fail to reach deal in  antitrust case

BRUSSELS -  Microsoft Corp. failed on Thursday to reach a deal with the  European Commission, setting the stage for a landmark  antitrust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist.

It will be  fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.  Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $24.89 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday.

The decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush smaller rivals.

Spain wants "maximum power" in EU, says Zapatero

MADRID - Spain's next prime minister said on Thursday he would fight for as much power as possible for Madrid in a European Union constitution, yet was optimistic of a breakthrough over voting rights.

"I'm going to defend maximum possible power for Spain in the European Union," Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in an interview with Spanish television. "My primary goal is that we have a European constitution as soon as possible."

Talks on a constitution for an enlarged EU of 25 members broke down in December when Spain, with
Poland, blocked the draft because it would reduce their voting rights.

New Irish proposal may solve EU share-trading row

BRUSSELS - A key EU official said on Thursday she was ready to back a compromise giving the green light to highly disputed European Union share trading rules that would let banks compete with stock exchanges.

"I will be voting for the compromise and recommending other members of the European parliament to do it as well," Theresa Villiers, the British parliamentarian in charge of the issue in the European Parliament, told Reuters.

EU states and the European Parliament have locked horns over what pre-trade transparency obligations to impose on banks in return for allowing them to trade shares in-house.

Under the compromise proposed by Ireland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, banks would have to reveal what +M they are willing to trade at "when dealing for sizes up to standard market size," according to another EU official.

Tiny Malta expects to make voice heard in EU

VALLETTA - Malta will make its small voice heard in the European Union because of the special Mediterranean dimension it will bring to the bloc, the man set to become Malta's new prime minister said on Thursday.

Lawrence Gonzi, 50, is expected to replace on Monday Eddie Fenech Adami, 70, who has said he will resign after the ruling Nationalist Party elects a new deputy leader on Friday.

"Small is beautiful, and the way the EU is structured and operates will ensure that Malta's voice and its vote will be an important part of the European reality," Gonzi told Reuters Television in an interview.

"This will be a coming of age for a young independent state which will take its rightful place among its European partners," Gonzi said. "We'll bring to the EU a Mediterranean dimension which nobody else might bring."

EU newcomers chide current members for slow reforms

BRATISLAVA - Incoming European Union members criticised current members on Thursday for failing to find the political will to implement reforms which they themselves have already introduced.

Senior officials from several countries due to join the EU on May 1 said the enlarged Union should slash farm spending and that current members such as Germany should partly privatise pension systems and make it easier to hire and fire workers.

Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos criticised the Union for foot-dragging and said he hopes enlargement will "deepen and speed up structural reforms in current EU states", though he remained sceptical much would change.

Uzbekistan opposition needs "breathing space" - EU

TASHKENT - Uzbekistan should provide "breathing space" for the oppressed opposition and media, and bolster piecemeal reforms to lure investment, a senior European Union official said on Thursday.
EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said he had told Uzbek President Islam Karimov
Europe would welcome reforms leading to greater freedom.

"I set out my thoughts on the importance of providing a breathing space in a new, modern democracy for political opponents, as well as for civil society and, of course, the media," Patten told a news conference after meeting Karimov.

Madrid attacks won't hurt euro zone econ - Grasser

BRATISLAVA - Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser said on Thursday the Madrid bombings will not dampen the euro zone's economic recovery and that he sees 2004 GDP growth at 1.75-2.0 percent.

"It (Madrid) is a tragedy ... but the world knows how to deal with such terrorist attacks and all the messages that we are getting from the markets are that trust for recovery is still there," he told Reuters on the sidelines of an economic conference in Bratislava.

"I expect the positive forecasts will be realised and I think euro zone growth for this year could be between 1.75 and 2.0 percent ... Terrorism will not affect our economic recovery," he added.

Hungary signals may delay euro entry to aid growth
BUDAPEST - Hungary gave its strongest signal so far that it may drop a target of adopting the euro in
2008, when its finance minister said on Thursday that sticking to that date would hurt economic growth.

Instead, Hungary may put off membership of the euro zone to 2009 or 2010, Tibor Draskovics told a business lunch.

"One possible choice for us is that we strain ourselves to join in 2008, which is theoretically achievable, but would have a serious growth sacrifice, or we can choose to enter one or two years later...which would be a smaller growth sacrifice and better for competitiveness," he said.

But the centre-left government put the target date under review early this year, after the budget deficit for 2003 came out at 5.9 percent of gross domestic product.

Poland to meet eurozone criteria in 3-4 yrs-FinMin

BRATISLAVA - Poland is likely to curb its budget deficit to below three percent of GDP in three to four years, enabling it to adopt the euro before the end of the decade, Finance Minister Andrzej Raczko said on Thursday.

He added that after meeting the nominal fiscal criterion, Poland should give itself another year to see whether the budget deficit is firmly on a downward path.

"Reaching three percent (of GDP) in the budget gap is a very good signal, but we will take a year to observe if the economy is able to maintain such a low level of public spending," Raczko told Reuters on sidelines of an economic seminar in Bratislava.

"In three, four years we should be able to reach the appropriate level of the budget deficit. If that proves sustainable then I am an optimist that we will be able to join the eurozone soon afterwards," he said.

EU worried making sole effort to cut farm handouts

BRUSSELS - The European Union wants an agreement to help take world trade talks forward, but is afraid of being the only one to cut its handouts for farm exports.

"The idea is still that we should try everything possible to reach an agreement...before the middle of the year, before the summer break," European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler told a news conference on Thursday.
But Fischler said all users of export subsidies had to make an effort to reduce them.
"For us what is important is that we get better guarantees on parallelism," meaning that not only EU
subsidies, but also state trading enterprises and export credits should be cut.

EU newcomers receive wake-up call on farm payments

BRUSSELS - Europe's farm chief issued a stern warning on Thursday to the 10 countries set to join the EU in May that they must work urgently to set up proper systems for paying subsidies - or risk losing out on generous EU benefits.

"All acceding countries still have work to do. In many cases the timetable for finishing the work is very tight," EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler told a news conference.
"There is not a second to lose," he said. "A big final effort is required to get everything done on time." Each new EU member must have an accredited paying agency, also approved by the Commission,
which can process farmers' subsidy applications and issue payments accordingly.

EU gears up for fight on tobacco, olive oil reform

BRUSSELS - Five EU states hold the key to the European Union's next wave of farm reforms and will fight hard to save jobs in poor areas that depend on olive oil, cotton and tobacco, diplomats said on Thursday.

EU minister, building on principles agreed last June on overhauling cereals and livestock, will next week debate plans to change the subsidy systems for so-called Mediterranean products, which are dominated by Spain, Greece and Italy.

At the heart of the debate will be concerns among the producers about farmers abandoning land due to the decoupling of subsidy payments from production.

"The principle of decoupling is accepted. What is at stake is the number of jobs for tobacco and cotton," one EU official said. "The other main issue is the Spanish quota on olive oil."

Czech budget revision won't hit euro plan-FinMin

BRATISLAVA - A major revision of the Czech 2003 budget deficit putting it at 12.9 percent of GDP will not affect the country's plan to adopt the euro at the end of the decade, Finance Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said on Thursday.

Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency, said on Tuesday the Czechs posted a 328.5 billion crown ($12.20 billion) fiscal gap last year, around double previous finance ministry estimates due to the inclusion of one-off items.

Speaking at a financial conference in the Slovak capital Bratislava, Sobotka said he does not expect any further revisions to data, and that they do not affect the government's plan to adopt the euro between 2008 and 2010.
"Nothing has changed with regard to our plans," he said.

EU warns pregnant women over mercury in fish

BRUSSELS - Pregnant women should limit consumption of swordfish and tuna due to high mercury levels which can cause brain damage in unborn children, the EU's food safety authority said on Thursday.

Pollution causes the toxic metal mercury to accumulate in fish and seafood, in the form of meythlmercury. The EU's food safety authority (EFSA) said consumers were close to reaching safe intake levels for the toxin.

"EFSA recommends that women of childbearing age...select fish from a wide range of species, without giving undue preference to large predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna," it said in a statement.

EU lawmakers condemn U.S. anti-terror air data deal

BRUSSELS - Key EU lawmakers dealt a blow to Washington's air security strategy on Thursday by rejecting a U.S.-EU accord on handing over passengers' personal details.

Page 165 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Citing civil rights concerns, the European Parliament's civil liberties committee voted by a large majority to condemn the  European Commission for agreeing to pass on data, such as credit card numbers and phone numbers, which Washington says it needs to spot potential terrorists.

"The agreement with the United States is not on a level that it gives enough protection to EU citizens," said Dutch Liberal Democrat Johanna Boogerd-Quaak, who was overseeing the dossier.

HD            Microsoft prepares for monopoly fightback

MICROSOFT yesterday began its fightback against a  European Commission verdict that the software group abused its monopoly after last-minute negotiations failed to achieve a settlement.

The world's biggest software company all but conceded that, after the failure of eleventh-hour talks with Mario Monti, Europe's  Competition Commissioner, it expected to be found to have abused the dominant position of its Windows computer operating system.

TD
"We will be taking this matter to the European Court," said John Frank,  Microsoft's deputy general counsel, who took part in the final round of discussions with Signor Monti. The appeal against the Commission's ruling will extend the long-running case for many more months.

Signor Monti is understood to have refused a number of concessions that  Microsoft offered in a desperate attempt to head off a ruling on the investigation next week.

By refusing to settle the case, which began in 1998, Signor Monti set the stage for a landmark ruling that is expected to see  Microsoft hit with a  fine of between Euro 500 million (Pounds 340 million) and Euro 1 billion as well as sanctions that will force it to change the way it sells and licenses software.

"In the end I had to take a decision, to decide what was best for competition and consumers in Europe," Signor Monti said. He added: "I believe that competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."
A settlement would not have carried any burden of guilt on  Microsoft's part.

Steve Ballmer,  Microsoft's billionaire chief executive, who flew into Brussels this week to try to negotiate a settlement with Signor Monti, said that the talks broke down on the matter of how to resolve possible future  antitrust complaints against the software company.

"I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case. But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," he said.

Microsoft shares fell 50 cents to $24.63 in early New York trade.

Mr Ballmer said he hoped that "perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage", as the company did in the US, where a settlement was reached after a final court decision.

The 15 member states of the European Union will meet on Monday to decide the  fine to be levied against Microsoft. A source close to the Commission said the  fine would "need to be of a scale that hurts Microsoft".

Even the maximum possible  fine of about $3.2 billion (Pounds 1.7 billion) -or 10 per cent of Microsoft's revenues during the period when its behaviour was in question -would hardly dent its cash balance of $55 billion. But anything above Euro 462 million would be a record for any  fine imposed by the Commission.

Signor Monti has worked tirelessly to ensure that the Commission's case against  Microsoft is strong enough to withstand a challenge at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

The regulator has enlisted an internal committee to make the highest-profile decision of his tenure watertight and avoid a repeat of previous situations where decisions have come under attack.
The European Court of Justice has ruled on three occasions in the past two years that the
Commission overreached its powers when blocking mergers.

Microsoft Corp. and European  antitrust regulators broke off last-ditch settlement talks yesterday, setting the stage for a court battle that could impose limits on the software company's expansion in new markets such as handheld devices and smart phones.

TD
A formal decision in the European Commission's five-year-old  Microsoft case isn't expected until Wednesday, but commission antitrust chief Mario Monti said a settlement “hasn't been possible” despite three days of high-level meetings involving  Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer.

The sticking point, in the end, was Mr. Monti's insistence that a settlement not be restricted to the current case, which alleges that the software titan is using its near-monopoly in the market for operating systems for personal computers to dominate media and networking software. Mr. Monti is also seeking to resolve at least one other pending complaint that alleges  Microsoft illegally leverages its Windows operating system to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices.

“We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct,” Mr. Monti told a news conference in Brussels. He added that he is seeking “a strong precedent” that would “establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market.”

Microsoft's critics cheered Mr. Monti's announcement.

“I'm hopeful that our case now will move to centre stage and get accelerated attention,” said Ed Black, president of the Washington-based Computer & Communications Industry Association, which urged European Union  antitrust authorities in January, 2003, to investigate the pending case involving
next-generation software.

The association's members include not only  Microsoft competitors such as Sun Microsystems Inc., but also Microsoft business partners such as Fujitsu Ltd. and Verizon Communications Inc.

Regulators also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree to unfair technology licensing terms. “There are a lot of complaints in our files and others' files, and we really have to set some guidelines for the future,” said Europe's No. 2  antitrust official, Philip Lowe.

The immediate effect of a failure of marathon settlement talks likely will be an appeal by the Redmond, Wash.-based software company to the EU's highest courts. The company not only can appeal the commission's finding that it violated European  antitrust law, but it also can ask the
Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance to suspend the commission's decision pending the outcome of an appeal.

Page 169 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
“Today is just another step in what could be a long process,” said Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel. “We'll all benefit from the clarity that courts can bring to these questions.”

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement with EU regulators, with Mr. Ballmer spending the week in Brussels overseeing the company's negotiating tactics. He met Mr. Monti a third time yesterday morning before Mr. Monti made his announcement.

The settlement talks' failure is a big blow for  Microsoft, which could have avoided any finding of guilt and payment of headline-grabbing  fines by striking a deal with Mr. Monti.
Mr. Monti, encouraged earlier this week by unanimous support from  antitrust authorities in the EU's
15 member states, said he would meet with his fellow European commissioners on Wednesday to
discuss imposing a fine on Microsoft for its alleged misconduct and possible orders to change
Microsoft's business practices.

The fine is expected to come to more than 100 million euros ($165-million), but people familiar with Microsoft say that — and the other changes to Microsoft's business practices that the commission is seeking — won't significantly slow down Microsoft in the market.

More troublesome than any  fine for Microsoft would be expected EU demands that  Microsoft offer computer makers a version of Windows without its own multimedia software. Mr. Monti also is likely to demand that the company publicly release enough of its code to allow rival server software
companies, such as Sun Microsystems, to interface as well with computers running Windows.

Probably the most painful issue for  Microsoft is “unbundling” its Media Player. Such an order would complicate Microsoft's business strategy of integrating new functions into Windows, including Web search engines and other consumer-friendly features.

Microsoft could appeal any orders to the Court of First Instance and later to the European Court of
Justice for a final ruling, a procedure that could take several years.

BRUSSELS

The European Union  antitrust chief says last ditch settlement talks with  Microsoft Corp. have failed and he will propose that a precedent-setting ruling against the U.S. software giant be adopted next week.

TD
"We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems that had arisen in the past but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti said yesterday. "It was impossible to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of setting a precedent."

The dispute over "future conduct" included EU regulators' demands that  Microsoft alter its plans to bundle multiple features into future products, including its next version of Windows, due in 2006.

That edition of Windows is expected to contain a search engine and other features that could compete with rival products.  Microsoft's chief counsel, Brad Smith, agreed the talks broke down over the EU's attempt to regulate the company's behaviour. He reiterated  Microsoft's determination to take any negative decision to court.

Monti said he would also propose a fine -- expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars -- when his draft decision goes to the full European Commission, the EU's executive branch, on Wednesday.
After winning unanimous backing from the 15 EU governments last week, the ruling is expected to pass easily.

Microsoft is accused of unfairly grabbing market share from rival companies by "bundling" its own version of their products with Windows -- the operating system in the majority of personal computers worldwide.

Microsoft says that benefits consumers, but rivals claim it's unfair  competition intended to drive them out of business.

The charge was similar to the 1990s Internet browser war in the U.S., where  Microsoft was found guilty of using illegal means to protect its Windows monopoly. But a 2001 settlement with the Bush administration allowed it to continue integrating its Internet Explorer with Windows.

Sources familiar with the case say the EU's draft ruling also finds  Microsoft guilty of monopolistic behaviour -- setting a precedent in Europe -- and goes beyond the U.S. remedies.

The EU is demanding  Microsoft offer computer makers in Europe a discounted version of Windows without its Media Player pre-installed, so rivals like RealNetworks Inc.'s RealOne Player and Apple Computer Inc.'s QuickTime have a better shot at reaching consumers.

In addition, the draft is expected to require the company to release more underlying Windows code so rival server software companies like Sun Microsystems can interface as well with computers running Windows. EU officials last year began investigating competitors' charges that Microsoft's latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

Sources said Microsoft made a last minute offer to include rival media programs with Windows, along with its own, to settle the case and avoid an "unbundling" order that could interfere with its business strategy. But at a news conference, Monti said "In the end I had to ... decide what was best for competition and consumers in Europe."
However, he praised the "high degree of professionalism" of the  Microsoft negotiating team.

Monti would not comment on the size of the  fine he would seek. The figure will be presented Monday to the advisory committee of national regulators for review before going to the commission.

MICROSOFT WILL be fined hundreds of millions of euros by the  European Commission and could be forced to sell versions of its Windows operating system with rival media-playing programs included, after talks between the two sides broke down yesterday.

Despite the intervention of  Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, who flew to Europe for talks with the EU  Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, the sides said they could not agree on "commitments for future conduct".

TD
Microsoft said it would appeal against the decision - a process that could take years.

At the same time, the EU is also expected to tell  Microsoft to reveal details about how its larger server computers communicate with its desktop machines. Windows dominates the desktop, with more than
90 per cent market share, and the EU believes it is using that effective monopoly to muscle its way into the server market.

Microsoft was accused of shutting out rivals by including its own Media Player software in Windows, rather than requiring users to download it, as they must for rival products.  Microsoft responded that the bundling benefited consumers.

The draft decision will go to the full  European Commission next Wednesday, where it is expected to be approved.
Mr Monti said it was "impossible to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of setting a precedent."

He added: "In the end I had to ... decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe. I believe competition and consumers will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent ... that will set clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position in the market."

Microsoft's chief counsel, Brad Smith, said the talks broke down over the EU's attempt to regulate future behaviour.

BRUSSELS:

Settlement talks between  Microsoft and the European Commission collapsed Thursday, virtually assuring that the five-year-old dispute will conclude next week with an  antitrust ruling and fines against the company.

TD
After a third and final face-to-face meeting with Steven Ballmer, the chief executive of  Microsoft, in Brussels on Thursday morning, the  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, paid a surprise visit to journalists attending the daily noon briefing at the  European Commission's head office.
A settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible, he said.

Microsoft's top lawyer, Brad Smith, confirmed two hours later that the company had given up trying to avert a negative ruling next week. I am now going home, he said. Mr. Ballmer is leaving, too.

Failing to come to an agreement with Monti is a huge legal setback for  Microsoft, analysts said. Rather than resolving the legal uncertainty dogging the company, which is the world leader in software, the European Union  antitrust case is likely to become a reference point for future  antitrust litigation, the analysts said.

The EU ruling next week will demand more changes to the way  Microsoft does business in Europe than were sought in the  antitrust settlement by the U.S. Justice Department in 2001, according to sources who are familiar with the European decision.

Although officially secret, the main remedy the commission will impose has been widely reported. Microsoft will have to sell two versions of Windows to manufacturers of personal computer in Europe: one with its Media Player bundled into the operating system as at present, and the other a discounted one with Media Player stripped out.

The aim of such a remedy is to remove Media Player's unfair advantage over competing music and video players such as Real Networks' RealOne Player and Apple Computer's QuickTime.

The commission maintains that developers of content such as record companies and Hollywood studios will increasingly tailor their releases for Media Player only, because of the added expense of making them suit all players.

Fines against Microsoft of anywhere from 100 million, or $122 million, to 1 billion are also likely, people close to the case said.

On Thursday, both sides said they had made progress in settling the two specific issues in the case, the alleged abuse of Microsoft's dominance in operating systems to hurt competitors in audio and video software, and the alleged abuse to hurt competitors in computer server software.


Page 174 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the two sides were unable to agree on a new demand Monti added in the final days of negotiations, sources said.

After receiving the unanimous support of national  competition regulators from the 15 member states of the European Union on Monday, Monti is understood to have added a condition to a settlement this week. As a price for averting a legal ruling next week, Monti wanted  Microsoft to sign an undertaking not to abuse the dominant position of Windows by bundling other software programs into it, a person close to the talks said.

That would accelerate any future lawsuits against  Microsoft involving the bundling of other pieces of software, thereby simulating the legal effect of a precedent-setting ruling, without forcing  Microsoft to admit any wrongdoing, the person said.

If Microsoft refused to make a legal commitment not to abuse the dominance of Windows by bundling in other software in the future, then the public and competition would be better served by a decision setting a strong legal precedent which establishes clear principles for a company that is so dominant in the market, Monti said.

But Microsoft was not willing to sign. The company would rather challenge next week's ruling in the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg upon appeal, said Smith, the  Microsoft general counsel.

He would not say whether the company would ask that the remedies to be imposed next week be postponed until after the appeal.
Let's take one day at a time, he said.

The regulator is expected to ask the court not to suspend the remedies during an appeal by  Microsoft. If successful, the changes the commission will demand will become effective in the European Union within months of the ruling.
Dave Stewart, the deputy general counsel of RealNetworks, welcomed the certainty of a ruling against
Microsoft.

We've read the commission's statement and strongly support a decision that will give PC makers, enterprises and consumers a choice of media players, Stewart said in a statement, adding: It's time to restore competition to digital media through an effective remedy that addresses  Microsoft's illegal tying.

Even though they go further than the remedies exacted by the Justice Department, some industry analysts are still doubtful the commission's demands will have much impact on the market for media players.

David Smith, a research fellow with the technology research firm Gartner, said that in order to persuade PC makers to install the version of Windows without Media Player, it would have to be sold at a discount to the fully bundled version.

I don't see how the commission can ensure this without being accused of price setting, David Smith said.

The incentive to stock an unbundled version of Windows would also depend on what rivals such as RealNetworks are prepared to offer to get their software installed instead of  Microsoft's Media Player, he said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on Monti's announcement Thursday. A spokesman said the department is considering whether to make a statement next Wednesday, after the official ruling is taken.
The last big European  competition case was the decision by the commission to prohibit General
Electric's $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International in 2001.

HANNOVER, Germany:

At the annual Cebit technology trade fair here, visitors and exhibitors alike seemed largely skeptical that the European Commission's expected ruling next week in the  Microsoft antitrust case would have much of an impact on consumers or companies.

TD
Microsoft will be punished, but then they will just continue doing the same thing, said Bernhard Hollaus,
23, a computer science student from Schwaz, Austria, who took time off from his studies to stroll through
the cavernous halls of the 355,000-square-meter, or 3.8-million-square-foot, exhibition site.

If Microsoft is ordered to remove its audio-video software, Media Player, from its Windows operating system, he said, I don't think anyone is going to notice the difference.

His classmate, Nikolai Speed, 28, agreed. If they are  fined, so what? It is not as if you are suddenly going to have any more choice in operating systems, he said. And once they pay the  fine, who gets the money? I think that if the monopolist is  fined, then the money should be used to support smaller companies that are trying to compete with them, Speed said.

Shuky Garibi, who was tapping away on his Windows-based laptop at a cafe inside one of the exhibit halls, said, I agree that  Microsoft is a monopoly, of course. Garibi, 45, who works for an Israeli graphic arts company, said that he had once considered installing an alternative operating system for his home computer but then wavered after considering the prospect of abandoning what he called an ingrained habit.

But even if he did opt for a system like Linux, he would not be able to escape Windows. At work, I have no choice because it is the IT department that decides, and they still choose  Microsoft, he said.

The sentiment of technology industry leaders was harder to come by, perhaps because most of them do business with Microsoft in one fashion or another.

The market needs alternatives and wants to have choices, said Guy Dubois, the European executive vice president for PeopleSoft, a leading U.S. business-software company exhibiting at Cebit. Though he wouldn't comment on the case specifically, Dubois did say, It is important to ensure that whatever the industry, we maintain a fair and competitive environment for all actors in the market."

Erkki Liikanen, the European commissioner for enterprise and information society, was alerted to the breakdown in EU negotiations with  Microsoft via his Nokia Communicator, while briefing journalists on technology industry trends in an 18th floor conference room at the trade fair, shortly after noon.

He ended the briefing early to huddle with advisers, explaining that he could make no public comment until the final verdict is announced next week.

On the show floor, Jorg Lentsch, in charge of network administration and security at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, said he believed that the commission should both force  Microsoft to unbundle the Media Player and levy  fines against the giant U.S. software company.

There is not a chance to settle this dispute without a  fine, said Lentsch, who was busy browsing the booths of software companies. Bundling gives them a dominant position and no other company has the chance to do the same.
Lentsch said he used RealPlayer, the media player produced by  Microsoft rival RealNetworks. Dominik Grunnek, a technology manager at a German financial institution and another user of
RealPlayer, said he also thought Microsoft should be fined. A company like RealNetworks has invested
in creating an innovative product and Microsoft's response was 'O.K., we will bundle our player with
Windows and you're dead,'" he said.

Peter Budde-Maydorn, a German technology manager at Kahmann &Ellerbrock, based in Bielefeld, Germany, a maker of protective clothing and other products for industrial uses, had similar views.

I think it is a good thing to force the unbundling because bundling Media Player with Windows makes it difficult for smaller companies to gain market share, he said, while watching a presentation on
open-source software by the Linux Forum.

Budde-Mayhorn said that although  Microsoft's Media Player was bundled with the software on his home computer, he does not use it. He has installed a player made by Asustek of Taiwan, he said.

But Frank Obshuimer, a technology manager for schools in a small town near Hannover, said he thought the commission should stay out of it. There are alternatives to Media Player, he said, and people are using them. Everyone can choose what they want, he said.

Tim De Landtsheer, an account manager in the storage and document imaging division of Acal, an electronics maker in Zaventem, Belgium, said he was torn.

I use Microsoft's Media Player in the office and at home. It is free, I use it and I think it is good, he said. But from a professional view, I think it is normal that they cannot bundle it. It is really an uncompetitive attitude.

Europe's Regulators Ready To Rule Against  Microsoft - Antitrust Talks Break Down - U.S. software giant faces possible order to change ways it bundles products.

Talks to settle the  European Commission's antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. broke down Thursday over regulators' requirements that the software maker change the way it bundles features into future products.

TD
The European Commission and Microsoft had reached much agreement, but "were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future,"  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a statement.

Analysts say the European Union's  antitrust arm might have overplayed its hand by trying to address the issue of bundling features into future Windows operating systems.
"Microsoft firmly believes they cannot let governments dictate what they can and can't put into
Windows," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with independent researcher Directions on  Microsoft.
Politics also might be playing a role in Europe's tough stance against the U.S. tech giant. Politics is "absolutely" playing a role in the EU's case, said David Smith, an analyst with market
research firm Gartner Inc.

"This is very much a matter of not wanting to back down and wanting to declare victory more than anything," Smith said.

The failure of settlement talks clears the way for the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, to issue a decision in the case next week. EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said he would propose a fine and recommend that Microsoft be ordered to change its business practices.
Monti gave no amount for the  fine, but it's likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

The 20-member European Commission is slated to rule on the proposal Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium. The EU says Microsoft uses its monopoly status in personal computer operating systems to dominate the market for media players, or software that plays music and shows video.  Microsoft has integrated its media software into Windows.
The European Commission says this has unfairly hurt competitors such as RealNetworks Inc.'s
RealPlayer and Apple Computer Inc.'s QuickTime.

The commission is expected to demand that  Microsoft offer computer makers in Europe a version of Windows without its media player pre-installed.

The EU's case also has probed the advantages  Microsoft has in making both PC and server operating systems.

The commission is expected to require  Microsoft to provide greater access to its underlying Windows code so that servers made by rivals, such as Sun Microsystems Inc., can work well with computers running Windows.

Microsoft agreed to similar terms in its November 2002 settlement with the U.S. Justice
Department, but observers say Europe might seek more concessions.

Resolving the media player and server issues apparently wasn't the biggest disagreement between the European Commission and Microsoft. It was the product-tying, or bundling, issue.

This is the same issue the Justice Department ultimately decided to back away from because it didn't believe it could win in court.

"We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems which have arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Monti said in a statement. "In the end, I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe. I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."

That precedent would "establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position in the market," he said.

But Microsoft would "fight to the death" for its right to add new functions to its Windows operating system, said analyst Rosoff.

The company's next-generation operating system, code-named Longhorn and due out in 2006, is expected to have an integrated search engine and other new functions.

The European Commission wanted concessions beyond what the case was about, said Nicholas Economides, a professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. Microsoft likely would win the bundling issue in court because it benefits consumers, he said.
The Microsoft case is the most politically charged  competition probe since the EU blocked
General Electric Co.'s planned acquisition of Honeywell International Inc. in 2001.

Europe's handling of the  Microsoft antitrust case is more in keeping with its legal history rather than on any divisions stemming from disagreements over the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Rosoff said. European legal history puts more emphasis on the power of government and less on the power of business, he said.

"It's more of a long-term political-cultural divide than anything that happens to be related to how the geopolitical situation is right now," Rosoff said. "Most of the governments in Europe would be considered socialist by American standards."

Microsoft could appeal the EU ruling to the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance and later to the European Court of Justice, a process that could take years.

Microsoft, the software firm which employs 1,300 staff in Dublin, indicated yesterday that it would appeal a European Commission ruling that it has abused its dominant position in the marketplace to the courts.

The ruling, which will be formally adopted next Wednesday by the Commission, is expected to levy hundreds of millions of euro in  fines on Microsoft and force changes to its business model.

TD
Attempts to negotiate a settlement between the parties ended in failure yesterday as days of talks between Microsoft chief executive Mr Steve Ballmer and  Competition Commissioner Mr Mario Monti ended in deadlock.

Microsoft Ireland, one of the Republic's biggest technology employers, last night sought to reassure customers and staff that the ruling would not have a material impact on its business.

Mr Joe Macri, Microsoft Ireland's managing director, said the firm was clearly disappointed that it had not come to a settlement with the Commission. But he said the expected decision would not affect  Microsoft's development, operations or sales functions at offices in Dublin.

The EU decision will require  Microsoft to supply a second version of its popular Windows operating system stripped of built-in audiovisual software. Brussels will also order the company to share proprietary information with rival server makers and levy a  fine running to hundreds of millions of euros.

Microsoft's legal counsel, Mr Brad Smith, said it was just another step in a long process. "Perhaps the courts will provide the clarity that is necessary to resolve these issues," he said.

The Commission's decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the Commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush its smaller rivals.

This time the Commission wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, putting an end to a pattern of bringing one case after another and getting new settlements each time.
"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible," said Mr
Mario Monti, as he made a surprise appearance at the EU executive's daily news briefing.
Mr Monti met Mr Ballmer three days in a row, once for four hours, to discuss the ruling.

"We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," Mr Ballmer said in a statement.

A major issue in the case had been  Microsoft's efforts to damage rival makers of audio-visual software by allegedly tying its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system.

Microsoft was willing to go further than a Commission plan requiring it to supply a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software. But, in Mr Monti's view, the heart of the case went deeper than today's problems.
Two more Microsoft cases are already under investigation, again focusing on the question of
abuse of monopoly power.
Next Wednesday  Microsoft will be formally held to have abused its dominant market position in the
European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling in the United States.

Microsoft has made clear that it will appeal the decision to the courts, setting in train a process that could take years to decide. In the US, Microsoft has agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle class-action lawsuits, filed in the wake of its antitrust settlement with the US government.

But the firm still faces anti-trust suits initiated by rivals RealNetworks and Sun Microsystems. - (Additional reporting, Reuters)

NEW YORK -- Stocks fell, but well off their lows, after reports that Pakistani troops may have surrounded al Qaeda's No. 2 official. While the news was taken as a positive, there were still decliners, notably Intel and  Microsoft, which tugged at both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The Nasdaq fell 14.32 points, or 0.72%, to 1962.44, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.52, or 0.04%, to 10295.78 and the Standard &Poor's 500 Index shed 1.44, or 0.13%, to 1122.31, with the latter still positive for the year.

"You had reports of a potential capture and that gave us a definite boost," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck &Co. "But you don't want to get too excited because captures, like when Saddam Hussein was caught, have an immediate impact but the market tends to give it back."

Intel fell 59 cents, or 2.1%, to $27.20, part of a generally weak semiconductor group that had helped to lead Wednesday's rally.

Microsoft slipped 24 cents, or almost 1%, to 24.89. Settlement talks related to an antitrust case brought by the  European Commission have broken down, leading to a probable fine and other punishment against the world's largest software company.

United Technologies, a Dow-industrial component, fell 97 cents, or 1.1%, to 87.83. The diverse industrial manufacturer reaffirmed 2004 earnings in the range of $5 to $5.30 a share, with the low end below analysts' expectations of $5.22.

Kmart (Nasdaq) jumped 2.38, or 6.9%, to 37.06. The retailer posted a fourth-quarter profit, its first since emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in May.

Herman Miller (Nasdaq) sank 2.07, or 7.2%, to 26.76. Fiscal third-quarter earnings rose, but the office-products maker projected fourth-quarter earnings lower than Wall Street expectations.

Morgan Stanley fell 55 cents to 59.91. The investment bank announced a 35% rise in first-quarter profit, although analysts noted the company didn't beat expectations by as much as rivals Lehman Brothers Holdings and Bear Stearns, which reported earlier in the week.

Tibco Software (Nasdaq) gained 25 cents, or 3.2%, to 8.02. Fiscal first-quarter earnings came in at five cents a share when analysts were expecting three cents.

Sears Roebuck declined 64 cents, or 1.4%, to 44.48. The retailer will pay more than $625,000 to settle allegations that it ran auto centers that defrauded customers who paid to have four-wheel alignment services done.

Fortune Brands gained 3.73, or 5.2%, to 75.56. The maker of Jim Beam bourbon, Moen faucets and Titleist golf equipment said first-quarter earnings will outpace expectations, fueled by strong product demand, a weak dollar and the benefits of cost-savings initiatives.

Royal Dutch/Shell Group revealed its battered oil and natural-gas reserves position is even worse than it previously admitted and said it will delay release of its annual report. Royal Dutch Petroleum fell 60 cents, or 1.2%, to 47.71, while Shell Transport &Trading dropped 55 cents, or 1.3%, to 40.50.

Cheesecake Factory (Nasdaq) sank 1.97, or 4.2%, to 45.06. President Gerald Deitchle is leaving the restaurant chain to take up a similar post at closely held Johnny Carino's Country Italian chain.

Darden Restaurants declined 74 cents, or 3%, to 24.25. The operator of Red Lobster and Olive Garden eateries reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings but saw continued slippage in
same-store sales and customer traffic at Red Lobster restaurants.

Microchip Technology (Nasdaq) bucked the slide in semiconductors, rising 99 cents, or 3.8%, to 26.90. Shares were upgraded to overweight from equal weight by Morgan Stanley, which cited strong fundamentals and a more compelling valuation.

Medtronic sank 1.21, or 2.5%, to 48.05, and Guidant fell 1.49, or 2.3%, to 63.41 on concerns of a possible slowdown in the implantable cardiac defibrillator market.

HD          Microsoft Faces Tough Penalties In EU's Ruling --- Antitrust Regulators Pose Obstacle to Using
Windows  To Gain an Edge Elsewhere

BRUSSELS -- Microsoft Corp. failed in last-ditch talks to reach an accord on its business practices with European antitrust regulators and now faces rulings that could affect the way it sells software for an array of products, from servers now to mobile phones in the future.

The European Commission next Wednesday is expected to order  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its Media Player multimedia software for sale to European consumers -- and that could lead to such a choice being offered world-wide. The commission also is expected to require Microsoft to release enough new information about Windows to allow rival companies,
including Sun Microsystems Inc. and Novell Inc., to make software that works as well in a
Windows-dominated world as  Microsoft's own software does. It also will likely levy its largest  fine,
widely expected to be at least $200 million to $300 million.

TD
The commission's ruling, intended to set a precedent to govern  Microsoft's future behavior, could ultimately place a huge impediment on the software titan's $32 billion global business. The commission's action will go far beyond a 2001 U.S. settlement with  Microsoft over its Internet Explorer browser, which exacted concessions but let the company continue to integrate the browser with its dominant Windows operating system.

More than five years of investigation and settlement talks ended with three days of fruitless face-to-face meetings between chief European  antitrust regulator Mario Monti and  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, whose black van could be spotted inside the courtyard of Mr. Monti's glass office building here.

The commission intends to find  Microsoft guilty of illegally abusing the near-monopoly position of its Windows operating system to dominate markets for multimedia and networking software. Regulators said they wanted to lay down "clear principles" for its future conduct world-wide.

The sticking point was Mr. Monti's insistence that any settlement go beyond the current case, and apply to Microsoft's efforts to use Windows links to advance its forays into a whole new generation of software and services. That move sets up European regulators as a major roadblock to  Microsoft's ambitions to use Windows to gain an edge in more technologies.  Microsoft's links in its Windows XP system to mobile-phone software and instant computer-to-computer messaging are also under investigation by the commission. The company also is expected to include its own Internet search engine in its next version of Windows.

The commission's prospective ruling was hailed as a landmark by  Microsoft competitors and others frustrated by the company's continued Windows-aided march into new markets.

"Critics have accused U.S. and EU regulators of fighting yesterday's battles over  Microsoft," said Scott Megregian, a London-based partner at law firm McDermott, Will &Emery, which has filed other  antitrust complaints in Brussels but isn't involved in the Microsoft case. Instead, he said, the commission had moved for the first time to rein in "future abuses" by Microsoft.

Mr. Monti, who blocked General Electric Co.'s proposed acquisition of Honeywell Inc. in 2001 after the U.S. had approved it, told a news conference yesterday that a settlement in the  Microsoft case "has not been possible" despite the intense high-level meetings. "We made substantial progress toward
Page 185 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
resolving the problems which have arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Mr. Monti said.

The most immediate effect of the failure to settle the differences will probably be an appeal by Microsoft to the EU's highest courts. "Today is just another step in what could be a long process," said Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel. "We'll all benefit from the clarity that courts can bring to these questions."

If Microsoft wins a temporary injunction against the commission's order, it could avoid having to implement Mr. Monti's tough conditions until a final court ruling. That could take three to five years. If it fails to get the injunction,  Microsoft might choose to seek a so-called fast-track court procedure that could reach final judgment within a year or so -- but that would also restrict its grounds for appeal.

Lawyers and financial analysts say neither a  fine nor the "behavioral" changes the commission seeks are likely to slow the company down significantly in its current markets. Goldman Sachs, in a note sent to investors early yesterday, said a requirement to separate the media player and pay a  fine of even around $600 million should only cause "a short-term disappointment" in the company's stock price and wouldn't pose a "serious change" to  Microsoft's business model.  Microsoft stock dropped 24 cents or just under 1% to $24.89, against a much bigger drop in the broader market average.

But the impact of the EU's move on Microsoft's future plans is potentially broader, if it isn't struck down in the courts. Complainants alleging that Microsoft is unfairly leveraging Windows to sell other products in Europe could merely cite the commission's findings that Windows is a monopoly and that  Microsoft abused its market power, without having to prove the point again -- forcing  Microsoft to work in an environment of rivals more easily bringing and winning cases against it. Mr. Monti made clear yesterday that was the commission's intent, saying a ruling "will establish clear principles for the future conduct of
a company with such a strong dominant position in the market."

For now, the commission's ruling sets out two major orders, details of which would have to be resolved within about 60 days of a ruling unless the court grants a stay.

On the Media Player issue, it orders  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without the player, without making it a less-attractive choice -- language that has been interpreted as meaning  Microsoft would have to make it less expensive. Then, computer makers would have to choose which operating system to place on their products.

"In the future, programs will have to be sold on their own merits," said Dave Stewart, deputy general counsel for Microsoft rival RealNetworks, which makes Real Player software. "PC manufacturers will have a real choice to take the player that's the technically better one."

Microsoft and the computer makers also would each have to decide whether to offer different options in Europe than in the rest of the world, or to make the same products available world-wide. The commission decision is enforceable only in Europe, but  Microsoft in the past has said it prefers to sell the same licenses under similar terms world-wide.

In the server aspect of the case, Mr. Monti intends to demand that  Microsoft release more information about Windows and to work out the details with its rivals and bring back a proposal for the commission to approve.

Michael Reynolds, a lawyer at Allen &Overy who represents Sun, said a commission decision represents a "different animal" than the 2001 U.S. settlement, in that the commission's case covered different legal ground and offers the prospect of "a formal, binding decision."

The EU's demands are particularly important for Sun, which filed the original  antitrust complaint against Microsoft in December 1998. The Silicon Valley maker of computer servers has been battling what it views as one of Microsoft's biggest unfair advantages -- that information passes between desktop Windows systems and Microsoft's server operating system in forms that rival products can't decode. As a result, Sun servers can't match some features that are possible when a company has Microsoft products on both desktops and servers, such as easily setting up a single password for users to log on to multiple systems.

Microsoft has maintained that it should have the right to bundle almost any new product or service with Windows in order to provide increased functionality for its users. In the U.S. and elsewhere, it has successfully fought off demands that it strip features out of Windows in order to make life easier for its competitors.

But the  European Commission has become one of the world's toughest  antitrust cops. And earlier this year its powers were expanded, effective May 1, through new EU laws regulating mergers and monopolies and affecting a wide range of business activities.

The failure of settlement talks is a big blow for Microsoft, which could have avoided any finding of guilt and payment of  fines by striking a deal with Mr. Monti. Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement with EU regulators, with Mr. Ballmer spending the week in Brussels overseeing the company's negotiating tactics. He met Mr. Monti for a third time Thursday morning just a few hours before Mr. Monti made his announcement. Mr. Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, estimated he spent 20 days in Brussels over
the past two months in nearly round-the-clock meetings with EU regulators.
Despite the failure to reach a settlement, Mr. Monti praised the "constructive and cooperative spirit" and
"high degree of professionalism" of the  Microsoft negotiating team.

Now, Mr. Monti said he would ask his 19 fellow European commissioners next Wednesday to confirm his finding that  Microsoft should be ordered to change its business practices and to slap the company with a fine for its alleged misconduct. Legally, the commission can  fine a company up to 10% of its
most recent world-wide sales, or about $34 billion, which works out to about $3 billion. In practice,  fines
are always much lower.

(EDS: UPDATING WITH DETAILS)

The European Commission (EC) and Microsoft Corp. failed Thursday to reach a settlement to a landmark antitrust case over the way the U.S. software giant sells its Windows operating system, a high-ranking EC official said.

TD
"A settlement has not been possible on the  Microsoft case,"Mario Monti, the EC commissioner for concurrence, told an impromptu news conference. "I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues next Wednesday to adopt a decision, which has already received the unanimous backing of member
states."

The announcement came after three days of talks with  Microsoft. Monti hailed the constructive and cooperative spirit displayed by  Microsoft but said, "I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe."

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said, "We are unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future."

The development paves the way for the EC, the executive body of the European Union (EU), to impose a fine on Microsoft next Wednesday following a landmark  antitrust ruling backed by EU antitrust regulators Monday.

The ruling takes issue with the way  Microsoft sells Windows Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating systems.

The draft ruling requires  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to computer makers for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would include Windows Media Player as in the current system and the other would have it removed.

The commission could set the  fine anywhere from $100 million to $1 billion, according to media reports. Europe accounts for about 30% of  Microsoft's sales.

HD     Settlement  talks fail, ruling  due next week

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union announced its intention Thursday to sanction  Microsoft Corp. after the software giant balked at demands that could have prevented it from adding new features to future versions of Windows -- a restriction it avoided in the landmark U.S.  antitrust case.

Frenzied settlement talks that accelerated this week with the arrival of  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer in Brussels collapsed over the EU's insistence on a broad deal in exchange for allowing Microsoft to avoid being found guilty of monopolistic behavior.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said he would now proceed with a precedent-setting ruling against the world's largest software company on Wednesday. The EU also plans to hit  Microsoft with a fine expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars.

"We made substantial progress toward resolving the problems that had arisen in the past, but we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," Monti said. "It was impossible to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of setting a precedent."

Hours later, Ballmer said he believed the issues in the current case -- involving digital media players and the server software market -- had been resolved.

"But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," he said in a statement.

Microsoft lawyers said the company would appeal any negative decision to European courts.
An EU order could force  Microsoft to make costly changes in its software -- potentially on a global scale
-- in a matter of months unless it wins a suspension from the court pending appeal, which can take years.
In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  Microsoft shares were down 44 cents, 1.75 percent, at
$24.69.

Monti will present the proposed fine Monday to an advisory committee of national regulators before going to the full European Commission, the EU's executive branch, on Wednesday for a final decision.

After winning unanimous backing from the 15 EU governments last week, the ruling is expected to pass easily.

Microsoft is accused of unfairly grabbing market share from rival companies by bundling its own Media
Player with Windows -- the operating system in nearly every personal computer worldwide.

Microsoft contends that benefits consumers, but rivals claim it is unfair  competition that stifles innovation and aims to drive them out of business.

The charge was similar to the 1990s Internet browser war in the United States, where  Microsoft was found guilty of using illegal means to protect its Windows monopoly. But a 2001 settlement with the Bush administration allowed it to continue integrating its Internet Explorer with Windows.

Sources familiar with the case say the EU's draft ruling finds  Microsoft guilty of monopolistic behavior -- setting a precedent in Europe -- and goes beyond the U.S. remedies.

The EU is demanding that  Microsoft offer computer makers in Europe a discounted version of Windows without Media Player so that rivals like RealNetworks Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. have a better shot at reaching consumers.

In addition, the draft is expected to require the company to release more underlying Windows code so rival server software companies including Sun Microsystems Inc. can interoperate better with computers running Windows.

In exchange for a settlement, Monti was seeking commitments that could have affected  Microsoft's business not just in Europe but globally -- and helped to resolve other EU  antitrust cases pending against the company, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

The EU last year began investigating new charges from Microsoft competitors that its latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

In this week's settlement talks, the EU was anticipating that the next edition of Windows, which isn't expected until at least 2006, will include search engine capabilities and other features that could compete with rival products.

Sources said Microsoft had made a last-minute offer to include rival media programs with Windows, along with its own, in hopes of avoiding an "unbundling" order that could interfere with its business strategy.

Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief lawyer in Europe, refused to comment on what  Microsoft had offered. But he said the company resisted the commission's attempt to define "a simple rule" that would apply to "every conceivable instance of product integration or innovation in the future."

"In assessing product improvement issues, there needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers, developers and competitors," he said in an interview.

Both sides took pains, however, to praise the other's "cooperative spirit" and "professionalism," in contrast to the rancor that often characterized the last high-profile, trans-Atlantic  antitrust case: the EU's blocking of GE's merger with Honeywell in 2001.
Ballmer said he still hoped for a settlement "at a later stage."

Microsoft critics praised the commission for its firmness and dismissed  Microsoft's arguments against future commitments as disingenuous.

"That's a little like a bank robber saying, `I agreed to give the money back but they're telling me I can't rob any more banks,'" said Ed Black, head of the Washington-based Computer and Communication Industry Association.

"One of the most fundamental anti-competitive tactics that  Microsoft uses is the bundling of really separate products into their monopoly product," he said by telephone. "This (ruling) raises serious questions about whether that is a tactic they can continue to use without it being seen as presumptively illegal."

HD           THE DAY ON WALL STREET: Dow finishes in the red after a day of volatility

The stock market rallied on news that Pakistani troops may have cornered al-Qaida's No. 2 leader, but the late buying wasn't enough to prevent the major indexes from closing in the red.

Microsoft's antitrust problems in Europe and a mixed bag of economic reports did nothing to help the market, which reversed two strong sessions that added almost 200 points to the Dow Jones industrial average.

TD
The market was volatile all day as the Dow moved in and out of positive territory. Investors were responding on the upside to reports that Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahri, had been trapped in a remote region near the Afghan border with Pakistan.
But this enthusiasm could not quite overcome the drag from reports earlier in the day that  antitrust
talks between  Microsoft and the European Commission had failed.
This is expected to result in a  fine and other punishment against the world's largest software company.
Microsoft shares fell 24 cents, or almost 1 percent, to $24.89.

Economic reports that might have boosted the market on any other day hardly made a dent in investor sentiment.

The government's report that first-time claims for unemployment benefits declined last week to the lowest level in more than three years surprised strategists who were looking for a slight increase. This suggested that layoffs had possibly slowed enough for business firms to start hiring again.

The private Conference Board said its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which anticipates future trends, was unchanged last month --- not exactly a plus but not necessarily negative.
The most disturbing economic report was the government's producer, or wholesale, price index for
January --- a month late because of recent changes to the system used for tracking price changes.

The PPI jumped 0.6 percent, vs. 0.2 percent in December. Economists were looking for a rise of 0.4 percent. The core rate --- minus food and energy costs --- rose 0.3 percent, vs. December's 0.1 percent decline.

Even more disturbing for the inflation outlook was the $37.93-per-barrel price of crude oil. That was 25 cents lower than its 14-year price peak on Wednesday but a cause for investor anxiety.
In Thursday's trading, chip maker Intel fell 2.1 percent in a broad setback for the semiconductor group. United Technologies shares fell 1.1 percent after the diversified manufacturer said the low end of its
2004 profit forecast was below analysts' expectations.

Page 191 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But retailer Kmart shares jumped 6.9 percent after reporting its first profit since emerging from bankruptcy in May 2003, in the fourth quarter.
The Dow, which fell as much as 86 points around noon, closed Thursday at 10,295.78 with a loss of
4.52 points, or 0.04 percent.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.43 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,122.32, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 14.32 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,962.44.
The S&P 500 is the only major index that is up for the year, by just shy of 1 percent. The Dow is down
1.5 percent year-to-date and the Nasdaq composite just over 2 percent.

HD         Europe to impose Microsoft sanctions Last-ditch effort to settle case fails

After last-ditch negotiations failed, the European Union announced Thursday it plans to go forward with major sanctions against  Microsoft Corp. for abusing its monopoly power in the computer software business.

The EU is expected to force  Microsoft to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in  fines and drastically change the way it sells its products in Europe. A final ruling detailing the penalties is set for next week.

TD
But more broadly, the European action may finally force the world's biggest software company to seriously start considering how it bundles different applications into future versions of its Windows operating system.

''What  Microsoft has that no other software vendor has is the ability to integrate a huge range of technology together and make it universal,'' said Rob Helm, research director at Directions on Microsoft, an independent research company in Kirkland, Wash.
''But they may have to start thinking about offering PC manufacturers a more modular form of Windows
--- perhaps a stripped-down Windows'' that lacks programs such as Internet browsers or media players,
Helm said.

Certainly,  Microsoft doesn't want to take such drastic measures unless it's forced. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant indicated it would file a lawsuit aimed at thwarting the EU action.

''Today is just another step in what could be a long process,''  Microsoft Senior Vice President and General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement. ''Perhaps the courts will provide the clarity that is necessary to resolve these issues.''

The European complaint centers on the Windows Media Player software, used to watch movies and listen to music on PCs. Competitors and regulators say they fear  Microsoft could use the software to extend its monopoly into a wide variety of new applications and devices, from entertainment center computers to hand-held media players.
''In the end, I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe,'' EU
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement. ''I believe they will be better served with a
decision that creates a strong precedent ... which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of
a company with such a strong, dominant position in the market.''

For starters, the EU wants  Microsoft to offer PC makers separate versions of its Windows software, one with the media player and one without it.  Microsoft apparently was willing to do that.



Page 193 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But it apparently wouldn't agree to make its Windows code more accessible to other potential future software --- everything from built-in search engines to programs that  Microsoft hasn't even dreamed up yet.

''I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case,''  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a statement. ''But we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future.''

As recently as a few days ago, it looked like  Microsoft and the EU were coming to terms, in part because of last-minute negotiating by Ballmer himself.
Early Thursday morning, however,  Microsoft and the EU announced talks had broken off.

Details of  Microsoft's settlement offer weren't disclosed. But  Microsoft attorney Smith contended that they would have gone a long way toward resolving the concerns of regulators not just in Europe but elsewhere.

The European Commission's pursuit of more far-reaching changes to the Windows operating system, Smith suggested, could have harmed consumers more than helped them.

''We have to ensure that the law is not just about competitors' complaints about the impact of new features,'' he said. ''There needs to be consideration of the needs of consumers for new innovations. Consumers must be part of the equation.'' Photo EU official Mario Monti wants to establish "clear principles" for  competition. Graphic HEADACHES WORLDWIDE
In addition to its European Union troubles,  Microsoft faces a series of new and persisting challenges: State antitrust case: Microsoft apologized to jurors in Minnesota for past anticompetitive behavior.
The suit says Microsoft overcharged about 1 million people or businesses there.

National antitrust case: Microsoft still awaits a U.S. appeals court ruling to decide whether sanctions in the federal settlement were adequate.

Private suits:  Microsoft's rival in Seattle, RealNetworks Inc., also has sued, alleging it illegally monopolized the field of digital media by including its Windows Media Player with its Windows operating system.

Japanese probe: In February, officials from Japan's fair trade watchdog raided  Microsoft offices on suspicion of monopoly law violations. The officials said  Microsoft Japan is suspected of attaching improper restrictive conditions in deals with computer makers.
Linux: Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. said this week that it would sell desktop PCs based on
the rival, open-source Linux operating system in Asia, where many countries are especially eager for a
Windows alternative.

The European Commission and Microsoft failed to settle  antitrust charges yesterday, removing the last obstacle to a landmark ruling next week branding the company an abusive monopolist.
It now faces a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros, albeit probably not the biggest ever levied by
Brussels.

TD
Microsoft plans to appeal to the courts in what is expected to be a long process, a company official said.
'We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future,' chief executive
Steve Ballmer said.

Company legal counsel Horatio Jutierrez said: 'Both parties fully accept the need for the court to provide clarity.'

Mr Jutierrez said the Commisson and the company were able to agree on solutions to the issues in the present case but not on future conduct.
He said: 'Where we failed to agree was on a single formulation for issues in the future.'

A settlement at some point in the future has not been ruled out. Mr Ballmer said: 'I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage.'

The EU decision, to be adopted next Wednesday, will require  Microsoft to supply a second version of its Windows operating system stripped of built-in audiovisual software.
Brussels will also order the company to share proprietary information with rival server makers.
Most importantly,  Microsoft will be formally ruled to have abused its dominant market position in the
European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling in the United States.

That decision could open the way for further legal action against  Microsoft in all European Union countries if the company is seen to be competing unfairly.
The Commission is probing two other cases against  Microsoft.

Mr Ballmer negotiated with Mr Monti for four hours on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday and yesterday, to avoid the formal decision.

Sources close to the case said he made a last-ditch offer on Wednesday to compel computer makers to carry rival audiovisual software alongside  Microsoft's Windows Media Player.

Mr Monti praised Microsoft's efforts, but said they fell short because the company was unwilling to make commitments to change its future business practices.

A centerpiece of the Commission inquiry has been to go beyond the specifics of the case and focus more broadly on Microsoft's use of its market dominance to crush smaller rivals. 'The aspect of setting
Page 195 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
a clear and strong legal precedent is indeed of key importance,' Mr Monti said. 'It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either there or on the horizon.'

Microsoft reached settlements with the Commission in 1994 and 1997. It has headed off other EU
investigations by agreeing to change its behaviour towards particular companies.
But in Mr Monti's view, none of those settlements prevented the recurrence of similar  competition
problems.

'I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues to adopt a decision that has already received the unanimous backing of the member states,' Mr Monti said.
An antitrust lawyer representing some of  Microsoft's rivals praised the decision.

'This is a great victory for European consumers and for the information and communciations technology industries,' said Thomas Vinje of London law firm Clifford Chance.

Litigation in the European courts could now take several years and  Microsoft is very likely to seek a suspension of the remedies against it during that time.

Another  antitrust expert and former Commission official said a last-minute deal would have been a major error.

'If the Commission were to end the case without a formal decision, it would fly in the face of everything they've said so far about the strength of their case,' said David Wood of Howrey Simon.

The Commission draft proposal calls on  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows to computer makers.
One with the Windows Media Player embedded and one without it.

Microsoft contends it cannot do so without breaking Windows. But a rival audiovisual software maker, RealNetworks, gave a demonstration to the Commission at a hearing to argue that Windows Media Player could be removed without harm.

Microsoft Corp. failed to reach a settlement with European regulators yesterday, and now anticipates an antitrust ruling that could force it to unbundle features from its Windows operating system potentially changing how the company designs and markets software for personal computers in the future.

While the ruling from the  European Commission on Wednesday would apply only to the European market and have no immediate impact on American consumers, it could have far-reaching implications for Microsoft's worldwide business, analysts said.

TD
For one, the company would have to calculate whether to integrate new applications, such as a search engine, into its next version of Windows, called Longhorn, that could be released as early as next year. Doing so would mean having to prepare a separate version for Europe, and risking fresh challenges to the bundled product from other  Microsoft-wary countries taking their cue from the Europeans.

"It would impact  Microsoft's strategy," said Laura DiDio, senior analyst for the Yankee Group research firm in Boston. "It's going to make them much more careful and much more proactive in heading off trouble before it happens. And that could give customers in Europe and America some more leverage in dealing with  Microsoft."

Microsoft's top executives tried unsuccessfully to head off the European ruling. After more than a year of negotiations, in which differences were narrowed,  Microsoft chief executive Steven A. Ballmer and chief counsel Bradford L. Smith flew to Brussels and met for four hours Tuesday with Mario Monti, competition commissioner for the European Union. But the two sides failed to come to agreement, and both released statements yesterday saying they had broken off talks.
"Obviously, we're preparing for a negative decision," said Jim Desler, a  Microsoft spokesman in
Brussels.

The ruling by the  European Commission would likely require Microsoft to offer two separate versions of Windows in Europe one with and one without music and video software.  Microsoft could also be fined $122 million for monopoly abuses and be compelled to license more of its Windows code to enable competitors to develop better software for the operating system.  Microsoft is expected to
appeal the commission ruling to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. "It's probably best to have a court give us some guidance," Desler said.

Desler said the sticking point in this week's talks was the European insistence that  Microsoft refrain from integrating "new technology and new innovations" with Windows, which the firm says is in the best interest of consumers. "We were hopeful we could resolve this issue," he said. "The effort we took to try to settle this case amicably underscores our commitment to the European market."

In his statement yesterday, Monti said the two sides differed on "commitments for future conduct." Monti said European consumers were "better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."

The geopolitical climate may be coloring the dispute, suggested the Yankee Group's DiDio. "I don't think you can discount that  Microsoft has been tarred with some of the anti-American sentiment coming out of Europe now with the war in Iraq," she said.

John E. Kwoka, economics professor at Northeastern University, noted that the bundling issue specifically, the bundling of the Internet Explorer browser with Windows was at the heart of the US antitrust suit against  Microsoft. But while US courts ruled against the company, the penalties didn't require it to unbundle programs.

"If the Europeans come down against  Microsoft, they're going to face some tough choices," Kwoka said. "One would be to offer different products in Europe and here. The other would be to offer their unbundled product everywhere. They've always resisted doing that."

One key issue, Kwoka said, would be the price of an unbundled operating system. "If you offer it separately at a price that's so high that no one wants to buy it, then commercially it's a dead duck," Kwoka said. "And then  Microsoft can say, `I told you so.' "

Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software maker, failed to reach an  antitrust settlement with the European Union, raising the chances regulators will put limits on the Windows program that runs 95 per cent of personal computers.

Talks broke down over whether an accord will apply to future conduct, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said. The EU accuses the company of abusing its hold in PC operating systems to dominate in computer-networking software and audio and video players.

TD
The ruling, due March 24, will set a precedent for other investigations against the Redmond, Washington-based company,  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said. The EU, which also is probing complaints on programs for handheld computers and some mobile phones, wants  Microsoft to disclose secret programming information to rivals and offer PC makers the option of dispensing with the Windows Media Player.

"The ongoing stream of legal news is like walking through a thorn bush -- it's like death by a thousand cuts," said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. "It begins to wear on people's attitude about the company."
Legal concerns are one reason Loomis Sayles, which manages more than $54 billion, has sold
"several million"  Microsoft shares this year and kept just 250,000, he said.

Microsoft shares fell 24 cents to $24.89 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. They surged 53 per cent in 2001 on a U.S.  antitrust settlement. The stock has suffered since then, falling 22 per cent in 2002 and lagging rivals in 2003 amid concern about  Microsoft's slowing growth rate and worries the free Linux software will hurt sales of Windows.

Shipments of Linux for servers that run networks will grow more than twice as fast as Windows in the year ending June 30, according to  Microsoft's forecasts. Hewlett-Packard Co. will begin selling PCs running Linux in 12 Asian countries, software maker Turbolinux said this week.

"That might actually be more important," said Henry Asher, president of Northstar Group, which manages $140 million in New York including  Microsoft shares. "Are the computer manufacturers able to assist the movement of Linux to the desktop?"

Microsoft said it expects to appeal any EU decision and raised the possibility of a future settlement. "I
hope that perhaps we can still settle this case at a later stage," Ballmer said in a videotaped statement.

"Microsoft and the European Commission reached agreement on the case, but we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," he said.

The State Department wouldn't say whether it would raise objections to the decision, saying it was premature to speculate on what specific actions the EU will take.
Page 199 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The U.S. and the EU "have an interest in adopting similar enforcement approaches" under a 1991 cooperation agreement, and the department will "address issues" with the EU as they arise, State Department spokesman Kurtis Cooper said.

The collapse of talks with the European Commission, the EU's regulatory arm, may also lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Representatives from the bloc's 15 member states will meet Monday to discuss the level of the penalty.

"The EU's teeth are sharpening," said James Macmillan, head of European equities at Merrill Lynch & Co. in London. "It's important for Europe to have a credible approach to these issues, whether they're about market dominance or mergers and acquisitions."

The EU has said a 2001 settlement in the U.S. didn't go far enough to restrain anticompetitive practices. In the U.S., the company agreed to give computer makers the option to promote rival software such as RealNetworks Inc.'s RealPlayer and hide user access to Media Player or other Microsoft applications.

The U.S. settlement requires disclosure of some information to enable competing server software to operate on Windows.

The EU seeks further disclosures to enable competitors such as Sun Microsystems Inc. to work as well with Windows as  Microsoft's own products, according to an August statement of objections.

The commission wants to restrain  Microsoft from using its prominent position on most people's desktops to block competitors such as RealNetworks from succeeding in the market for software that plays music or displays videos.

"Competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent," Monti told reporters in Brussels. "It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company, in cases which are either already there or on the horizon."
History of legal wrangles
EU and U.S. regulators have been involved in legal battles for more than a decade, charging  Microsoft
with blocking competition.
1994

July 15: European Commission and U.S. Justice Department reach a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges the company used licensing to block  competition.
1997

November 24: European Commission reaches a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges the company used licensing policies to block competition, this time against the Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix software maker.

December 11: U.S. Justice Department says Microsoft broke the 1994 agreement and is blocking competition. U.S. judge later orders Microsoft to unbundle Internet Explorer browser from its ubiquitous Windows operating system.
1998

May: U.S. Court of Appeals rules in favour of  Microsoft, exempting Windows 98 from the U.S. judge's order.
2000
April 3: U.S. judge rules  Microsoft used its monopoly power to block  competition, later orders
Microsoft be broken up.

August 3: European Commission says in first Statement of Objections that  Microsoft used its policies to block competition, refusing to supply essential information to Sun Microsystems.
2001

June 28: U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejects Microsoft break-up and faults judge for failing to hold hearings on the matter. But it rules that Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to block competition.

BERLIN -- Three days of intense talks between  Microsoft Corp. and the European Union failed to settle a broad  antitrust case against the U.S. software company, the two sides say. The breakdown clears the way for the EU to make a formal finding of monopolistic  abuse against Microsoft on Wednesday next week.

"We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past," EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement issued after talks with  Microsoft chief executive Steven Ballmer at the 15-nation group's headquarters in Brussels. "But we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct."

TD
Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith offered a similar assessment in an interview, saying the two sides had tentatively come to terms on all issues of the  antitrust case before the  European            Commission, the EU's executive arm, but could not settle on a "single formula" for dealing with future complaints against the company.

Antitrust regulators in all 15 EU countries have endorsed a call by Monti that the commission should find Microsoft in violation of EU  competition rules. The regulators are due to meet Monday in Brussels to discuss the issue of  fines. A formal decision by the full commission is scheduled for two days later, and people on all sides predict it will go against  Microsoft.

People familiar with the case expect the commission to impose  fines of between $125 million (U.S.) and $250 million, to require  Microsoft to offer a version of its Windows software without a subprogram known as a media player and to help competitors make big-computer software that is compatible with  Microsoft's. The company also would be subject to close monitoring in the future.

Microsoft can appeal, and Smith said yesterday that it would.

As in the United States,  Microsoft products are present in almost every European office and in many homes as well. The company has created versions of its programs in French, German and other European languages and has been eager to remain on the good side of authorities here.

Microsoft failed on Thursday to reach a deal with the  European Commission, setting the stage for a landmark antitrust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist. It will be fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software. Its shares were down 1.8 percent at
$24.68 in midday U.S. trade. The decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the Commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush smaller rivals. This time the Commission wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, putting an end to a pattern of bringing one case after another and getting new settlements each time.

TD
"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible,"  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said as he made a surprise appearance at the EU executive's daily news briefing. Monti met  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer three days in a row, once for four hours. "We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," Ballmer said in a statement. A major issue in the case had been  Microsoft's efforts to damage rival makers of audio-visual software by allegedly tying its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system.  Microsoft itself was willing to go further than a Commission plan requiring it to supply a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiosivual software.  Microsoft was also willing to sell information to rival makers of server software so their products, which run on Linux and Unix operating systems, could work more easily with Windows. NEED TO SET PRECEDENT-MONTI But in Monti's view, the heart of the case went
deeper than today's problems. Two more  Microsoft cases are already under investigation, again focusing on the question of  abuse of monopoly power. Next Wednesday  Microsoft will be formally held to have abused its dominant market position in the European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling
in the United States. "The aspect of setting a clear and strong legal precedent is indeed of key importance," Monti said. "It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either there or on the horizon." That may open the way for further legal action against  Microsoft in all European Union countries - 25 of them after May 1 - if the company is seen to be competing unfairly. "We're talking about an issue of enforcing respect for the rules," said Michael Reynolds, a lawyer with Allen and Overy who filed the first complaint in the case for Sun Microsystems in 1998.  Microsoft said it has given up hopes of a settlement for now and expects a
drawn-out fight on appeal. It announced plans to take the Commission to court after the formal decison next week. "Today is just another step in what could be a long process,"  Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said in a statement. "I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage," Ballmer said. Microsoft settled with the U.S. Justice Department, but only long after a final court decision found that it had abused monopoly power. The Commission draft proposal calls on  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows to computer makers, one with Windows Media Player embedded and one without it.  Microsoft contends it cannot do so without crippling Windows to the point where it doesn't work properly. But a rival audio-visual software maker, RealNetworks, gave a demonstration to the Commission at a hearing to argue that Windows Media Player could be removed without harm. The exact size of the  fine will be approved by a meeting of member states on Monday.

HD       EU Competition Commissioner Moves Towards Anti-Trust Ruling on Microsoft

The European Union (EU)'s  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti yesterday rejected a final attempt
by Microsoft to strike a deal over the company's anti-trust case, raising the risk of actions against the US
software giant for practicing unfair  competition, the Financial Times reports. Monti turned down a
far-reaching offer from  Microsoft chief executive officer (CEO) Steve Ballmer, saying that it would have
failed to constrain the company in other cases. Ballmer had offered to include rivals' programmes on
computers shipped around the world. The commissioner will seek to establish a precedent in EU law by
ruling that the company has illegally used its Windows monopoly to push competitors out of other
markets. European Commission officials are also looking into a complaint against the company's
Windows XP operating system and  Microsoft's licensing policy.

TD
Significance: There now seem to be few obstacles to the European Commission moving ahead with anti-trust actions against  Microsoft. The Commission is set to impose a fine on the company next week and order it to change its practices - in particular by sharing information with rivals in the market for computer servers and offering computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Media Player programme. Microsoft is likely to appeal to EU courts - a process that could take years - and will probably ask for a suspension of the demands pending appeal.

Antitrust talks between the European Union and Microsoft Corp. collapsed Thursday, making it likely the world's largest software company will be fined and ordered to make broader changes in its business practices than it agreed to under a settlement with the U.S. government.

The EU's executive body is scheduled to rule on the case next week, placing a new set of restrictions on the global technology giant whose software runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers. Microsoft said it plans to challenge the decision in international court.

TD
The EU's decision came after last-minute talks between the two sides broke down over what limits might be placed on  Microsoft as it develops new products.

"We made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement issued after discussions ended with Microsoft chief executive Steven A. Ballmer at the 15-country group's headquarters in Brussels. "But we were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct."

Microsoft General Counsel Bradford L. Smith gave a similar assessment, saying the deal breaker was not how to settle the specific issues of past conduct, but how to craft a "single formula" for dealing with future complaints.

Under the proposed settlement, the company would have avoided the public relations stigma, legal burdens and fines associated with being formally labeled an abusive monopolist in Europe. In return, the EU wanted the company to accept certain limits on how many features it can legally add to its near-universal Windows software in the future, according to people familiar with the case.

Microsoft, which in antitrust cases on both sides of the Atlantic has fiercely defended its right to innovate, decided the Europeans were asking for too much. In the United States, the company settled antitrust charges in part by agreeing to mask but not remove offending features and to not interfere with the ability of computer makers to add competing software to their machines.

European antitrust officials have shown a willingness to craft their own remedies to  competition problems apart from decisions in the United States, occasionally straining relations between the two. The Europeans, for instance, blocked high-profile mergers such as General Electric Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell International Inc., WorldCom Inc.'s proposal to buy Sprint Corp. and Time Warner's attempt to buy music giant EMI Group PLC.

The Department of Justice's  antitrust division said in a statement Thursday night that it continues to believe the settlement it reached with  Microsoft "provides the appropriate framework for marketplace competition in this important sector."



Page 207 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The U.S. Government and the  European Commission enjoy a strong working relationship on matters relating to  competition policy and have a shared interest in avoiding divergent enforcement approaches," the statement said.
At the center of the European case are concerns about how  Microsoft uses the dominance of its
Windows software to conquer new markets. In investigations since 1999, European  antitrust
regulators have concluded that  Microsoft unfairly hurts companies that make media players -- software
that plays video and sound -- by including a player in Windows. Because Windows users automatically
get a player, they're unlikely to buy the competitors' versions, the regulators have reasoned.

The regulators have also found that  Microsoft does not disclose enough technical data about its widely used software for computer servers, which serve as hubs in big corporate networks, making it difficult
for rival programs to flourish.

Antitrust regulators in all 15 EU countries are scheduled to meet on Monday in Brussels to discuss the case. A formal decision by the full commission is set for two days later.

People familiar with the case expect the commission to impose  fines of between $125 million and $250 million, and to require  Microsoft to offer a version of its Windows software without a media player. Microsoft is also likely to be required to release data that would help competitors make programs that are compatible with servers powered by  Microsoft software. The company would also be subject to close monitoring in the future.

As in the United States,  Microsoft products are used in almost every office of Western Europe and in many homes as well. The company has created versions of its programs in French, German and other European languages and has been anxious to remain on the good side of authorities here.

Laura DiDio, an industry analyst with the Yankee Group, a research organization, said that despite Ballmer's trip to Brussels, there was no realistic chance of a settlement, in view of the commission's demands. The proposed controls on its future operations were "nebulous" and "very, very broad and potentially hampering future sales and marketing efforts," she said.

"The prevailing sentiment out there is that they're guilty until proven innocent," she said, noting that Microsoft's past actions are partly responsible for that. She said that anti-American feelings have played some role in European sentiments against the company. European officials deny any such motivation.

Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based lawyer representing the Washington-based Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group and  Microsoft critic, expressed satisfaction that there would be a formal finding of wrongdoing. "It seems to us that Mario Monti has got it exactly right," he said. "He understands that this behavior, this case represents only the tip of the iceberg in Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior. What is really needed is a decision that acts as a precedent and lays down rules of the road for  Microsoft's behavior."

Microsoft has been adding features to Windows ever since its introduction in 1983 and contends that this serves consumers and makes the life of software developers easier by providing common technical standards. This practice has been the focus of years of  antitrust litigation in the United States as well
-- resulting in a settlement with the Justice Department and several states.

The European Commission is already entertaining a new complaint about the inclusion of instant messaging, e-mail and movie-making software in Windows, and it is eager to avoid retrying the issue all over again for that and other likely future complaints. The commission wants an agreement on handling upcoming disputes of this type.

But Microsoft was unwilling to agree to the commission's terms,  Microsoft's Smith said. "In the U.S., the courts have agreed that consumer benefits and developer impact all need to be considered," Smith said. "You would hope that that would emerge as a principle in Europe as well."

According to Vinje,  Microsoft offered to settle the media player complaint through a "must-carry" approach by which the company would instruct computer makers that machines they sold must contain at least three versions of a media player.

Smith declined to discuss specifics of what  Microsoft had offered, but in a statement he said, "I believe our settlement offer would have resolved the issues of the case, not just in Europe but around the
world, and right now."

Monti said in his statement that in the end he decided that "it is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position in the market." This would be "best for  competition and consumers in Europe."

MICROSOFT FAILED to reach an accord with European Commission antitrust regulators. The software titan now faces the prospect of a heavy fine and conditions that could affect the way its sells products for an array of technologies, from servers to mobile phones. The EU ruling is a potentially huge impediment to  Microsoft's global business.

BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) failed on Thursday to reach a deal with the European Commission, setting the stage for a landmark  antitrust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist.

It will be  fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.  Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $24.89 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday.

TD
The decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush smaller rivals.

This time the commission wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, putting an end to a pattern of bringing one case after another and getting new settlements each time.

"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said as he made a surprise appearance at the EU executive's daily news briefing.
Monti met Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer three days in a row, once for four hours.

"We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," Ballmer said in a statement.

A major issue in the case had been  Microsoft's efforts to damage rival makers of audio-visual software by tying its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system.

Microsoft was willing to sell information to rival makers of server software so their products, which run on Linux and Unix operating systems, could work more easily with Windows.
NEED TO SET PRECEDENT-MONTI
But in Monti's view, the heart of the case went deeper than today's problems. Two more  Microsoft
cases are already under investigation, again focusing on the question of  abuse of monopoly power.
Next Wednesday  Microsoft will be formally held to have abused its dominant market position in the
European Union, as it was in a 2001 final U.S. appeals court ruling.

Late on Thursday the U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement stressing its good relations with the European Commission but also making clear it believes the U.S. settlement with  Microsoft contains the appropriate remedies.

"The Department of Justice will continue the work of enforcing the consent decree entered in its case against Microsoft, which in the Government's view provides the appropriate framework for marketplace competition in this important sector," the statement concluded.

Page 212 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Monti said setting a clear and strong legal precedent was very important. "It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either there or on the horizon."

That may open the way for further legal action against  Microsoft in all European Union countries - 25 of them after May 1 - if the company is seen to be competing unfairly.
"We're talking about an issue of enforcing respect for the rules," said Michael Reynolds, a lawyer with
Allen and Overy who filed the first complaint in the case for Sun Microsystems (SUNW.O) in 1998.

Microsoft said it has given up hopes of a settlement for now and expects a drawn-out fight on appeal. It announced plans to take the Commission to court after the formal decision next week.

"Today is just another step in what could be a long process,"  Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said in a statement.

"I hope that perhaps we can still settle the case at a later stage," Ballmer said.  Microsoft settled with the U.S. Justice Department, but only long after a final court decision found that it had abused monopoly power.

The Commission draft proposal calls on  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows to computer makers, one with Windows Media Player embedded and one without it.

Microsoft contends it cannot do so without crippling Windows to the point where it doesn't work properly.
But a rival audiovisual software maker, RealNetworks (RNWK.O), gave a demonstration to the
Commission at a hearing to argue that Windows Media Player could be removed without harm.

The exact size of the  fine will be approved by a meeting of member states on Monday. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor and Aine Gallagher).

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp. software designed for, of all things, cash registers and slot machines played a persuasive role in the European Union's landmark  antitrust case labelling it an abusive monopolist.

The European Commission is expected to  fine Microsoft hundreds of millions of euros next week and order it to offer a version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system without Windows Media Player audio-visual software installed.

TD
If Competition Commissioner Mario Monti succeeds in getting  Microsoft to reconfigure future versions of an operating system that runs more than 95 percent of all PCs - still considered a longshot by some industry observers - a piece of  Microsoft software known as Windows XP Embedded could be the reason.

The commission says that by bundling Windows Media Player with its operating system,  Microsoft is stifling  competition in a market that is rapidly becoming a favourite method for consumers to listen to music and watch movies.

Microsoft argues removal of Windows Media Player will limit, if not make impossible, the ability to play songs and film clips on a PC.
For now, the Commission isn't buying the argument. FIGHTING  MICROSOFT WITH  MICROSOFT

Microsoft competitor RealNetworks, makers of rival audiovisual software Real Player, used XP Embedded to respond to  Microsoft's contention that removing Windows Media Player damages Windows.

In November, RealNetworks demonstrated a PC running on Windows XP - minus the Windows Media Player - at a closed hearing of the  European Commission on the Microsoft case. The computer appeared to function normally. It was configured with Windows XP Embedded.

Windows XP Embedded is sold to manufacturers of relatively uncomplicated machines such as cash dispensers and cash registers. The manufacturers use the software to design a scaled-down version of Windows XP to run their hardware, excluding non-essential functions like Outlook Express and Media Player.
RealNetworks gave Reuters a demonstration this week on a similarly scaled-down machine with
RealPlayer, not Windows Media Player, installed.

To demonstrate that removing Windows Media Player will not affect the PC's multi-media features, Real played a ColdPlay CD and a trailer from "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones" on the PC through RealPlayer.



Page 216 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We believe this demonstrates clearly it is technically feasible to separate Windows Media Player from Windows and have a stable operating system. And,  Microsoft has done a substantial amount of work to enable that," said Dave Stewart, deputy general counsel for RealNetworks.
"MISLEADING"

Microsoft dismissed the demonstration as "misleading." A company spokesman said it is impossible to strip Windows Media Player entirely from the Windows operating system and have basic playback functionality remain intact on the PC.

"To remove Windows Media Player, you would actually have to rip out the underlying code. And if you do that, you hobble the system completely," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

Throughout the lengthy EU investigation, claims and counter-claims about the guts of the Windows operating system and whether it can function without the Windows Media Player have dominated the proceedings.
"It's an issue of semantics," said David Smith, a Gartner Research analyst, and specialist on  Microsoft
software.

"What  Microsoft is claiming is that some things won't work out of the box the way it is packaged and delivered to people today. That is true. But it would not be a huge effort to change it," he said.

Microsoft responds that is simply not the case.

(Rewrites with details on negotiations)
By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, March 17 (Reuters) -  Microsoft neared the end of intensive talks to try to settle a landmark EU antitrust suit on Wednesday, focusing on whether it would make broad, binding commitments to change the way it does business in Europe, a source close to the talks said.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the EU executive was determined to make a final decision at a meeting on March 24, ruling out any extension for further negotiations in the five-year probe.

"What I believe is that we are on track...for an announcement next week, which was always the plan," Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a news conference.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has backing from EU governments for a draft ruling finding Microsoft broke antitrust law and requiring the software giant to change the way it sells audiovisual software. The EU also plans to impose a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros.

But Microsoft is negotiating to try to avoid a precedent-setting ruling branding it an abusive monopolist.

Microsoft's share price was up 14 cents to 25.32 in midday U.S. trading.

Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and general counsel Brad Smith met Monti for several hours on Tuesday in the  competition directorate's green steel-and-glass building, and contacts between the two sides continued on Wednesday.
FAR BROADER

Microsoft reached settlements with the Commission in 1994 and 1997. It has headed off other
Commissions investigations by agreeing to change its behaviour towards particular companies.

But any settlement this time would have to be far broader to avoid a repetition of similar cases by changing the way  Microsoft does business in Europe, the source said.

If there were a provisional settlement, that too would go to the full 20 member Commission next Wednesday. EU procedures would then give interested third parties approximately a month to comment.

Experts say that given likely bureaucratic delays, any final compromise would not be officially completed until after May 1, when a new law takes effect permitting a so-called settlement decision.

Page 218 of 219 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That statute would make any settlement binding on  Microsoft, permitting the Commission to reopen proceedings against the company rapidly if Brussels believed it had broken the deal.
Monti held last-minute negotiations with the then chief executive of General Electric, Jack Welch, in
2001 but the Commission eventually turned down his proposed acquisition of Honeywell International.
