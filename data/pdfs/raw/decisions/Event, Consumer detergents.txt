* EU Commission set to announce decision on Wednesday

* Case will be fourth under EU's settlement procedure
(Adds P&G comment, Henkel no comment, shares) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble are set to be fined by EU regulators this week for fixing washing-powder prices, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.

Germany's Henkel, which alerted the European  Commission to the cartel in washing powder, will not be penalised, the source said.
"The Commission is expected to announce its decision on Wednesday," the source said.

As part of the settlement procedure, the EU watchdog will cut the fines by 10 percent in return for the firms' admissions that they participated in the  cartel, which the Commission had dubbed "Purity" in its investigation, the source added.
EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment.
P&G, which owns Tide washing powder, said it and rivals have been subjected to antitrust inquiries in
Europe, an issue which it has routinely reported every quarter for the last three years.

"As the European  Commission case is ongoing, we will not comment on speculation regarding this legal matter," Paul Fox, its director of corporate communications, said.

Henkel declined to comment. P&G shares were trading 0.8 percent higher at $62.40 by 1819 GMT while Henkel trimmed losses to end 0.5 percent down at 44.15 euros. Unilever, which owns the Omo and Surf brands, closed 0.13 percent down at 22.23 euros.

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of annual turnover for breaching EU rules. This will be the fourth EU decision using the settlement procedure after cases in the chipmaking, air cargo and animal feed sectors last year.

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is a dominant force in  detergents while P&G is the world's No.1 in the market. Henkel sells Persil.

The EU watchdog raided the three companies in June 2008 on suspicion of price fixing, and also sought information from U.S.-based household products firm Sara Lee.
The Commission has imposed close to 12 billion euros on  cartels in the five years to 2010.

European Union regulators have  fined consumer products firms Unilever and Procter andamp; Gamble andeuro;315.2m ($456m) for fixing washing powder prices in eight EU countries.
The fines, confirmed on Wednesday, conclude a three year investigation by the European
Commission into a price-fixing  cartel begun after a tip off from Henkel, a German competitor.

TD
Unilever, which sells the Omo and Surf brands, was fined andeuro;104m and Procter andamp; Gamble, which owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands, was fined andeuro;211.2m.

Henkel, which owns the Persil brand name in certain but not all EU countries, was not  fined because it had alerted the  commission to the cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the price fixing had begun when the companies, through a trade association, were working to make their  detergents more environmentally friendly.

"The three companies took the opportunity of these discussions on environmental agreements promoted by their trade organisation to organise a  cartel," Almunia said.

He said that the three had agreed not to decrease prices when making their packages smaller and even agreed later to raise prices.

Cartel companies

The cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between 2002 and 2005.

As part of the  commission's settlement procedure, the EU watchdog cut the  fines by 10 per cent in return for the firms' admission that they participated in the  cartel.

"By acknowledging their participation in the  cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation," Almunia said in a statement.
Unilever said it had used the investigation findings to tighten up its internal procedures, adding that the
fine was covered by provisions made in its 2010 results.

"All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives," the company said in a statement.
Procter andamp; Gamble said it has made the appropriate financial reserves for the case. "Perhaps more importantly, we have already taken the appropriate internal action, including
strengthening our global compliance program, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key
policies and regular auditing," Paul Fox, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement.
The Commission called its investigation into the  cartel "Purity".

The European Commission today finedProcter & Gamble and Unilever a total of € 315.2 million for operating a cartel together with Henkel in the market for household laundry powder  detergents in eight European Union countries. The  fine on the two companies includes a 10% reduction for acknowledging the facts and enabling a swift conclusion of the investigation. Henkel got immunity for revealing the  cartel to the Commission. The three companies are the leading producers of washing powder in Europe. The cartel lasted some three years and aimed at stabilising market positions and at coordinating prices in violation of EU and EEA antitrust rules (Article 101 of the EU treaty and Art. 53 of the EEA agreement). This is the third  cartel settlement in a year.

Joaquín Almunia, Vice-President of the Commission in charge of competition policy, said: “By acknowledging their participation in the cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation, and for this they got a reduction of the fine. But companies should be under no illusion that the  Commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly and on the merits.”
The Commission has adopted a decision settling a  cartel investigation and imposing a  fine totalling €
315.2 million on Procter & Gamble and Unilever. The decision is also addressed to Henkel, but because
the company, in 2008, revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission it benefitted from full
immunity from  fines. All three companies are major producers of washing powder and other laundry
detergents in Europe and they must abide by Art 101(1) of the EU Treaty and Art 53(1) of the EEA
Agreement, which ban practices restrictive of competition.

The cartel concerned powder detergents used in washing machines. The  Commission has evidence showing that the  cartel existed at least between 7 January 2002 and 8 March 2005. The  cartel started when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products. The environmental objective, however, did not require them to coordinate prices or other anti-competitive practices. Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk.

The cartel covered Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands. The decision is addressed to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Unilever PLC and Unilever NV, as well as to Procter & Gamble International S.à.r.l. and The Procter & Gamble Company which as parents of the P&G Group are held jointly and severally liable for the conduct of their relevant European subsidiaries.

The fines take into account the relevant sales of the companies involved in the eight countries concerned, the very serious nature of the infringement and the parties’ high combined market share. The assessment is based on the EU 2006 Guidelines on  fines
The individual fines are as follows: Reduction under the Leniency Notice (%) Reduction under the Settlement Notice

Henkel received full immunity because it was the first to inform the  Commission. The Commission carried out inspections in this case in June 2008 (see MEMO/08/424). Subsequently, Procter & Gamble and Unilever also applied for leniency under the EU’s Leniency Notice. The  Commission took account of their cooperation in the investigation and granted a reduction of respectively 50% to Procter & Gamble
and 25% to Unilever. Moreover, they also benefitted from a reduction of 10% for settling the case with the
Commission.

The settlement discussions started in the second half of 2010, after the companies indicated that they were prepared to settle, according to a procedure introduced in 2008. In January 2011, they all clearly and unequivocally acknowledged their respective liability for the infringement. A Statement of Objections reflecting the parties’ submissions was notified to them in February 2011 and they all confirmed that its content reflected their submissions. This led to a strongly streamlined settlement decision that could be adopted only two months later.
The settlement procedure

The settlement procedure is based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 (see IP/08/1056 and MEMO/08/458). It allows the  Commission to apply a simplified procedure to suitable cases and thereby reduce the length of the investigation. This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs; good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker decisions and a 10% reduction in  fines.
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court and Council Regulation 1/2003 both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission fine.

The Commission considers that meritorious claims for damages should be aimed at compensating, in a fair way, the victims of an infringement for the harm done. More information on antitrust damages actions, including the public consultation and a citizens’ summary, is available at:

Today the European  Commission adopted a cartel settlement decision finding that Henkel, Procter
& Gamble and Unilever operated a  cartel in the market for powder  detergent  in Europe between
2002 and 2005. Procter and Gamble and Unilever were  fined € 211.2 and € 104 million respectively.
Henkel received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.

The cartel affected consumers in eight European countries that use the products regularly in their washing machines. I will not name the brands because I’m not here to advertise the companies’ products, but they all feature prominently on the shelves of supermarkets and other shops.

TD
According to our evidence, the  cartel was in operation from January 2002 until March 2005 and covered Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

The cartel came about in the context of an initiative launched by the companies through their trade association called “AISE” (the Association for soaps,  detergents and other similar products in Europe) designed to reduce the weight of  detergent  powders as well as their boxes and bags in order to reduce packaging waste.

It is important to know, however, that the initiative at stake did not foresee or necessitate any price discussions. Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever engaged in the anticompetitive practices on their own initiative and at their own risk.

They did so to ensure that none of them would use this initiative to gain competitive advantage over the others by decreasing prices and to ensure their market positions would remain the same as prior to the environmental initiative.

This is a cartel settlement because the parties acknowledged their participation in the  cartel, thereby enabling the Commission to conclude the investigation from start to finish in less than three years. The fines on Procter & Gamble and Unilever include a 10% settlement reduction to reward them for this.

On top of this, the fines include a reduction of 50% for Procter and Gamble and 25% for Unilever for cooperating with the Commission at the beginning of the investigation under the Leniency programme.

This is the third  cartel settlement since the settlement procedure was introduced in 2008. The previous two were in the DRAMS and animal feed cases of 2010.

The procedure enables the  Commission to deal with  cartel investigations more expediently whenever the companies cooperate and the case lends itself to such a procedure, freeing up resources for other investigations and increasing the deterrence of our antitrust rules.

Companies should be under no illusion, however, that the  Commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which are the worst violation of competition rules by extracting higher prices from consumers than they would pay when companies compete fairly and on the merits.

Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been slapped with fines totalling 315.2 million euros (£280.5 million) after they colluded to fix the price of washing machine detergent powder.

The European  Commission said the two companies and rival Henkel shared information about pricing in eight countries when they worked together on an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of their products.

TD
The Commission finedUnilever, whose UK brands include Surf, 104 million euros (£92.6 million) and P&G, which makes Ariel, 211.2 million euros (£188 million) after reductions for co-operating with the investigation.
Henkel was let off a  fine after it blew the whistle to the regulator.

The three companies admitted that the  cartel existed in eight European countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands - between January 7 2002 and March 8
2005.

They were working together on environmental measures, including a scheme to produce concentrated powder to reduce packaging, but they also shared financial information, said the EC.

A spokesman for Unilever said the company has strengthened its internal compliance programme and all key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules.

BRUSSELS, April 13 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble were  fined
315.2 million euros ($456 million) by EU regulators on Wednesday for fixing washing powder prices in
eight EU countries.

Germany's Henkel , which alerted the European  Commission to the cartel in laundry detergent,  was not penalised.

The fines for Unilever and P&G were reduced by 10 percent under the  Commission's settlement procedure, after they admitted taking part in the  cartel which had lasted three years, the EU watchdog said.

"By acknowledging their participation in the  cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
The cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
Netherlands.

Procter & Gamble and Unilever, the world’s biggest consumer goods companies, have been  fined a total €315.2 million (£281 million) by the European  Commission for fixing the price of laundry detergents.

The penalty relates to a period between January 2002 and March 2005, when the companies, together with Germany’s Henkel which blew the whistle on the companies, were encouraging consumers to switch from old-style washing powder to more concentrated, environmentally friendly, powders.

TD
The European Commission said that the three companies, Europe’s biggest producers of washing powders, formed a cartel to co-ordinate prices during the period, covering sales in Belgium,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. No evidence of price-fixing was found in the UK market.

The brands involved include Ariel, made by Procter & Gamble, Skip, Unilever’s biggest laundry detergent  brand in continental Europe, and Persil, which is sold by Henkel in some of the countries concerned, although it is owned by Unilever in other countries including the UK.

Procter & Gamble is to pay €211.2 million, while Unilever was  fined €104 million. Both companies had their fines reduced by 10 per cent because they admitted taking part in the price-fixing and were further reduced for voluntarily disclosing information to the investigation.

The European Union watchdog raided the three companies in June 2008, and also sought information from Sara Lee, the US consumer goods companies.

Joaquin Almunia, vice president of the  commission in charge of competition policy, said today,“Companies should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels.”

Unilever said: “All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives.”

The company has already made provision for a settlement of this size within its 2010 results. Its share price rose by 1 per cent to £19.34 this morning following the news.

Shoppers looking for laundry powder are presented with a bewildering array of deals and offers, but a market that appears to offer a myriad of choices for getting clothes clean has been sullied after it emerged that three of its giants have been colluding on prices.

Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been  fined a total of €315.2 million (£281 million) by the European Commission for fixing the price of laundry  detergents. The penalty relates to a period between January 2002 and March 2005 when the companies, with Henkel of Germany, which blew the whistle on the price-fixing agreement, encouraged consumers to switch from old-style washing powders to concentrated, eco-friendly versions.

TD
The Commission said that Europe’s biggest producers of washing powders had formed a  cartel that co-ordinated prices during the period. It covered sales in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. No evidence of pricefixing was found in Britain.

Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner, said: “Companies should be under no illusion that the Commission will pursue its relentless fight against  cartels.”

He said that the price-fixing had begun when the companies were working to make their  detergents more environmentally friendly. They agreed to make their packages smaller without decreasing prices and, later, to raise prices while keeping the size of their packages the same.

The brands involved include Ariel, made by Procter & Gamble, Skip, Unilever’s biggest laundry detergent  brand in Europe, and Persil, which is sold by Henkel in most of the countries concerned, although it is owned by Unilever in other markets including Britain and Ireland.

Procter & Gamble was  fined €211.2 million, while Unilever was  fined €104 million. Both companies had their fines reduced because they admitted taking part in the price-fixing and voluntarily disclosed information to the investigation.

Unilever said: “All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives.” The company has made
provision for a settlement in its 2010 results.

P&G said: “We have already taken the appropriate internal action, including strengthening our global compliance programme, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key policies and regular auditing.”

Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, the chief compliance officer at Henkel, said that the company had uncovered the price-fixing in internal audits in 2008.

“We had to acknowledge evidence of misconduct by employees in several Western European countries. We have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner,” he said.

HD     EU finesUnilever, Procter & Gamble in detergent cartel; Henkel escapes fine

BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined consumer products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of (EURO)315.2 million ($456 million) for fixing prices of powdered laundry detergent  together with Henkel in eight EU countries.
Germany's Henkel AG escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

TD
Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co. has to pay (EURO)211.2 million ($306 million), while
British-Dutch company Unilever NV was  fined (EURO)104 million ($150 million). Both companies had
their fines reduced because they agreed to settle the case with the  Commission and cooperated with the
investigation.

The three companies are the leading producers for washing powder in Europe, the  Commission said. Unilever makes laundry detergents including OMO and Radiant; Procter & Gamble produces Ariel and Tide; while Henkel owns the Persil brand. In the U.K. and Ireland, Persil is sold by Unilever.
The cartel was started when the companies were in joint talks on how to cut down on packaging, said the
EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"They used this environmental initiative to agree on market share and to agree on not reducing the prices even if the packages were smaller," Almunia said.

The cartel lasted from Jan. 2002 until March 2005 and covered Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, the  Commission said.

Unilever said the fine falls below provisions already made in the company's 2010 results. "Unilever believes it is in the best interests of the company for Unilever and the  Commission to have reached this settlement," it said in a statement.

Procter & Gamble said the  fine was not a surprise and it had already put away money for it in recent earnings reports. "It's our policy to comply with the letter and spirit of all laws everywhere we do business," spokesman Paul Fox said in Cincinnati. "We've already taken the appropriate internal action and strengthened our global compliance program."

Henkel said it discovered the  cartel in 2008 during an internal audit and immediately notified the authorities.

The detergent  case is the third  cartel case the Commission decided to settle this year. A settlement leads to lower fines, but it also cuts down on the time and money the EU has to spend on an investigation.

Almunia said companies should expect the  Commission to pursue a relentless fight against  cartels, "which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly and on the merits."

HD     EU fines washing  powder giants

Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter and Gamble were  fined 315.2 million euros by EU
regulators today for fixing washing powder prices in eight EU countries.

Germany's Henkel, which alerted the European  Commission to the cartel in laundry detergents, was not fined. The penalty for Unilever was 104 million euros, while PandG was fined 211.2 million euros. The announcement confirmed a Reuters report from Monday.

TD
The price fixing began when the companies, through a trade association, were working to make their detergents more environmentally friendly, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a news conference.

"The three companies took the opportunity of these discussions on environmental agreements promoted by their trade organisation to organise a  cartel," Almunia said, adding that the three agreed not to decrease prices when making their packages smaller and even agreed later to raise prices. As part of the Commission's settlement procedure, the EU watchdog cut the fines by 10 percent in return for the firms' admission that they participated in the  cartel, which the Commission had dubbed "Purity" in its investigation. "By acknowledging their participation in the cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation," Almunia said in a statement. The  fines were also reduced under the Commission's leniency programme related to voluntary disclosure of information. World No. 1 household products producer PandG owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands of washing powder, while Anglo-Dutch Unilever makes detergent  products under the brand names Omo and Surf. Henkel owns the Persil brand in most of Europe, while Unilever owns it in Britain, Ireland and France. The  cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between 2002 and 2005, the regulator said. Unilever said it had used the investigation findings to tighten up its internal procedures, adding that the  fine was covered by provisions made in its 2010 results. "All key managers in Europe
have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industrywide environmental initiatives," the company said in a statement. PandG said it has taken the appropriate financial reserves for the case. "Perhaps more importantly, we have already taken the appropriate internal action, including strengthening our global compliance program, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key policies and regular auditing," PandG spokesman Paul Fox said in a statement. Henkel said it found out about the  cartel activity during internal compliance audits in 2008
and immediately informed the regulators. Unilever shares were up 0.8 percent at 19.31 pounds in London; Henkel stock was 0.9 percent higher at 43.85 euros. PandG shares were up 1 cent at USD62.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. The  Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of annual turnover for breaching EU competition rules. This is the third EU decision using the settlement procedure, after cases
in the electronic chipmaking and animal feed sectors last year. The EU watchdog raided the three firms in June 2008 on suspicion of price fixing, and also sought information from U.S.-based household products firm Sara Lee. It has imposed  fines close to 12 billion euros on  cartels in the five years to 2010. (C ) Reuters

DUSSELDORF, Germany, April 13 -- Henkel issued the following news release:

The European Commission has imposed fines on several international  detergent  manufacturers today on grounds of cartel infringements in different Western European countries. Due to its extensive cooperation with the  cartel authority Henkel was granted full immunity from  fines.

TD
From 2002 through early 2005 the companies committed  cartel infringements in the heavy-duty
detergent  powder segment. These infringements were detected in 2008 during internal compliance audits
carried out by Henkel. The company immediately informed the authorities and contributed substantially to
clearing up the issue.

"In 2008, we had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several Western European countries. For us, living Corporate Compliance means actively dealing with this issue. This is why we have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner. This is our obligation vis-a-vis our employees, customers and shareholders", says Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, Chief Compliance Officer at Henkel.

With the change from a decentralized Compliance organization to a central one in 2007 and the establishment of the position of a globally responsible Chief Compliance Officer who directly reports to the CEO, Henkel has taken effective activities in order to uncover and avoid future misconduct.

BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) antitrust regulator on Wednesday  fined consumer goods giants Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Unilever a total of 315.2 million euros (456 million U.S. dollars) for fixing the prices of washing powder.

Germany's Henkel, which also participated but blew the whistle on the illegal  cartel for price fixing, was exempted from punishment, the European  Commission said in a statement.

The cartel concerned powder detergents used in washing machines, which existed at least between
January 2002 and March 2005.

The commission said it started when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products. The environmental objective, however, did not require them to coordinate prices or other anti-competitive practices. Henkel, P&G and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk.

"The three companies are the leading producers of washing powder in Europe. The  cartel lasted some three years and aimed at stabilizing market positions and at coordinating prices in violation of EU antitrust rules," the  commission said.

CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble has been  fined $305.1 million by European regulators and charged with conspiring with competitors to fix prices for laundry  detergent  in eight countries.
The European Union said Wednesday that it is fining P&G and rival Unilever for forming what it called a
"cartel" to set prices for powdered  detergent  in eight Western European countries.

A third detergent  maker implicated in the plan, Germany-based Henkel, was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the scheme, regulators said.
The three companies are the largest sellers of  detergent  in Europe, the EU said. Unilever was fined $150.2 million.
European Union officials said the three companies began working together on a plan to reduce the environmental impact of powder  detergents.

"The environmental objective, however, did not require them to coordinate prices or other anti-competitive practices," the EU said in a prepared statement. "Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk."

The fines for both companies were reduced because they acknowledged the facts and cooperated in the investigation, the EU said. P&G's  fine was reduced by 50 percent and Unilever's was reduced by 25 percent. Both  fines were reduced an additional 10 percent because they agreed to settle, the EU said.

The P&Gfine comes on top of a $17 million  fine from antitrust authorities in Spain in March for a similar plan.

Spain's antitrust agency said P&G (and its precursor company in Spain, Wella) and other companies formed a cartel that met regularly from 1989 to 2008 to exchange pricing information on hair care products.

P&G has been setting aside money to pay antitrust  fines in Europe for some time. In January, the company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission that it had set aside $574 million to pay potential fines resulting from antitrust investigations in Europe. The investigations involved the European Commission, as well as individual investigations in 10 countries, P&G said at the time.
P&G said its own investigation of the complaints caused it toincrease the amount of money reserved to
pay fines. The company said it identified violations in "certain European countries and appropriate actions
were taken." It did not offer further details.

P&G spokesman Paul Fox said the company took "the appropriate disciplinary action" in the case, but would not comment on individual cases.

"All employees know that failure to comply with business conduct standards will result in appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination," he said.

He also said the company has taken other internal actions, including strengthening its global compliance program, improving training, and regular auditing. "It's something we clearly take very seriously," Fox said.

P&G said an investigation in the United Kingdom was closed without any penalty to the company.

The EU commission hit washing powder giants Procter & Gamble and Unilever, makers of Ariel and
Persil, with over 300 million euros in  fines Wednesday for running a price-fixing  cartel in Europe.

They claim whiter than white results, but housewives the world over finally landed proof that the washing powder giants behind Ariel and Persil, by their own admission. ran a price-fixing  cartel for years.

TD
Global giants Procter & Gamble and Unilever received  fines from the European  Commission, which polices business abuses across the European Union, totalling 315.2 million euros ($456 million) after settling a long-running  cartel case.

Another company, Germany's Henkel, was also listed as a member of the  cartel that operated for more than three years at the start of the last decade, but it escaped any  fine having revealed the sharp practices initially in 2008.

"Companies should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in revealing the penalty.

"By acknowledging their participation in the  cartel, the companies enabled the  commission to swiftly conclude its investigation, and for this they got a reduction of the  fine," of 10 percent, he added.

The secret deal to fix prices arose out of a plan through a trade association "to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products," the  commission noted.
The companies fixed prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
Netherlands.

They claim whiter than white results, but housewives got proof of price-fixing Wednesday as the makers of Ariel and Persil agreed to pay  fines totalling over 300 million euros for running a washing-powder cartel.

Global giants Procter & Gamble and Unilever reached settlements to pay the European  Commission, which polices business abuses across the European Union market for half a billion consumers, 211.2 million euros ($306 million) and 104 million euros ($151 million) respectively, the EU said.

Germany's Henkel was also listed as a member of the  cartel that operated for more than three years at the start of the last decade, but it escaped any  fine having revealed the sharp practices initially in 2008.
"I will not name the brands, but they all feature prominently on the shelves of supermarkets," said EU
competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
"I'm sure you know all the brands that were involved.

"Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever engaged in anti-competitive practices... on their own initiative and at their own risk," he said, in a bid "to protect their own market share."

Almunia would not put a figure on how much the companies gained from the secret deal to fix prices that arose out of a trade association plan "to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products."

But he said he hoped the  fine would prove "deterrent enough" and warned that companies in all business sectors "should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against  cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly."
The companies fixed prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
Netherlands.

They both obtained a 10 percent reduction in the  fines, based on associated business turnover, for holding their hands up after raids by inspectors.

It was the third time the  commission has reached a settlement in a gamut of  cartel cases, which often run for years, after similar outcomes last year in the computing and animal feed sectors.

Thirteen companies that ran an animal feed phosphates  cartel for more than three decades until 2004 were fined 175 million euros in July.
The world's biggest memory chip makers, including Samsung, Infineon and Toshiba, were  fined a total of
331 million euros in May.

Earlier this month, a  cartel of 17 steelmakers led by global leader ArcelorMittal saw  fines for fixing markets between 1984 and 2002 reduced from an initial 518 million euros to 269 million.

They claim whiter than white results but housewives got proof of price-fixing Wednesday as the makers of Ariel and Persil agreed to pay 315 million euros ($456 million) in  fines for running a washing-powder cartel.

Germany's Henkel was also listed as a member of the  cartel that operated for more than three years at the start of the last decade but it escaped any  fine, having revealed the sharp practices initially in 2008.
"I will not name the brands but they all feature prominently on the shelves of supermarkets," EU
competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
"I'm sure you know all the brands that were involved."

The world's largest consumer products group, Procter & Gamble owns brands including Bonux and Tide while Anglo-Dutch group Unilever markets the likes of Surf and Omo.
Unilever is behind Persil in Britain and Ireland while Henkel controls it in much of the rest of Europe. "Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever engaged in anti-competitive practices ... on their own initiative
and at their own risk ... to protect their own market share," Almunia said.

He would not put a figure on how much the companies gained from the secret deal to fix prices that arose out of a trade association plan to "improve the environmental performance" of  detergents.

But the commissioner said he hoped the  fine would prove "deterrent enough" and warned that companies in all business sectors "should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly."

The Spaniard said the  cartel came about so as "to ensure that none of them would use (the environmental) initiative to gain competitive advantage over the others by decreasing prices."
The companies fixed prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
Netherlands.

P&G and Unilever obtained a 10 percent reduction in the  fines, based on associated business turnover, for holding their hands up after raids by inspectors.
Unilever said it was now training all key European product managers to ensure strict adherence to EU
competition rules while Henkel also insisted it had taken measures to ensure there would be no repeat.

It was the third time the  commission has reached a settlement in a gamut of  cartel cases, which often run for years, after similar outcomes last year in the computing and animal feed sectors.

European Union regulators have  fined consumer products firms Unilever and Procter andamp; Gamble andeuro;315.2m ($456m) for fixing washing powder prices in eight EU countries.
The fines, confirmed on Wednesday, conclude a three year investigation by the European
Commission into a price-fixing  cartel begun after a tip off from Henkel, a German competitor.

TD
Unilever, which sells the Omo and Surf brands, was fined andeuro;104m and Procter andamp; Gamble, which owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands, was fined andeuro;211.2m.

Henkel, which owns the Persil brand name in certain but not all EU countries, was not  fined because it had alerted the  commission to the cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the price fixing had begun when the companies, through a trade association, were working to make their  detergents more environmentally friendly.

"The three companies took the opportunity of these discussions on environmental agreements promoted by their trade organisation to organise a  cartel," Almunia said.

He said that the three had agreed not to decrease prices when making their packages smaller and even agreed later to raise prices.

Cartel companies

The cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between 2002 and 2005.

As part of the  commission's settlement procedure, the EU watchdog cut the  fines by 10 per cent in return for the firms' admission that they participated in the  cartel.

"By acknowledging their participation in the  cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation," Almunia said in a statement.
Unilever said it had used the investigation findings to tighten up its internal procedures, adding that the
fine was covered by provisions made in its 2010 results.

"All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives," the company said in a statement.
Procter andamp; Gamble said it has made the appropriate financial reserves for the case. "Perhaps more importantly, we have already taken the appropriate internal action, including
strengthening our global compliance program, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key
policies and regular auditing," Paul Fox, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement.
The Commission called its investigation into the  cartel "Purity".

LP
CONSUMER goods giant Unilever, which makes Persil, is expected to be  fined today by competition watchdogs for fixing prices in the washing powder market.

The Anglo-Dutch firm, together with Ariel maker Procter & Gamble, is understood to have struck a deal with the European Commission that will see it receive a reduced penalty in exchange for admitting it participated in a cartel.

TD
The Commission can fine companies as much as ten per cent of global sales. However, the figure is more often between two and three per cent of sales. Germany's Henkel, which alerted the European Commission to the cartel in washing powder, will not be penalised, the source said. Unilever is a dominant force in detergents while P&G is the market leader.

The EU watchdog raided the three companies in June 2008 on suspicion of price fixing, and also sought information from US-based household products firm Sara Lee.
The commission has imposed close to €12bn (£10.6bn) worth of  fines on cartels in the five years to
2010.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday said it is fining washing powder producers a total of EUR315.2 million for operating a cartel in eight European Union countries.

In a statement, the EU's antitrust body said it is fining Proctor & Gamble Co. (PG) EUR211.2 million and Unilever NV (UN) EUR104.0 million.

TD
The third member of the cartel, Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (HEN.XE), won't be  fined because it revealed the cartel to the commission in 2008.

The fines imposed on the other two companies were also reduced for 'acknowledging the facts and enabling a swift conclusion of the investigation,' the statement said.
The cartel covered Belgium, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

It concerned powder  detergents used in washing machines and evidence showed the  cartel existed at least between January 2002 and March 2005.
Settlement discussions started in the second half of last year.

In the statement, Joaquin Almunia, vice-president of the commission in charge of competition policy, said: 'Companies should be under no illusion that the commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels.' -By Laurence Norman, Dow Jones Newswires; +32 (0)2 741 1 481; laurence.norman@dowjones.com

Consumer goods groups Procter & Gamble and Unilever will have to pay  fines totalling €315.2m (£280m, $455m) for fixing prices of laundry powder  detergents in Europe, together with Germany's Henkel, for more than three years.

European antitrust regulators said the  cartel, which developed out of a valid environmental initiative in the industry, ran between early 2002 and March 2005 and covered eight European countries - including Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

Henkel finally blew the whistle on the arrangements in 2008, meaning that it gets immunity from any fines. The company said the  cartel arrangements were detected during internal audits in 2008 and that it "immediately informed the authorities".

In a statement, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, Henkel's chief compliance officer, said: "We had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several western European countries ... we have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner."

P&G and Unilever have now settled the matter with the European  Commission, meaning that they benefit from a 10 per cent reduction in  fines under Brussels' new settlement guidelines. The two companies also co-operated in the investigation, which meant that P&G's  fine was cut by a further 50 per cent and Unilever's  fine was cut by a further 25 per cent.
As a result, P&G was  fined €211.2m, while Unilever was  fined €104m.

On Wednesday, Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said the  cartel had grown out of a genuine and legal environmental initiative that was co-ordinated through a trade association and dealt with the packaging and presentation of products. But, in the course of this, the companies strayed into illegal territory, agreeing measures to protect their market shares, maintain prices and, ultimately, fix prices.

This is the third  cartel investigation to be resolved under the  Commission's settlement procedures, which came into operation in 2008. The new procedures had a slow start, although lawyers and officials say they are becoming increasingly comfortable with the mechanisms, which are designed to avoid long legal fights over liability and  fines. Mr Almunia said he was "happy with the experience".

The detergent  manufacturers could still be vulnerable to damages claims from "victims" of the  cartel. Consumers are entitled to bring claims before national courts, seeking redress.

(ADPnews) - Apr 13, 2011 - German consumer goods maker Henkel (ETR:HEN3) said today that it evaded a fine for illegal price fixing due to its cooperation with the European  Commission (EC).
The cartel authority today imposed  fines on several international  detergent  manufacturers due to
cartel infringements in different Western European countries.

From 2002 to 2005 the companies committed  cartel infringements in the heavy-duty  detergent powder segment, which were discovered during an internal compliance audits carried out by Henkel in 2008.

BRUSSELS, April 13 -- European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined consumer products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of euro315.2 million ($456 million) for fixing prices of powdered laundry  detergent  together with Henkel in eight EU countries.

U.S.-based Procter & Gamble Co. has to pay euro211.2 million ($306 million), while British-Dutch company Unilever NV was  fined euro104 million ($150 million). Both companies had their  fines reduced because they agreed to settle the case with the  Commission and cooperated with the investigation.

TD
The three companies are the leading producers for washing powder in Europe, the  Commission said. Unilever makes laundry  detergents including OMO and Radiant; Procter & Gamble produces Ariel and Tide; while Henkel owns the Persil brand. In the U.K. and Ireland, Persil is sold by Unilever.

The cartel was started when the companies were in joint talks on how to cut down on packaging, said the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"They used this environmental initiative to agree on market share and to agree on not reducing the prices even if the packages were smaller," Almunia said.

The cartel lasted from Jan. 2002 until March 2005 and covered Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, the  Commission said.

Unilever said the fine falls below provisions already made in the company's 2010 results. "Unilever believes it is in the best interests of the company for Unilever and the  Commission to have reached this settlement," it said in a statement.

Henkel said it discovered the  cartel in 2008 during an internal audit and immediately notified the authorities.

The detergent  case is the third  cartel case the Commission decided to settle this year. A settlement leads to lower fines, but it also cuts down on the time and money the EU has to spend on an investigation.

Almunia said companies should expect the  Commission to pursue a relentless fight against  cartels, "which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly and on the merits."Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

BRUSSELS, April 13 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble were  fined
315.2 million euros ($456 million) by EU regulators on Wednesday for fixing washing powder prices in
eight EU countries.

Germany's Henkel , which alerted the European  Commission to the cartel in laundry detergents, was not fined. The penalty for Unilever was 104 million euros, while P&G was fined 211.2 million euros. The announcement confirmed a Reuters report from Monday.

The price fixing began when the companies, through a trade association, were working to make their detergents more environmentally friendly, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a news conference.

"The three companies took the opportunity of these discussions on environmental agreements promoted by their trade organisation to organise a  cartel," Almunia said, adding that the three agreed not to decrease prices when making their packages smaller and even agreed later to raise prices.

As part of the  Commission's settlement procedure, the EU watchdog cut the fines by 10 percent in return for the firms' admission that they participated in the  cartel, which the Commission had dubbed "Purity" in its investigation.

"By acknowledging their participation in the  cartel, the companies enabled the  Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation," Almunia said in a statement.

The fines were also reduced under the  Commission's leniency programme related to voluntary disclosure of information.

World No. 1 household products producer P&G owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands of washing powder, while Anglo-Dutch Unilever makes  detergent  products under the brand names Omo and Surf. Henkel owns the Persil brand in most of Europe, while Unilever owns it in Britain, Ireland and France.

The cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between 2002 and 2005, the regulator said.

Unilever said it had used the investigation findings to tighten up its internal procedures, adding that the
fine was covered by provisions made in its 2010 results.

"All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industrywide environmental initiatives," the company said in a statement.
P&G said it has taken the appropriate financial reserves for the case.

"Perhaps more importantly, we have already taken the appropriate internal action, including strengthening our global compliance program, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key policies and regular auditing," P&G spokesman Paul Fox said in a statement.

Henkel said it found out about the  cartel activity during internal compliance audits in 2008 and immediately informed the regulators.
Unilever shares were up 0.8 percent at 19.31 pounds in London; Henkel stock was 0.9 percent higher at
43.85 euros. P&G shares were up 1 cent at $62.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of annual turnover for breaching EU competition rules. This is the third EU decision using the settlement procedure, after cases in the electronic chipmaking and animal feed sectors last year.

The EU watchdog raided the three firms in June 2008 on suspicion of price fixing, and also sought information from U.S.-based household products firm Sara Lee. It has imposed  fines close to 12 billion euros on cartels in the five years to 2010.

UNILEVER and Procter & Gamble have been handed  fines of about £280million for colluding to fix the price of washing machine  detergents.

The two companies and rival Henkel shared information about pricing in eight countries while they worked together on an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of their products, the European Commission said.

TD
Unilever, which makes Surf, was  fined more than £92million and Ariel owner P&G must pay about
£187million.

The sums were reduced after the pair co-operated with the investigation, while German group Henkel was let off for blowing the whistle to the regulator.

The companies admitted the  cartel existed in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between January 2002 and March 2005.

The three were working together on green measures, including a scheme to produce concentrated powder to reduce packaging.
But during the project the companies also shared financial information, said the EC investigators. Unilever said the company had since strengthened its internal compliance programme and all its key
managers in Europe had been retrained on the region's competition rules.

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust authorities levied stiff  fines on Wednesday on the household products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever for price-fixing that arose during efforts to make greener packaging for laundry  detergents.

P.& G., the maker of  detergent  brands like Tide and Ariel, was ordered to pay 211.2 million euros, or $306 million. Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, was  fined 104 million euros. A German company, Henkel, escaped a  fine in exchange for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

TD
The European competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said that the companies had developed the cartel to make sure none gained a competitive advantage over the others while seeking to meet environmental goals.

''They agreed to protect their respective market shares, they agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of the packages, and afterwards they even agreed on a price increase,'' Mr. Almunia said.

The companies formed the  cartel after working on methods to reduce the weight of detergent powders and to reduce waste from boxes and bags through the Association for Soaps, Detergents and Maintenance Products, a trade association that includes other major home products companies.

The cartel operated from January 2002 until March 2005, and it affected the price of laundry detergents in supermarkets in Belgium France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, the European  Commission said.

Mr. Almunia said there was no need to punish the trade association, which he praised for promoting environmental initiatives.

Henkel said it detected the  cartel in 2008 during an internal audit. The company ''had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees'' in several West European countries, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, the chief compliance officer at Henkel, said in a statement.
Henkel also said that it had taken measures to ''avoid future misconduct.''

Marina Barker, a spokeswoman for P.& G., said that the activity took place from six to nine years ago, and had been solely focused on some countries in Europe.

She said that P.& G. had ''previously taken an appropriate financial reserve,'' and that the company had already strengthened its global compliance program.
Unilever said that the size of the  fine was in the range it had prepared for.

Mr. Almunia said the companies admitted involvement in the  cartel in exchange for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines as part of a settlement procedure.

Mr. Almunia said that where possible he favored settlements, as in two recent cases involving computer chips and animal feed, to speed up  cartel investigations, but that that did not mean Europe was going soft on  cartels.

''The  commission will pursue its relentless fight against  cartels, which are the worst violation of competition rules by extracting higher prices from consumers than they would pay when companies compete fairly and on the merits,'' Mr. Almunia said.

MAX FOSTER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: BP's board comes out fighting as angry protestors show their fury.
Asleep on the job, the head of U.S. air traffic control unit resigns.

TD
And after a bit of engine trouble investors in Google search for good results.
I'm Max Foster in for Richard Quest. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Hello to you.
Anger and frustration as BP faces shareholders and critics nearly a year on the Deepwater Horizon
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It was never going to be easy. These protestors found themselves locked out
of the company's annual general meeting in London. We'll have a full report on what happened in just a
moment.

Inside the hall some investors were scarcely less irate. They pushed BP's bosses on the company's safety record, environmental responsibilities and financial losses. A key deal with Russia's Rosneft was due to be done today. It is not yet complete, though, it isn't dead.

Now, let's have a look at this in some more detail. Rosneft share swap, the deal is actually worth something like $16 billion, and the deadline has been extended, now, to May 16. But there is clearly a few problems. It is a vital arctic opportunity for everyone involved. The chairman of BP, Carl-Henric-Svanberg said today,
that Russia is an important place for BP to be. It is a very important country, for BP.

Now, nearly one year since the crisis, that we are talking about, April the 20th, Svanberg says our response was without precedent, CEO Bob Dudley said that new safety and risk management measures need to
earn back trust. They are all in place, though, he said. Svanberg said, we have to reset the company and are now doing things differently. So try to deal with all of these problems they are facing right now.

What about the future? Well, BP said the demand for energy will grow 40 percent in 20 years; 93 percent of demand will be coming from emerging markets, or the-93 percent of demand growth is from there.

Now, Bob Dudley calls it a wake up call for everyone, particularly, in the company. Now to fulfill that growing demand, BP is looking to pump oil from the Arctic, of course. And that is where Russia's Rosneft comes in. Last month investors in BP's other Russian venture, TNK-BP tried to block the deal. I asked CNN's Matthew Chance how things stand right now.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is not clear what is going to come out of this. But what has happened today is the deadline for the deal to be agreed between BP and the Russian state, oil monopoly Rosneft, has extended by about a month. And so that is created some wiggle room for BP to sit down again with the Russian shareholders of TNK-BP, its joint venture in Russia, and try to hammer out some kind of agreement that would either see BP buy out their 50 percent stake in TNK-BP, or bring them into the deal in some way that they were happy with, but obviously it is going to be very difficult. So far the attempts to negotiate a settlement to this have not been successful. And so it has put the deal somewhat in jeopardy, Max.
Page 66 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FOSTER: Uh, is another partner likely to come in, say an American oil firm, to replace BP. Is that the best option for the Russian, do you think?

CHANCE: I think it is a possibility. But I think it not the most likely scenario. I think still, investors I have spoken to, people who have been focusing on this, think that the most likely outcome on this is that some kind of deal will be reached. Remember, this isn't just about a financial, you know, agreement between a Russian oil company and BP. This issue is of a fundamental strategic importance to Russia. It wants to make sure that in the future it remains the world's biggest energy supplier, the world's biggest oil producer. To do that it needs to exploit those oil and gas resources underneath the arctic. It has identified BP as the best company to do that with. And so I think it is probably very unlikely that a few Russian shareholders and, you know, an agreement and a few court rulings are going to get in the way of the Kremlin if that is what is they want to do.

FOSTER: And these key figures that have such a large stake in the business. Do you think that they are just holding out for the highest price or do they want something more strategic here, do you think?

CHANCE: Well, I think it is a bit of both. They have said repeatedly, the Russian investor half of TNK-BP; they have said repeatedly that the business is not up for sale. But obviously it has been reported that they have been in negotiations with BP to find a price that they would agree on to buy them out. They have been talking about $25 billion, valuing the company at $50 billion. That has not been acceptable to the Russian shareholders. They want a valuation of somewhere in the region of $70 billion, which means they would have to get $35 billion for BP.

But it is not just the price that is the problem. The other problem is that these Russian billionaire oligarchs are also demanding that that money is paid in terms of share, in both Rosneft and BP. And both of those companies have decided, it seems, that they don't want these Russian billionaires to be significant shareholders in their companies. And so at the moment that is a non-starter. But, you know, now that no agreement has been reached, now that there are several more weeks of negotiations ahead of us, that kind of deal could very well be back on the table again.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

FOSTER: Well, back to London and to protests outside that meeting of BP shareholders. Residents of the Gulf of Mexico are still suffering the effects of last year's spill. As Jim reports, some people came a long way to let BP know.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JIM BOULDEN, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Just days before the first anniversary of this, the BP Gulf of Mexico disaster, Louisiana fisherman Mike Roberts and shrimper Terry Kuhns joined other Gulf residents to come all the way to London in an attempt to get into BP's annual general meeting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are officially being denied access. And that comes from whose authority? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Under the authority of BP.
BOULDEN: The group was not successful as they aren't shareholders.

TRACY KUHNS, LOUISIANA BAYOUKEEPER: And it is sad. It really is. I mean, this is what got BP in trouble. Not listening to the people.
BOULDEN: Roberts says he's entitled to more than just the one small payment he has received from the
$20 billion fund paid by BP and run by Kenneth Feinberg.

MIKE ROBERTS, LOUISIANA FISHERMAN: The Feinberg process is a farce. It is not-it doesn't work for everybody. There is no rhyme or reason to it.

BOULDEN: The fund, to date, has paid out around $3.5 billion. And it says more than half the claims submitted have now been processed. But the fund says 19,000 claims need more paperwork. It has
already rejected 3,000 claims. Tracy Kuhns wants BP to pay for not just lost business, but also for lost food on the dinner table.

We save a lot of what we catch, that is what we eat. We bring it home, we feed our families with that. And we can't fish.

BOULDEN: BP said Thursday it remains committed to paying all the legitimate claims and will fulfill its responsibilities along the Gulf.


Page 67 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BOB DUDLEY, CEO, BP: And over 99 percent of the Gulf is now open for fishing. And government testing has consistently found Gulf seafood safe to eat.

BOULDEN: The BP board did receive sympathy from some shareholders. But also heard some big institutional shareholders were unhappy about BP's risk management systems before the spill. BP CEO Bob Dudley read out the names of the 11 men killed in the Gulf last April.

DUDLEY: Gordon Jones is one of those, from MS Swako (ph). Jason Anderson, Aaron Dale Burkene, Donald Clark, Steven Curtis.

BOULDEN: At the AGM the BP board did receive sympathy from some shareholders. But also heard how some are unhappy about BP's risk management systems before the spill.

And inside, and outside, BP also faced a small number of protestors calling for the company to stop deepwater drilling.

(On camera): Inside the meeting CEO Bob Dudley told shareholders, in fact, the company will double investment into exploration and focus on countries like Azerbaijan, Angola, Egypt, and, yes, the Gulf of Mexico. And Dudley says the company will focus on deepwater drilling. Jim Boulden, CNN, London.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

FOSTER: Well, elsewhere, Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader has revealed a new boardroom line up, and plans for a multibillion dollar IPO. Seventy-one year old Antarctic adventurer and former Hutchinson Whampoa CEO Simon Murray has been appointed non-executive chairman of the board. Former BP boss Tony Hayward will join as a senior independent director. They will help launch the company's public listing in Hong Kong and in London. It is expected to raise as much as, wait for it, $11 billion and become a component of the FTSE 100.

Glencore's IPO announcement comes in the same week that Goldman Sachs says commodity investments are too risky. It has dropped its recommendation to buy crude, cotton, copper and platinum. It says political unrest and natural disaster could hit demand. Oil prices are looking slightly lower. This Thursday, in fact, Brent crude is currently trading a touch under $122 a barrel. Down around half a dollar on Wednesday's close. It has been a volatile 12 months for oil, with prices ranging from $70 to $126.

John Stephenson is a commodities expert and author of "The Little Book of Commodity Investing". He joins me now, live from CNN New York.
Thank you so much joining us.

First of all, Glencore, they are making a bit of a bet here as well, aren't they? If they are right, of if Goldman Sachs is right, we are at some sort of peak on commodities. This is just the time for an IPO for a commodities trader?

JOHN STEPHENSON, AUTHOR, "THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMODITY TRADING": Well, I think that is right. I think they have done a good job, just like Goldman did a good job with their IPO, in terms of timing it at the height of the dot.com, you know, rally. And I think for Glencore, the timing is excellent. But I do believe that at least as far as Goldman's most recent call, it was a bit of a trading call. I think it is widely
viewed in the industry that we might see a pull back in the price of commodities in the short-run, but overall, it is going longer. Goldman, after all has a $200 oil handle out another year or so. So, I think they are pretty bullish on commodities overall.

FOSTER: It is interesting because they are suggesting that because prices have risen so much, actually that is taking some of the demand away. Is that something you agree with?

STEPHENSON: Well, that-there is a bit of an argument, I mean, up until this point, particularly in many commodities, we were focused on the supply side. And in the oil complex, for example, we were focus on supply disruptions, lately focusing on Libya. But now there is some evidence coming out, that Americans, for example have been driving less and the effect of $3.75 per gallon gas, has kept some cars in the garage. But I think the reality is it is still a supply driven story and I think the fundamentals, longer term are very, very positive for commodities, including all the ones that Glencore trades and Glencore produces.

FOSTER: Haven't heard much today about the huge demand from China and India, for example, but that is an ongoing trend. But I guess Goldman Sachs are looking in the more medium term, rather than the long term, right?

STEPHENSON: Yes, well, I think basically what they are saying is, look, you have had a great run in copper. You have had a great run in cotton. You have had a great run in oil. Take some bets off the table.

Page 68 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And come back, revisit this in a month or two time. And they'll go higher from there. And I think that is probably a fair call as a trading call. But longer term, you know, if you look out five to 10 years, I think this is still one sector investors want to focus on, because you have this huge demand coming from Asia, and supply is really struggling. We just heard in the, you know, before, about BP focusing on the Gulf and offshore drilling, and deep offshore. The reason is that is where the growth is going to come from. There is no other alternative and that is the supply story for very- for virtually all commodities across the board. Supply is very constrained and demand is voracious.

FOSTER: Just looking at the market dynamic. We are talking about this because it was Goldman Sachs saying it. It is still a very big player in this market, isn't it? Could that perhaps be enough to take a lot of the heat out of the market, because people will simply follow Goldman Sachs' trades?

STEPHENSON: Well, people absolutely follow Goldman Sachs' trades, and advice. And I think they are certainly a big player in it, but I think, you know, we have to look a little behind where it is coming from. And I think they have a vested interest in having you move your money from one sector to another sector. And I think also the fact remains that they are not part of the syndicate that is leading the IPO for Glencore. And I think that is, you know, in part, maybe has something to do with this. But I think, in general, Glencore is going to do very well with their IPO and commodities, in general are going to march higher from here.

FOSTER: Good stuff, thank you very much. John Stephenson, thank you for joining us, from New York. Appreciate it.

Let's have a look at the European markets now. It was all about economics, really, here. They have been on a bit of a roller coaster ride this week, of course, after rebounding from a sell off yesterday the big three are back in the red today. The worst performing index was in Athens, though, with the crisis of confidence triggering a slide of more than 2.5 percent. The cost of borrowing money grew-the cost of borrowing money grew for Greece as bond yields soared, while the cost of credit default swaps or insuring Greek bonds against default, also increased to a record high. Those are both signs that investors have little confidence
in Greece's ability to pay back its debts, as things stand. Part of the reason for that are comments by Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. An interview-in an interview with the newspaper "Develt" (ph), he implied that Greece may have to restructure its debt if an analysis in June finds that its levels of debt are unsustainable.

Now, Google is preparing to report rising earnings later today. That is another story, in New York. With anti-trust suits and Facebook snapping at its heels, we'll look at how long its golden touch can last.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: Well, in just a few hours' time, Google will release its first quarter earnings. It marks the end of an era for Google, many are saying. New CEO Guy Paige will be steering the company in coming quarters. He took over from Eric Schmidt last month who had been at the helm for 10 years. CNN's Maggie Lake joins
us now from New York.
Maggie, what is most interesting about this, today, for you?

MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, if we take a look, I think we might have a stock chart, there with you on set. But, you know, Google, we are used to them having great profits. But the stock has been going down ever since CEO Eric Schmidt announced that he was going to step aside
as CEO. It is sort of an interesting dynamic. It seems to be falling out of favor with investors. So, today I talked to a veteran journalist, Steven Levy, who has a new book out about Google called, "In The Plex". And I asked him, when Schmidt stepped aside he famously Tweeted, "Day to day adult supervision no longer needed." But did he think that Larry Paige was really ready to run this company?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVEN LEVY, AUTHOR, "IN THE PLEX": The test really is, whether he is going to not only do the strategic, product oriented stuff, that we know he's going to do. We know he is a smart guy, we know he has a great vision of the future. But whether he is also going to take on the other side of the CEO. You know, Google's public perception is as much a product and is important a product for Google, as it goes forward and negotiates regulatory problems, privacy criticisms, and things like that. So, Larry has to step up, not only in terms of coming up with great products and great vision, and taking on Facebook. But he has to be able to make people feel OK about Google and not be scared of it.
LAKE: There is a sense from some, that Google has peaked. What did you see from your time inside? LEVY: The thing about Google is, I actually think they have a shot at taking on this innovator dilemma.
Where a company dominates in one area and then the next power line comes a long and they are really
challenged to be as innovative in the next round. And I think the thing that is going for them is that Larry, in
Page 69 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
particular, looks far head and he is making a big bet on artificial intelligence, and pushing Google's mission to the farthest definition that you could, which is of course gathering, making accessible all the world's information there.

It is no means assured. And in the short-term they have a big challenge in the social space with Facebook, but I think they have a shot.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

LAKE: You know it is interesting, Max, I asked about this issue of privacy, of you know, privacy of-anti-trust people now looking at Google now that they are so big. I said, do they realize that they have this target on them? That people are looking at them closely? And he said, intellectually they do, but in their bones, in their hearts, they still sort of think of themselves as the little guy, as the underdog. And that people understand they want to do good. That their intentions are good and therefore they are going to get a little slack then. Really interesting insight. This guy has spent a lot of time with them, they are not a company or people that are easy to get access to. So, really interesting stuff. I'm going to blog about it tomorrow and it will be interesting to see how investors react, if Larry gets on that investor, leads the call, and how they react to his leadership. It is going to be crucial for Google.

FOSTER: OK, stay there for a minute Maggie, because I'm going to bring in that chart that you were referring to. Because shares of Google, which has beat Wall Street profit targets. So, for the past seven of the past eight consecutive quarters they are actually down more than 8 percent and that is since the company announced in January that Paige would be come CEO.

Let's have a look at the charts. Here you go. And we'll show you point at which that announcement came. It is actually right, here. So, there was an initial dip down. Then it came back up, then it went back down again.

Maggie, it is all about confidence, isn't it? Because Google, for many people, is still a unique company. So it is hard to value.

LAKE: It is about confidence and how he will lead the company. And, Max, it is also about where they are going to go from here. A lot of people have been concerned about the fact that Google has really made a misstep and has fallen behind in the area of social. You hear people say, Google doesn't do social. Facebook has got a lot of users, a lot of information, and information is power. So that is a short-term challenge for them. Are they going to be able to get over that? Are they going to be able to regain some of that growth momentum that we had.

One of our colleagues at CNNMoney had a very nice line in an article he did. He said it is no longer a growth company, but it is not a value company. It is kind of in no-man's land for investors. So, Google has to kind of win people over and get them to believe in their vision of the future and that they can achieve growth.

Again, Steven Levy has some interesting thoughts on that when it came to artificial intelligence. We will be talking more about that over the next 24 hours, but they have a lot to prove to investors, Max.
FOSTER: Maggie, thank you very much indeed.

Now, another tech stock to watch is HP. It's share fell today along with many of its rivals on news that PC shipments are declining. CEO Leo Apotheker still has plenty of plans to keep up with the competition, though. He spoke to CNNMoney's senior editor Adam Lashinsky.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ADAM LASHINSKY, CNNMONEY.COM: Talk a little bit about your competition with Cisco. With Cisco retrenching, as we speak, they are getting out of the flip video business. They seem to have-they seem to be acknowledging that maybe they made a mistake getting into the consumer business in the first place. You compete with Cisco on their making servers. You bought 3COMM so you are making networking devices. What is the state of that competition?

LEO APOTHEKER, CEO, HEWLETT-PACKARD: Well, we were in the networking business before that. And we bought three companies to strengthen our offer. And the networking business and HP is a very, very strong business. It is growing double digits every quarter. We are doing, very, very well. We are getting market share every quarter, significantly. And we are probably one of the reasons why Cisco is retrenching. So that competition is going strong. I think we have-we are in a much better position than, unfortunately, for Cisco, they are in. We don't see them that much in the server business. They see us much more in the networking side of the house. And given the innovation that we are putting into this, I think they will see us even more.

Page 70 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LASHINKSY: Conventional wisdom, certainly among investors, would that your predecessor Mark Hurd, was able to do very well with earnings at Hewlett-Packard, by cutting costs, which had the knock on affect of hurting morale, at the company-at least, again, that is the conventional wisdom. Can you have it both ways? Does it take money to improve moral. And does that hurt the expense side of the company?
APOTHEKER: Success is the best recipe for moral. And therefore we are focusing on being successful
first. For that, you need to make some investments in order to be relevant. That doesn't mean that you don't
want to be very cost conscious. That means that you want to be very efficient. Means you want to be very
effective. But you can't just cut yourself to- you just can't cut a business to salvation, it doesn't work. There
comes a moment where you have to create some value. We are about creating value some value in the
most efficient way possible.
By the way, there are still a lot of inefficiencies that we can deal with inside HP. LASHINSKY: What is an example of that?
APOTHEKER: When it comes to quality, for example. We have to be better in quality. When it comes to innovation we need to bring innovation much faster to market. That is all efficiency that we can drive. And we are driving that. And there are programs in place to address these in a very, very straightforward manner. So I'm very much committed to that. People respond very well to that, to these ideas. They rise to the challenge. We have great people in HP, globally. And I believe that you will see HP coming out of its corner, swinging.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

FOSTER: Now, the head of the U.S. air traffic control agency has resigned after several planes had to land without the help of an air traffic controller. Scary stuff. It is even more scary when you consider that they were actually asleep, that story, after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: Well, there is a new job opening high up at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Hank Grabowski, head of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization, has stepped down. If follows the sixth incident this year of controllers sleeping on the job. From Washington, Samantha Hayes has more.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Inside the control tower at the Reno-Tahoe Airport early Wednesday morning, seven calls came in from a pilot trying to land a Life Flight plane with a sick patient onboard. But no answer, according to a government source.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are not answering the phone line either. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to need to land.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Landing will be at your own risk.
HAYES: The FAA says the controller was asleep and out of communication for about 16 minutes.

RAY LAHOOD, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: This is ridiculous. It is outrageous. It is the kind of behavior that we will not stand for at the Department of Transportation. The controller has been suspended. We are conducting a investigation.

HAYES: The FAA also said the official in charge of operating the air traffic control system has resigned, after this, the latest case of a controller sleeping on the job. Airport officials say the controller fell asleep during what is usually a low traffic time of day.

KRYS BART, CEO, RENO-TAHOE AIRPORT AUTHORITY : We have very light traffic at 2:00 a.m. We are a 24/7 operation and open to any aircraft that want to land or take off at any hour of the day or night. However, during the night we typically have very little traffic.

HAYES: The FAA says the controller is suspended as the agency investigates. And meanwhile, the government is assigning an additional controller to 27 airports where currently only one person is staffed during the midnight shift.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is from Nevada, raised the issue on Capitol Hill, Wednesday. SEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV): This shouldn't happen in Nevada. It shouldn't happen anywhere in our
country. It shouldn't happen in any airplane. And it certainly shouldn't happen in an air ambulance.

FOSTER: Now a different view on the U.S. debt debate is just 30 minutes away. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is on PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT, giving his view on President Obama's economic plans, and latest political polls, much more. Piers will also be joined by Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg. That is at
8:00 p.m. in London, 9:00 in Berlin, only here on CNN.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER: Welcome back. I'm Max Foster.
You're watching QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Let's check the headlines this hour.
Libyan state TV says civilians were killed in NATO air strikes on Tripoli earlier on Thursday. Sources showing a defiant Moammar Gadhafi in public for the first time in days. The latest strikes come as NATO's secretary-general asks for more precision fighter jets to avoid civilian deaths.

Tunisian authorities want to try former President Zine Abidine Ben Ali on 18 different charges, including manslaughter and drug trafficking. The justice minister says he's looking at ways to legally extradite Ben Ali from Saudi Arabia. That's where he fled in January after an uprising that inspired others in the Arab world.

Russia says the U.N. should have remained neutral in the crisis in Ivory Coast. News agencies quote President Dmitry Medvedev saying the body should mediate between the parties. The U.N. said it was protecting civilians when it attacked positions held by soldiers loyal to former President Lauren Gbagbo.
Angry protests here in London at BP's first annual general meeting since the massive Gulf oil spill. Around
100 people came out to show their anger at the company and one was ejected from the conference hall.
BP head, Bob Dudley, said the firm is working hard to earn trust back.

The world's top emerging economies have laid out their plans to chip away at the dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency. In a joint statement after the BRICS summit in China, Brazil, Russia, India, China and newcomer, South Africa, said the international monetary system needs an overhaul. The five countries have now agreed to work toward using their own local currencies when lending money to each other.
And they've also pledged more action on inflation and rising commodity prices in particular. The BRICS
nations also criticized the use of force by countries intervening in Libya and the rest of the Arab world.
It was a solid display of unity by the five countries at their first summit.

As Eunice Yoon reports, the BRICS nations are hoping to earn themselves as much -- a much greater role in the way the world is run.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

EUNICE YOON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On the small Chinese island of Hainan, a summit of five big developing nations -- the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa met to coordinate policy, paving the way to one day become a voice for the developing world.

DILMA ROUSSEFF, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a group that wishes to see a solidarity-based international order, solidarity taken to mean the ability to promote prosperity.

YOON: Together, they're known as the BRICS -- emerging nations banning together to act as a counterweight to the wealthier West. At this year's summit, BRICS leaders talked economic issues, calling for greater say at international institutions like the World Bank and a need to calm volatile commodity prices
-- a potential threat to their growth.

(on camera): Until now, the summit has been focused on the global economy. But now there's been a shift where these countries want to have more influence in political affairs.

DMITRY MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Our economic potential, our political opportunities and prospects of development as a group of countries are, in this sense, unique and they break new horizons.

YOON: South Africa joined the talks for the first time as the newest member, harshly criticizing the use of force in Libya, despite voting in favor of a no-fly zone at the UN. Other BRIC nations abstained.

JACOB ZUMA, SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT: We underscored our support for multilateralism and the United Nations system, but are also agreed on the need for the reform of the United Nations, including the U.N. Security Council.

YOON: While the leaders here were unified in their opposition to military force in Libya, experts say these nations are so different, that it's difficult to get them to come out with clear, unified positions on many matters. For example, countries like Brazil have been highly critical of China, saying Beijing keeps the value of its currency artificially low.
But the yuan was left out of discussions here.
(on camera): Well, how do you feel about the Chinese currency? Isn't it harmful to Brazil?
LUCIANO COUTINHO, PRESIDENT, BRAZILIAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK: No, I don't think
Brazil has to take care of himself and not count on others to solve its own problems.

YOON: Instead, the leaders criticized the current monetary system, which is dominated by the U.S. dollar. These leaders will meet again in India next year for more discussions and another chance to move their agendas forward.

ANAND SHARMA, INDIAN COMMERCE MINISTER: This platform, as such, can make a significant and defining contribution to the global architecture as the world is seeing a major shift.
YOON: Driven by the rise in wealth of the developing world. Eunice Yoon, CNN, Sanya, China.

FOSTER: While South Africa was formally welcomed into the BRICS fold in that leaders' joint statement, not everyone is convinced by the newest addition to the club there.
Robyn Curnow explains what South Africa will offer the BRICS. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ROBYN CURNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): South Africa's Durbin Harbor is one of the busiest and biggest in Africa. It's a gateway to the rest of the continent, a point that South Africa's diplomats emphasized as they negotiated entry this year into the BRIC club of emerging economies.

With one billion people, an emerging middle class and the third fastest growing region in the world, Africa is a market that can't be ignored, say the South Africans.
MAITE NKOANA-MASHABANE, SOUTH AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS MINISTER: South
Africa runs the biggest and the most diverse economy on the South -- on the African soil.
CURNOW: She says South Africa has lots to offer.
NKOANA-MASHABANE: South Africa has mineral resources that are exploitable now, because of our
(INAUDIBLE) infrastructure, worth $2.6 trillion. So we're not coming bare-handed.

CURNOW: But even taking into consideration its gold, diamonds, platinum and other mineral riches, many believe South Africa just doesn't belong in the elite club of powerful emerging economies -- muscle flexing countries that should account for 3 to 5 percent of global GDP, says the man who coined the phrase, "BRIC."

JIM O'NEILL, GOLDMAN SACHS: South Africa doesn't even come close to - - to certainly not the BRICS. The South African economy, what, $350 billion, is -- is .5 a percent of global GDP.
CURNOW: So then why has this small economy at the southern tip of Africa leap-frogged over better BRIC
candidates like Mexico or Turkey or Indonesia?

(on camera): South Africa and its new BRIC partners argue that it's a political choice, not an economic one. The diplomats lobbied hard for membership, arguing that a new global political order is emerging with

power shifting away from the West. They say that Brazil, Russia, India and China need South Africa's stature as a strong democracy in Africa if they're to create a new bargaining bloc for the developing world.

(voice-over): Even though the harbors and highways, rail links and airports provide a strategic link to the economic spoils in the rest of the continent, it's South Africa's moral weight on the world stage, after a successful transition to democracy, that seems to have sealed their entry into the elite club of global powerhouses.
Robyn Curnow, CNN, Johannesburg, South Africa. (END VIDEO TAPE)
FOSTER: Well, coming up, a soap opera with an unhappy ending -- a laundry  detergent cartel gets smashed by price-fixing watchdogs. We'll tell you who wasn't whiter than white, after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: Two of the world's biggest consumer giants have been hit with combined  fines of nearly half a billion dollars after a price-fixing case that gives new meaning to the phrase money laundering. European regulators found that Procter & Gamble, which makes washing powders like Dash and Unilever, which is behind brands like Purcell (ph), fixed laundry  detergent  prices around Europe for years. Procter & Gamble have been fined more than $300 million. Univer -- Unilever has to pay around half that amount.
I spoke to the European competition commissioner, Joaquin Alumnia. And I asked -- I started by asking him how the  cartel was uncovered. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JOAQUIN ALMUNIA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION: We discovered it when one of the companies involved, company Hankel, came to the  commission with the information about the existence of the  cartel and the very useful information to figure out how do these  cartel was working during the more than three years.
FOSTER: How was it working? How were prices being fixed?
What sort of agreements were being reached?

ALMUNIA: So they use an opportunity that is the result trade association was launching an environmental problem to reduce the size and the -- the components of the packages of the washing powder. And they can say well, this is a good opportunity to distribute our market shares, not to compete among themselves and to maintain, to keep the prices even if the size of the packages were reduced.
FOSTER: So they were agreeing not to compete in certain geographic areas? ALMUNIA: Yes, in eight member states of the European Union.
FOSTER: And how was this agreed?
Was it agreed amongst executives in hotels? how was it agreed?

ALMUNIA: Well, I don't know about the details. But their representatives of the three companies that are very important ones, Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. They managed to agree the distribution of the market shares and their agreement to maintain prices and even, during the duration of the  cartel, at one moment, they decided to increase prices at the same time.

FOSTER: They obviously agreed to this  fine because it was lower than it would be if you continued the investigation.
Why did you bail out of the investigation earlier?
Why not go all the way and give them a proper  fine that would really punish them?

ALMUNIA: So, we -- we had notice of the existence of the  cartel and of the activities of the  cartel thanks to one of the companies, to Henkel. The others also cooperated, given the evidences that were in our offices. And at one moment, because there was no possibility to deny the evidence and they accepted the
existence of these illegal activities, they accepted a settlement and this had allowed us to adopt a decision

Page 74 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
less than three years after we started our activities, our inspections, that this is a shorter duration than in other cartel investigations that takes longer.

And because of the settlement, because of their acceptance of the existence of a cartel, of an illegal activity and because of their cooperation, the -- the settlement implies that the fines are reduced in 10 percent.
FOSTER: It doesn't really reflect how much they gained from it, though, does it?

ALMUNIA: Well, we don't calculate how they gain. What we intend with our  fines in the cases of  cartels or of anti-trust infringement in general is to deter. So we try to convince the companies that they will not be involved anymore in these kind of activities.

And, in fact, I have the satisfaction to say that these companies, after the existence of the  cartel and the -- our investigations, they have tightened their internal rules so as to avoid, in the future, the repetition of these kind of activities.
FOSTER: And what does this mean to the viewers, then?
Does this mean that washing powder will become cheaper in Europe?

ALMUNIA: Well, it means at least that even if the size of the package have been reduced, the prices will not be maintained, that we will pay in proportion of what we want to buy.
(END VIDEO TAPE)
FOSTER: Well, there you are. A fascinating story.

Meanwhile, a massive sandstorm encompassing over 300,000 square kilometers of the Arabian Peninsula is racing across the Middle East. It's scary stuff.
Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri is at the CNN International Weather Center following that story -- Pedram. PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Max.
Sandstorms, you know, typically, you head your way from March into April and also the latter portion of the year. We have these winter storms that cruise right on through and pick up a lot of sand and have caused a lot of problems out there across portions of the Middle East.

And I just want to show you what it looks like from space, going from Bartard (ph) south toward Kuwait. And you can see this area that we talked about. Over 300,000 square kilometers of coverage of just a massive dome of sand here moving its way toward Kuwait. And then you break it down and you calculate it, that's equal to roughly the size of Germany.

This area of sand is beginning to move in. Now, of course, we've got millions of grains of sand that are moving in at 50, 60, 70 kilometers per hour. That's going to cause some respiratory issues for the folks out there. Some schools, we know, have been closed across portions of Iran and also some travel difficulties out there.

But the sand right now on track to work its way toward portions of the UAE. So from Abu Dhabi toward Dubai, you're going to see plenty of strong wind gusts and also a lot of sand working its way toward that region.

And some video to share with you coming out of areas of Kuwait. This is what it looked like. An iReporter sent us this phenomenal video. It shows you how dangerous it is to be out on the roads because within a moment's notice, you can have visibility go from one or two kilometers to right there to zero, where you can't see anything in front of you.

And I've actually driven through a sandstorm and it's among the serious things you can do, because right just like that, you lose everything you have as far as visibility is concerned and it becomes very dangerous. And, again, this is going to shift south and into Southern Iran over the next 24 hours. And, again, switching back the graphics, I'll show you what's going on.

Here you go. The winds, the current winds around portions of Abu Dhabi at about 20 or so kilometers per hour. Notice the green numbers. That's visibilities right there, reduced around areas of Doha there in Qatar. But work your way south toward Abu Dhabi and also Dubai, visibility is right now at about 10 or so kilometers. That's going to reduced. So if you have travel plans out there, you've got to keep that in mind. We're certainly going to see some travel difficulties in and out of the UAE.

Page 75 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And take a look at the what's happening over in Europe. We do have high pressure trying to extend out, so across portions of the UK there around Ireland, we're going to see partly cloudy skies. The storm systems have all moved to the south here, so your weekend plans look pretty nice across the northern fringes and the northwest corner there of Europe.

But again, the storms are going to shift to the south and bring some showers toward that region and eventually a little bit of a warming trend as we get back up close to seasonal temperatures for this time of year, which is about 13 or 14 degrees, say, for areas around London. And that's going to be the pattern, Max, after a few clouds roll by in the next couple of days and keep you partly cloudy out there.
So not too bad across Europe. FOSTER: OK, Pedram.
Good news.
Thank you very much, indeed.

Now, we spend years racking them up and hours on the phone trying to get the best deals. For frequent fliers, air miles are the world's most important currency.
But would you take a completely needless flight just to get more?
As Poppy Harlow finds out, there are some travelers who take air miles very seriously. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
POPPY HARLOW, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: How many miles have you flown in your life? RANDY PETERSEN, FOUNDER, FLYERTALK: I raise my hand -- 17 million.
HARLOW: What? PETERSEN: Yes, 17 million.
HARLOW: Didn't George Clooney fly like a million in "Up in the Air". PETERSEN: He ain't got -- he ain't got nothing on me.
HARLOW (voice-over): Imagine flying for fun. It sounds crazy to most, given the delays, cancellations and security hassles. But to some, like Randy Petersen, it's well worth it to rack up the miles on so-called mileage runs.

RICK SEANEY, CEO, FARECOMPARE.COM: A mileage run is really just a mechanism to do one of two things -- earn the most miles for the cheapest amount of money and then you take those miles and redeem them for something really valuable later on.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You want to go from Point A to Point B, but you want to go in as much -- a roundabout fashion as you possibly can, leave in the morning, hop all around, pick up 10,000 or 15,000 miles.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, National to Atlanta, Atlanta to Seattle, Seattle to Detroit, Detroit to Houston, Houston to Atlanta, Atlanta to Seattle, Seattle to Detroit, Detroit to Nashville, and then I drive home from Nashville.
HARLOW: On FlyerTalk.com, people post and search for the cheapest mileage runs with the most miles. BARBARA KESSLER, FREQUENT FLIER: We are flier talkers.
HARLOW: Barbara Kessler is a self-employed attorney who flies, well, just for the sake of flying and racks up hundreds of thousands of miles a year. KESSLER: Some people like to go shopping all day. I will go to California for lunch and meet friends. I went to Disneyland and met friends and spent the day at Disneyland.
HARLOW: One day? KESSLER: Yes.



Page 76 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HARLOW (voice-over): Kessler even flies from New York City to Hawaii more than she goes to Midtown Manhattan, just 20 blocks from her apartment. The key, experts say, is paying less than two cents per mile and redeeming them for much more.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you want anything else? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well...
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Water? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: White wine.
HARLOW: But with hefty mileage bonuses from credit card offers, the currency of sorts is being devalued and award tickets can be harder to come by. But the perks are still there.

SEANEY: If you like to travel, you know, and get upgraded, if you want to be the first person to board the plane so you can actually have some bin space, so that's where miles come in.
HARLOW (on camera): Do you have to be rich to be a flier talker?

KESSLER: Not at all. I have seen places that I could not afford. I -- I've stayed for weeks in Paris for less than seven euros.

PETERSEN: I've been to the Great Wall of China. I've been to the ballet in Moscow. I've been to -- on safari in South Africa. And I've eaten shrimp on the barbie in Australia all because of miles.
HARLOW: Not bad if you don't mind the long journey getting there. In New York, Poppy Harlow reporting.

FOSTER: Now, we're royal wedding fashion hunting next. And it's not just about the dresses, you know. Prince William needs a uniform that's fit for a king. I'll show you how much that costs from no less than his tailor in just a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: There is plenty of speculation over Kate Middleton's dress ahead of the royal wedding, but what about William?

We know he's gone for a uniform, but we don't know which one, while I did find out, though, from his tailor is that dressing to impress on the big day doesn't come cheap.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

FOSTER (voice-over): Savile Row -- for centuries, home to Britain's  finest tailors. At Number One sits Gieves & Hawkes, where, for the right price, you can be dressed to fit into any social setting. Special guests are invited upstairs, where Prince William and other royals have their fittings.

(on camera): Well, you can expect to see a few uniforms at the wedding because that's traditional for members of the military. But you'll also notice a uniform of sorts for other male guests.
Andrew, pleased to meet you.
ANDREW GOLDBERT, GIEVES & HAWKES: Hello. FOSTER: General manager of tailoring here.
And this is what we call a morning dress, isn't it? This is what most guests will be wearing?
GOLDBERT: That's correct. This is -- for formal wedding occasions, this is what you would wear. FOSTER: OK. So take us through it.
GOLDBERT: Well, here you have the morning coat and also the trousers. The morning coat would be originally worn as a -- a riding coat...


Page 77 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FOSTER: Yes.
GOLDBERT: -- for gentlemen riding their horses... FOSTER: In the morning.
GOLDBERT: -- in the morning. FOSTER: OK.
GOLDBERT: And -- and moving on, we have the trousers, pleated, striped. The stripe has cashmere in them for comfort, but, also, you would wear them with braces to make sure the trousers are well supported.

And the way to go for yourself, we would suggest a double-breasted, although you could wear a single-breasted.
FOSTER: If someone is feeling particularly daring, it -- could they turn up in a regular suit? Could they turn up with something quite (INAUDIBLE)?
GOLDBERT: The groom usually sets the tone of the wedding. So he is wearing a morning dress suit as such.
FOSTER: Or a military uniform?
GOLDBERT: Or a uniform. That is what you would wear.
FOSTER: And it would be a bit of a faux pas, I guess, if they went in something different? GOLDBERT: It would be. Yes.
FOSTER: Embarrassing?
GOLDBERT: It would be embarrassing, I think, yes.
FOSTER: OK, then Andrew, let's put it to the test. And as if by magic, I'm ready for the wedding. Andrew, what does this look say to you?
It certainly feels really -- really proper, I have to say.

GOLDBERT: It says your dressed for the occasion. It's a solemn occasion so the idea is that you should look and feel different than any other normal day.
FOSTER: And in terms of costs, what are we talking here?
GOLDBERT: If we were making this for you on the spot, we'd be looking at right about $8,000. FOSTER: It can quickly go up from there, though, can't it?
GOLDBERT: It certainly can. But we leave that to the client to choose. FOSTER: Fifty thousand dollars?
Sixty thousand?
GOLDBERT: It certainly can, yes. FOSTER: Andrew, thank you very much. GOLDBERT: A pleasure.
(END VIDEO TAPE)
FOSTER: And more than that, I heard.

The only thing I'm missing at this point is the wedding invite, but I'm sure it's going to come. You know, I'm just elated by it -- a cancellation guest, maybe.
Anyway, after the break, we'll have a look at the markets for you.


Page 78 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
FOSTER: Now, let's have a look at the markets.

The markets in Asia finished mostly lower this session. Tokyo's Nikkei was the only index to post gains. Resource and property stocks dragged Hong Kong's main benchmark lower.
Mining stocks were some of the losers there in Sydney.

Reminding you of the day's numbers across Europe, after a rebound session on Wednesday, it was another down day, really, for the major indices here. Paris, the worst off, with a loss of almost 1 percent. A lack of confidence in Greece's ability to avoid defaulting on its debt has hurt banking stocks in particular.
We'll bring you these European markets in a moment.

As we said earlier, the bond markets are piling on the pressure after comments by Germany's finance minister.

Barring some decent gains tomorrow, all three of the indices look like they'll actually end the week with losses.

As for across the Atlantic, let's check in one last time on the Dow. It's recovered from early losses. The Dow fell more than 100 points at one stage, down slightly now, but hardly moved. Financial stocks have been weighing the markets down. Shares in banks and technology companies also falling today.

We'll keep an eye out for Google's earnings reports. That's what everyone was talking about today. Those due out after the closing bell. That's in around an hour's time. But we'll bring it to you on CNN.

Now, there is a lot of activity over in Washington, meanwhile, on Capitol Hill right now, but it seems as if the buildup to the excitement wasn't quite enough to keep one Democratic leader awake. The vice president of the United States couldn't keep his eyes open during President Obama's speech on Wednesday night. He appeared to be dozing during parts of the president's remarks.
Maybe he was just concentrating. Maybe we're being unfair.
The president said Biden will head up deficit reduction negotiations with both parties beginning in early
May.
Definitely a bit sleepy, I would say. That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. I'm Max Foster in London.
"PIERS MORGAN" just ahead.
First, though, John will join us with a check of the headlines. END

LP
UNILEVER and Procter & Gamble (P&G), the consumer goods giants, have been  fined €315.2m
(£280m) for their involvement in a pan-European price-fixing ring.

The European  Commission (EC) found that the two companies, together with Germany's Henkel, had colluded to fix the price of washing powder in eight continental European countries between January 2002 and March 2005.

TD
Unilever has agreed to pay €104m and P&G €211m following the investigation which was launched
in June 2008. The scale of the  fines reflects the size of the groups' businesses in the eight countries.

Henkel was spared a fine after it informed the EC of the  cartel's existence. P&G's  fine was reduced by 50pc after it co-operated with the EC's investigation, with Unilever receiving a 25pc reduction after subsequently also co-operating.

"Companies should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly," said Joaquín Almunia, the EC vice-president who oversees competition.

A Unilever spokesman said no one had been fired as a consequence of the EC investigation but that a number of staff had left in the interim.

The EC said the  cartel was formed after the three companies worked together to improve the environmental impact of their products. "The environmental objective, however, did not require them to co-ordinate prices or other anti-competitive practices. Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative," the EC said.

Unilever said it had since strengthened compliance procedures. The company, which had already made a provision against a possible  fine, saw its share price rise 13p to £19.28.

P&G said in a statement: "We confirm that the European  Commission has reached a settlement with a number of detergent  manufacturers on matters that date back to between six and nine years ago and is solely focused on some countries within Europe.

"We have routinely reported on this case every quarter for the last three years, previously taken an appropriate financial reserve and have already strengthened our global compliance programme."

The European Union’s competition authority has  finedUnilever and Procter & Gamble a total amount

of 315.2 million Euros ($456 million) for fixing the prices for powdered laundry  detergent,  together with

TD
German company Henkel, across eight EU countries. However, the authority has not put any penalty on
Henkel, the company which informed the European  Commission about the alliance in laundry
detergent.
After Unilever and P&G agreed to the fact that they were the part of the  cartel, which continued for three years (January 2002 until March 2005)and cooperated with the investigation, the  Commission eased out their penalties by 10 per cent each. The three companies operated the alliance for the
purpose of
stabilising their market position in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
Netherlands.

HD         Washing powder cartel fined for price-fixing eco products

Shoppers looking for laundry powder are presented with a bewildering array of deals and offers, but a market that appears to offer a myriad of choices for getting clothes clean has been sullied after it emerged that three of its giants have been colluding on prices.

Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been  fined a total of €315.2 million (£281 million) by the European Commission for fixing the price of laundry  detergents. The penalty relates to a period between January 2002 and March 2005 when the companies, with Henkel of Germany, which blew the whistle on the price-fixing agreement, encouraged consumers to switch from old-style washing
powders to concentrated, eco-friendly versions.

TD
The Commission said that Europe's biggest producers of washing powders had formed a  cartel that co-ordinated prices during the period. It covered sales in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. No evidence of pricefixing was found in Britain.

Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner, said: "Companies should be under no illusion that the Commission will pursue its relentless fight against  cartels."

He said that the price-fixing had begun when the companies were working to make their  detergents more environmentally friendly. They agreed to make their packages smaller without decreasing prices and, later, to raise prices while keeping the size of their packages the same.

The brands involved include Ariel, made by Procter & Gamble, Skip, Unilever's biggest laundry detergent  brand in Europe, and Persil, which is sold by Henkel in most of the countries concerned, although it is owned by Unilever in other markets including Britain and Ireland.

Procter & Gamble was  fined €211.2 million, while Unilever was  fined €104 million. Both companies had their fines reduced because they admitted taking part in the price-fixing and voluntarily disclosed information to the investigation.

Unilever said: "All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives." The company has made provision for a settlement in its 2010 results.

P&G said: "We have already taken the appropriate internal action, including strengthening our global compliance programme, which includes extensive training, reinforcement of key policies and regular auditing."

Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, the chief compliance officer at Henkel, said that the company had uncovered the pricefixing in internal audits in 2008.

"We had to acknowledge evidence of misconduct by employees in several Western European countries. We have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner," he said.

HD      European Union: EU Fines Two Companies  for Fixing  Detergent Prices

Section: General News - Iranian European regulators are fining two consumer product firms $456 million for fixing the price of powdered laundry  detergents in eight countries.

The European  Commission on Wednesday fined U.S.-based Procter & Gamble $306 million and the British-Dutch firm Unilever $150 million for fixing soap prices between 2002 and early 2005. Regulators said a third firm, Germany's Henkel, participated in the  cartel, but escaped any  fine because it divulged the scheme.

TD
The EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said the  cartel started when the three companies discussed how to cut down on the size of  detergent  packages as an environmental concern. But he said the competitors used the talks to agree on market share and that prices would not be cut even if the packages were smaller.

The EU said the  cartel covered sales in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

The three companies are the leading powdered laundry detergent  sellers in Europe. Procter & Gamble sells Tide and Ariel brands, while Unilever sells Omo and Surf detergents. Henkel owns the Persil brand in most of Europe. - VOA

CONSUMER products giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble were yesterday  fined a total of
?315.2million (£280million) for fixing washing powder prices in eight European countries.
Anglo-Dutch Unilever will pay ?104million under a settlement reached with the European
Commission while US Ariel maker P&G is set to pay ?211.2million.

TD
The pair colluded over prices for more than three years from early 2002 when, along with Germany's Henkel, they encouraged consumers to switch from oldstyle powder to more concentrated powders.

Henkel, which sells Persil in some of the countries concerned although the brand is owned by Unilever in the UK, avoided a  fine after alerting European regulators to the  cartel in laundry detergent  in 2008.

The arrangement covered sales in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. No evidence of price fixing was found in the UK market.

Both Unilever and P&G had their  fines reduced by 10 per cent for admitting their part in the price fixing and disclosing information voluntarily to the  commission to speed up the investigation.

CONSUMER goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been slapped with  fines totalling
£280.5m after they colluded to fix the price of washing machine  detergent  powder.

The European  Commission said the two companies and rival Henkel shared information about pricing in eight countries when they worked together on an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of their products.

TD
The Commission finedUnilever, whose UK brands include Surf, £92.6m and P&G, which makes
Ariel, £188m after reductions for co-operating with the investigation.
Henkel was let off a  fine after it blew the whistle to the regulator.

The three companies admitted that the  cartel existed in eight European countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands - between January 7, 2002 and March
8, 2005.

They were working together on environmental measures, including a scheme to produce concentrated powder to reduce packaging, but they also shared financial information, said the EC.

A spokesman for Unilever said the company has strengthened its internal compliance programme and all key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules.

BANKING
IMF cautions that some
EU banks are on shaky ground

BERLIN - The International Monetary Fund says some European banks are still on shaky ground despite measures taken to ward off another financial crisis. An IMF report says more needs to be done to strengthen the banking system. That could include weaker banks raising more capital reserves from reserves or from governments. Wednesday's report says banks with thin financial buffers are "caught in a maelstrom of interlinked pressures that are intensifying risks for the system as a whole." It says banks

that have lost access to sustainable financing include nearly all those in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, along with smaller Spanish savings banks and some German regional banks. Those banks depend on emergency financing from the European Central Bank and some forms of short-term borrowing.

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators  fined consumer products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of 315.2 million euros ($439.5 million Canadian) on Wednesday for fixing prices of powdered laundry  detergent  together with Henkel in eight EU countries.
Germany's Henkel AG escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

TD
U.S.-based Procter & Gamble Co. must pay 211.2 million euros ($294 million), while British-Dutch company Unilever NV was  fined 104 million euros ($145 million). Both companies had their  fines reduced because they agreed to settle the case with the  commission and co-operated with the investigation.

The three firms are the leading producers in Europe, the  commission said. Unileverdetergents include OMO and Radiant; Procter & Gamble produces Ariel and Tide; while Henkel owns the Persil brand. In the U.K. and Ireland, Persil is sold by Unilever.
The cartel was started when the companies were in joint talks on how to reduce packaging, said
Joaquin Almunia, the union's competition commissioner.

"They used this environmental initiative to agree on market share and to agree on not reducing the prices even if the packages were smaller," he said.

The cartel lasted from January 2002 until March 2005 and covered Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, the EU said.

Unilever said the fine falls below provisions already made in the company's 2010 results. "Unilever believes it is in the best interests of the company for Unilever and the  commission to have
reached this settlement," it said in a statement.

Procter & Gamble said the  fine was not a surprise and it had put away money for it in recent earnings reports. "It's our policy to comply with the letter and spirit of all laws everywhere we do business," spokesman Paul Fox said. The  detergent  case is the third  cartel case the commission has settled this year.

HD          Sales still up despite rising  gas prices

LP
Retailers held on to sales gains in March despite the recent spike in gas prices, according to government data released Wednesday.

The Commerce Department reported that shoppers pulled out their wallets for discretionary purchases such as electronics, furniture and apparel - a finding many economists interpreted as a signal of consumer health. Excluding volatile categories such as automobiles, gasoline and building materials, retailers posted a 0.4 percent gain in March compared with the previous month.

TD
There were also some warning signs: That increase was the smallest this year. Sales at gas stations jumped 2.6 percent in one of the biggest spikes in any category. Spending on cars and at online retailers and department stores all declined.
"There's a clear slowdown in the growth in spending in March," said Steve Blitz, senior economist for
ITG Investment Research. "The devil and the angel are in the detail."

Some economists have been worried that the recent run-up in fuel prices could force consumers to reduce spending in other areas - a move that could set back the nation's economic recovery. Though the average price for a gallon of regular gas has yet to surpass its high in 2008 of $4.11, a recent Gallup poll found that consumers expect prices at the pump to surpass that this year. Meanwhile, 71 percent of shoppers surveyed by consulting firm Deloitte said higher gas prices would prompt them to trim their budgets.

So far, there has been more frustration than frugality. Clothing stores rang up a 0.6 percent increase in March sales compared with the previous month. Sales at electronics and appliance stores jumped 2.1 percent, perhaps buoyed by the release of the iPad 2. And sales of home furnishings, which have languished since the collapse of the real estate market, soared 3.6 percent.

"This is a good report since it indicates consumers are still spending despite all the problems they are facing," said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight.

Some of the strength in consumer spending can be attributed to the broader recovery. The economy added 216,000 jobs in March, according to government data, and the unemployment rate ticked down
to 8.8 percent. That could be making consumers feel more comfortable about dipping into their savings. Also, this year's payroll tax cut may have padded shoppers' pocketbooks.

Economists and retailers are eyeing April as a more accurate litmus test of consumers' health. Several technical quirks might be clouding last month's numbers: Snowy weather in January might have pushed many retail sales into February, making results that month seem stronger. Meanwhile, this year's late Easter might be throwing off calculations for March.

Even more important will be the length of time that gas prices remain elevated. Though shoppers have absorbed the spike for now, many will eventually have to make tough choices.

"If there was nothing else going on in the world, then you could just end the story right there," Blitz said. "March is a little bit of a caution flag."

US Uncut, a group protesting corporate tax issues and government service cutbacks, claimed responsibility for a fake news release that said General Electric would return a "$3.2 billion tax refund."

The Associated Press published a story based on the release, part of US Uncut's effort to press companies to pay their taxes, group spokesman Andrew Boyd said in an interview. US Uncut cooperated on execution of the fake release with a group known as the Yes Men that has been involved in similar hoaxes.

"By pretending GE did the right thing by re-gifting their tax refund, we hold them accountable to that better future," Boyd said. "People are moving very fast and are going to reprint the release, and we think there's also an unconscious motivation that they're happy to see the news."

The statement, which purported to be from GE Communications, claimed the company was responding to a "public outcry" and would "allow the public to decide how to spend" the returned money. Anne Eisele, a GE spokeswoman, said the statement was not from the company. This month on its Web site, GE refuted claims that it received any 2010 tax rebate, refund or payment from the government.

European Union regulators finedProcter & Gamble and Unilever $456 million for fixing prices of powdered laundry detergent  together with Henkel in eight E.U. countries.
Germany's Henkel escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.
U.S.-based Procter & Gamble has to pay $306 million, while British-Dutch company Unilever was  fined
$150 million. Both companies had their  fines reduced because they agreed to settle the case with the
commission and cooperated with the investigation.

Procter & Gamble said that the  fine was not a surprise and that it had already put away money for it in recent earnings reports.
"It's our policy to comply with the letter and spirit of all laws everywhere we do business," spokesman
Paul Fox said in Cincinnati.
"We've already taken the appropriate internal action and strengthened our global compliance program."

l U.S. goes after "botnet": The United States moved to disable an international "botnet" that infected more than 2 million computers with malicious software as part of a "massive fraud scheme," according to the Justice Department. The department filed a civil complaint and criminal seizure warrants and issued a temporary restraining order in an effort to disable a malicious software known as Coreflood, which allows someone to remotely control another computer and record keystrokes and private communications.

Consumer-goods giants Procter & Gamble Co. and Unilever PLC were slapped with fines totaling
€315.2 million ($456.3 million) by the European  Commission for operating a laundry-detergent  cartel
that stemmed from an industry-wide environmental initiative.

The incident shows how corporate-responsibility initiatives, which often necessitate industry-wide coordination to succeed, also require a watchful navigation of antitrust rules.

TD
The European  Commission said Wednesday that P&G, Unilever and a third company, Henkel AG, engaged in anticompetitive practices in the powdered-detergent  market from 2002 to 2005 in eight European countries.

The commission issued a €211.2 million fine to P&G and a €104.0 million  fine to Unilever. Henkel didn't receive a fine because it alerted the commission to the cartel and received immunity.

The decision relates to how the three companies implemented a voluntary industry initiative to reduce the environmental impact of laundry  detergents. Spearheaded by a trade group, the International Association for Soaps,  Detergents  and Maintenance Products (known as AISE), the initiative was designed to help shift consumers away from big-box powder  detergents—which require lots of packaging—to more-compact alternatives.

P&G, Henkel and Unilever "took the opportunity" to organize a cartel while coordinating on the environmental program, said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy.

"They sought to ensure that no one could use this initiative to gain a competitive advantage over the others, so they agreed to protect their respective market shares," Mr. Almunia said. "They agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of packages, and afterwards, they even agreed to a price increase."
The commission said AISE did nothing wrong.

The three companies are major players in Europe's laundry-detergent  industry, with recognizable brands such as Ariel, Persil and Surf. The  commission said the fines imposed on P&G and Unilever were reduced because the companies were forthright in "acknowledging the facts and enabling a swift conclusion of the investigation."

P&G, Henkel and Unilever all said Wednesday that they had strengthened their compliance programs as a result of the investigation. P&G and Unilever noted that the investigation had been flagged in corporate results and added that potential settlements had been budgeted.

"All key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules and are well placed to participate fully in industry-wide environmental initiatives," Unilever said Wednesday.

Dusseldorf-based Henkel said it detected the  cartel activity in 2008 during internal compliance audits and "had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several Western European countries."

Henkel said Wednesday that it conducted an intensive internal investigation and immediately informed the authorities. The company centralized its compliance operation in 2007 and established a chief compliance officer to "uncover and avoid future misconduct."

A spokeswoman for the trade association AISE said it was working in full compliance with antitrust laws. "What the companies outside did was on their own initiative at their own risk," she said Wednesday. "AISE will continue to work on sustainability initiatives which have the full support of the commission."

The reduced fines are part of a settlement procedure introduced by the  Commission in recent years that aims to speed the resolution of cases in return for cutting the penalties on firms.

European regulators have ordered Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Gain and Era washing power brands, and Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, to pay  fines totalling more than €300m (£270m) for their part in a  cartel that fixed  detergent  prices across eight European countries.

TD
In a settlement, the two companies acknowledged fixing prices along with Henkel, the German consumer goods group which escaped penalties by blowing the whistle on the arrangement in 2008. The cartel existed for at least three years between January 2002 and March 2005, fixing prices of power detergents for washing machines in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

"The cartel started when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products," the European  Commission said in the settlement published yesterday.

"The environmental objective, however, did not require them to co-ordinate prices … Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk."

The total  fine of €315.2m - €104m for the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever and €211.2m for P&G of the US - includes a 10 per cent reduction for acknowledging the facts. The final figures also reflect a 50 per cent reduction for P&G and 25 per cent for Unilever on account of their co-operation with regulators under the EU's leniency notice.

Henkel, which owns the Persil brand across many European countries, said it first got wind of the  cartel arrangements during compliance audits in 2008 and "immediately informed the authorities and contributed substantially to clearing up the issue".
Unilever said it strengthened its compliance programme.

The European Commission has the power to  fine companies up to 10 per cent of their global annual turnover in cartel cases, though discounts are usually applied to those which co-operate.

Consumer product firms Procter & Gamble and Unilever have been  fined hundreds of millions of dollars for colluding on washing powder prices in Europe.

The European  Commission found the companies fixed prices in eight European countries. Another company that was initially involved, Germany's Henkel, escaped  fines by providing the tip-off.

TD
Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, which makes the detergents Omo and Surf, was  fined $143 million, while
Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Gain and Era, was fined $290 million.
The pair were handed discounted  fines after admitting to running the  cartel.
The EU Competition Commissioner would not put a figure on how much the companies gained from the
cartel, but said he hoped the  fine would be a deterrent to companies in all business sectors.

Brussels, 13/04/2011 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 13 April, the European Commission finedProcter & Gamble and Unilever a total of € 315.2 million for operating a cartel together with Henkel in the market for household laundry powder  detergents in eight EU countries (Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal). The  fine on two companies (€211.2 million on
Procter & Gamble and €104 million on Unilever) includes a 10% reduction for acknowledging the facts and enabling a swift conclusion of the investigation. Henkel got immunity for revealing the  cartel to the Commission. The three companies are the leading producers of washing powder in Europe. The  cartel lasted some three years (from 7 January 2002 until 8 March 2005) and aimed at stabilising market positions and at coordinating prices in violation of EU and EEA antitrust rules. This is the third  cartel settlement in a year. (O.L./transl.fl)

The Anglo-Dutch group Unilever and the American firm Procter & Gamble have been hit with a  fine of
€315.2 million for operating a  cartel with Henkel of Germany in the washing powder market. Henkel was
given immunity for blowing the whistle, disclosing the  cartel's existence to the European  Commission in
2008. The three firms are the leading producers of washing powder in Europe.

TD
The Commission announced, on 13 April, that the  cartel operated for around three years (from January
2002 to March 2005) and aimed to stabilise market positions and coordinate prices in eight member
states (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands), in violation of EU
anti-trust rules and rules on abuse of dominant position (Article 101 of EU Treaty). The  cartel began
when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the
environmental performance of  detergents. The environmental objective did not require the coordination
of prices or other anti-competitive practices, however, noted the  Commission.

Settlement discussions began in the second half 2010, after the companies made it known that they were prepared to settle, under a procedure introduced in 2008. In January 2011, they clearly and unequivocally recognised their respective liability for the infringement.

Procter & Gamble has been  fined €211.2 million and Unilever €104 million. The  fines take into account the relevant sales of the companies involved in the eight countries concerned, the very serious nature of the infringement and the parties' high combined market share. The  Commission also took account of the cooperation shown by both firms during the investigation, giving Procter & Gamble a 50% reduction in its fine and Unilever 25% under the leniency notice. They were also given a 10% reduction each for settling the case with the  Commission.

Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia commented that, "by acknowledging their participation in the cartel," the companies enabled the Commission to conclude its investigation swiftly and were consequently given a reduction of the fine. "But companies should be under no illusion: the  Commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly and on merits".

Detergent cartel ran for three years

TD
Germany's Henkel blows the whistle

Consumer goods groups Procter & Gamble and Unilever will have to pay  fines totalling €315.2m ($455m) for fixing prices of laundry powder  detergents in Europe, together with Germany's Henkel, for more than three years.

European antitrust regulators said the  cartel, which developed out of a valid environmental initiative in the industry, operated between early 2002 and March 2005.

The cartel covered eight European countries, the regulators said. These included Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

Henkel finally revealed the arrangements of the  cartel in 2008, with the result that it gets immunity from any fines.
The company said details of the  cartel were detected during internal audits in that year and that it
"immediately informed the authorities".

In a statement, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, Henkel's chief compliance officer, said: "We had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several western European countries . . . we have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner."

P&G and Unilever have now agreed the matter with the European  Commission, meaning that they benefit from a 10 per cent reduction in  fines under Brussels' new settlement guidelines.

The two companies also co-operated in the investigation. This culminated in P&G's  fine being cut by a further 50 per cent and the penalty against Unilever being reduced by a further 25 per cent.
As a result, P&G was  fined €211.2m, while Unilever was  fined €104m.

On Wednesday, Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner, said the  cartel had grown out of a genuine and legal environmental initiative that was coordinated through a trade association and dealt with the packaging and presentation of products.

In the course of this, however, the companies strayed into illegal territory, agreeing measures to protect their market shares, maintain prices and, ultimately, fix prices.

This is the third  cartel investigation to be resolved under the  Commission's settlement procedures, which came into operation in 2008. The procedures had a slow start, although lawyers and officials say they are becoming increasingly comfortable with the mechanisms, which are designed to avoid long legal fights over liability and  fines. Mr Almunia said he was "happy with the experience".

European cartel on laundry powder

TD
Germany's Henkel blows the whistle

Consumer goods groups Procter & Gamble and Unilever will have to pay  fines totalling €315.2m (£280m) for fixing prices of laundry powder  detergents in Europe, together with Germany's Henkel, for more than three years.

European antitrust regulators said the  cartel, which developed out of a valid environmental initiative in the industry, ran between early 2002 and March 2005 and covered eight European countries - including Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

Henkel finally blew the whistle on the arrangements in 2008, meaning that it gets immunity from any fines. The company said the  cartel arrangements were detected during internal audits in 2008 and that it "immediately informed the authorities".

In a statement, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, Henkel's chief compliance officer, said: "We had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several western European countries . . . we have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly and in an unrestricted manner."

P&G and Unilever have now settled the matter with the European  Commission, meaning that they benefit from a 10 per cent reduction in  fines under Brussels' new settlement guidelines. The two companies also co-operated in the investigation, which meant that P&G's  fine was cut by a further 50 per cent and Unilever's  fine was cut by a further 25 per cent.
As a result, P&G was  fined €211.2m, while Unilever was  fined €104m.

On Wednesday, Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said the  cartel had grown out of a genuine and legal environmental initiative that was co-ordinated through a trade association and dealt with the packaging and presentation of products. But, in the course of this, the companies strayed into illegal territory, agreeing measures to protect their market shares, maintain prices and, ultimately, fix prices.

This is the third  cartel investigation to be resolved under the  Commission's settlement procedures, which came into operation in 2008. The new procedures had a slow start, although lawyers and officials say they are becoming increasingly comfortable with the mechanisms, which are designed to avoid long legal fights over liability and  fines. Mr Almunia said he was "happy with the experience".

Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been slapped with fines totalling
315.2 million euro (£280.5m) after they colluded to fix the price of washing machine detergent
powder.

The European  Commission said the two companies and rival Henkel shared information concerning pricing in eight countries when they worked together on an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of their products.

TD
The Commission finedUnilever, whose UK brands include Surf, 104 million euro (£92.6m) and P&G, which makes Ariel, 211.2 million euro (£188m) after reductions for co-operating with the investigation.
Henkel was let off a  fine after it blew the whistle to the regulator.

The three companies admitted that the  cartel existed in eight European countries – Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands – between January 7 2002 and March 8 2005.

They were working together on environmental measures, including a scheme to produce concentrated powder to reduce packaging, but they also shared financial information, said the EC.

A spokesman for Unilever said the company has strengthened its internal compliance programme and all key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules.

Unilever and Procter & Gamble have been hit with  fines totalling euros 315.2m (pounds 281m) for fixing the price of washing powder in eight European countries.

The European  Commission imposed the penalties yesterday after finding that the consumer goods groups had colluded over prices for more than three years. P&G must hand over euros 211.2m, while Unilever will pay euros 104m. Both  fines were reduced because the companies co-operated with the investigation and agreed to settle.

TD
The price-fixing  cartel began in January 2002, according to the  commission, when P&G and Unilever, along with Germany's Henkel, held talks over plans to implement an industry-wide programme to improve the environmental performance of  detergents. The companies agreed to shrink the amount of packaging they used but to keep prices unchanged, and later to collectively raise prices. The arrangement lasted until March 2005 and involved products sold in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

"The cartel lasted some three years and aimed at stabilising market positions and at coordinating prices in violation of EU and EEA antitrust rules," said the  commission as it announced the  fines.
Henkel avoided a fine after being granted full immunity for informing the  commission about the  cartel
in 2008.

"Companies should be under no illusion that the  commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly and on their merits," said Joaquin Almunia, vice-president of the  commission, which oversees competition policy.

Unilever said in a statement that it had retrained managers across Europe so that they better understood European competition rules. P&G also said it had strengthened its global compliance programme. Both companies had made provisions to cover a likely  fine from the commission.

Anglo-Dutch group Unilever makes  detergent  products under the brand names Omo and Surf. P&G, which is the world's largest consumer products group, owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands of washing powder. Henkel owns the Persil brand in most of Europe, although Unilever holds the rights in Britain, Ireland and France.

Procter & Gamble qualified for a 50% reduction in its original  fine under leniency rules, while Unilever saw its penalty cut by 25%.

These discounts are part of the  commission's attempt to speed up its investigations by using a simplified procedure.

"This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs; good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker decisions and a 10% reduction in  fines," it said.

EUROPEAN REGULATORS have ordered Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Gain and Era washing power brands, and Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, to pay  fines totalling more than
€300m (£267m) for their part in a  cartel that fixed  detergent  prices across eight European countries.

TD
In a settlement, the two companies acknowledged fixing prices along with Henkel, the German consumer goods group, which escaped penalties by blowing the whistle on the arrangement in 2008. The cartel existed for at least three years between January 2002 and March 2005, fixing prices of powder detergents for washing machines in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

"The cartel started when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products," the European  Commission said in the settlement published yesterday.

"The environmental objective, however, did not require them to co-ordinate prices... Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk."

The total  fine of €315.2m - €104m for Anglo-Dutch company Unilever and €211.2m for P&G of the US - includes a 10 per cent reduction for acknowledging the facts. The final figures also reflect a 50 per cent reduction for P&G and 25 per cent for Unilever on account of their co-operation with regulators under
the EU's leniency notice.

Henkel, which owns the Persil brand across many European countries, said it first got wind of the  cartel arrangements during compliance audits in 2008 and "immediately informed the authorities and contributed substantially to clearing up the issue".

"In 2008, we had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees in several Western European countries," Henkel's compliance chief, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, said. "For us, living in corporate compliance means actively dealing with this issue. This is why we have intensively investigated internally and have made our findings available to the authorities promptly in an unrestricted manner."

Unilever said it had used the findings of the investigation to strengthen its compliance programme, and retrained all key managers in Europe on the continent's competition rules. The consumer goods giant added that the  fine fell within provisions made in its results. P&G also said that it had made "appropriate financial reserve" for the  fine and had "already strengthened" its compliance programme.

The Commission has powers to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover in these cases.
TOP 5 EUROPEAN  CARTEL FINES

Page 116 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Saint Gobain - €896m

The French group was  fined €896m in 2008, the biggest individual penalty in an EU cartel case, following a probe into a market-sharing  cartel between car-glass producers. In all, the Commission finedSaint Gobain, Asahi, Pilkington and Soliver a total of nearly €1.4bn, the biggest fine in a European cartel case.
E.ON and GDF Suez - €553m each

The energy giants, two of the biggest players in the European gas industry, faced penalties of €553m each in 2009 for market sharing in the French and German gas markets. The case saw the European Commission impose its first penalties for antitrust infringement in the energy sector.
ThyssenKrupp - €480m

In 2007,  fines of €992m were levied on members of  cartels covering the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Of the total, the German group ThyssenKrupp faced a penalty of nearly €480m for its part in the arrangements.
F. Hoffmann-La Roche - €462m

The Swiss pharmaceuticals group was  fined €462m in 2001 when the European Commission penalised eight companies for participating in various market-sharing and price-fixing cartels affecting vitamin products. Roche faced the biggest penalty in the case as it was "an instigator and participated in all the cartels", the EC said at the time, characterising the company as "the prime mover and main beneficiary" of the various schemes.
Siemens - €396m

The German engineer was  fined over €396m for participating in a cartel for gas-insulated switchgear projects. Handing down the penalties in 2007, the  Commission said cartel members had employed "sophisticated measures to keep their communications secret", including using code names for companies and individuals.

HD         Europe levies fines in laundry  detergent cartel

European antitrust authorities levied stiff  fines Wednesday on the household products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever for price fixing that arose during efforts to make greener packaging for laundry detergents.

P.&G., the maker of  detergent  brands like Tide and Ariel, was ordered to pay €211.2 million, or $306 million. Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, was  fined €104 million. A German company, Henkel, escaped a  fine for participating in the  cartel in exchange for alerting the authorities of its existence.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, said the companies developed the  cartel to make sure none gained a competitive advantage over the others while seeking to meet environmental goals.

‘‘They agreed to protect their respective market shares, they agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of the packages, and afterwards they even agreed a price increase,’’ Mr. Almunia said.

The companies formed the  cartel after working on methods to reduce the weight of detergent  powders and to reduce waste from boxes and bags through the Association for Soaps, Detergents  and Maintenance Products, a trade group that includes other major home products companies.
The cartel operated from January 2002 until March 2005, and it affected the price of laundry
detergents in supermarkets in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain, the European  Commission said.

Mr. Almunia said there was no need to punish the trade association, which he praised for promoting environmental initiatives.

Henkel said it detected the  cartel in 2008 during an internal audit. The company ‘‘had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees’’ in several West European countries, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, the chief compliance officer at Henkel, said in a statement.
Henkel also said that it had taken measures to ‘‘avoid future misconduct.’’

Marina Barker, a spokeswoman for P.&G., said the activity took place six to nine years ago, and had been focused only on some countries in Europe.

She said the company had ‘‘previously taken an appropriate financial reserve,’’ and had strengthened its global compliance program.
Unilever said the size of the  fine was in the range it had prepared for.

Mr. Almunia said the companies admitted involvement in the  cartel in exchange for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines as part of a settlement procedure.

315.2 million euros, or about $450 million, by the European  Commission for operating a
laundry-detergent cartel that fixed prices.

Regulators said the companies initially came together as part of an industry initiative to reduce the environmental impact of laundry  detergents, but then used the group to set pricing.

TD
The European  Commission said Wednesday that P&G, Unilever and Henkel AG engaged in anticompetitive practices in the powdered-detergent  market from 2002 to 2005 in eight European countries.
The commission finedP&G 211.2 million euros and Unilever 104.0 million euros. Henkel wasn't  fined
because it alerted the commission to the cartel and received immunity.

International Association for Soaps,  Detergents  and Maintenance Products (known as AISE), the initiative was designed to help shift consumers away from big-box powder  detergents -- which require lots of packaging -- to more-compact alternatives.

P&G, Henkel and Unilever "took the opportunity" to organize a cartel while coordinating on the environmental program, said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

"They sought to ensure that no one could use this initiative to gain a competitive advantage over the others, so they agreed to protect their respective market shares," Mr. Almunia said. "They agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of packages, and afterwards, they even agreed to a price increase."
The commission said AISE did nothing wrong.
The three companies are major players in Europe's laundry-detergent  industry, with brands such as
Ariel, Persil and Surf.

P&G, Henkel and Unilever all said Wednesday that they had strengthened their compliance programs as a result of the investigation. P&G and Unilever said that potential settlements had already been budgeted.

A spokeswoman for the trade association AISE said it was working in full compliance with antitrust laws. "What the companies outside did was on their own initiative at their own risk," she said Wednesday.

The European  Commission found the companies fixed prices in eight European countries. Another company that was initially involved, Germany's Henkel, escaped  fines by providing the tip-off.
Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, which makes the detergents Omo and Surf, was  fined $143 million, while
Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Gain and Era, was fined $290 million.
The pair were handed discounted  fines after admitting to running the  cartel.
The EU Competition Commissioner would not put a figure on how much the companies gained from the
cartel, but said he hoped the  fine would be a deterrent to companies in all business sectors.

EUROPEAN Union regulators on Wednesday  fined consumer products companies Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of $437.23 million for fixing prices of powdered laundry  detergent  together with Henkel in eight EU countries.
Germany's Henkel AG escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

TD
US-based Procter & Gamble Co has to pay $292.97 million, while British-Dutch company Unilever NV was fined $144.26 million. Both companies had their  fines reduced because they agreed to settle the case with the  Commission and co-operated with the investigation.
The three companies are the leading producers for washing powder in Europe, the  Commission said. Unilever makes laundry detergents including OMO and Radiant; Procter & Gamble produces Ariel
and Tide; while Henkel owns the Persil brand. In the UK and Ireland, Persil is sold by Unilever.

The cartel was started when the companies were in joint talks on how to cut down on packaging, said the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

``They used this environmental initiative to agree on market share and to agree on not reducing the prices even if the packages were smaller,'' Almunia said.
The cartel lasted from January 2002 until March 2005.

THE BAD ...

& x95;SA equities are unlikely to offer much value in the next few years after sharp gains in 2010 pushed asset valuations to unjustifiably high levels, said Investec Asset Management.

TD
“If you have an expectation that you will get inflation plus 3% on the JSE, the odds are not in your favour,”
said Clyde Rossouw, a portfolio manager who helps manage $90-billion in assets at Investec.

The asset manager is also limiting its exposure to commodities, where rising prices, Rossouw said, are “an accident waiting to happen”. Goldman Sachs, a long-time commodities bull, also painted a bleak picture for commodities, saying this week that prices had got ahead of fundamentals.

& x95;Palabora Mining said its iron ore output in the first quarter to the end of March fell 8% as a result of equipment slowdowns. Copper production fell 10%, it added.

& x95;The National Union of Mineworkers appealed to the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday to hand over a donation from Aurora Empowerment Systems director Khulubuse Zuma to “the destitute Aurora workers”.

“Over 2000 workers remain unpaid at Aurora’s Orkney mine for a period of over two years while the fat cat moves around with luxurious vehicles and has a nerve to donate some of his excesses while poor workers starve at his mines,” said union spokesman Lesiba Seshoka.

& x95;Shares in Allied Technologies (Altech) fell more than 1% after the group said it expects full-year headline earnings a share to drop by between 11% and 16%.
& x95;Regulatory concerns and the nationalisation debate took a front row seat during 2010 and covered
SA mining in a blanket of controversy, PricewaterhouseCoopers says in a survey of the local industry.

“The challenges in obtaining new-order mining rights and environmental authorisation for projects pales into insignificance when the nationalisation debate begins,” the report reads.

“Security of tenure is essential when one makes investment decisions that span up to 30 years, or more. SA cannot afford the risk to the mining industry’s contribution by engaging in a nationalisation experiment.”
& x95;SA’s gold output fell 2.3% in volume terms in February while total mineral production rose 2.8%
compared with the same month a year earlier, according to Stats SA data.
& x95;Consumer goods giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble were  fined à315.2-million by European
Union regulators for fixing washing powder prices in eight EU countries.

Germany’s Henkel, which alerted the European  Commission to the cartel in laundry detergents, was not fined. The penalty for Unilever was à104-million while P& G was fined à211.2-million.
P& G owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands of washing powder while Unilever makes Omo and Surf.

In an address to Congress, President Obama called for lawmakers to cut deficits by $4 trillion over 12 years and promise to lock in automatic spending cuts and tax increases if an initial benchmark is not met by 2014. Republicans called the speech partisan and inadequate. Obama put forth cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare, limits on military spending and a tax system overhaul. The GOP seeks to roll back the health-care reform law. It scored a victory with deep cuts in funding for the
Environmental Protection Agency. On Thursday, Congress passed the 2011 budget deal after six weeks of intense negotiation. Lawmakers touted $38 billion in cuts, but only $352 million would come through this year.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's former Harvard classmates cannot undo their settlement over creation of the social networking site, a federal appeals court ruled. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were declared savvy enough to understand what they were agreeing to when they signed the agreement in 2008. The deal called for a $20 million cash payment and partial ownership of Facebook. The settlement is worth more than $160 million because of Facebook's increased valuation.

U.S. companies face the sixth-highest effective tax rate in the world, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The tax rate for the largest U.S. companies from 2006 to 2009 was 27.7 percent, compared with a 19.5 percent average elsewhere.

HD       Consumer  Giants In Soapy Bubble As Price-Fixing 'Gamble' Fails To Pay Off

The European  Commission today fined household brands Unilever and Proctor & Gamble (P&G) a total of €315.2 million following a three-year investigation on washing powder price-fixing between the two companies and Henkel (the owners of Persil).

Henkel blew the whistle on the cartel between the three companies back in 2008 and a result of Henkel's disclosure to the European Commission, the company was awarded 100% immunity from  fines.

TD
The three companies are the leading producers of washing powder across the whole of Europe. According to the  Commission, the cartel lasted from January 2002 until March 2005 and covered a number of countries within the EU such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

In 2002 the companies introduced an initiative for the production of eco-friendly  detergent  products. The initiative was set up by way of a trade association and its purpose was to enable the production of smaller, more environmentally friendly packaging. Whilst the initiative itself did not require the companies to enter into discussions over price or market shares, it would appear that such discussions did take place.  According to the  Commission, "Henkel, Proctor & Gamble and Unilever did this on their own initiative and at their own risk". Such discussions are a clear breach of EU competition law.

When revealing the penalty, the  Commission said that "companies should be under no illusion that the Commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which extract higher prices from consumers than if companies compete fairly". This is the third cartel investigation that the  Commission have carried out so far this year.

Whilst the two companies both received a 10%  fine reduction for their cooperation in the investigation, due to the serious nature of the competition law infringement, their respective market shares and annual sales, Unilever and Proctor & Gamble still face a hefty  fine.

According to Unilever, their  fine of €104 million will be covered by their 2010 profits and "all key managers in Europe have been retrained on the European competition rules". This point cannot be over emphasised - training your staff can help to prevent infringements occurring in the first place and the costs of training will generally be less than any potential penalty!

Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Unilever have been ordered to pay a total of EUR 315.2 M ($457.5 M) in fines by the European  Commission for conniving to fix prices of household powder laundry detergents in eight European countries. Henkel was also involved in the price-fixing cartel, but was not fined for blowing the whistle on the scheme in 2008. Based on evidence on hand, the cartel operated at least between 7 Jan 2002 and 8 Mar 2005 and fixed prices in the following countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands. P&G and Unilever were fined EUR 211.2
M and EUR 104 M, respectively. The three firms are the biggest powder laundry detergent  makers in Europe with a total market share of 71%. P&G was the market leader with a 33% share of the $4.6 bn European market in 2010.

On 13 April 2011 the European  Commission ('Commission') announced that it had imposed  fines amounting to €315.2 million on two producers of washing powder for infringing Article 101 TFEU by participating in a  cartel aimed at stabilising market positions and fixing prices. The  Commission found that each of Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Henkel had engaged in a  cartel relating to washing machine detergents from at least 7 January 2002 until 8 March 2005.

The cartel was found to have developed from a valid environmental initiative coordinated through a trade association and covered 8 EU territories (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands). Henkel, the whistleblower, uncovered the  cartel whilst conducting internal audits in
2008 and immediately informed the authorities in return for full immunity. The  Commission then launched on-site inspections at the premises of several consumer  detergent  producers.

TD
This is only the third decision that the  Commission has adopted using its settlement procedure since it was introduced in 2008. The purpose of this procedure is to allow the Commission to deal with cases more expediently and free up its resources. At the discretion of the Commission, parties to a  cartel may opt to engage in settlement discussions prior to the issuance of a statement of objections. A key requirement is that the relevant party must acknowledge liability for an infringement. That party is also required to confirm that it has had the opportunity to be heard and that it will neither seek access to the case file nor request an oral hearing. The procedure concludes with the  Commission issuing a
'streamlined' decision with a 10% reduction in  fine for those parties that have participated.

The first settlement occurred in May 2010 in relation to a  cartel in the market for Dynamic Random Access Memory chips and the second, in June 2010, concerned a  cartel in the market for animal phosphates. The current case suggests that the settlement procedure is beginning to bed down, having taken less than 3 years to complete from the leniency application to the infringement decision (materially less than under the ordinary procedure).

Procter & Gamble received a  fine of €211.2 million including a 50% reduction under the Leniency Notice and the 10% settlement reduction. Unilever received a  fine of €104 million including a 25% reduction under the Leniency Notice and the 10% settlement reduction. It remains to be seen however whether any private actions for damages will be made.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that a real estate multiple listing service violated the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) Act by restricting the distribution of discount brokers' listings. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decided that, as a pleading matter, the relevant geographic market for a globally manufactured product may be limited to the United States, to the exclusion of foreign countries where the product is made.

Other recent antitrust developments of note included several cases involving Google, including the rejection of the Google Books settlement and the approval, with conditions, of Google's acquisition of a travel software firm, as well as a district court's grant of the FTC's request to preliminarily enjoin a hospital merger in Ohio.

TD
Realty Listing Service

An association of rival real estate agents and brokers in southeastern Michigan, Realcomp II, Ltd., operates the state's largest multiple listing service (MLS), a database of real estate listings that can be viewed and searched by member realtors. Facing a growing threat to traditional broker arrangements from the Internet and discount brokers, Realcomp restricted the dissemination of discounted listings. Under Realcomp's policies, nontraditional listings subject to discounted brokerage arrangements were excluded from the default search setting in the Realcomp MLS, necessitating an affirmative extra step to find the discounted listings (the search-function policy), and were also excluded from the data feed distributed to public real estate advertising websites (the website policy).

The FTC challenged the policies as unreasonable restraints of trade that injured consumers by restricting the publication and marketing of non-traditional listings and constituted unfair methods of competition in violation of §5 of the FTC Act. Following an administrative trial, an FTC administrative law judge ruled
late in 2007 that the complaint counsel failed to show that the policies had significant anticompetitive effects. The  Commission reversed in a unanimous opinion and determined that the policies were unlawful whether subject to a "quick look" standard of review or a full rule-of-reason analysis.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed, stating that substantial evidence supported the FTC's conclusion. The appellate panel noted that its affirmance was based on a full rule-of-reason analysis without deciding whether it would have been appropriate to apply an abbreviated quick look review.

The Sixth Circuit stated that the website policy was likely to adversely impact competition by limiting consumer access to discount listings and imposing additional costs on discount brokers. The court observed that the Internet and limited-service discount listings exert pricing pressure on traditional brokers and that consumers are not informed that the websites display only traditional, full-service listings. The appellate opinion emphasized that the restrictive policies were especially pernicious because they targeted nascent or emerging threats to traditional business models.

The Sixth Circuit then reviewed the FTC's evidence of actual effects on competition. The court found that a decrease in the share of discount listings from about 1.5 percent to about 0.75 percent, among other

Page 135 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
evidence, supported the  commission's finding of actual anticompetitive effect. But the appellate court added that even if the actual effects evidence was inconclusive, the  commission met its initial burden under the rule of reason by establishing Realcomp's market power and the "anticompetitive tendencies" of the policy.

The court rejected Realcomp's procompetitive justifications, stating that the policy did not plausibly prevent "free riding" by discount brokers as they were also paying members of Realcomp. The court then stated that the contention that the website policy was designed to eliminate a "bidding disadvantage" was not a meritorious procompetitive justification as it merely described efforts to protect brokers from pricing pressures.
Realcomp II Ltd. v. FTC, No. 09-4596, 2011-1 CCH Trade Cases 77,409 (April 6, 2011).

Comment: The policy challenged in the Realcomp II case did not exclude discounted listings altogether from the MLS but rather encumbered their dissemination, preventing consumers from learning about offerings from lower-cost sellers. Collective efforts by industry groups to suppress the flow of competitive information have long been the subject of enforcement actions and have often been upheld by the
courts. Query whether restricting rivals' access to a crucial marketing tool or network would have been deemed unlawful under current Supreme Court jurisprudence if implemented by a single dominant firm rather than an association of rivals.
Relevant Geographic Market

A Korean manufacturer of para-aramid fibers—strong, synthetic fibers used to make tires, body armor and fiber optic cables—claimed that DuPont, the only American producer of para-aramid, entered into exclusionary supply arrangements with major customers, insulating substantial portions of the market from competition in violation of §2 of the Sherman Act.

A district court dismissed the antitrust claims brought by the Korean firm, Kolon Industries Inc., for failure to properly plead a relevant geographic market and exclusionary conduct. The Fourth Circuit reversed.

The appellate court noted that dismissals of antitrust claims for failure to adequately allege a relevant market are relatively rare and generally limited to "glaring deficiencies," such as failing to define a market altogether or alleging an unreasonably and implausibly narrow market.
Kolon's complaint asserted that the relevant geographic market was the "worldwide supply of
para-aramid fiber to commercial purchasers in the United States" and that DuPont had over 70 percent of
that market. But the district court stated that the market must be expanded to include Korea and the
Netherlands, where the foreign sellers to U.S. customers are headquartered.

The Fourth Circuit disagreed and criticized the lower court for ignoring commercial realities, including the extent to which any para-aramid fiber supplied to customers in Korea and the Netherlands could practicably be diverted to U.S. buyers. The appellate panel pointed out that Kolon was not a major participant in the U.S., as the Korean manufacturer alleged it had been in the U.S. market for only a few years and accounted for less than one percent of U.S. sales of para-aramid.

The court rejected the suggestion that supplier headquarter sites must be included in the relevant geographic market definition as a matter of law, without considering whether consumers can actually turn to those regions for supplies.

Turning to the sufficiency of allegations of exclusionary conduct, the appellate court stated that even though DuPont's contracts did not require that customers buy all of their supply of para-aramid from DuPont, requiring major customers to obtain around 85 percent of their needs from DuPont could effectively foreclose competition in this context.
E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. v. Kolon Industries Inc., 2011-1 CCH Trade Cases ¶77,380 (March 11,
2011).

Comment: The Department of Justice and the FTC came to an agreement on this case and submitted an amicus brief criticizing the suggestion that a relevant geographic market must, as a matter of law, include the locations of production for all supplies of the relevant product. While the agencies acknowledged that in many cases the geographic dimension of the market is properly defined around the locations where
the product is made, they argued that the geographic market may be restricted to the location of customers due to commercial realities, including the feasibility of cross-border arbitrage.
Google Books Settlement



Page 136 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A district court rejected a proposed settlement of copyright claims arising from Google's efforts to create a universal digital library. The court observed that the settlement, if not modified, would reward Google
for engaging in unauthorized wholesale copying and identified concerns about class action and copyright law as well as antitrust law.

Among other features of the settlement, Google would have obtained a license to display out-of-print books without prior authorization from the copyright holder unless the rights holder objected. The court stated that the proposed settlement would grant Google a "de facto monopoly" over unclaimed or "orphan" works and would disadvantage a potential rival provider of digital library services that did not have rights to millions of orphan works. In addition, the court expressed concern that Google's market power in the online search market would be enhanced by the ability to prevent competitors from searching orphan books scanned by Google.
The Authors Guild v. Google Inc., 2011-1 CCH Trade Cases ¶77,387 (S.D.N.Y. March 22, 2011). Hospital Acquisition
A district court granted the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the completion of a hospital merger in the Toledo, Ohio, area, and allow the FTC to conduct an administrative trial while preserving the status quo. The court stated that the transaction was presumed unlawful because the merger would significantly exceed the market concentration thresholds set forth in the antitrust agencies' merger guidelines: The combined hospitals' post-acquisition share of the general acute care market
would approach 60 percent in an already concentrated market and the merger would lead to a duopoly in the inpatient obstetrical services market with over 80 percent of that market.
FTC v. ProMedica Health System Inc., 2011-1 CCH Trade Cases ¶77,395 (N.D. Ohio March 29, 2011). Comment: Despite agency efforts to de-emphasize relevant market analysis and market concentration
thresholds in the new merger guidelines, the FTC's victory in the ProMedica Health System decision was
due in large part to the court's adoption of those traditional metrics.
Travel Software Acquisition

The Justice Department agreed, subject to behavioral conditions, to allow Google to proceed with its proposed acquisition of ITA Software, a developer of software used by online travel agents and search sites to perform customized flight searches. The department alleged that Google's plans to offer an online search product combined with its prospective ownership of the underlying search software would lessen competition among providers of comparative flight search websites. To ensure that websites
would continue to have access to ITA's pricing and shipping software, the department required Google to develop and license this software on commercially reasonable terms, establish internal firewalls to prevent unauthorized use of competitively sensitive information from ITA and continue funding research and development for flight search software.

United States v. Google Inc. & ITA Software Inc., No. 1:11-cv-00688 (April 8, 2011) available at http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/google.html.

Comment: In the enforcement action reported immediately above, the department extracted a traditionally disfavored form of relief, imposing affirmative obligations that require ongoing monitoring instead of requiring a onetime structural change, such as a divestiture.
Price Comparison Sites

In another review of a transaction involving Google, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trade (OFT) opened an inquiry into Google's completed acquisition of British financial products price comparison site, BeatThatQuote.com.

Detergent Price Fixing

The European  Commission (EC) fined producers of washing powder €315 million for engaging in price coordination in the market for household laundry powder  detergent  in eight European Union member states. The  commission alleged that the collusion began through a trade association initiative to improve the environmental performance of detergent.  Two producers, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, received the standard 10 percent reduction in the fine for participating in the settlement process. Under
the EC's leniency program, a third producer, Henkel, received immunity for revealing the  cartel to the EC

and did not pay a fine, while Proctor & Gamble and Unilever received a 50 percent and 25 percent reduction, respectively, for coming forward with information during the investigation.

Network Membership

The General Court of the European Union upheld the EC's €10.2 million  fine imposed on Visa for its refusal to accept Morgan Stanley to Visa network membership because the bank owned the rival Discover Card network. The EC asserted that the exclusion prevented a potential competitor from entering a highly concentrated market with a trend toward consolidation and noted that the refusal to admit Morgan Stanley prevented it from providing services for accepting Visa cards and MasterCard cards. The court rejected Visa's argument that Morgan Stanley could have entered into a "fronting arrangement" with a Visa member financial institution.

LP
EUROPEAN Union regulators recently  fined Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of US$456 million for fixing laundry  detergent  prices in eight EU countries.

The EU action last Wednesday reminds me of these two companies' recently announced intentions to raise prices on a range of household items such as shampoo, bath lotion, toothpaste, and  detergent.

TD
The extent of the price increases - as much as 15 percent in some cases - and the seemingly coordinated nature of the announcement have stoked a public outcry.

Granted, after rounds of quantitative easing in the United States and now in Japan and the subsequent run-up of commodity prices around the world, the inflation beast has clearly climbed ashore. The consumer price index has been hovering close to 5 percent in recent months.

Oil prices, in particular, are again in the three-digit territory. As oil byproducts, some of the raw materials used in shampoo and lotion have seen price increases as high as 50 percent.
So there seems to be a legitimate reason for these companies to transfer higher costs to consumers. However, the public is crying that the announced price increases seem to be more than enough to
cover material cost increases.

If you look at the cost breakdown of a P&G shampoo for example, only 15-30 percent is attributed to manufacturing costs, of which maybe half of it is for raw material. The bulk of the other cost items are for advertising and sales in the distribution channel.

The consumer product industry is famous for its large advertising budget, probably only behind the auto industry. Therefore, it seems that an outrageous 15 percent price hike is more than it needs.
Market power

If that is the case, it then leads to the other more important issue that the public is concerned about - the excessive market power of consumer product behemoths P&G and Unilever.

The public's concern is highly justified, as this industry indeed sees a high market concentration. Let's do a quick back-of-the-envelope antitrust analysis here.

Take shampoo as an example. I think no antitrust expert is going to dispute me on the product definition of shampoo as just shampoo.

The geographic dimension of the relevant market definition should be the national market, since the transport cost of shampoo is relatively low.

OK, let's look at the national market of shampoo. The two giants, P&G and Unilever, with a myriad of brands under them, each occupies about 30 percent of market share, according to the market research company Asia PHPC.



Page 139 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That alone translates into 1800 points of the Herfindahl index, which is the most common index used for measuring market concentration. When adding other companies, my guess is that the Herfindahl index for the shampoo market could be north of 2000.

In the US, a merger request that generates above 2000 in the Herfindahl index would raise grave concerns at the US Federal Trade  Commission or the Justice Department, whichever is assigned to evaluate such request.

Based on China's Antimonopoly Law, such a high industry concentration would constitute the market power position, and would also serve as the basis for inquiries into any abuse of such power. And the coordinated nature of these price announcements, in my opinion, seems to be suspect behavior called tacit collusion among an informal  cartel of oligopolistic companies.

In fact, the very public announcement of price increase intentions may well serve as a market signal to its rivals that would eventually result in a rough and unspoken coordination of price increases.
Tricky behavior

The result can thus approximate the consequences of traditional price-fixing in a smoke-filled board room, even though each company does nothing but makes its own independent decision by observing what the other companies do in the marketplace or say in the media.
In the history of antitrust enforcement, there is no short supply of behaviors like this.

American Airlines, for example, once repeatedly led the industry with its megaphone loud price increase announcements, followed unanimously by its smaller competitors.

Are the consumer product giants in China also playing a game like this? We don't know yet. But we do know that P&G and Unilever are the very recently convicted villains of price-fixing in the EU market.

Could it be the case that the two seasoned players of the market power game have been price-fixing all along in China as well? And that this time they have the audacity to further increase prices - by a whopping 15 percent?

The regulatory folks at the National Reform and Development  Commission seem to have got the message and talked to them into holding back their plan for the moment.

But in my opinion, the mere fact of a well-coordinated and loudly-ochestrated price increase campaign smacks of a tacit collusion conspiracy.
I am keeping a close eye on their next move.

EC Cartel Fine Provides Warning on Dangers of Trade Associations

The European Commission (EC) fined Procter & Gamble and Unilever a total of EUR315.2 million for operating a cartel together with Henkel in the market for household laundry powder detergents in eight EU countries on April 13, 2011. Henkel obtained full immunity from a  fine for revealing the cartel to the EC. The EC used its settlement procedure for the third time, and based on this, P&G and Unilever received 10% fine reductions.

TD
The EC described the  cartel as starting when the companies implemented an initiative through their trade association to improve the environmental performance of  detergent  products. However, this led to wider arrangements aimed at price coordination and stabilizing market positions. The case provides another clear warning of the dangers inherent in trade association activities. Due to these risks, companies are increasingly banning or restricting attendance at trade associations. At the very least, competition law compliance programmes must carefully consider the issues raised by trade associations, and staff who attend meetings must be trained appropriately.
UK Regulator Provides Guidance on Competition Law Treatment of Land Agreements

UK law was changed so that its competition law applies to land agreements as it does to other types of agreements on April 6, 2011. Reflecting this change, on March 24, 2011, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published guidance on the application of competition law to such agreements.

The guideline sets out that: there is no presumption that a land agreement will infringe competition law, and the OFT expects that only a small minority will do so; restrictions on the use of land may potentially infringe competition law where this protects a business from competition, or prevents its competitors from entering a market; and generally, the OFT is unlikely to take further action in cases where none of the parties to an agreement has more than a 30% share of the market in which the land is being used. The principles set out in the guidance will also be of interest to any company or adviser considering similar agreements in other EU countries or under EU competition law.
EU General Court Confirms State Aid Treatment of Airport Infrastructure Funding

The EU's General Court (its second highest court) ruled that the construction of airport infrastructure is an economic activity on March 23, 2011. Therefore, public funding of infrastructure necessary for the operation of an airport alleviates the costs that the airport operator would normally have to bear and constitutes State aid. State aid which is paid and which would not have been provided by an investor operating under normal market conditions or which cannot otherwise be exempted under one of the special provisions in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, must be repaid with interest
by the beneficiary.

The EC welcomed this decision, stating that "the ruling of the General Court is important . . . for [all EU] Member States and . . . European airports." The ruling is consistent with the EC's approach as laid down in its 2005 guidelines on the financing of airports, and as applied in a number of decisions since 2001.
EU General Court Provides Important Judgment on Agreements which Prevent Potential Competition


Page 141 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The EU General Court decided on April 14, 2011, that Visa had infringed EU rules on restrictive business practices by refusing to admit, for six and a half years, Morgan Stanley Bank as a member to its payment card network without objective justification. The General Court also upheld the EUR10.2 million  fine imposed on Visa.

The court held that an assessment of the conditions of competition in a given market has to be based not only on the existing competition between undertakings already present in the market in question, but also on potential competition from new entrants. The court took the view that it is correct to consider whether the entry of a new player (here Morgan Stanley Bank) would have created scope for further competition
in the market in question. The essential factor on which the assessment of a potential competitor must be based is its ability to enter the market.

In the specific circumstances of this case, the judgment confirms that an association of banks cannot unjustifiably exclude another bank which could potentially bring further competition on the market. However, the principles apply to any other scenario in which entry to a market may be foreclosed by agreement.

The makers of Ariel, Persil and other household brands of laundry  detergent  were exposed as not exactly whiter-than-white earlier this month when a major price-fixing scam came out in the wash.

Unilever and Proctor & Gamble were  fined a combined total of over €315 dollars by EU regulators for operating a long-running cartel in eight member states. A third company, Henkel, was also involved in the scam, but escaped a fine by having revealed the sharp practices to the European  Commission.

TD
In an investigation dubbed “Purity”, the EU watchdog found that the three industry leaders aimed to stabilise market positions and coordinate prices, in clear violation of EU anti-trust rules. The fines were reduced by ten per cent in exchange for the firms’ admission that they had participated in the cartel.

Ireland East MEP Mairead McGuinness said the case, which was the third such  cartel exposed in less than a year, has sent a clear message that the EU will not tolerate price-fixing. “It proves that market manipulation is a very real issue requiring constant vigilance. The swift and stern action of the Commission in responding to this market violation shows that the EU will do what it must to achieve a truly ‘free’ single market,” added the  Fine Gael MEP.
Ferry passengers to be compensated for lost luggage

Any passenger who loses their luggage during a ferry crossing will be eligible for compensation by the carrier, under new rules agreed at the European Parliament this week.

The regulations, which have yet to be approved by member states, will improve the rights of passengers by making ferry companies liable. They will also make insurance a compulsory requirement for carriers, with a right of direct action against insurers up to a specified limit. The discussions are part of efforts by the European  Commission to bring maritime passenger legislation into line with airline legislation, by establishing rights and minimum rules. These include provisions for alternative routes in case of cancellations, assitance for people with reduced mobility, and the creation of indpendent national bodies for the settlement of disputes.

Speaking from Brussels, Irish MEP Jim Higgins said he is confident that the proposals will get the green light from member states. “It’s important to ensure that passengers, regardless of how they travel, are entitled to rights and protection for their belongings. These new safeguards will give consumers a greater level of assurance, while simplifying requirements for all EU carriers,” said the  Fine Gael MEP.
EU must speed reform in all dictatorships

The institutions of the EU were urged this week to use their influence to encourage democratic reform in repressive dictatorships all over the world, in an effort to stave off violent uprisings of the kind that are wreaking havoc across North Africa and the greater Arab world.

Irish MEP Gay Mitchell said the ongoing conflicts in Libya, the Ivory Coast, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen have highlighted the urgent need to promote basic human rights in the world’s remaining totalitarian régimes.

Speaking at the European Parliament in Brussels, Mr Mitchell said the current revolutions in North Africa should not have surprised the world, as they follow decades of bubbling tension among oppressed peoples. The  Fine Gael MEP, who is Chairman of the European Parliament’s working group on Human Dignity, said the EU must turn its attention to helping developing stable democracies in every troubled region of the globe.

“The suppression of human rights remains a central cause of some of the world’s current conflicts. Whilst condemning these atrocities, the challenge remains for the international community to unite in promoting constructive, peaceful conflict resolution while encouraging democratic reform,” he said.
Farmers will oppose EU plan to end fuel rebate

A proposal by the European  Commission to remove existing tax reductions for the fuel used in agriculture is meeting with considerable resistance from farmers and politicians in Ireland and other EU countries.
The draft plan published in early April recommends a range of changes to energy taxation, including a suggestion that farmers may face a new energy consumption tax based on carbon dioxide.

At present, Ireland is one of 17 European countries that gives tax allowances on agricultural fuel, and any new legislation on taxation would require unanimity from all member states. Speaking in Brussels this week, Ireland East MEP Liam Aylward called on other farming nations to unite in opposing the measure. The Fianna Fáil MEP, a member of the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, said the removal of the duty rebate on agricultural fuel would cut badly into farmers’ margins, in a market already under
serious stress.

“Irish farmers have already made measurable and costly moves towards greening and reducing emissions. They should not be squeezed further in the drive to meet the EU’s targets for reducing greenhouse gases,” said Mr Aylward.

HD       China finesUnilever over 'panic buying'; Officials claim price warning  distorted market

Sneaking in a stealth price rise in the West can be a recipe for trouble. In China, it seems, the reverse is the case: Unilever has just been  fined for telling its customers that the cost of soap and washing powder is about to rise.
The company was fined two million yuan (£200,000) for apparently inciting panic buying after warning in
March that it may increase its prices because of a sharp rise in commodity and energy prices.

TD
Beijing, which is trying desperately to tackle inflation running at 5.4 per cent, accused Unilever of "seriously distorting market order" and threw in allegations — denied by the company — that it had abused a monopoly position and agreed prices with competitors as part of a  cartel.

The move, which appeared to single out the Anglo-Dutch giant for punishment, was a response to comments made by local managers in March.

According to China's National Development and Reform  Commission, Unilever executives told the state news agency Xinhua that the prices of personal care products had "entered an upward cycle". This was enough to trigger what authorities described as a "buying rush" on soap,  detergent,  shampoo and other goods.

The NDRC said that Unilever, which yesterday confirmed that it had received a  fine, had deliberately spread misinformation that caused consumers to expect "massive" price increases. State media said that sales of Unilever products in some supermarkets were ten times their usual levels. The company said: "Unilever today closed a case with Shanghai Price Bureau. As a company with a long-term commitment to China, we continue to be sensitive to the local environment." The Government has cited its battle with inflation, which has reached a 32-month high, as a top priority amid the threat of social unrest. Its concerns are thought to lie behind the recent intensification of arrests and "disappearances" of prominent critics of government policy.

The panic buying, which was never officially quantified but generated images of elderly shoppers scrambling for washing powder, prompted the NDRC to demand that Unilever postpone its planned price increases. Although Unilever continues to invest heavily in its China operations, its decision to yield to
the NDRC was regarded by many as a watershed. China exerts pressure on state-owned companies to hold prices in check, but had not previously leant so obviously on a foreign multinational.

Unilever was not alone in publicly suggesting that soap and  detergent  prices would have to rise in line with global commodity markets. The panic buying began after reports that four consumer groups, including the detergent  maker Guangzhou Liby Enterprise, were planning price increases of up to 15 per cent.

Procter & Gamble and Tingyi, the company that produces half of China's instant noodles, had also been planning to raise prices last month but were not understood to have received  fines.
