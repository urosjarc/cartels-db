(Adds details throughout) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - British  Airways  (BA),  Air France-KLM, and SAS are among several airlines  set to be fined by European Union (EU) antitrust regulators next month for fixing cargo prices, several sources said.

The European Commission charged the carriers in December 2007 with taking part in an  air freight cartel, following raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that also involved the U.S. Department of Justice.

The EU watchdog did not identify the targets of the probe, but BA, Lufthansa, SAS,  Air France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan  Airlines, All Nippon  Airways,  Air Canada and Alitalia all confirmed they had been investigated.

"A commission decision is expected on Nov. 9," said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is expected to announce the  fines at a news conference that day.

Another source said on Thursday that  fines would be substantial, but that the total was unlikely to top the 1.38 billion  euro ($1.92 billion) penalty slapped on a  cartel of car glassmakers in 2008, due to the large number of leniency applicants, and defence arguments citing the effects of the credit crisis.

The source said continuing debate within the  commission on the size of the  fines could delay the decision.

A date has not been set for the decision, said Amelia Torres, EU spokeswoman for competition matters.

It would be "extremely unlikely" that companies arguing their inability to pay due to the crisis would be able to convince the  commission, one of the sources said.
Lufthansa previously said it told the  commission about the  cartel and therefore would not face a  fine. The probe initially targeted more than 20 carriers, including Qantas, Singapore  Airlines, Korean  Air,
Cargolux, Malaysia Airlines and Alitalia, but not all are expected to be found guilty.

The commission can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their global sales for breaching EU
rules, but fines rarely reach that level.

BA and Korean  Air each paid $300 million in criminal  fines in the U.S. price probe in 2007;  Air France-KLM agreed to a $87 million U.S. civil antitrust claims settlement in July. (Editing by Rex Merrifield, Sharon Lindores) ($1=.7181  Euro)

LP
Brussels, 21/10/2010 (Agence Europe) - Several large airline companies, including  Air France, KLM, British  Airways  and SAS, could face European Commission fines for having organised an  air cargo cartel. Communication of the decision stating the amount of the fines is expected on 9 November, Reuters indicates.

The Commission investigation, which covered over 20 companies, had been triggered in December 2007 following inspections carried out on both sides of the Atlantic by  Commission services and those of the
US Justice Department. The companies concerned were suspected of insider agreements on the subject of fuel surcharges in order to offset the surge in oil prices. Not all, however, are to be penalised.

TD
Although the Commission had not communicated the names of the companies undergoing investigation, British Airways,  Lufthansa, SAS,  Air France-KLM, Japan  Airlines, Cathay Pacific, All Nippon  Airways, Air Canada and Alitalia have confirmed that they were concerned.

Lufthansa had acknowledged the facts, which could mean that it will not have to pay such heavy  fines under the Commission's leniency programme which exonerates in whole or in part companies that denounce insider dealing or cooperate with the inquiry.

The fine could be substantial, although it will not reach the record €1.38 billion imposed in 2008 on the glassmakers' cartel operating in the automotive sector.

No date has been given by the  Commission but the debate underway on the size of the  fines could delay still further a decision that was due last week. (F.G./transl.jl)

British  Airways  (BA) could be  fined up to 80 million euros next month for fixing cargo prices with other carriers, a source with direct knowledge of the case said.
The European Commission charged BA, Air France-KLM, SAS and several other  airlines  in December

The EU watchdog is expected to announce penalties for the carriers on Nov. 9, several sources have told
Reuters.

The charges followed raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that also involved the U.S. Department of Justice. "The  Commission is considering a fine of between 60 to 80 million euros," the source said, adding that no final decision has been taken and discussions are continuing. A European Commission spokeswoman described the figure as speculation. BA, which declined to comment, lost a record 531 million pounds in the year to March 2010 but expects to break even in the full year to March
2011 despite bigger-than-expected first quarter losses due to the impact of volcanic ash and strikes. Shares in the company were trading at 279 pence on Tuesday afternoon, about 1.7 percent down on the day. The Commission has not identified the targets of its probe, but BA, Lufthansa, SAS,  Air
France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan  Airlines, All Nippon  Airways,  Air Canada and Alitalia all confirmed they had been investigated. Lufthansa previously said it had immunity as it alerted the Commission to the cartel.

BRITISH  Airways  is bracing itself to be slapped with a  fine of up to £70m by Brussels for fixing prices on cargo routes with rival carriers.

The European Commission charged BA,  Air France-KLM and a host of other  airlines  with operating an air freight cartel in 2007, after German rival Lufthansa blew the whistle on the clandestine arrangement. The Commission is slated to announce the scale of  fines to be imposed on the carriers on November 9.

TD
Several sources close to the  European authorities said the penalty for BA (down 3.9p to 279.9p) was likely to be between £52m and £70m. The multi-million pound  fine will be particularly embarrassing, given that it comes just three years after BA was hit with a total penalty of £270m by US and UK authorities over a separate price-fixing scandal.

BA was found guilty of colluding with Virgin Atlantic to fix fuel surcharges levied on commercial passengers, forcing up the price of transatlantic tickets.

The EU watchdog has the power to charge BA up to 10pc of global sales for any breach of the rules on cartels, implying a ceiling of £800m based on BA’s 2010 revenues of £7.99bn. In practice  fines rarely, if ever, reach such mammoth proportions.
But even though BA has already set aside cash for a  fine, a £70m penalty will spell bad news for the
airline as it battles to recover from a record £531m loss before tax in 2010.

Chief executive Willie Walsh has pledged that the company will at least break even this year after two successive years of losses. Walsh has faced a difficult year, with the  airline beset by an ongoing industrial dispute with cabin crew unions and the volcanic ash saga that grounded planes across Europe.
A £5bn merger with Iberia and a transatlantic revenue-sharing agreement with the Spanish carrier and
American Airlines have provided better news of late.

But the prospect of a multi-million pound  fine is likely to put a dampener on half-year results due to be unveiled by Walsh on Friday.

This latest price-fixing scandal has engulfed not just BA, but also rival carriers around the world. BA, SAS,  Air France-KLM, Japan  Airlines, Cathay Pacific,  Air Canada and Alitalia have confirmed they have been under investigation.

Lufthansa also said it was being probed, but was handed immunity from punishment in return for alerting the authorities to the  cartel. BA declined to comment on the potential  fine.

HD        BA's '£70m price fix fine' BY        By Cheryl Latham

BRITISH  Airways  could be fined up to £71million next month for fixing cargo prices with other carriers, sources have revealed.

The airline was charged by the European Commission along with Air France-KLM, SAS and several other airlines  with taking part in an air freight cartel. It is not clear what, if any,  fines will be levelled on the other airlines.

TD
The European watchdog is expected to announce penalties for the carriers on November 9. A European Commission spokeswoman described the figure as speculation. BA, which declined to comment, lost a record £531million in the year to March this year but expects to break even in the full year to March 2011 despite bigger-than-expected first quarter losses owing to the impact of volcanic ash and strikes.

The charges followed raids on both sides of the Atlantic that also involved the US Department of Justice, following a tip-off from Lufthansa.
The inquiry initially targeted more than 20 carriers but not all are expected to be found guilty.
BA and Korean  Air each paid £190million in criminal  fines in the US price-fix inquiry in 2007, and  Air
France-KLM agreed to a £55million US civil antitrust claims settlement in July.

Some of the world's leading  airlines  are bracing for fines running into hundreds of millions of  euros this week when antitrust regulators in Brussels are expected to hand down a much-delayed decision in their four-year-old air cargo cartel probe.

Japan Airlines, British  Airways  and Air France-KLM are among the carriers awaiting the outcome of the European part of a global investigation that has already seen  fines of more than $1.6bn being imposed by the US Department of Justice alone.

TD
More than 20 airlines  have agreed to pay fines, and at least four executives have been sentenced to jail since regulators launched surprise raids on airlines  around the world in early 2006.

Separately, several have paid millions to settle civil claims brought against them by shippers who say they were victims of a  cartel to fix prices for  air freight shipments.
Other civil cases are still under way in the UK and the Netherlands and the outcome of the  European
case is expected to have big implications for these.

Action from  European Commission investigators was originally expected more than a year ago. But the case has been delayed for various reasons. Some  airlines,  for example, argued the economic downturn that saw many of them suffer large losses made it impossible for them to pay hefty  fines without endangering their viability.
Others have claimed they were sucked into the  cartel as a result of their membership of  airline
alliances and had abided by local regulatory requirements.

The decision, which could come as early as Tuesday, will be carefully scrutinised to see which carriers have been penalised and how individual  fines have been determined. Lufthansa is expected to receive immunity because it acted as a whistleblower.
But others could face large penalties on top of those already paid.

British  Airways,  which agreed to pay $300m in  fines in the US to settle charges of fixing cargo and passenger prices and saw a former cargo manager, Keith Packer, serve eight months in prison, set aside £350m ($566m) three years ago to deal with such  fines.
Other airlines  have made similar provisions.

In the High Court in London, BA has been sued by two UK flower importers, and judges are still deciding whether the case should be allowed to go ahead on a representative basis, so other parties can seek damages if they are successful.

Separately, several hundred companies - led by Philips and Sweden's Ericsson - have brought proceedings against  Air France-KLM and Martinair in the Netherlands.

The companies' lawyers allege they have suffered more than €400m ($562m) of damage as a result of price-fixing. A first court date has been set for March.

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - British Airways,  Air France-KLM and 11 other carriers are set to be fined a total of about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) by EU competition regulators for fixing cargo prices, a source with direct knowledge of the case said on Monday.
The European Commission charged the carriers in December 2007 with participating in an  air freight
cartel, following raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that also involved the U.S.
Department of Justice.
"Thirteen  airlines  will be fined, of which six are non-European carriers," said the source.
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia will announce the  fine at a Brussels news conference at
1600 GMT on Tuesday.

British  Airways  could be penalised by as much as 120 million  euros, the source said. A different source with direct knowledge of the case had told Reuters last month that the  Commission was considering fining BA 60-80 million  euros but had not finalised the figure at that time.

Other carriers facing fines include Singapore  Airlines, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, the source said. The Commission had initially targeted more than 20 companies in its probe.

The EU watchdog did not identify the companies but BA, Lufthansa, SAS,  Air France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan  Airlines, All Nippon  Airways,  Air Canada and Alitalia had all previously confirmed that they had been investigated.
Lufthansa alerted the  Commission about the  cartel and therefore will not face a  fine.

Korean Air, Cargolux and Malaysia  Airlines were also investigated by the  Commission, another source familiar with the case said last month.
The commission can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their global sales for breaching EU
rules, but fines rarely reach that level.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Franco-Dutch airlineAir France KLM (AF.FR) faces a new EUR150 million to EUR250 million fine Tuesday when the European Commission releases its verdict on an alleged air cargo cartel, French daily Les Echos Monday reports without citing its sources.

Air France-KLM, which provisioned EUR530 million for the case in 2007-2008, has already paid
EUR258.7 million in  fines in the U.S., Canada and Australia for the same affair, Les Echos said.

TD
Tuesday, it could be  fined another EUR150 million to EUR250 million, the newspaper reported, without citing sources.

Air France-KLM and several other  airlines  have been accused of fixing prices since 2000, by making deals among themselves over surcharges they imposed to offset increases in fuel costs, and in the cost of additional anti terrorism measures, as well as extra war-risk insurance premiums following the outbreak of war in Iraq in 2003.

The commission can penalize companies as much as 10% of their annual global sales if they find evidence of price-fixing.

Air France-KLM denied to comment on the report Monday. "Brussels has not yet taken a decision," a spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires, without even confirming a decision is due Tuesday.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission is going to fine several airlines  Tuesday for an alleged cartel in freight transport, ending years-long investigation, two people familiar with the case told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.

The commission, the European Union's antitrust body, could fine airlines,  including the largest European ones such as Air France KLM (AF.FR) and British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN), a total of hundreds of millions of euros for colluding in setting surcharges, mainly a fuel surcharge, for their cargo operations.

TD
Tuesday, it could be  fined another EUR150 million to EUR250 million, the newspaper reported, without citing sources.

Air France-KLM and several other  airlines  have been accused of fixing prices since 2000, by making deals among themselves over surcharges they imposed to offset increases in fuel costs, and in the cost of additional anti terrorism measures, as well as extra war-risk insurance premiums following the outbreak of war in Iraq in 2003.

The commission can penalize companies as much as 10% of their annual global sales if they find evidence of price-fixing.

Air France-KLM denied to comment on the report Monday. "Brussels has not yet taken a decision," a spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires, without even confirming a decision is due Tuesday.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission is going to fine several airlines  Tuesday for an alleged cartel in freight transport, ending years-long investigation, two people familiar with the case told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.

The commission, the European Union's antitrust body, could fine airlines,  including the largest European ones such as Air France KLM (AF.FR) and British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN), a total of hundreds of millions of euros for colluding in setting surcharges, mainly a fuel surcharge, for their cargo operations.

The commission's fines can go as high as 30% of the companies' revenue in the specific activity targeted in the investigation, to which some further sums for aggravating circumstances can be added, for each year the  cartel had been taking place.

However, given the recent economic downturn and the big hit  airlines  have taken from it,  fines might be lower than initially expected.

The commission's probe--which started in 2006 with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters--initially targeted more than 20 carriers and more than 10 are likely to be  fined, the people familiar with the case said.
The commission, the European Union's antitrust body, declined to confirm the announcement of the
fines.
Companies have two months to appeal to the  European Court of Justice, after the  commission
makes a decision.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission is likely to fine several airlines  Tuesday, ending investigations into an alleged global cartel in air freight transport that dragged on of years, two people familiar with the case told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.

The commission could fine airlines,  including two of the largest  European ones such as Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) and British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN), a total of hundreds of millions of euros for colluding in setting surcharges, mainly a fuel surcharge, for their cargo operations.

In what is truly a global case, many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total fines of more than
$1.5 billion were levied against  airlines  that admitted fixing fuel surcharges. Eighteen airlines  have been charged.

In Europe, the commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue, though penalties tend to be much smaller and reflect the length of the offense and the size of the market affected.
The recent economic downturn and the big hit  airlines  have taken from it might also promt EU
authorities to limit the amount of  fines low.

Some companies, including British Airways  and Luxembourg-based Cargolux, have been putting money aside in the wake of a probable fine, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) isn't expected to be fined because it acted as whistle blower in the case.
British Airways  in May 2007 said it had provisioned GBP350 million for  fines in the U.S. and EU. The
commission's probe--which started in 2006 with unannounced raids at the companies'
headquarters--initially targeted more than 20 carriers and more than 10 are likely to be  fined, the

Brussels probe part of global inquiry

TD
DoJ has handed out $1.6bn in penalties

Some of the world's leading  airlines  are bracing for fines running into hundreds of millions of  euros this week when antitrust regulators in Brussels are expected to hand down a much-delayed decision in their four-year-old air cargo cartel probe.

Japan Airlines, British  Airways  and Air France-KLM are among the carriers awaiting the outcome of the European part of a global investigation that has already seen  fines of more than $1.6bn being imposed by the US Department of Justice alone.

More than 20 airlines  have agreed to pay fines, and at least four executives have been sentenced to jail since regulators launched surprise raids on airlines  around the world in early 2006.

Separately, several have paid millions to settle civil claims brought against them by shippers who say they were victims of a  cartel to fix prices for  air freight shipments.
Other civil cases are still under way in the UK and the Netherlands and the outcome of the  European
case is expected to have big implications for these.

Action from  European Commission investigators was originally expected more than a year ago. But the case has been delayed for various reasons. Some  airlines,  for example, argued the economic downturn that saw many of them suffer large losses made it impossible for them to pay hefty  fines without endangering their viability.
Others have claimed they were sucked into the  cartel as a result of their membership of  airline
alliances and had abided by local regulatory requirements.

The decision, which could come as early as Tuesday, will be carefully scrutinised to see which carriers have been penalised and how individual  fines have been determined. Lufthansa is expected to receive immunity because it acted as a whistleblower.
But others could face large penalties on top of those already paid.

British  Airways,  which agreed to pay $300m in  fines in the US to settle charges of fixing cargo and passenger prices and saw a former cargo manager, Keith Packer, serve eight months in prison, set aside £350m ($566m) three years ago to deal with such  fines.
Other airlines  have made similar provisions.

In the High Court in London, BA has been sued by two UK flower importers, and judges are still deciding whether the case should be allowed to go ahead on a representative basis, so other parties can seek damages if they are successful.

Separately, several hundred companies - led by Philips and Sweden's Ericsson - have brought proceedings against  Air France-KLM and Martinair in the Netherlands.

The companies' lawyers allege they have suffered more than €400m ($562m) of damage as a result of price-fixing. A first court date has been set for March.

BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) -  Air France-KLM , British  Airways  and nine other airlines  were fined a total of 799 million  euros ($1.11 billion) by EU regulators on Tuesday in a price-fixing case that could open the way for private claims against the companies.

The European Commission said in a statement the carriers coordinated surcharges for fuel and security without discounts between late 1999 to early 2006.
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
The European Commission slapped a 340 million-euro fine, the biggest in the case, on the
Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM, which was formed from a merger in 2004 and which acquired
Martinair in 2008.

Air France-KLM said in reaction that the penalty was disproportionate and it would appeal to the court. [ID:nWEA8176]
It already faces a claim for up to 500 million euros from a group of companies that includes Ericsson and
Philips , seeking compensation for alleged air cargo price-fixing. [ID:nLDE68S225]
HUNDREDS OF PRIVATE CLAIMANTS

Litigation firm Claims Funding International (CFI) which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the companies, said the number of claimants could increase.
"We have hundreds of companies waiting for the  Commission decision before they sign up," said Peter
Koutsoukis, CFI managing director. A Dutch court is due to hear the case on March 30.
The EU regulator finedBritish Airways  104 million euros, Singapore Airlines 74.8 million euros, Cathay
Pacific 57.12 million euros, Qantas 8.9 million euros and Japan Airlines 35.7 million euros.
Luxembourg-based Cargolux Airlines was fined 79.9 million euros and LAN Chile 8.2 million  euros.

Air Canada , which was  fined 21 million euros, said it may appeal the decision. It also said it had made a C$125 million provision related to the case in 2008 [nN09295430].

SAS , which was  fined 70.2 million euros, said it would appeal, but would provide for the charge in its third-quarter earnings to be announced on Wednesday.

Lufthansa was found guilty of taking part in the  cartel but received immunity from punishment because it had alerted the  Commission to the existence of the price-fixing scheme. Swiss International  Air Lines, acquired by Lufthansa in 2005, also escaped a  fine.

VANCOUVER, Nov 9 (Reuters) -  Air Canada said on Tuesday it may appeal a decision by the
European Commission to fine it 21.03 million  euros ($29 million) in a cargo price-fixing case.

Air Canada, one of a number of  air cargo carriers fined a total of 799 million  euros by European antitrust regulators, said the penalty is "more than adequately" covered by a C$125 million ($125 million) provision it made in 2008.

Depending on its review of the EC's decision, Canada's biggest  airline said it may adjust the provision in its fourth-quarter results.

Air France-KLM was slapped with a 340 million euro fine, the biggest in the case, which also includes
British  Airways  , Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines .

The European Commission said the carriers co-ordinated surcharges for fuel and security without discounts between late 1999 to early 2006.

BRITISH Airways,  Air France-KLM and 11 other carriers are set to be  fined a total of around 800 million euros (£689.2m) by EU anti-trust regulators for fixing cargo prices, a source said.

The European Commission charged the carriers in December 2007 with participating in an  air freight cartel, following raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that also involved the US Department of Justice.

TD
“Thirteen  airlines  will be fined, of which six are non-European carriers,” said the senior  European
source.
The fines are expected to be announced in Brussels later today.

Other carriers facing fines include Singapore  Airlines, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, the source said. The Commission had initially targeted more than 20 companies in its probe.
The Commission can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their global sales for breaching EU
rules, but fines rarely reach that level.

The European Commission on Tuesday announced nearly 800 million  euros (1.1 billion dollars) in  fines
against 11 air cargo carriers, including British  Airways,  Air France-KLM and Japan  Airlines, for running
a cartel.
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," said  European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

TD
The Air France-KLM group was hit with the biggest  fine, 310 million euros, of which 183 million  euros
was for Air France and 127 million  euros for KLM.
British  Airways  was fined 104 million euros.
The other companies  fined were Air Canada, Martinair, Cargolux, Cathay Pacific  Airways,  Japan
Airlines, LAN Chile, Qantas, SAS and Singapore  Airlines.

Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss International  Air Lines escaped a fine under the commission's leniency programme for being the first to provide information about the cartel.

The 11 cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006, the  European Union's competition watchdog said.

Europe's competition watchdog hit 11  airlines  with nearly 800 million  euros in fines Tuesday for running a global cargo cartel that included  Air France-KLM, British  Airways  and Japan Airlines.
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," said  European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

TD
The fines, totalling 799.4 million  euros (1.1 billion dollars), were slapped on  airlines  that span the globe, from Air Canada and LAN Chile in the Americas to Cathay Pacific  Airways  and Singapore Airlines in Asia and Qantas in Australia.

The 11 cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006, the  European Commission said.
The cartel covered flights from, to and within the  European Economic Area.
The Air France-KLM group was hit with the biggest  fine, 310 million euros, of which 183 million euros
was for Air France and 127 million  euros for KLM. Martinair, which is owned by  Air France, was fined
29.5 million euros.

Air France-KLM said it plans to appeal the  fine.
"The group will file an appeal against the decision in the EU General Court," it said in statement. Elsewhere in Europe, British  Airways  was ordered to pay 104 million  euros, Scandinavia's SAS group
was fined 70.2 million euros and Luxembourg's Cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million  euros.
In Asia, Singapore  Airlines was fined 74.8 million euros, Cathay was hit with 57.1 million  euros and
Japan Airlines will pay 35.7 million euros.

Air Canada must pay 21 million  euros while Qantas and LAN Chile got the smallest  fines, 8.9 million and
8.2 million euros, respectively.
Five airlines  applied for a reduction in the  fine, claiming they were unable to pay it, but the  commission
said none of them met the conditions.

Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss International  Air Lines escaped a fine under the commission's leniency programme for being the first to provide information about the cartel.

The commission said it dropped charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm which it did not name.

The cartel initially began with contacts between  airlines  to ensure that worldwide  air freight carriers imposed a "flat rate surchage per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said.
The cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge. The companies refused to pay a
commission on such surcharges to their clients, the regulator said.


Page 48 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers," the  commission said.
SAS also said it would appeal the  fine.

"We adamantly maintain that these isolated incidents do not mean that SAS Cargo has been involved in a global cartel," the  airline's chief legal officer, Mats Loennkvist, said in a statement.

"We are highly disappointed and strongly contest the considerable level of the  fines, which we believe to be disproportionate to SAS Cargo’s actions."

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Fines for "air freight  cartel" WC    330 words

Brussels, 08/11/2010 (Agence  Europe) - As announced (EUROPE 10241), without any further delays, Joaquin Almunia, the vice-president of the  Commission with responsibility for competition issues, is to announce the names of the companies found to have taken part in the  air freight cargo, together with the corresponding fines, on 9 November.

According to Les Echos, these  fines will be calculated on the basis of the turnover made by each company in the "freight" sector. This may be between 0 and 30% of the turnover of the company, multiplied by the number of years of fraud, plus a "right of entry" of 15% to 25% of the turnover. They will be assigned a "seriousness" coefficient, to be left to the discretion of the  Commission, which will take account of attenuating or aggravating circumstances, such as the degree of "cooperation" with its investigations, repeat performances, etc.

TD
Of the large companies involved, top of the list is likely to be  Air France-KLM and its subsidiary Martinair, which, Les Echos reports, is set to face a  fine of between 150 and 250 million  euros, but could be granted a reduction of up to 20% due to its degree of cooperation. British  Airways  is set to be  fined between 60 and 80 million euros, with a rebate of 30 to 50% for having been quick to cooperate. For having blown the whistle on the cartel, Lufthansa, which was incidentally one of its instigators, may come out of it rather
well, escaping fines altogether or having to pay only a very small one. The other companies involved are believed to be SAS, Alitalia, Japan  Airlines, Cathay Pacific,  Air Canada and All Nippon  Airways.

Companies which have faced similar measures in the United States, Canada and Australia for the activities of the same  cartel may ask the Commission to take account solely of the turnover achieved from Europe, to avoid double penalisation. (F.G./trans.fl)

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is likely to fine more than 10 airlines  Tuesday, ending investigations into an alleged global cartel in air-freight transport that dragged on for years, people familiar with the case said Monday.

The commission, the European Union's executive arm, could fine the airlines  -- including some of Europe's largest, such as Air France-KLM SA and British Airways  PLC -- hundreds of millions of euros for colluding in setting surcharges, mainly a fuel surcharge, for their cargo operations.

TD
Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo.

In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.5 billion were levied against  airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges. Eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

In Europe, the commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue, though penalties tend to be much smaller.
The recent economic downturn and the big hit  airlines  have taken from it might also prompt EU
authorities to limit the  fines.

Some companies, including British  Airways  and Luxembourg-based Cargolux, have been putting money aside because of the prospect of a probable  fine, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG isn't expected to be  fined because it acted as whistle-blower in the case, one person familiar with the case said.
British  Airways  in May 2007 said it had provisioned GBP 350 million ($566.5 million) for  fines in the
U.S. and EU.

Air France-KLM -- which now also owns Netherlands-based passenger and cargo  airline Martinair -- provisioned 530 million euros ($743.8 million) for  fines in different regions, while Scandinavian airlineSAS AB didn't make any provision.

The commission's probe -- which started in 2006 -- initially targeted more than 20 carriers and more than 10 are likely to be  fined, the people familiar with the case said.

The commission, the EU's antitrust body, declined to confirm the  fines' announcement, which is expected Tuesday afternoon in Brussels. The companies will have two months to appeal to the European Court of Justice, after the  commission makes a decision.

Air France-KLM and Cargolux declined to comment. British  Airways  said only that it didn't know the decision would be announced Tuesday.

HD         EU Fines Airlines $1.11 Billion in Cartel Case

BRUSSELS—The European Commission on Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of €799 million ($1.11 billion) for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France-KLM SA received the largest  fine with €340 million, including the three different  airlines
that are now part of the group—Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair.

TD
British  Airways  PLC was fined €104 million.

Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.6 billion were levied against airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

According to the  commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation—which initially targeted more than 20 companies—started with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters.

Initially, "the carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that worldwide  airfreight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said in a statement. "The  cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients," it said.
Other airlines fined include Singapore  Airlines Ltd.,  fined €74.8 million, Qantas  Airways  Ltd. with
€8.8 million, Cathay Pacific  Airways  Ltd., with €57.1 million and Japan  Airlines International Co.,  fined
€35.7 million.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB €70.2 million, LAN Chile €8.2 million, Luxembourg-based Cargolux €79.9 million and  Air Canada €21 million.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG wasn't  fined because it acted as a whistle-blower in the case, the
commission said.

The commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue. The EU didn't  fine any U.S. company because it didn't find enough evidence to do so,  European Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said during a press conference to announce the decision.

Some companies, including British Airways  and Cargolux, have been putting money aside because of the prospect of a  fine. British Airways  said Tuesday that the  fine falls within its provision. The
company said in May 2007 that it had provisioned £350 million ($654.6 million) for  fines in the U.S. and
EU, while  Air France-KLM provisioned €530 million for  fines in different regions.

Air France-KLM said it will appeal the decision. "The  Air France-KLM group considers that the level of the fines is disproportionate given the fact that the economic analysis produced within the context of the procedure demonstrated that the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight

Page 55 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
shippers nor the freight forwarders. Moreover, the level of the  fines disregards the economic hardship that the  air cargo industry has suffered, and will have a distortive effect on the level playing field," the company said in a statement.

Air France-KLM noted that its  fines exceed the level of provisions it has already taken against
anti-trust litigation, obliging it to book an unexpected €127 million charge to its earnings for the first six
months of its financial year that ends March 31, 2011.  Air France-KLM will release its first-half results
on Nov. 17.

SAS, which didn't make any provision, said Tuesday that it will appeal the  commission's decision, calling the fines disproportionate, while Cargolux said the  fines seems "a very harsh punishment indeed," when added to others due to other antitrust authorities.

Electronics Firm Remains Cautious Despite Net Surge

TD
Toshiba Corp. enjoyed a surge in net profit as electronics makers race to grab a piece of the burgeoning market for smartphones and tablet computers that use the flash-memory chips the Japanese company makes.

Yet Toshiba remained cautious despite the solid earnings, leaving its full-year outlook unchanged, citing a challenging foreign-exchange environment that threatens Japan's economy.

Toshiba, which also makes consumer electronics and nuclear power plants, on Tuesday posted a fiscal second-quarter net profit of 27.35 billion yen ($336.8 million) compared with a profit of 94 million yen in the same period a year earlier.

Operating profit surged to 71.02 billion yen from 36.46 billion yen. Revenue rose 3% to 1.630 trillion yen from 1.583 trillion yen.

As foreshadowed by Ten last week, Chairman Nick Falloon said that he will leave the company following its annual shareholder meeting in December.
Ten wouldn't comment on a successor. A spokeswoman said the issue is "a matter for the board." Mr. Murdoch, a nonexecutive director of News Corp., said he is looking forward to "working
collaboratively with the company on its multichannel strategies and working with the other directors to
grow value for all of the company's shareholders."

Chinese Video Site Files

Tudou Holdings Ltd., one of the largest Chinese online video companies, filed plans for an initial public offering in the U.S., giving a first glimpse into the finances of China's highly competitive online video sector.

Tudou operates a website similar to Google Inc.'s YouTube, allowing users to watch streaming video and to upload their own content. But unlike YouTube, the bulk of Tudou's videos are made up of licensed professional content such as Chinese-language television shows. YouTube, which also offers some content from large media companies, is blocked in China.

The Shanghai-based company reported in Monday's prospectus that it was still operating at a loss as of September, but that losses shrank to 83.7 million yuan ($12.5 million) in the first nine months of this year, or roughly 17% less than the same period in 2009. Tudou, which has raised a total of $135 million in funding since its website went live in 2005, hopes to list American depository shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Watchmaker's Profit Jumps 93% on Improved Sales

Fossil Inc.'s third-quarter profit surged 93% as the company's sales jumped sharply and margins improved, with results handily topping expectations.

The watch and fashion-accessories retailer has seen significant improvement in its results as wholesale shipments in the U.S. and same-store sales remained strong in a resumption in consumer spending on discretionary items.

Fossil posted earnings of $68.2 million, or $1 a share, up from $35.3 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 37% to $523.8 million.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Tuesday fined 11 air cargo carriers, including Air France-KLM and British Airways,  a total of 799 million euros (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) for price fixing in cargo services.

TD
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," said Joaquin Almunia,  commission vice president in charge of competition.
The 11 carriers fined by the commission were Air Canada, Air France-KLM, British  Airways,  Cathay
Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Martinair, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas.

Germany's Lufthansa, which also participated in the price- fixing cartel, received full immunity from penalty because it was the first to provide information about the cartel.

The commission found that the carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over six years, from December 1999 to February 2006.

The cartel arrangements consisted of numerous contacts between  airlines,  at both bilateral and multilateral level, covering flights from, to and within  Europe.

Air France-KLM was hit with the biggest sum of  fine, which amounted to 183 million euros (255 million U.S. dollars), while British  Airways  came in second, facing a  fine of 104 million euros (145 million U.S. dollars).

HD      European Union fines 11 airlines euro800 million for fixing  cargo prices

BRUSSELS (AP) - The  European Union on Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total euro799.4 million ($1.1 billion) for fixing prices on international cargo shipments, leading to higher prices for businesses to move their goods.
The European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said "the carriers coordinated their action
on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts" between December 1999 and February 2006, when
the EU's investigation stopped the  cartel.

TD
"Had it not been for the  commission's intervention, the  cartel would not have ended in 2006," said
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Air France-KLM received the largest  fine and has to pay euro310.1 million, while British Airways  PLC was fined euro104 million. Air France-KLM will also have to pay the  euro29.5 million fine for Martinair, which it now owns.

Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas will also have to pay  fines between euro8.2 million and euro79.9 million.

The commission dropped charges against 11 other carriers and one consultancy, because it couldn't prove they participated in the  cartel.

Lufthansa escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel. All other carriers, except Singapore Airlines, had their fines reduced by between 15 percent and 50 percent for cooperating with the EU's investigation.

BA said the fine doesn't exceed the money it set aside in 2007 to cover potential antitrust penalties. As of September, the airline had spent 174 million pounds ($280 million) of the 350 million pounds it had provisioned for fines and litigation.
KLM-Air France had no immediate comment.

It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of European businesses and European consumers" Almunia said. "With today's decision the Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behavior."

The U.S. Department of Justice has already charged 18  airlines  and several executives in its investigation of the cargo  cartel and imposed more than US$1.6 billion in  fines.

The EU can't pursue companies or individuals with criminal charges, but Almunia didn't rule out that individual countries might impose criminal charges.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

TD
Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest  fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group --Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.5 billion were levied against airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

According to the  commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation --which initially targeted more than 20 companies-- started with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters.

Initially, "the carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that worldwide  airfreight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said in a statement. "The cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients," it said.

Other airlines fined include Singapore  Airlines Ltd. (C6L.SG),  fined EUR74.8 million, Qantas  Airways Ltd. (QAN.AU) with EUR8.8 million, Cathay Pacific  Airways  Ltd. (0293.HK), with EUR57.1 million and Japan Airlines International Co.,  fined EUR35.7 million.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB (SAS.SK) EUR70.2 million, LAN Chile (LAN.SN) EUR8.2 million, Luxembourg-based Cargolux EUR79.9 million and  Air Canada (AC.B.T) EUR21 million.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) wasn't  fined because it acted as a whistle-blower in the case, the
commission said.
The commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue.
The EU didn't  fine any U.S. company because it didn't find enough evidence to do so,  European
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said during a press conference to announce the decision.

Some companies, including British  Airways  and Cargolux, have been putting money aside because of the prospect of a  fine.

British  Airways  said Tuesday that the fine falls within its provision. The company said in May 2007 that it had provisioned GBP350 million for fines in the U.S. and EU, while  Air France-KLM provisioned
EUR530 million for  fines in different regions.

SAS, which didn't make any provision, said Tuesday that it will appeal the  commission's decision, calling the fines disproportionate, while Cargolux said the  fines seems "a very harsh punishment indeed," when added to others due to other antitrust authorities.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Franco-Dutch airlineAir France-KLM (AF.FR) said Tuesday the size of the  fines levied against it and 10 other international airlines  by the European Commission for having organized a global cartel on air cargo tariffs is "disproportionate," and said it will appeal the decision.

The Air France-KLM group, including its Dutch cargo unit Martinair, was  fined a total of EUR339.6 million, or 43% of the total amount of EUR799 million of the EU  fines.

"The Air France-KLM group considers that the level of the  fines is disproportionate given the fact that the economic analysis produced within the context of the procedure demonstrated that the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight shippers nor the freight forwarders. Moreover, the level of the fines disregards the economic hardship that the  air cargo industry has suffered, and will have a distortive effect on the level playing field," the company said in a statement.

Air France-KLM noted that its  fines exceeds the level of provisions it has already taken against
anti-trust litigation, obliging it to book an unexpected EUR127 million charge to its earnings for the first
six months of its financial year that ends March 31, 2011.  Air France-KLM will release its first-half

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Franco-Dutch airlineAir France-KLM (AF.FR) said Tuesday the size of the  fines levied against it and 10 other international airlines  by the European Commission for having organized a global cartel on air cargo tariffs is "disproportionate," and said it will appeal the decision.

The Air France-KLM group, including its Dutch cargo unit Martinair, was  fined a total of EUR339.6 million, or 43% of the total amount of EUR799 million of the EU  fines.

"The Air France-KLM group considers that the level of the  fines is disproportionate given the fact that the economic analysis produced within the context of the procedure demonstrated that the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight shippers nor the freight forwarders. Moreover, the level of the fines disregards the economic hardship that the  air cargo industry has suffered, and will have a distortive effect on the level playing field," the company said in a statement.

Air France-KLM noted that its  fines exceed the level of provisions that it has already taken against antitrust litigation, obliging it to book an unexpected EUR127 million charge to its earnings for the first six months of its current financial year that ends March 31, 2011.  Air France-KLM will release its
first-half results on Nov. 17.

Air France-KLM has been involved since 2006, with 25 other  airlines  in antitrust investigations launched by several countries over allegations of anticompetitive agreements or concerted action in the air freight industry.


Page 67 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the financial year ended March 31, 2009, the carrier paid a total of EUR230.3 million in  fines in the U.S., Canada and Australia following plea bargaining arrangements. Martinair, which  Air France-KLM took over subsequently, has also been  fined EUR31.6 million in these countries.

Air France-KLM has outstanding antitrust litigation in Switzerland, Brazil and South Africa. The  airline
is also appealing a South Korean accusation of anticompetitive agreements amongst itself and 26 other
airlines.

These outstanding litigations don't include possible risks from class action suits by forwarding agents and air freight shippers who claim to have suffered from the  cartel's price-fixing  cartel.
Up until Tuesday,  Air France-KLM had provisioned a total of EUR530 million against litigation risks.

SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Qantas Airways  Ltd. (QAN.AU) on Wednesday confirmed it has received notification from the European Commission of an EUR8.8 million  fine for being part of a global  cartel involved in fixing  air-freight tariffs.
The EC on Tuesday  fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million.

TD
A spokesman for Qantas said notice of the  fine is now being examined, adding the Australian carrier may have more to say on the matter later in the day.

The EC's antitrust body has alleged the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006.

Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest  fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group --Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  Plc (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

Other airlines  fined include Singapore  Airlines Ltd. (C6L.SG), fined EUR74.8 million, Cathay Pacific Airways  Ltd. (0293.HK), with EUR57.1 million and Japan Airlines International Co.,  fined EUR35.7 million.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB (SAS.SK) EUR70.2 million, LAN Chile (LAN.SN) EUR8.2 million, Luxembourg-based Cargolux EUR79.9 million and  Air Canada (AC.B.T) EUR21 million.

The fine for Qantas comes after a difficult week, with the  airline forced to ground its fleet of  Airbus A380s after an engine explosion forced one of its  aircaft to make an emergency landing in Singapore last week.

The A380s problems were quickly followed by an  air incident involving a Qantas 747, which was also forced to make an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi  Airport.

2244 GMT [Dow Jones] Qantas (QAN.AU) confirms it's received notification of  European Commission EUR8.8 million  fine for being part of global  cartel involved in fixing  air-freight tariffs. Suffice it to say, it isn't QAN's week. The  airline was forced to ground fleet of A380s after an engine explosion prompted the emergency landing of one of its planes in Singapore less then week ago; then two other QAN planes landed with technical problems. The airline's shares are down 7.4% since before A380 incident. QAN
just one of 11 airlines  fined by the EC; its fine paled in comparison to those slapped on  Air France KLM (AF.FR), which was fined EUR340 million, British  Airways  (BAY.LN),  fined EUR104 million. Still, more bad news for QAN isn't likely to help the stock. A QAN spokesman said notice of the  fine being
examined, it might have more to say later in day. QAN last at A$2.75. (cynthia.koons@dowjones.com)

HD       UPDATE: EU Fines 11 Airlines EUR799 Million  For Air Cargo Cartel

(Adds details, background.)

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

TD
Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest  fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group --Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.5 billion were levied against airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

According to the  commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation --which initially targeted more than 20 companies-- started with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters.

Initially, "the carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that worldwide  airfreight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said in a statement. "The cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients," it said.

Other airlines fined include Singapore  Airlines Ltd. (C6L.SG),  fined EUR74.8 million, Qantas  Airways Ltd. (QAN.AU) with EUR8.8 million, Cathay Pacific  Airways  Ltd. (0293.HK), with EUR57.1 million and Japan Airlines International Co.,  fined EUR35.7 million.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB (SAS.SK) EUR70.2 million, LAN Chile (LAN.SN) EUR8.2 million, Luxembourg-based Cargolux EUR79.9 million and  Air Canada (AC.B.T) EUR21 million.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) wasn't  fined because it acted as a whistle-blower in the case, the
commission said.
The commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue.
The EU didn't  fine any U.S. company because it didn't find enough evidence to do so,  European
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said during a press conference to announce the decision.

Some companies, including British  Airways  and Cargolux, have been putting money aside because of the prospect of a  fine.

British  Airways  said Tuesday that the fine falls within its provision. The company said in May 2007 that it had provisioned GBP350 million for fines in the U.S. and EU, while  Air France-KLM provisioned EUR530 million for  fines in different regions.

SAS, which didn't make any provision, said Tuesday that it will appeal the  commission's decision, calling the fines disproportionate, while Cargolux said the  fines seems "a very harsh punishment indeed," when added to others due to other antitrust authorities.

The European Commission is today expected to  fineBritish Airways  and 12 other carriers for fixing
air cargo prices, with the penalty expected to total about €800m (£690m).

The fine is the culmination of a three-year investigation by  European competition regulators into an alleged air-freight  cartel.

TD
A group of carriers, which also includes  Air France-KLM, was charged in December 2007 following raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that involved the US Department of Justice.

EC Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia is expected to announce the fine this afternoon. "Thirteen  airlines  will be fined, of which six are non-European carriers," one European source told Reuters.
More than 200 European companies, led by Ericsson and Philips Electronics, have launched a
€400m damages claim, alleging they were victims of the  cartel.

Eleven airlines,  including British  Airways,  Air France-KLM, Australia's Qantas and Japan's JAL, have been hit with fines totalling almost €800m ($1.1bn) for running an  air cargo cartel in Europe for six years.

The European Commission, Europe's antitrust regulator, announced the penalties on Tuesday after a four-year inquiry. Its decision will give fresh impetus to large private damages claims from companies that feel they were overcharged by the  airlines'  air cargo services between late-1999 and 2006, when the cartel was running. Two potential group claims are being lined up in the English and Dutch courts, the latter said to be seeking at least €500m.

TD
Airlines faced with the largest  fines are Air France (€182.9m), KLM (€127.2m) and BA (€104m).

Other carriers affected include  Air Canada (€21m), Martinair (€29.5m), Cargolux (€79.9m), Cathay Pacific (€57.1m), JAL (€35.7m), LAN Chile (€8.2m), Qantas (€8.9m), SAS (€70.2m) and Singapore Airlines (€74.8m).

Lufthansa and its Swiss  Airlines subsidiary received immunity from any  fines because the German carrier "blew the whistle" on the illegal arrangements.

Inquiries started in 2006 when officials raided the offices of several  air cargo companies seeking evidence they were co-ordinating pricing on fuel surcharges. A formal investigation was opened in December 2007.

The probe was part of a global investigation into  air cargo practices, involving regulators in the US and Asia. So far, more than 20 international carriers have admitted involvement in North American, Asian and Australian proceedings and paid large  fines. As of last year, the US Department of Justice alone had imposed penalties of more than $1.6bn. Some individuals faced criminal prosecutions.
SAS and  Air France said they planned to appeal against the "disproportionate"  fines.

The commission said the carriers colluded to impose a flat-rate surcharge per kilo on all shipments and extended their co-operation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay  commission on surcharges to freight forwarders.

The fines had been anticipated but the case was delayed as the  airlines  tried to argue down the amount, saying their viability was in jeopardy.

Joaquín Almunia,  European Union competition commissioner, said that none of the "inability to pay" applications succeeded and that alliance agreements were not a "blank cheque" for collusive behaviour. "There were pricing discussions that were illegal," he said.

The commission's investigation involved more than 20  airlines  initially. Asked why some carriers no longer featured, Mr Almunia said those that were listed on Tuesday were "all companies where the facts demonstrated their participation".

British  Airways,  Air France-KLM and 11 other carriers are expected to be  fined a total of about
€800m (£690m) by EU antitrust regulators for fixing cargo prices.

TD
The European Commission charged the carriers in December 2007 with participating in an  air freight cartel, following raids on both sides of the Atlantic a year earlier that also involved the US Department of Justice.
"Thirteen  airlines  will be fined, of which six are non-European carriers," said a senior  European
source.

The Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is set to announce the  fine in Brussels this afternoon.

British  Airways  could be penalised by as much as €120m, the source said. Reports last month suggested it was facing a  fine of between €60m and €80m.

HD               Airlines fined over cargo route price fixing

LP
The European Commission today imposed a €104m  fine on British  Airways  for its part in cargo route price fixing involving a number of  airlines.

The EC fine follows penalties inflicted on BA in America, Canada and Australia for the offence which involved fuel surcharges on international  airfreight.

TD
Air France and Dutch carrier KLM were among other  airlines  also fined today by the EC.

Air France was fined the most – €183m – and in total the  airlines  involved were fined nearly
€800m.

The Commission said BA and the other carriers coordinated their action on fuel surcharges over a period of six years.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," said  European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
"With today’s decision the  Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel
behaviour."
The cartel operated from December 1999 to February 2006, said a  Commission statement.

"The cartel arrangements consisted of numerous contacts between airlines,  at both bilateral and multilateral level, covering flights from, to and within the EEA (European Economic Area).

"Airlines providing airfreight services primarily offer the transport of cargo to freight forwarders, who arrange the carriage of these goods including associated services and formalities on behalf of shippers."

The cartel began as a discussion between the  airlines  on fuel surcharges: ''The carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that worldwide  air freight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments.

"The cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients (freight forwarders)."

The aim, said the  Commission, was to ensure that all carriers applied the surcharges and that any increases or decreases of the surcharge levels were equally applied, in full, but all in the  cartel.

"By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers. Such practices are in breach of the EU competition rules," said the  Commission statement.




Page 83 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said it set the levels of  fines against the various  airlines  taking into account "the sales of the companies involved in the market concerned, the very serious nature of the infringement, the EEA-wide scope of the  cartel and its duration".

All carriers received a  fine reduction of 15% because of what the  Commission called a "general regulatory environment in the sector which can be seen as encouraging price co-ordination.

Four carriers, including BA, were also granted a 10% reduction for their "limited participation" in the illegal cartel deal.

Lufthansa received full immunity under the  Commission’s "Leniency Programme", because it brought the  cartel to the Commission’s attention and provided "valuable" information.

The maximum fine the Commission could impose on any single carrier is 10% of their 2009 turnover.

HD     EU Fines 11 Airlines $1.1 Billion for Cargo Cartel

The European Union Nov. 9 fined 11 airlines  $1.1 billion for their role in a global  cartel that colluded to fix air cargo rates.

Air France-KLM,  Europe's biggest cargo  airline, was hit with the largest  fine of $476 million while British
Airways  has to pay $145.6 million and Singapore  Airlines $104.7 million.

TD
The announcement of the  fines brings to a close a four year investigation that began with dawn raids on
airline offices on both sides of the Atlantic.
The 11 airlines  "coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts," between
2000 and 2006, the  European Commission, the EU's executive said.
The cartel "would have continued" had the  Commission not intervened, EU competition commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said.
The Commission was due to hand down its decision a year ago, but the case was delayed as  airlines
claimed they could not pay heavy  fines due to the slump in the  air cargo market.

The other  airlines  <a href="/air-expedited/eu-fines-cargolux-112-million-air-cargo-cartel" target="_blank"><u>facing EU fines include Cargolux $112 million</u></a>, SAS Scandinavian  Airline System $98.3 million, Cathay Pacific $80 million, Japan  Air Lines $50 million, Martinair $41.3 million and Air Canada $29.4 million.
Australian  airline Qantas and LAN Chile were both  fined around $12 million.
Lufthansa was found guilty price fixing but escaped  fines because it notified the  Commission of the
cartel and co-operated in its investigations.

The air cargo fines fall short of the EU's largest anti-trust penalty of $1.93 billion imposed on a  cartel of automobile glass makers in 2008.
The airlines  have two months to launch an appeal in the  European Court of Justice.

The U.S., which has been running a parallel investigation to the EU probe, has so far imposed  fines of more than $1.6 billion on 18 airlines  and <a href="/air-expedited/justice-air" target="_blank"><u>filed criminal charges against 14 airline executives</u></a> for price fixing.

Air France-KLM paid the biggest U.S.  fine of $350 million while British  Airways  and Korean Air were each fined $300 million.

Europe's competition watchdog has hit 11  airlines  with over a billion dollars in fines for running a global cargo cartel that included  Air France-KLM, British  Airways  and Japan Airlines.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," said  European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia on Tuesday.

TD
The fines, totalling $1.1 bn, were slapped on airlines  that span the globe, from  Air Canada and LAN Chile in the Americas to Cathay Pacific Airways  and Singapore Airlines in Asia and Qantas in Australia.

The 11 cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006, the  European Commission said.
The cartel covered flights from, to and within the  European Economic Area.

The Air France-KLM group was hit with the biggest  fine, $432m , of which $255m was for  Air France and $177m for KLM.

Air France-KLM said it plans to appeal the  fine.
"The group will file an appeal against the decision in the EU General Court," it said in statement. Five airlines  applied for a reduction in the  fine, claiming they were unable to pay it, but the
commission said none of them met the conditions.

Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss International  Air Lines escaped a fine under the commission's leniency programme for being the first to provide information about the cartel.

The commission said it dropped charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm which it did not name.

The cartel initially began with contacts between  airlines  to ensure that worldwide  air freight carriers imposed a "flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said.

The cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge. The companies refused to pay a commission on such surcharges to their clients, the regulator said.

"By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers," the  commission said.
SAS also said it would appeal the  fine.

"We adamantly maintain that these isolated incidents do not mean that SAS Cargo has been involved in a global cartel," the  airline's chief legal officer, Mats Loennkvist, said in a statement.

"We are highly disappointed and strongly contest the considerable level of the  fines, which we believe to be disproportionate to SAS Cargo's actions."

Eleven airlines,  including British  Airways,  Air France-KLM, Australia’s Qantas and Japan’s JAL, have been hit with fines totalling almost €800m ($1.1bn) for running an  air cargo cartel in Europe for six years.

The European Commission, Europe’s antitrust regulator, announced the penalties on Tuesday after a four-year inquiry. Its decision will give fresh impetus to large private damages claims from companies that feel they were overcharged by the  airlines’  air cargo services between late-1999 and 2006, when the cartel was running. Two potential group claims are being lined up in the English and Dutch courts, the latter said to be seeking at least €500m.

TD
Airlines faced with the largest  fines are Air France (€182.9m), KLM (€127.2m) and BA (€104m).

Other carriers affected include  Air Canada (€21m), Martinair (€29.5m), Cargolux (€79.9m), Cathay Pacific (€57.1m), JAL (€35.7m), LAN Chile (€8.2m), Qantas (€8.9m), SAS (€70.2m) and Singapore Airlines (€74.8m).

Lufthansa and its Swiss  Airlines subsidiary received immunity from any  fines because the German carrier “blew the whistle” on the illegal arrangements.

Inquiries started in 2006 when officials raided the offices of several  air cargo companies seeking evidence they were co-ordinating pricing on fuel surcharges. A formal investigation was opened in December 2007.

The probe was part of a global investigation into  air cargo practices, involving regulators in the US and Asia. So far, more than 20 international carriers have admitted involvement in North American, Asian and Australian proceedings and paid large  fines. As of last year, the US Department of Justice alone had imposed penalties of more than $1.6bn. Some individuals faced criminal prosecutions.
SAS and  Air France said they planned to appeal against the “disproportionate”  fines.

The commission said the carriers colluded to impose a flat-rate surcharge per kilo on all shipments and extended their co-operation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay  commission on surcharges to freight forwarders.

The fines had been anticipated but the case was delayed as the  airlines  tried to argue down the amount, saying their viability was in jeopardy.

Joaquín Almunia,  European Union competition commissioner, said that none of the “inability to pay” applications succeeded and that alliance agreements were not a “blank cheque” for collusive behaviour. “There were pricing discussions that were illegal,” he said.

The commission’s investigation involved more than 20  airlines  initially. Asked why some carriers no longer featured, Mr Almunia said those that were listed on Tuesday were “all companies where the facts demonstrated their participation”.

BANGKOK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - National carrier Thai  Airways  International PCL said on Wednesday the European Commission had dropped charges against it relating to competition rules in the cargo sector and it did not now face any  fine.

The airline had booked 4.29 billion baht ($145.2 million) in provisions related to the case since 2008, it said in a statement.

Earlier 11 airlines,  including Air France-KLM and British  Airways  , were fined a total of 799 million euros ($1.11 billion) by EU regulators in a price-fixing case that could open the way for private claims against the companies.

HD        BA fined £90m for global cargo price fixing  cartel

LP
BRITISH  AIRWAYS was fined £90million yesterday for its involvement in a six-year price-fixing scam.

The EC penalty follows others imposed on BA in the US, Canada and Australia for the offences, which involved fuel surcharges on international  airfreight. Air France and Dutch carrier KLM were among other airlines  also fined by the EC.

TD
Air France was fined the most - £159million - but the BA  fine was the second biggest. In total the 11 airlines  involved were hit by £690million in penalties. 'It is deplorable that so many major  airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers,' said European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

A surcharge is an additional fee levied by the  airline to cover any fuel price rises after the flight ticket was issued.
The cartel operated from December 1999 to February 2006 and began as a discussion between the
airlines  on fuel surcharges.

The carriers contacted each other so as to ensure worldwide  air freight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments. Cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients (freight forwarders).

The aim, said the  commission, was to ensure all carriers applied the surcharges and that any increases or decreases of the surcharge levels were equally applied in full.

In a statement last night BA said it made a £350million provision in its 2006-07 report and accounts to cover the fines.
Lufthansa received full immunity under the  commission's leniency programme because it exposed the
cartel and provided 'valuable' information.

The European Commission has ordered Air Canada to pay $29.4 million in penalties for its role in a price-fixing scheme for air cargo that was deemed to run afoul of  Europe's competition laws.
The country's largest carrier was named among 12 other carriers, including  Air France-KLM and British
Airways,  in the decision and was ordered to pay its portion of roughly $1.1 billion in penalties.

TD
Air Canada had set aside a $125 million provision in 2008 specifically for the  European investigation, which it said yesterday more than adequately covered the  fine.
The company also said it was studying the decision to determine whether it would launch an appeal.

The cargo cartel, which largely centred on the carriers collaborating on setting a worldwide fuel surcharge for cargo, is also being investigated in the U.S. and Canada, and is subject to a series of class-action
suits.

"The provision specifically addressed the proceedings before the  European Commission, but not those in all jurisdictions,"  Air Canada said in a statement. "Management has determined it is not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of all proceedings and investigations."

HD      Qantas hit with $12m cartel fine

The European Commission has fined Qantas and 10 other  airlines  $1 billion for fixing  air cargo prices.

The Commission has found Qantas, British  Airways,  Air France, Japan  Airlines and seven other carriers fixed the price of  air cargo between 1999 and 2006.

TD
The Commission says the "deplorable"  cartel would have continued had it not intervened.
Of the $1 billion  fine, Qantas will shoulder the second lowest share of $12 million.

European Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia says the economic climate at the time is no excuse for collusion.

"The fact that fuel prices were increasing, or that security costs rose after the 2001 terrorist attacks, is not an acceptable reason to stop competing against each other," he said.

"If companies' costs increase, it's normal that their prices also increase. But companies cannot collude to fix the price for customers.

"Let me state clearly that the  Commission supports the consolidation of the  airline industry provided that it does not create monopolies or excessive market power.

"We have approved numerous mergers and alliances in the sector. But the existence of an alliance agreement cannot give a blank cheque for naked price coordination among the members of this alliance."
A Qantas spokesman says the  airline has received official advice on the  fine and is now examining the
European Commission's decision.
The airline says it will make a further statement later today.
The fines follow lengthy investigations by regulators in  Europe, the US and Asia.
The EU says the  airlines  coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts. The investigation began after German  airlineLufthansa blew the whistle on the behaviour.
Lufthansa was involved in the  cartel, but because they came forward they have escaped a  fine.

It is not the first time Qantas has been hit for anti-competitive behaviour. In 2007 it was  fined $US40 million for price fixing in the North American  Air Cargo market.
The head of the competition watchdog says the $1 billion  fine is a reminder of the price of collusion. The ACCC has already  fined Qantas $20 million after it pursued it and several other  airlines  over the
same cartel.

ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel says since July last year executives who engage in cartels are at risk of jail time, and he is amazed executives continue to undertake such practices.

"They'll have to take into account now the fact that if they engage in any serious hardcore  cartel activity, they now face the prospect of going to jail for up to 10 years," he said.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Qantas said its share of the  fine for price-fixing conduct within its freight division between 2000 and 2006 was 8.8 million euros (12.1 million US dollars), adding it would consider in detail the EC's full decision when it was received next week.

"We have acknowledged the improper conduct by the Qantas Freight division over this period," a spokesman for the  airline said.

"Qantas was a leniency applicant and we have fully cooperated with the EC. We have also cooperated fully with all other global regulators."
The fine comes three years after Qantas was  fined 40 million US dollars for price-fixing in the North
American air cargo market.

And it follows a decision by Australia's competition watchdog to  fine Qantas 20 million dollars over the same cartel.

The European Commission said the cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period.

The commission said it dropped charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm which it did not name.

Air New Zealand said it was one of the  airlines  the EC had dropped the charges against, describing the decision as "positive". The carrier refused to comment on why the case against it was dropped.

Cathay Pacific said Wednesday it was considering its legal options after the European Commission     
fined the Hong Kong  airline for running a global cargo  cartel with 10 other carriers.

Europe's competition watchdog Tuesday slapped a  fine totalling 799.4 million  euros (1.1 billion US
dollars) on the 11 airlines  after finding they had coordinated pricing on their cargo business.

TD
Cathay was told to pay 57.1 million  euros.
The watchdog called the deal by the  airlines  -- including Air France-KLM, British Airways  and Japan
Airlines -- "deplorable" and "to the detriment of European businesses and European consumers".

It said the companies coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006.

Cathay said in a statement it was "reviewing the decision and evaluating its options with its legal advisers".

"Cathay Pacific remains committed to its long standing policy of full compliance with the law and reaffirms its support of full and fair competition among  air carriers," it added.
A spokeswoman declined to confirm whether Cathay will file an appeal.

"We are reviewing our options, that's all we can say for now. We will update our shareholders and the stock exchange when we make a decision," she told AFP.
Cathay shares were trading 0.2 percent lower on Wednesday morning at 22.05 Hong Kong dollars (2.84
US dollars).
The cartel covered flights from, to and within the  European Economic Area. ly/pb/dan

France on Wednesday deplored the European Commission's "completely disproportionate"
340-million-euro (470-million-dollar) fine against Air France-KLM for its role in a global cargo  cartel.

European Affairs Minister Pierre Lellouche said he was "shocked by the totally disproportionate nature of this fine in terms of the losses potentially suffered by users of (the) freight service of the group's companies."

TD
The fine "will inflict considerable damage on the French  air sector and adds to losses suffered by the sector in 2009, in the context of the financial crisis," he said in a statement.
Lellouche said the  fine was discriminatory as it exempts from punishment  airlines  that took part in the
cartel but decided to cooperate with the investigation.

The European Commission's competition watchdog on Tuesday hit 11  airlines  with nearly 800 million euros in fines for running a global cargo  cartel that included  Air France-KLM as well as British  Airways and Japan Airlines.

The fines, totalling 799.4 million  euros (1.1 billion dollars), were slapped on airlines  from Air Canada and LAN Chile in the Americas to Cathay Pacific  Airways  and Singapore Airlines in Asia and Qantas in Australia.
French Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau said he was "completely aghast.
"We are with (Environment Minister) Jean-Louis Borloo completely aghast at the amount of the  fine
levied by the European Commission against Air France-KLM," Bussereau told reporters.

"We think that (Air France-KLM) is absolutely right to take this up with  European justice," he said of the company's decision to appeal the ruling.

The 11 cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006, the  European Commission said.
The cartel covered flights from, to and within the  European Economic Area.

The Air France-KLM group was hit with the biggest fine -- 183 million euros for Air France and 127 million euros for KLM. Martinair, which is owned by Air France, was fined 29.5 million euros.

Brussels, Belgium

Europe's competition watchdog hit 11  airlines  with nearly €800-million in fines on Tuesday for running a global cargo cartel that included  Air France-KLM, British  Airways  and Japan Airlines.

TD
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," said  European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The fines, totalling €799,4-million, were slapped on airlines  that span the globe, from  Air Canada and LAN Chile in the Americas to Cathay Pacific Airways  and Singapore Airlines in Asia and Qantas in Australia.

The 11 cargo carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six-year period, between December 1999 and February 2006, the  European Commission said.
The cartel covered flights from, to and within the  European Economic Area.
The Air France-KLM group was hit with the biggest  fine, €310-million, of which €183-million was for  Air
France and €127-million for KLM. Martinair, which is owned by  Air France, was  fined €29,5-million.

Air France-KLM said it plans to appeal the  fine.
"The group will file an appeal against the decision in the EU General Court," it said in statement. Elsewhere in Europe, British  Airways  was ordered to pay €104-million, Scandinavia's SAS group was
fined €70,2-million and Luxembourg's Cargolux will have to pay €79,9-million.
In Asia, Singapore  Airlines was fined €74,8-million, Cathay was hit with €57,1-million and Japan  Airlines
will pay €35,7-million.

Air Canada must pay €21-million while Qantas and LAN Chile got the smallest  fines, €8,9-million and
€8,2-million, respectively.
Leniency
Five airlines  applied for a reduction in the  fine, claiming they were unable to pay it, but the  commission
said none of them met the conditions.

Lufthansa and its subsidiary, Swiss International  Air Lines, escaped a fine under the commission's leniency programme for being the first to provide information about the cartel.

The commission said it dropped charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm, which it did not name.

The cartel initially began with contacts between  airlines  to ensure that worldwide  air freight carriers imposed a "flat rate surchage per kilo for all shipments", the  commission said.
The cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge. The companies refused to pay a
commission on such surcharges to their clients, the regulator said.


Page 110 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers," the  commission said.
SAS also said it would appeal the  fine.

"We adamantly maintain that these isolated incidents do not mean that SAS Cargo has been involved in a global cartel," the  airline's chief legal officer, Mats Loennkvist, said in a statement.

"We are highly disappointed and strongly contest the considerable level of the  fines, which we believe to be disproportionate to SAS Cargo's actions." -- AFP

Singapore, Nov. 10: The cargo unit of Singapore  Airlines (SIA) said it would likely to appeal against the European Commission 74.8 million euros (S$132.5 million)  fine on it and 10 other carriers for their alleged involvement in a global cartel.

The SIA Cargo issued a statement today stating it would look into the basis of such a decision when full details were available. The statement read, "Singapore  Airlines Cargo strongly contests, however, any suggestion that it has been involved in a global conspiracy to fix surcharges or rates." Meanwhile, the European Commission yesterday issued a statement and said that it had  fined 11 airlines  799.5 million euros in total for fixing fuel and security surcharges for over six years.

TD
The carriers include global majors such as Japan Airlines, Qantas,  Air Canada, Air France-KLM and British  Airways,  besides SIA. Joaquin Almunia, the Commission's vice-president for competition, said, "It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers....With today's decision the  Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behaviour."

Air NZ escapes antitrust  fines in Europe that hit 11  airlines

Nov. 10 (BusinessDesk) -  Air New Zealand has escaped censure from the European Commission after the body imposed fines totaling 800 million  euros on 11 airlines  for operating as a cartel.

TD
The EC "has dropped the case against a number of  airlines,  including Air New Zealand, arising from alleged anti competitive conduct in the  air cargo business," the Auckland-based carrier said in a statement to the NZX today. "This brings closure to one more part of the ongoing investigations and proceedings which commenced in February 2006," it said.
Rival Qantas  Airways  was fined 8.9 million euros for its part in the price-fixing activity. The 11  airlines
were fined for cargo activities related to the European Economic Area.

Air France-KLM received the biggest  fine, at 310 million  euros and British  Airways  was fine 104 million
euros.

Other airlines fined included Air Canada, Martinair, Cargolux, Cathay Pacific, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS and Singapore  Airlines.
Shares of Qantas rose 1.1% to $2.78 on the ASX.  Air NZ fell 0.7% to $1.36 on the NZX. (BusinessDesk)

HD       Airlines fined $1.1 billion for price fixing  shipments

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total $1.1 billion for fixing prices on international cargo shipments, leading to higher prices for businesses to move their goods.
The European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said "the carriers coordinated their action
on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts" between December 1999 and February 2006, when
the EU's investigation stopped the  cartel.

TD
"Had it not been for the  commission's intervention, the  cartel would not have ended in 2006," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Air France-KLM received the largest  fine and has to pay euro 310.1 million, while British Airways  PLC was fined euro 182.9 million.  Air France-KLM will also have to pay the  euro 29.5 million fine for Martinair, which it now owns.

Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas will also have to pay  fines between euro 8.2 million and euro 79.9 million.

The commission dropped charges against 11 other carriers and one consultancy, because it couldn't prove they participated in the  cartel.

Lufthansa escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel. All other carriers, except Singapore Airlines, had their fines reduced by between 15 percent and 50 percent for cooperating with the EU's investigation.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of European businesses and European consumers," Almunia said. "With today's decision the Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behavior."

The U.S. Department of Justice has already charged 18  airlines  and several executives in its investigation of the cargo  cartel and imposed more than $1.6 billion in  fines.

The EU can't pursue companies or individuals with criminal charges, but Almunia didn't rule out that individual countries might impose criminal charges.

HD             BRUSSELS FINES BA £90M OVER CARGO CARTEL WC             297 words

LP
BRITISH  Airways  has been slapped with a £90m  fine by Brussels for colluding with rivals to operate a cartel on cargo routes.
The European Commission found BA,  Air France-KLM and nine other  airlines  guilty of fixing  air
freight prices over six years, after Germany’s Lufthansa blew the whistle on the illegal arrangement.

TD
EC competition watchdog Joaquin Almunia, branded the  cartel ‘deplorable’ and said the fines – which amount to nearly £690m for all 11  airlines  involved – showed that the Commission would ‘not tolerate  cartel behaviour’.

The former flag carrier has now been hit with £367m in  fines in just three years, following an earlier scandal when it admitted to fixing fuel surcharges with transatlantic rival Virgin Atlantic.
This latest penalty exceeds expectations of a £70m bill for its anti-competitive behaviour.
But the  airline said it has already set aside £350m to cover  fines relating to both cases in its
2006-07 report, meaning the charge will not affect chief executive Willie Walsh’s pledge to break
even this year, after a record £531m annual loss.

And BA still hopes to shave a £121.5m  fine from the Office of Fair Trading off its mountain of penalties, after a civil case over the collusion with Virgin collapsed.

However, BA (down 1p to 278.4p) could yet be forced to pay out millions to passengers and corporate clients affected by the two scandals.
US passengers have successfully won £30m in the courts over the fuel surcharge affair, while UK
passengers have until 2012 to make a claim.

Companies affected by the  air freight cartel may now also choose to seek recompense through legal channels, adding to BA’s burden as it wrestles to cover from two successive annual losses.

HD     EU fines airlines  over air cargo cartel

The EU has slapped one of its biggest  fines in history on a number of  airlines  for fixing cargo prices. The case involves airlines  that fly around the globe, from  Air France-KLM, to British  Airways  and Quantas.
The European Union's competition watchdog issued  fines Tuesday to 11  airlines  totaling 799.4 million
euros ($1.1 billion) for running a global cargo  cartel.

TD
The cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period, between 1999 and 2006.
"With today's decision, the  European Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate
cartel behavior," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

The fine imposed is one of the biggest in EU history. The bloc's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors.
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers," Almunia added.
No fine for the whistleblower

Air France-KLM was hit with the largest  fine of 310 million euros. British  Airways  came in second, having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty. Luxembourg's Cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million  euros, while Scandinavian carrier SAS was ordered to pay 70.2 million  euros.

Other airlines  involved in the cartel and slapped with  fines were Singapore Airlines, Air Canada, Quantas, LAN Chile, Martinair and Japan  Airlines.
The Commission said it dropped charges against eleven other  airlines,  including German carrier
Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss  Air, because it was the first to provide information about the  cartel.

According to the  commission the cartel the airlines  began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999. Later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a  commission on those surcharges to their clients.

"By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers. Such practices are in breach of the EU competition rules," the  commission said in a statement.

Air NZ escapes antitrust  fines in Europe that hit 11  airlines

Nov. 10 (BusinessDesk) -  Air New Zealand has escaped censure from the European Commission after the body imposed fines totaling 800 million  euros on 11 airlines  for operating as a cartel.

TD
The EC "has dropped the case against a number of  airlines,  including Air New Zealand, arising from alleged anti competitive conduct in the  air cargo business," the Auckland-based carrier said in a statement to the NZX today. "This brings closure to one more part of the ongoing investigations and proceedings which commenced in February 2006," it said.
Rival Qantas  Airways  was fined 8.9 million euros for its part in the price-fixing activity. The 11  airlines
were fined for cargo activities related to the European Economic Area.

Air France-KLM received the biggest  fine, at 310 million  euros and British  Airways  was fine 104 million
euros.

Other airlines fined included Air Canada, Martinair, Cargolux, Cathay Pacific, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS and Singapore  Airlines.
Shares of Qantas rose 1.1% to $2.78 on the ASX.  Air NZ fell 0.7% to $1.36 on the NZX. (BusinessDesk)

The European Commission has fined 11 of the world's largest  airlines  €799 million for their part in a conspiracy to fix the price of cargo shipments. British  Airways  is among the carriers to be  fined and will pay a €104 million (£90 million) penalty. This takes the total that BA has paid to settle passenger and cargo price-fixing charges to about £400 million, based on present exchange rates.
The Commission also finedAir France-KLM €310 million, Cathay Pacific €57.1 million and Singapore
Airlines €74.8 million.

TD
Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, received immunity, along with its subsidiary Swiss International, after blowing the whistle on the conspiracy, which lasted from 2000 to 2006. Charges against a further 11 carriers were dropped.

After a three-year investigation, the Commission found that the  airlines  had conspired to fix fuel surcharges for cargo customers. The cartel members also conspired to introduce a security surcharge after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Regulators around the world have taken action against the  airlines  in one of the largest anti-cartel
investigations. So far, regulators have issued  fines totalling more than £1.7 billion.

Joaquín Almunia, the  Commission's vice-president for competition, said: "It is deplorable that so many major airlines  co-ordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers.
"The Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behaviour."

At least four  airline executives have been jailed for their part in the conspiracy, including Keith Packer, a former BA cargo manager. He pleaded guilty to  cartel charges in the United States and was sentenced to eight months in jail and a $20,000  fine.

BA has now been  fined by European, American, Australian, Canadian and South Korean regulators for its part in the cargo conspiracy. BA said that the  European fine announced yesterday would be covered by provisions made by the company in 2006-07. In addition to the cargo  fines, BA was charged four years ago by the US Department of Justice and Britain's Office of Fair Trading for conspiring with Virgin Atlantic to fix passenger fuel surcharges. Virgin received immunity after blowing the whistle on the conspiracy but BA was penalised £121.5 million in the UK and a further $100 million in the US.

The Commission's announcement yesterday should bring to an end regulatory action over the cargo cartel. However, the  airlines  face further civil prosecutions from companies affected by the price-fixing conspiracy. One civil action has been brought by Hausfeld, a London-based law firm, against BA on behalf of Emerald Supplies and Southern Glass House Produce, two small flower producers. The action has been backed by some of  Europe's largest companies, including Ikea, Philips, H&M, Ericsson and Michelin. Another civil action has been filed in the Netherlands seeking $430 million in damages from  Air France-KLM.

HD      Airlines fined $1.1B for fixing  cargo prices;  Air Canada's penalty from EU is $29 million

BRUSSELS -- The  European Union has fined 11 airlines,  Air Canada among them, a total of about $1.1 billion (U.S.) for fixing prices on international cargo shipments, leading to higher prices for businesses to move their goods.
The European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said Tuesday that the carriers
"co-ordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts" between December 1999
and February 2006, when the EU's investigation stopped the  cartel.

TD
"Had it not been for the  commission's intervention, the  cartel would not have ended in 2006," said
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Air France-KLM received the largest fine, 310.1 million  euros ($429 million) of the total of 799.4 million euros ($1.1 billion) levied against all 11. Air France-KLM will also have to pay the 29.5 million-euro ($40.8 million) fine for Martinair, which it now owns.

Air Canada, which took a $125 million provision related to the investigation in early 2008, said it was
fined 21 million euros, the equivalent of $29.1 million.
British Airways  PLC was fined 182.9 million euros ($253 million), while Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan
Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS, Singapore Airlines and Qantas were also  fined.
The commission dropped charges against 11 other carriers and one consultancy for lack of proof. Lufthansa escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.
"With today's decision the  commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel
behaviour," Almunia said.

The U.S. justice department has already charged 18  airlines  and several executives in its investigation of the cargo cartel and imposed more than $1.6 billion (U.S.) in  fines.

The EU can't pursue companies or individuals with criminal charges, but Almunia didn't rule out that individual countries might impose criminal charges.

(Adds EU confirmation, details on  fines for other airlines)

BANGKOK -(Dow Jones)- Thai  Airways  International PCL (THAI.TH) said Wednesday that the European Commission has decided to drop its charges against the  airline in an air cargo cartel case and that it isn't subject to any  fine.

TD
Thai Airways  has set aside a provision of THB4.29 billion (US$145 million) since 2008 for any potential penalty related to the  cartel allegations, it said in a statement.
A Commission official in Bangkok confirmed Thai  Airways'  statement.

The news came after the European Commission Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group --Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.5 billion were levied against airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

According to the  Commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation --which initially targeted more than 20 companies-- started with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters.

HD          EU fines airlines  $1.11 billion

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of 799 million  euros ($1.11 billion) for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France-KLM SA received the largest fine with 340 million  euros, including the three different carriers that are now part of the group -- Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair.

TD
British  Airways  PLC was fined 104 million euros.

Many countries around the world have been investigating issues related to price-fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.6 billion were levied against  airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and 18 airlines  have been charged.

According to the  commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation -- which initially targeted more than 20 companies -- began.

Initially, "the carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that world-wide  air-freight carriers imposed a flat-rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments," the  commission said in a statement. "The  cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients," it said.
Other airlines  fined include Singapore Airlines Ltd.,  fined 74.8 million euros; Qantas  Airways  Ltd.,
8.8 million euros; Cathay Pacific Airways  Ltd., 57.1 million  euros; and Japan Airlines International
Co., 35.7 million euros.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB 70.2 million  euros; LAN Chile, 8.2 million  euros; Luxembourg-based Cargolux, 79.9 million  euros; and Air Canada, 21 million  euros.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG wasn't  fined because it acted as a whistle-blower in the case, the
commission said.

The commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue. The EU didn't  fine any U.S. company because it didn't find enough evidence to do so,  European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said at a press conference announcing the decision.

Some companies, including British Airways  and Cargolux, have been putting money aside because of the prospect of a  fine. British Airways  said Tuesday that the  fine falls within its provision. The
company said in May 2007 that it had provisioned GBP 350 million ($664.6 million) for  fines in the U.S. and EU, while  Air France-KLM provisioned 530 million  euros for fines in different regions.

Air France-KLM said it will appeal the decision, saying in a statement that the  fines were "disproportionate" and that an "economic analysis produced within the context of the procedure demonstrated that the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight shippers nor the freight forwarders."

Air France-KLM noted that its fines exceed the level of provisions it has already taken, obliging it to book an unexpected 127 million euro charge for the first six months of its financial year.

SAS said Tuesday that it will appeal the  commission's decision, calling the  fines disproportionate, while Cargolux said the  fines seems "a very harsh punishment indeed.".

(Adds EU confirmation, details on  fines for other airlines)

BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--Thai  Airways  International PCL (THAI.TH) said Wednesday that the European Commission has decided to drop its charges against the  airline in an air cargo cartel case and that it isn't subject to any  fine.

TD
Thai Airways  has set aside a provision of THB4.29 billion (US$145 million) since 2008 for any potential penalty related to the  cartel allegations, it said in a statement.
A Commission official in Bangkok confirmed Thai  Airways'  statement.

The news came after the European Commission Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million for forming a global cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group --Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

Many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the U.S., total  fines of more than $1.5 billion were levied against airlines  that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges, and eighteen  airlines  have been charged.

According to the  Commission, the European Union's antitrust body, the  airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006, when the investigation --which initially targeted more than 20 companies-- started with unannounced raids at the companies' headquarters.

BRITISH  Airways  faces damages claims running into tens of millions of pounds after being  fined
€104m (£90m) by the European Commission for participating in an  air freight cartel.

The UK flag-carrier was one of 11  airlines fined a total of €799m for rigging fuel and security surcharges over six years, spanning December 1999 to February 2006.

TD
The EC decision leaves the carriers exposed to classaction damages claims from customers representing €6bn of cargo traffic.

After a three-year investigation, the EC found the carriers started by fixing fuel surcharges and then "extended their co-operation by introducing a security surcharge".

Joaquin Almunia, the EC's vice-president for competition, said: "It is deplorable that so many major airlines  co-ordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers."

Air France-KLM was handed the biggest fine, at €310m, while  air-freight carrier Cargolux is paying a €79.9m penalty and Singapore Airlines, €75m.
Scandinavian airline SAS was  fined €70.2m, with the penalty increased by 50pc for a second
cartel offence. As the whistleblower, Lufthansa escaped  fines.

BA said the penalty, which was cut by 10pc for cooperating with the EC, "falls within the provision" of £350m set aside in its 2006-07 accounts to settle  fines or claims relating to price-fixing .
Prior to the EC  fine, it had paid out £174m, mainly to settle with the US Department of Justice. However, BA faces damages claims from companies represented by Hausfeld & Co, filed in the
High Court. It may also become embroiled in a similar case brought by Dutch law firm
BarentsKrans in Amsterdam.

Anthony Mason, a partner at Hausfeld, said the EC's ruling meant "these  airlines  cannot now sensibly seek to avoid their liabilities".
The EC dropped charges against 11 carriers and one consultancy firm.
ART               Joaquin Almunia, EC vice-president for competition, called the price-fixing 'deplorable'

EU FINESAIR CANADA

TORONTO / The European Commission has ordered Air Canada to pay $29.4 million in penalties for its role in a price-fixing scheme for air cargo that was deemed to run afoul of  Europe's competition laws.

TD
The country's largest carrier was named among 12 other carriers, including  Air France-KLM and British
Airways,  in the decision and was ordered to pay its portion of roughly $1.1 billion in penalties.

Air Canada had set aside a $125-million provision in 2008 specifically for the  European investigation, which it said Tuesday more than adequately covered the  fine. The company also said it was studying the decision to determine whether it would launch an appeal.

The cargo cartel, which largely centred on the carriers collaborating on setting a worldwide fuel surcharge for cargo, is also being investigated in the U.S. and Canada, and is subject to a series of class-action
suits.
MAPLE LEAF SELLS PLANT

TORONTO / Maple Leaf Foods Inc. said Tuesday it is going ahead with the sale of one of its pork processing operations to an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners Inc. for about $20 million.
The deal for the plant, in Burlington, Ont., is expected to close in the next few days.

"This sale will complete the transformation of our fresh pork operations to focus our growth on branded, consumer-focused prepared meats and meals business," said Michael Vels, Maple Leaf's chief financial officer. "We are very pleased to have secured a buyer who will continue to operate the facility."

The deal includes a contract with Maple Leaf's rendering operations, and the company's prepared meat operations in Eastern Canada will remain a customer.
GIANT LAW FIRM MERGER

TORONTO / McMillan LLP and Lang Michener LLP have confirmed they are merging to create a new national business law firm with about 400 lawyers and offices in five Canadian cities and Hong Kong.

The merger takes effect on Jan. 1, with the new firm using the single name McMillan. The chief executive of the new firm will be Andrew Kent, who is currently chief executive of McMillan.

Based on 2010 rankings prepared by Canadian Lawyer magazine, the new McMillan will be home to about 395 lawyers, making it the 12th-largest legal firm in the country.
While both have offices in Toronto, Lang Michener has offices in Ottawa, Vancouver and Hong Kong, and
McMillan has offices in Montreal and Calgary.

ICONGO GAINS FINANCING

MONTREAL / Software developer iCongo has secured financing from Palo-Alto, Calif.-based Huntsman Gay Global Capital, it announced on Tuesday. Huntsman Gay will finance expansion of iCongo in what the equity company sees as a long-term move. Terms of deal were not disclosed.

Irwin Kramer, CEO of iCongo, explained his company is growing at a rapid rate and it needed the financing to expand its operations outside North America, particularly  Europe and Asia Pacific.

He said iCongo, founded in 1999, now has about 150 employees, but within five years that number will more than triple.
CHEVRON TO ENTER SHALE PLAY

NEW YORK / Chevron Corp will buy U.S. natural gas producer Atlas Energy for $3.2 billion, becoming one of the last big oil companies to jump into the Marcellus shale field.

The field in Pennsylvania and surrounding states, one of the largest U.S. natural gas finds in decades, has attracted a crush of industry heavyweights betting that the fuel will become a key global energy source in the coming decades.

Chevron's move into the Marcellus follows acquisitions by ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell earlier this year, and joint venture deals there by Total, BP PLC and Statoil.
"(Chevron) doesn't have much of a U.S. presence in shale, and I think it's an important place to be," said
Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss. "The price looks reasonable."
U.S. INVENTORIES JUMP 1.5%

WASHINGTON / U.S. wholesale inventories jumped more than expected in September as demand failed to keep up with production, suggesting output will remain soft as wholesalers try to trim stocks of unsold goods.

Inventories surged 1.5 per cent, matching a July gain that was the biggest increase in more than two years, the Commerce Department said in a report on Tuesday. Analysts had been expecting a
0.7-per-cent increase. Owners of small businesses planned to cut inventories and keep workforces trim in
October, a separate report showed.

Wholesale sales rose a less-than-expected 0.4 per cent, according to the government data, raising questions about whether inventories were gathering dust on shelves. Analysts were expecting a
0.6-per-cent gain in sales.
SLUGGISH GROWTH IN U.K.

LONDON / The British economy grew at the slowest pace since the first quarter of this year in the three months through October, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Tuesday.

Gross domestic product increased 0.5 per cent, the group, whose clients include the Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement. The result is slower than the 0.8-per-cent pace recorded in the third quarter.

The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the Bank of England should be "nimble" and respond quickly if the economy experiences faster inflation or shows signs of a faltering recovery.
Prime Minister David Cameron's government is enacting the deepest public-spending squeeze since the
Second World War, threatening to weaken economic growth.

"The U.K. economy's strong performance over the past seven months does not suggest a further round of quantitative easing is currently necessary," the institute said.
TATA MOTORS BOOSTS PROFIT
MUMBAI / Tata Motors Ltd., the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, boosted second-quarter profit more than
100-fold as a global economic recovery spurred demand for luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles.

Group net income, including Jaguar Land Rover, reached 22.2 billion rupees ($502 million Cdn) in the three months through September, compared with 218 million rupees ($4.94 million) a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said Tuesday.


Page 148 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Profit beat the 17.1 billion-rupee average estimate of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 36 per cent to 287.8 billion rupees ($6.5 billion).

Jaguar Land Rover returned to a profit in the quarter, with sales up 43 per cent on rising demand for Jaguar XJ sedans in the U.S. and China. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, have both raised their profit forecasts. Tata Motors shares have jumped 60 per cent this year in Mumbai, triple the gain in the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensitive Index.
RUSSIA TO JOIN WTO IN 2011?

BRUSSELS / Russia may win World Trade Organization membership next year, the  European Union's trade chief said in remarks that echo U.S. comments last month.

European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the EU is nearing an agreement with Russia, the largest economy outside the 153-member WTO, on its entry application. Russian wood-export duties opposed by European paper companies such as Stora Enso Oyj are the main remaining sticking point,
he said. "We have progressed rather well," De Gucht told reporters Tuesday in Brussels. "I would say they are now in for early entry. The end of next year, I would consider it to be early."

Russia, which applied to join the Genevabased WTO 17 years ago, is seeking to wrap up negotiations with the U.S. and the EU. Lawrence Summers, departing director of the U.S. National Economic Council, said on Oct. 20 that "we are certainly hopeful that well before 12 months from now the process will have been completed."

CALL OF DUTY TAKES GAMERS ON COLD WAR MISSION
PARIS / Kicking off with a mission to assassinate Fidel Castro, the newest instalment of the hit Call of
Duty franchise went on sale in North America and  Europe on Tuesday, taking gamers on a series of Cold
War-era military adventures.

Call of Duty: Black Ops is the successor to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, last year's biggest grossing console game with more than 20 million units sold around the world. Expectations for the Cold War chapter are high: IT marketing firm IDC forecasts that 11.7 million copies will be shifted in the United States by the end of the year alone.

Black Ops marks a significant change for the franchise, ditching the Second World War and modern-day environments for a Cold War theme. Mission number 1 is to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro before the 1962 missile crisis. From then on, missions take gamers inside the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.

To increase realism, the studio used motion capture technology to recreate ultra-accurate body and facial movements, while Vietnam veterans were consulted on how they modified weapons or infiltrated enemy lines on dangerous missions.
ART   Photo: Ethan Miller, AFP, Getty Images / Customers buy copies of Call of Duty: Black Ops at a store in
North Las Vegas, Nev. It is the seventh instalment in the Call of Duty franchise;

After a three-year investigation and a year of successive postponements due to pressure by the aviation sector, the European Commission was expected to fineAir  France-KLM, British  Airways,  SAS, Cargolux and six non-European airlines  a total €798.82 million, on 9 November, for illegal practices in freight transport. Only the whistleblower, Lufthansa-Swiss, escapes the financial sanctions under the Commission's leniency programme. The 12 airlines  are alleged to have operated a  cartel on tariffs for freight transport to and from the EU. Europolitics will be back with details.

Operators facing large claims for damages

Air France-KLM and SAS plan to appeal

TD
Eleven airlines,  including British  Airways,  Air France-KLM, Australia's Qantas and Japan's JAL, have been hit with fines totalling almost €800m for running an  air cargo cartel in Europe for six years.

The European Commission, Europe's top antitrust regulator, announced the penalties on Tuesday after a four-year inquiry. Its decision will give fresh impetus to large private damages claims from companies that feel they were overcharged for the  airlines'  air cargo services between late-1999 and
2006, when the  cartel was running. Two potential group claims are being lined up in the English and
Dutch courts, the latter said to be seeking at least €500m.

BA's €104m  fine was among the largest levied, but was less than the £350m (€406m) provision it set aside three years ago, and less than the €339m for the  Air France-KLM group, which will take a €127m charge.
The other carriers affected were: SAS (€70.2m),  Air Canada (€21m), Cargolux (€79.9m), Cathay Pacific
(€57.1m), JAL (€35.7m), LAN Chile (€8.2m), Qantas (€8.9m) and Singapore  Airlines (€74.8m).

Lufthansa and its Swiss  Airlines subsidiary received immunity because the German carrier acted as a whistleblower.
SAS and  Air France-KLM said they planned to appeal against the "disproportionate" size of the  fines.
Air France-KLM said analysis had shown "the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight
shippers nor the freight forwarders".
SAS said there had been "a few isolated cases" of violations of its internal rules.

"However, we adamantly maintain that these isolated incidents do not mean that SAS Cargo has been involved in a global cartel," said Mats Lönnkvist, SAS chief legal officer.

Inquiries started in 2006 when officials raided the offices of -several  air cargo companies. So far, more than 20 international carriers have admitted involvement and paid large  fines in North America and Asia. The US department of justice has imposed penalties of more than $1.6bn (€1.16bn). Several executives have received jail terms.

The commission said that the carriers had colluded to impose a flat rate surcharge per kilo on all shipments and had extended their co-operation by the introduction of a security surcharge and refusing to pay commission on surcharges to freight forwarders.

Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said that alliance agreements were not a "blank cheque" for collusive behaviour. "There were pricing discussions that were illegal," he said.

"No other industry has been subject to such vigorous global prosecution by competition authorities across the globe," said Miguel Odriozola, an antitrust lawyer at Clifford Chance, who has represented airlines.

"This is remarkable because the conduct for which they were blamed was not a traditional  cartel - airlines  competed ferociously on the price of cargo. The alleged co-ordination . . . only involved a fraction of the price charged to consumers."

Operators facing large claims for damages

Air France-KLM and SAS plan to appeal

TD
Eleven airlines,  including British  Airways,  Air France-KLM, Australia's Qantas and Japan's JAL, have been hit with fines totalling almost €800m (£690m) for running an  air cargo cartel in Europe for six years.

The European Commission, Europe's top antitrust regulator, announced the penalties on Tuesday after a four-year inquiry. Its decision will give fresh impetus to large private damages claims from companies that feel they were overcharged for the  airlines'  air cargo services between late-1999 and
2006, when the  cartel was running. Two potential group claims are being lined up in the English and
Dutch courts, the latter said to be seeking at least €500m.

BA's €104m  fine was among the largest levied, but was less than the £350m provision it set aside three years ago, and less than the €339m for the Air France-KLM group, which will take a €127m charge. The other carriers affected were: SAS (€70.2m), Air Canada (€21m), Cargolux (€79.9m), Cathay Pacific (€57.1m), JAL (€35.7m), LAN Chile (€8.2m), Qantas (€8.9m) and Singapore  Airlines (€74.8m).

SAS said there had been "a few isolated cases" of violations of its internal rules.

"However, we adamantly maintain that these isolated incidents do not mean that SAS Cargo has been involved in a global cartel," said Mats Lönnkvist, SAS chief legal officer.

Inquiries started in 2006 when officials raided the offices of -several  air cargo companies. So far, more than 20 international carriers have admitted involvement and paid large  fines in North America and Asia. The US justice department has imposed penalties of more than $1.6bn (£1bn). Several executives have received jail terms.

The Commission said that the carriers had colluded to impose a flat rate surcharge per kilo on all shipments and had extended this by the introduction of a security surcharge and refusing to pay commission on surcharges to freight forwarders.

HD      Airlines fined $1.1-billion over cargo price-fixing cartel

TRANSPORTATION REPORTER
Twelve global airlines  that ran a cargo price-fixing  cartel for years have been hit with  fines totalling
$1.1-billion by European Union regulators.

TD
The European Commission slapped Air Canada with the third-smallest  fine at €21-million
($29.2-million), but major European carriers received much-larger penalties, led by  Air France at
€182.9-million, KLM at €127.2-million and British  Airways  at €104-million.

“It is deplorable that so many major airlines  co-ordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers,” commission vice-president for competition Joaquin Almunia said in a statement Tuesday from Brussels.

Lan Chile had the lowest  fine at €8.2-million and Qantas the second-lowest at €8.9-million.  Air Canada, Lan Chile and Qantas were given financial leniency “in light of their limited participation in the infringement,” the  commission said.

Air Canada acknowledged that  European officials had notified the Montreal-based carrier about their decision.

“The amount of the  fine is more than adequately covered by the $125-million provision taken by the company in 2008, and the company is studying the decision and will determine its next steps, including possible appeal,”  Air Canada said in a statement.

Tuesday's decision signals the EU will only support further consolidation in the  airline industry if it doesn't produce excessive market clout. “We have approved numerous mergers and alliances in the sector. But the existence of an alliance agreement cannot give a blank cheque for naked price co-ordination among the members,” Mr. Almunia said.
Cargo price-fixing investigations have been carried out by regulators in  Europe, the United States and
Canada. The  European Commission and other authorities, including Canada's Competition Bureau,
have been assessing alleged anti-competitive cargo-pricing activities that occurred from late 1999 to early
2006, notably fuel surcharges levied by global carriers and freight companies.

EU regulators detailed the collusion among a dozen carriers, although it classified  Air France and KLM as a single corporate entity since the two  airlines  have the same parent,  Air France-KLM, making it a list of
11 cargo entities.  Air France-KLM, which also owns Martinair, and Singapore  Airlines are among the firms pondering filing appeals.

Air France-KLM said the  fines are “disproportionate given the fact that the economic analysis produced within the context of the procedure demonstrated that the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight shippers nor the freight forwarders. Moreover, the level of the  fines disregards the economic hardship that the  air cargo industry has suffered.”

The U.S. Justice Department already has imposed  fines of more than $1.6-billion (U.S.) against 18 carriers for conspiring to fix cargo freight rates, including Northwest  Airlines, SAS, Cargolux, Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific  Airways.

Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG and its subsidiary, Swiss International  Air Lines, received European immunity because the  commission credited them for their whistle-blowing roles in exposing the cargo cartel.

“The cartel started with the co-ordination of a fuel surcharge. The co-operation was later extended to cover a security surcharge, introduced after the terrorist attacks of September, 2001, as well as the refusal to pay a  commission on these surcharges to freight forwarders,” Mr. Almunia said. “The fact that
fuel prices were increasing, or that security costs rose after the 2001 terrorist attacks, is not an acceptable reason to stop competing against each other.”

HD      Air Canada lands heavy fine; EU dings 11 airlines  $1.1b for fixing  international cargo shipments

BRUSSELS -- The  European Union has fined Air Canada and 10 other  airlines  a total of almost $1.1 billion US for fixing prices on international cargo shipments, leading to higher prices for businesses to move their goods.

The European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said Tuesday the carriers "co-ordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts" between December 1999 and February
2006, when the EU's investigation stopped the  cartel.

TD
Air France-KLM received the largest  fine, 310.1 million  euros of the total of 799.4 billion  euros levied against all 11.  Air France-KLM will also have to pay the 29.5-million-euro fine for Martinair, which it now owns.

Air Canada, which took a $125-million provision related to the investigation a couple of years ago, said it was fined just over 21 million  euros ($29.4 million Cdn.)

"The amount of the  fine is more than adequately covered by the $125-million provision taken by the company in 2008 and the company is studying the decision and will determine its next steps, including possible appeal," the  airline said in a statement.

Air Canada also said the provision addressed the proceedings before the  European Commission, but not those in all jurisdictions.

"Management has determined it is not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of all proceedings and investigations."

Air Canada stock fell 24 cents to close at $3.43 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Among the other  airlines,  British  Airways  PLC was fined the second most: 182.9 million  euros.

Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas will also have to pay fines between 8.2 million and 79.9 million  euros.

The commission dropped charges against 11 other carriers and one consultancy because it couldn't prove they participated in the  cartel. Lufthansa escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.
