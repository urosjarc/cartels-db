* Services sector Businesses in the service sector reined back their price rises last month, the CIPS/RBS purchasing managers' index of the sector showed. Its headline measure of activity was 57.2, unchanged from April, on a scale where any figure above 50 indicates rising levels of activity. However, the index for prices charged dropped to 52.5, down from 53.9 in April and 55.3 in March. Although this suggested that prices continued to rise, the figure was the lowest since February 2006.

Telefonica,  Spain's leading telecoms group, will next month be punished and  fined by the European    Commission for abusing its dominant position in the market for broadband services.
The Brussels  antitrust watchdog issued formal charges against the group last year, accusing
Telefonica  of operating a "margin squeeze" on competing groups.

TD
The Commission found that the wholesale cost of accessing  Telefonica's  broadband network was so close to prices charged consumers that rivals were unable to earn a sufficient margin, effectively shutting them out of the broadband market.

According to people familiar with the case, the charges have been confirmed in a draft decision set to be approved by the Commission at a meeting on July 4.
The ruling was last Friday presented to national  competition regulators, who gave broad backing.

The Commission has yet to determine  Telefonica's  fine, but under EU rules it can impose a penalty of up to 10 per cent of the group's annual global turnover.

The case has raised questions about the system used by Spain's Telecoms Market Commission (CMT), the domestic regulator, to calculate wholesale broadband charges.

Its investigation found that they left scope for  competition, and Telefonica  has repeatedly pointed to the regulator's approval in its defence against the Commission accusations.

At the same time, the CMT and  Telefonica  are at loggerheads over sanctions against the group related to the alleged  abuse of its dominant position in fixed-line services.

In two cases involving margin squeezes in the telecoms sector - against France Telecom's  Wanadoo and Deutsche Telekom in 2003 - Brussels opted for relatively low  fines of 10.4m ($14m) and 12.6m respectively.

But since Neelie Kroes took over as EU  competition commissioner in 2004, the regulator has drastically increased fines for antitrust abuses, making it unlikely  Telefonica  will escape as lightly as its German and French rivals.

Last year the Commission imposed  fines of 1.85bn, a record that is certain to be topped in 2007, which has so far seen the regulator clock up just over 2bn in  fines.

Telefonica  stands accused of operating the margin squeeze since 2001.

Linking the alleged  abuse to the wider problems affecting the broadband market in Spain, Brussels said last year that "retail broadband prices in Spain are high and well above EU average".

The Commission stressed that the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to compete with  Telefonica's network was happening more slowly than in other European markets.
The group, which has always denied wrongdoing, is likely to appeal against any decision in front of the
European Court of First Instance, the EU's second-highest court.

HD          Euro CDS: High/Low  Grade Sectors See Divergence

LONDON, June 22 (MNI) - Euro CDS spreads had a more composed
tone today with high beta indices returning to the middle of the week's range. iTraxx crossover opened at the 207bps level, after spiking as high as 216bps yesterday.

The
Bear Stearns/sub prime debacle that prompted the increased
volatility in low grade sectors this week appears to be reaching some
kind resolution with  Bear Stearns investment bank reportedly planning to take on $3.2 bln of loans from creditors in an effort to stave off moves to auction the collateral.

The news did not prompt a rally in the sector, though, with the
ABX low grade indices related to sub prime remaining close to the week's lows, even after the loan buyout proposal was announced.

This was the case in the wider market, where CDS related to this type of securitisation was trading up to 20bps wider on the week. GMAC and FMCC in Euros were notable examples of this, leading other related single names wider.

In the new issue ABS market, which has a pipeline of over $44bln this month, traders reported slower demand for deals viewed as risky, but increased demand for higher quality issues, to the extent that the better quality deals are being priced at even tighter levels.

This trend could lead to a general divergence of high and low grade credit in the coming weeks as investors have been forced to take a less gung ho stance in the wake of the  Bear Stearns hedge fund problems.

Late morning trade saw iTraxx crossover start to widen out again, trading back up to 211bps. The weak German Ifo today weighed on stocks in Europe. The move, however, was seen as linked more to the general divergence of high and low grade credit sectors, with high beta single names having a particularly soft tone late morning.

Pearson and  General Electric said that they have decided against launching a counterbid for Dow Jones, clearing the way for News Corp to pursue the media company unchallenged. It was reported that GE had concluded it could not justify matching or beating News Corp's $5 bln offer and ruled out any other attempt to bid for Dow Jones.

It was reported in the FT, however, that Pearson and GE were discussing "co-operating agreements" between CNBC and the FT Group, which includes the Financial Times newspaper and FT.com and a

controlling stake in  Interactive Data Corporation.

Separately, the WSJ said that  LVMH is in exclusive talks to buy the French financial daily Les Echos from Pearson. LVMH already owns French financial daily La Tribune so a purchase would make it the dominant
player in the country's financial news.

The market seemed to view the newsflow in a positive manner with shares in Pearson up 10.5p, trading at the 835p level, bucking the trend in the wider market. CDS spreads for Pearson were around 3 bps tighter this morning, trading at the 47 bps level.

Telefonica was in the news this morning following an article in the
FT that the group will next month be punished and fined by the European             Commission for abusing its dominant position in the market for broadband services. The antitrust regulators issued formal charges against the
group last year accusing it of operating a margin squeeze on competing groups.

The commission has yet to determine Telefonica's fine but under EU rules it can impose a penalty of up to 10% of the group's annual turnover. Shares in Telefonica were basically unchanged on the news this morning, trading at the E16.33 level, as were CDS spreads, trading in
the 25 bps area.

ArcelorMittal announced its European steel markets update this morning with the firm forecasting a "robust" market for flat products, adding that they ware also confident about demand for carbon steel.

The news that the firm has decided not to raise steel prices sent its shares almost 1% lower. The company is reportedly fixing prices to keep the market stable. Some analysts, however, had expected the strong demand in Europe to enable ArcelorMittal to possibly increase margins. Spreads were more stable on the report, however, trading marginally wider at 26bps.

HD           UPDATE 1-Spain's Telefonica  may face large EU fine

(Rewrites with sources on  Telefonica's  strategy)

MADRID, July 2 (Reuters) -  Telefonica  may face a large fine if the European Commission finds on Wednesday the dominant Spanish telecoms company did not give its competitors sufficient room to make a profit on the resale of ADSL Internet.

TD
Sources familiar with the Spanish company's thinking fear a  fine, and although they do not quantify how much that might be, newspaper El Pais reported on Monday it might run to as much as 100 million euros ($136 million).

The decision will be announced from Brussels on July 4 but until then the EU is expected to remain tight-lipped on the subject.

Telefonica  will appeal any decision which finds the company at fault, the sources said, as it would imply the group has been deliberately hindering its rivals.

The telecommunication company will also argue it has been following market rules on pricing as established by Spain's telecoms market commission CMT, and that the EU is effectively overruling the national watchdog.

"It is clear that the EU regulator does not trust the national ones ... That would be understandable if Telefonica  were a state telecom ... but it has been privately owned for some time now," one source familiar with the situation said.

Although the source understood the dispute as a technical rather than a political question, in order to reach its conclusion, the EU has recalculated  Telefonica's  accounts, disregarding data which the company believes is key.

"We hope the case will be closed without a  fine because we have always acted in good faith and according to the CMT's regulations," a spokesman for  Telefonica  said.

He added the market in Spanish ADSL fast Internet connections has developed well in recent years and that  Telefonica  has lost an increasing market share to its competitors.
According to CMT data, Spain had 5.76 million ADSL lines by the end of April, of which 4 million were
Telefonica's  retail lines while the rest, although on  Telefonica's  network, are operated by its rivals.
Broker BPI said if the news was confirmed, it would be a blow to  Telefonica's  image and its pocket. "(Payment of the  fine) would require up to 100 million euros of cashflow, equivalent to nearly 1 percent
of annual operational cash flow or 0.1 percent of its capitalisation," it said in a note.

EU antitrust regulators formally charged Spain's  Telefonica  early in 2006 with squeezing out smaller rivals who want to compete with high-speed Internet services, although the case dates back to 2002.

Telefonica  is the only company with country-wide fixed-line telephone facilities carrying high-speed
Internet over asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL).

With the exception of cable operators such as ONO, others who want to compete must buy some of
the ADSL service wholesale from  Telefonica  and re-sell it. (Additional reporting by Sabina Zawadzki in

MADRID (Dow Jones)--Spain's telecommunications market regulator, the CMT, said Tuesday it was unhappy with the  European Commission's investigation of an alleged margin squeeze  Telefonica  SA (TEF) has waged against its broadband competitors ahead of a ruling on the case expected Wednesday.

BRUSSELS, July 3, 2007 (AFP) -
Spanish operator Telefonica  faces a fine close to 100 million euros (136 million dollars) from EU
regulators for stifling competition in the broadband Internet market, a senior EU official said Tuesday.

TD
Several other officials told AFP that "the most probable" was that the  fine, expected Wednesday, would be "a bit more" than 100 million euros, although in theory it could reach 10 percent of annual sales.
In 2006, the company reported sales of nearly 53 billion euros.
In any case, the  fine will be the biggest that  competition regulators at the the  European Commission
have ever slapped on a European telecommunications operator.

In February, the Commission took the first step in legal action against  Telefonica,  levelling formal charges against the company in a "statement of objections."

The group has since had a chance to lay out its defence but seems to have had little success in convincing the Commission.

Regulators accuse Telefonica  of intentionally squeezing competitors in the market for broadband Internet access by the way it sets prices for rivals to use its network.

HD     Expansion: Spanish telecoms  regulator against Brussels plan to fine Telefonica  (La CMT carga contra Bruselas  ante la multimillonaria multa a Telefonica).

Reinaldo Rodriguez, the chairman of the CMT, the Spanish telecommunications market commission, yesterday criticized the  European Commission's plan to  fine leading Spanish telecoms operator Telefonica  for abuse of dominant position in the internet broadband access market. The European authorities could today impose a  fine of over 100m euros on Telefonica  for having allegedly increased the wholesale prices charged to rival operators for using the group's infrastructure to the point that its competitors cannot make competitive offers, but ensuring that the profit margins are wide enough.

TD
The CMT, which authorized the offers now being penalized by Brussels, says that the wholesale prices charged by Telefonica  help to increase competition and enable the existence of alternative operators, adding that the planned  fine is not justified and could be detrimental to future investments in the sector. The CMT admits that ADSL prices in Spain are high, but it says that the funds help increase investments in internet infrastructure.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined Telefonica  151.8m for market abuses, setting a new high in the telecommunications sector and realising the worst fears of Spain's biggest operator.

TD
The fine, which follows an investigation into the company's  abuse of its dominant position in Spain's broadband market, compares with sanctions of 10.35m and 12.6m in similar cases involving  Wanadoo of France and Germany's Deutsche Telecom in 2003.

Telefonica,  which last year reported group profits of 6.2bn, had hoped for a similarly lenient  fine. However, Brussels has toughened its stance on  antitrust infringements since Neelie Kroes took over as EU competition commissioner in 2004.

The Commission last year formally issued charges against  Telefonica  for operating a margin squeeze on competing operators since 2001. By charging excessive fees for access to its fixed-line network, the company stopped rivals from earning a sufficient margin on their broadband business. This had also stymied the development of competing networks and low-cost internet access, the Commission said on Wednesday.

"Spanish consumers are paying for more than the average for high-speed internet access and many have chosen not to pay that price," Ms Kroes said.

"The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but harmed customers significantly.
"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers. "I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation," she said.

Telefonica,  which has always denied the charges, is almost certain to appeal to the European Court of
First Instance, the EU's second-highest court.

Telefonica  was told on Wednesday to pay a 152m ($207m)  antitrust fine, after the  European               Commission found Spain's dominant telecoms group guilty of illegally freezing out rivals from the lucrative broadband market.

It is the largest  fine Brussels has ever imposed on a telecoms company, outstripping earlier penalties imposed on Deutsche Telekom and France's  Wanadoo for similar abuses by a factor of 10. With the exception of Microsoft, no other company has been punished more severely for abusing a dominant position.

TD
The EU's top  antitrust regulator said the fine was intended as a warning to other groups, and reflected Brussels' determination to defend competition in newly liberalised markets such as energy and telecoms.  Telefonica  rejected the charges, and vowed to appeal against the ruling.

"Telefonica's  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy," said Neelie Kroes, the EU  competition commissioner. "I want to send a strong signal to dominant undertakings in all sectors that could be tempted to engage in similar practices that I will not tolerate such behaviour," she added.

The Commission found  Telefonica  operated a "margin squeeze" on its rivals for more than five years beginning in September 2001. The group weakened its competitors by setting the wholesale cost of accessing Telefonica's  broadband network so close to the retail price that rivals were forced to make losses to stay in the market,Brussels said.

Ms Kroes said the group's behaviour had undermined the growth of broadband in one of Europe's largest economies: "Spain has a broadband penetration rate well below the EU average. Consumers have been put off from exploring the new services that broadband internet allows."

Telefonica  yesterday railed against the size of the  fine, describing it as "unjustified and disproportionate".

The Commission's case against  Telefonica  has also raised questions about the regulation of Spain's broadband segment, where network access charges are fixed by the Telecoms Market Commission (CMT). The group has repeatedly pointed to the CMT's approval of its rates in its defence against Brussels, exposing an embarrassing rift between the Spanish regulator and the Commission.

Telefonica  said it had always "complied scrupulously with the rules imposed by the CMT". It added: "We believe that the  fine punishes us for being caught between two sets of contradictory rules - those of the CMT and those of the European regulator." Until late 2003, retail charges were set by the Spanish government, and the CMT used these to calculate wholesale charges which were supposed to allow space for competitors to make money in the broadband market.

When retail prices were liberalised, it began calculating the wholesale tariffs according to real market prices provided by Telefonica.
The company said it would present its appeal "within the next few days".

HD       FT.com site : European Central Bank turns a blind eye to sniping. BY       Paul Betts

LP
If in doubt, do like the Bundesbank. This seems to have become the prevailing creed at the European Central Bank these days. Just like the old German central bank, the ECB is defending its independent role in fixing European interest rates and studiously ignoring the continual sniping from the sidelines over its monetary tightening.

The strength of the euro and the ECB's current rate tightening cycle is being increasingly blamed by some countries - with France in the vanguard - for holding back growth and undermining export competitiveness. True, many companies complain that the strong euro is making life difficult.
Peugeot-Citroen's new boss, Christian Streiff, claims the single currency is about 30 per cent overvalued against the Japanese yen, which is at an all-time low against the euro. Airbus keeps whingeing that it is being heavily penalised by the unfavourable euro-dollar exchange.

TD
But how do these critics explain the continuing strength of German exports or indeed Germany's impressive export performance back in the old days of the strong Deutschmark?

How do they respond to the report the  European Commission released this week arguing that the rise of the euro had taken only "a modest toll" so far on export growth in the eurozone?

The problem seems to be elsewhere. Could it be that the re-energised German economy is now creating an imbalance in Europe with neighbouring countries struggling to match German performance?

In the past, countries such as Italy, Spain or France have been able to take advantage of a benign interest rate climate while Germany was struggling with reunification. Unfortunately, these countries did not seize the opportunity of this favourable economic climate to restructure their own houses. Germany, on the other hand, was forced to and is now reaping the fruits of all its hard work: wage restraint and corporate restructuring.

In a single currency system, there are fundamentally only two solutions to restore the balance. Germany's neighbours must either reform or Germany itself could allow its European partners a bit more breathing space by tolerating to live with higher inflation for a while.
But the Berlin government is unlikely to buy this and nor should it.

Monetary laxity has rarely delivered sustainable growth and it certainly does not encourage countries to adopt the financial and budgetary disciplines necessary for longer-term prosperity.
Sure, many of Germany's neighbours probably need more time to put together credible internal reforms. The ECB is also clearly aware of the current tensions and could be more accommodating.
But it will only do so if it is convinced that governments are serious in carrying out their reform attempts. It obviously does not consider that the evidence to date is sufficient.
Best of enemies

The European Commission's decision yesterday to make an example of  Telefonica  for abuses of its dominant position in the broadband market is a fairly serious blow for the Spanish telecoms group.
Page 25 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Although the company is big enough to absorb the hefty 152m ($207m)  fine - assuming its appeal fails - the sanction undermines a concerted campaign to shed its image in Spain as the big, bad
market-abusing incumbent.

Competitors and consumers readily agree that, in some cases, the company's marketing and pricing techniques are questionable at best and, yes, abusive at worst. Ironically, however, in the case of network access charges to broadband competitors,  Telefonica  appears to have been playing by the rules.

Executives have always maintained their innocence and those from some rival groups admit privately that Brussels may have come down a little hard on the incumbent.

Spain's Telecoms Market Commission (CMT), the market regulator, has been particularly critical of the sanction, arguing that, as it sets wholesale tariffs for fixed-line services, the scope for  abuse is minimal. When the tariff system was introduced in 2001, it argues,  Telefonica  enjoyed a whopping 95 per cent of the fixed-line market. This has since been pared to 55 per cent.

Although conceding that the country's broadband market has been slow to evolve, its system for calculating network access charges - based on subtracting from the final cost to consumers - is not the culprit, it argues.

The fact that the CMT has taken offence at the EC's charges against  Telefonica  is not surprising: the sanction is akin to a slap in the face for the regulator.

But it has given rise to a most surprising alliance. In normal circumstances, the CMT and  Telefonica  are at each other's throats, the former disallowing unfairly priced products and the latter complaining of overzealousness. Suddenly, they are comrades in arms. Whatever  Telefonica  and the CMT say about the EC, they may one day thank it for bringing them together.

European antitrust regulators will fineTelefonica SA as much as €150-million ($204-million U.S.) for abusing its dominance in broadband Internet access in Spain, two people with direct knowledge of the case said. The  European Commission in Brussels will accuse  Telefonica  of charging wholesale rates that are too close to retail prices, preventing competing Internet providers from making a profit, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The  fine will be between €100-million and €150-million, according to the people, several times larger than previous penalties against phone companies. TEF (Madrid) fell 6 euro cents to €16.44.

1.30pm:  European commission finds O2 owner guilty of squeezing rival operators out of the
Spanish broadband internet market. By David Gow in Brussels.
Neelie Kroes, EU  competition commissioner, today  fined Telefónica  a record &#8364;152m
(£103m) for squeezing rival operators out of the Spanish broadband internet market.

TD
The European commission found that the Spanish telecoms group, which owns O2, had charged its rivals too much for wholesale broadband services, compared to the cost of its own high-speed
internet product.

Ms Kroes coupled the  fine with a warning to energy groups and other incumbent companies accused of abusing their dominance that she would not hesitate to impose similarly swingeing penalties.
"The sky is not the limit," she said.

In a frontal attack on the protectionist policies of new French president Nicolas Sarkozy, she repeatedly proclaimed that the commission's anti-trust authorities are the real protectors of citizen and consumer interests by defending them against dominant groups. "I will not tolerate such behaviour," she said.

She added: "Telefónica's  conduct (over more than five years) harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy ...
"The fact is that small businesses and consumers in Spain are paying about 20% more than the
EU-15 average for high-speed (ADSL) internet access."

The fine, second only to the &#8364;497m imposed on Microsoft for abusing its dominant position, is a record for the telecoms sector and 10 times higher than those imposed in 2003 on Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom's internet arm  Wanadoo. Ms Kroes said these had failed to act as a deterrent.

"Telefónica  could have ended this abuse. It did not do so," she told reporters. The commission began inquiries into the Telefónica  case in late 2003 after Wanadoo's Spanish arm launched a formal complaint, and opened formal proceedings in February 2006. Wanadoo later became Orange broadband.

But the Spanish regulator, forewarned of the EC's move, did not act until December last year to curb Telefónica.  The Spanish telecoms group, Ms Kroes said, blamed the regulator and had lobbied intensively in the media and in Brussels against the pending  fine.

Spanish observers accused Ms Kroes of undermining the regulator's authority by intervening but she dismissed these charges. The regulator is seen in Brussels as pliable to pressure from governments of both centre-right and centre-left hue - and from  Telefónica  itself.

The Spanish telco said it would immediately lodge an appeal with the European court of justice. It insisted it had abided with the regulator's guidelines.

(Adds Telefonica,  Orange statement)

BRUSSELS, July 4 (Reuters) - The European Union's top  antitrust authority  fined Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica  a record 151.9 million euros ($207 million) for squeezing out rivals from the high-speed Internet market.

TD
The European Commission said Telefonica's  wholesale prices to other Internet providers were too high compared with its own retail prices, a margin squeeze that meant rivals made losses when they resold the access to consumers.

"Telefonica's  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy,"  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told reporters.

"I want to send a strong signal to dominant undertakings in all sectors that could be tempted to engage in similar practices that I will not tolerate such behaviour," she said, referring to the energy market, dominated by former state monopolies.

Telefonica  said it would immediately appeal the "unjustified and disproportionate" decision, arguing it was following market rules on pricing as set by Spain's telecoms market commission CMT, and that the EU was overruling the national watchdog.

The fine is the highest set against a telecoms firm and the second-highest the European Union's top antitrust regulator has levied in an "abuse of dominance" case, beaten by almost half a billion euros Microsoft had to pay in 2004.

CMT, which had dropped a similar case against  Telefonica,  on Tuesday criticised the Commission for stepping on its turf, adding that the EU executive should start a case against CMT if it was unhappy with the national telecoms regulator's actions.
Shares in the company were little changed, trading 0.4 percent up at 16.51 euros by 1141 GMT.

"The fine sets a precedent in terms of size although it's small change for  Telefonica,  but the decision does seem a little unusual," said a telecoms analyst at one London investment bank.
The EU complaint was orginally filed by  Wanadoo, an Internet service belonging to France Telecom's
Orange.

"The EU's decision confirms the arguments used that Orange made against the serious issues affecting  competition in the Spanish ADSL market," Orange said in statement.

TELEFONICA AWARE

The Commission said CMT's pricing was based on  Telefonica's  forecasts, which "were not matched by its actual data".

Page 30 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Telefonica's  business plan and cost accounts show that the company could not have been unaware that it was engaging in a margin squeeze," the EU executive said.
It added CMT regulated only  Telefonica's  regional wholesale prices -- 30 percent of its prices.
CMT significantly lowered the prices after the Commission opened its formal investigation in February
2006. The  fine covers the period between 2001 and 2006.
Analysts backed  Telefonica's  arguments that it was merely following CMT's guidelines.

"What Brussels should be looking at is whether the national regulator has favoured  Telefonica...  This decision will have consequences...it doesn't make any sense," said Nahum Sanchez of brokerage Caja Madrid Bolsa.

Telefonica  is the only company in Spain with country-wide fixed-line telephone facilities carrying high-speed Internet over asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL).
With the exception of cable operators such as ONO, others wanting to compete must buy some of the
ADSL service wholesale from  Telefonica  and resell it.

According to CMT data, Spain had 5.76 million ADSL lines by the end of April. Four million of those were Telefonica's  retail lines while the rest, although on  Telefonica's  network, were operated by its rivals.

The Commission said Spanish consumers paid 20 percent more than the average of the 15 "old" members of the EU, while broadband penetration was 20 percent below the EU-15's average.

Kroes' warning shot at other sectors was aimed chiefly at dominant energy companies which control both the supply of energy and the network through which it is transported.

Competitors often need to buy access to this network if they want to supply their own consumers. Kroes has already opened  antitrust investigations into Germany's RWE and E.ON and wants firms to spin off their networks. (Additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary and Robert Hetz in Madrid)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rivals in the broadband business.

Telefonica  squeezed its competitors' margins by raising their fees for access to the telephone network and lowering its own prices for retail broadband Internet services, the commission said in a statement. [
07-04-07 0530ET ]
About 80% of Spain's high-speed Internet connections are made over fixed telephone lines.

Telefonica,  a state-owned monopoly until 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network. This enabled the company to rig the country's broadband market, the commission said, noting that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's  retail prices and the prices for wholesale broadband access were too thin for other providers to cover their costs.

"The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but also harmed customers significantly. When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," the commission's top  antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

The commission's penalty is part of a broader effort to shake up Europe's telecommunications sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges.

The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network. [ 07-04-07 0533ET ]

Telefonica's  fine also shows that the commission is escalating its crackdown on antitrust abuses. In a similar case in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was fined only EUR10.4 million. In a range of recent cartel cases,  fines have been several times larger than in similar cases just a few years ago.

Fining Wanadoo helped pry open the French broadband market, the commission said, adding that the sector is now "among the most competitive in Europe, with lower prices" and a growing number of users.

In Spain, by contrast, broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries. Spain's broadband penetration rate is also 20% lower than average, according to
the commission.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rival broadband providers.

TD
Telefonica  squeezed its competitors' margins by raising fees for access to its telephone network and lowering its own prices for retail broadband services, the commission said in a statement.

Telefonica  was "making it virtually impossible for competitors to enter the market," the commission's top
antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference.

The commission's penalty, its highest ever against a telecommunications company, is part of a broader effort to shake up the sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges and has pushed for changes in several broadband markets. The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network.

Telefonica's  fine shows how the regulator is escalating its crackdown on  antitrust abuses by levying heftier fines. In similar cases in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was  fined EUR10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom was penalized EUR12.6 million. In a range of recent collusion cases, fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago.

Kroes said Telefonica's  fine was justified because of the seriousness of the  abuse and the harm done to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% lower than average, according to the commission.

Telefonica  said it will appeal the  fine, calling the commission's penalty "unjustified and disproportionate." It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecommunications regulator.

"Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the  European       Commission, which are at odds with each other," the company said in a statement.

Telefonica  said its share of Spain's broadband market has decreased steadily to its current 55% from
95% in 2001. The company's main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France
Telecom, and Jazztel PLC (JAZ.MC).

Being a former state-owned monopoly helped  Telefonica  rig Spain's broadband market, according to the commission. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines. Telefonica,  which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network.

The commission said that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's  retail prices and the fees it charged for network access was too thin for other providers to cover their costs.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rivals in the broadband business.

About 80% of Spain's high-speed Internet connections are made over fixed telephone lines.

Telefonica,  a state-owned monopoly until 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network. This enabled the company to rig the country's broadband market, the commission said, noting that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's  retail prices and the prices for wholesale broadband access were too thin for other providers to cover their costs.

"The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but also harmed customers significantly. When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," the commission's top  antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

The commission's penalty is part of a broader effort to shake up Europe's telecommunications sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rivals in the broadband business.

Telefonica  squeezed its competitors' margins by raising their fees for access to the telephone network and lowering its own prices for retail broadband Internet services, the commission said in a statement. [
04-07-07 0930GMT ]
About 80% of Spain's high-speed Internet connections are made over fixed telephone lines.

Telefonica,  a state-owned monopoly until 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network. This enabled the company to rig the country's broadband market, the commission said, noting that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's  retail prices and the prices for wholesale broadband access were too thin for other providers to cover their costs.

"The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but also harmed customers significantly. When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," the commission's top  antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

The commission's penalty is part of a broader effort to shake up Europe's telecommunications sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges.

The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network. [ 04-07-07 0933GMT ]

Telefonica's  fine also shows that the commission is escalating its crackdown on antitrust abuses. In a similar case in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was fined only EUR10.4 million. In a range of recent cartel cases,  fines have been several times larger than in similar cases just a few years ago.

Fining Wanadoo helped pry open the French broadband market, the commission said, adding that the sector is now "among the most competitive in Europe, with lower prices" and a growing number of users.

In Spain, by contrast, broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries. Spain's broadband penetration rate is also 20% lower than average, according to
the commission.

Telefonica's  business plan and cost accounts show that the company could not have been unaware that it was engaging in a margin squeeze, the commission said.

The commission opened a formal investigation into  Telefonica's  business practices in February 2006. That prompted Spanish regulators to force the company to lower its wholesale prices in December
2006, ending the company's  antitrust abuses, according to the commission.

HD        UPDATE: EU Fines Telefonica  EUR151.9M, Tightening Mkt Grip

MADRID (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission slapped a hefty  fine on Telefonica  SA (TEF) Wednesday for abusing its dominant position in the broadband market, as the EU watchdog rachets up its control on the European telecoms sector.

The largest telecommunications company in Spain and Latin America was  fined EUR151.9 million for operating a margin squeeze on its high-speed Internet competitors since 2001. This is the biggest  fine against a telecommunications company ever imposed by the Commission.

TD
The Brussels  antitrust watchdog found the wholesale cost of accessing  Telefonica's  broadband network was so close to prices charged to consumers that rivals were unable to earn a sufficient margin, shutting them out of the market. The commission also argued the rollout of competitors broadband networks has been slower in Spain than in other European countries due to  Telefonica's practices.

Telefonica  balked at what it said were conflicting criteria between the EU regulator and the Spanish telecom regulator, the CMT.

"The CMT hasn't ruled against us for these reasons, and it seems strange that after years of accepting our prices and practices, now a different regulator is saying there was wrongdoing," a company spokesman said.
At 0956 GMT,  Telefonica  shares were 0.5% higher at EUR16.52 in an overall positive Madrid market. "Telefonica  has a market capitalization of EUR79 billion and the impact of this  fine is minimal, what
could be more significant is if  Telefonica  is now facing a more restrictive regulatory scrutiny from
Brussels," UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda said. UBS rates  Telefonica  at neutral with a EUR17.70 price
target.

The hefty  fine also signals a departure from the EU's former soft-glove approach to regulating European telecommunications companies. In 2003, two other telecommunications incumbents, France Telecom (FTE) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) were  fined EUR10.4 million and EUR12.6 million respectively for similar infractions. But since Neelie Kroes took the helm as EU Competition Commissioner in 2004, the EU has tightened its grip on  antitrust infractions, and hiked its fines.

"Brussels is trying to make an example out of the  Telefonica  case and send a message to the European national regulators," Juan Tuesta from local brokerage Banesto said. "It's clear the EU is trying to wrestle control from domestic regulators, what remains to be seen is how far they are going to go," Tuesta added.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rival broadband providers.

TD
Telefonica  squeezed its competitors' margins by raising fees for access to its telephone network and lowering its own prices for retail broadband services, the commission said in a statement.

Telefonica  was "making it virtually impossible for competitors to enter the market," the commission's top
antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference.

The commission's penalty, its highest ever against a telecommunications company, is part of a broader effort to shake up the sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges and has pushed for changes in several broadband markets. The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network.

Telefonica's  fine shows how the regulator is escalating its crackdown on  antitrust abuses by levying heftier fines. In similar cases in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was  fined EUR10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom was penalized EUR12.6 million. In a range of recent collusion cases, fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago.

Kroes said Telefonica's  fine was justified because of the seriousness of the  abuse and the harm done to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% lower than average, according to the commission.

Telefonica  said it will appeal the  fine, calling the commission's penalty "unjustified and disproportionate." It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecommunications regulator.

"Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the  European       Commission, which are at odds with each other," the company said in a statement.

Telefonica  said its share of Spain's broadband market has decreased steadily to its current 55% from
95% in 2001. The company's main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France
Telecom, and Jazztel PLC (JAZ.MC).

Being a former state-owned monopoly helped  Telefonica  rig Spain's broadband market, according to the commission. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines. Telefonica,  which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with
a nationwide fixed-line network.

The commission said that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's  retail prices and the fees it charged for network access was too thin for other providers to cover their costs.

antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference.

The commission's penalty, its highest ever against a telecommunications company, is part of a broader effort to shake up the sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges and has pushed for changes in several broadband markets. The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network.

Telefonica's  fine shows how the regulator is escalating its crackdown on  antitrust abuses by levying heftier fines. In similar cases in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was  fined EUR10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom was penalized EUR12.6 million. In a range of recent collusion cases, fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago.

Kroes said Telefonica's  fine was justified because of the seriousness of the  abuse and the harm done to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% lower than average, according to the commission.

Telefonica  said it will appeal the  fine, calling the commission's penalty "unjustified and disproportionate." It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecommunications regulator.

"Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the  European       Commission, which are at odds with each other," the company said in a statement.

Telefonica  said its share of Spain's broadband market has decreased steadily to its current 55% from
95% in 2001. The company's main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France
Telecom, and Jazztel PLC (JAZ.MC). Orange first complained to the commission about  Telefonica's
business practices in 2003.
The commission's  fine "confirms the validity of Orange's (complaint)," Orange said in a statement. A
spokesman for Jazztel declined to comment.

Being a former state-owned monopoly helped  Telefonica  rig Spain's broadband market, according to the commission. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines. Telefonica,  which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with
a nationwide fixed-line network.

Telefonica's  business plan and cost accounts show that the company "could not have been unaware that it was engaging in a margin squeeze," the E.U. regulator said. Between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between  Telefonica's  retail prices and the fees it charged for network access was too thin for other providers to cover their costs, the commission added.

The commission opened a formal investigation into  Telefonica's  business practices in February 2006. That prompted Spain's telecommunications authority to force the company to lower its wholesale prices in December 2006, ending the company's  antitrust abuses, according to the commission.

The Commission found that from Sept. 2001 to Dec. 2006, the Spanish telecoms giant structured its wholesale and retail broadband prices at both the national and regional levels in such a way that the margin between them did not allow rivals to compete on the market without making losses.

"Through this so-called 'margin squeeze,'  Telefonica  insulated itself from the rigors of  competition by making it impossible for alternative broadband suppliers to enter the market on a commercially-viable basis," said Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for  Competition Policy.

As a consequence of  Telefonica's  unfair practice, small businesses and consumers in Spain are paying about 20 percent more than the average for high-speed Internet access in the old 15 EU member
states, the Commission claimed.

BRUSSELS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Wednesday announced an antitrust   
fine of over 151 million euros against Spanish telecoms operator  Telefonica.

The hefty  fine was imposed because Telefonica  had committed a "very serious  abuse" of its dominant position in the Spanish broadband market, the European Union's  antitrust watchdog said.

TD
The Commission found that from Sept. 2001 to Dec. 2006, the Spanish telecom giant structured its wholesale and retail broadband prices at both the national and regional levels in such a way that the margin between them did not allow rivals to compete without making a loss.

"Through this so-called 'margin squeeze,'  Telefonica  insulated itself from the rigors of  competition by making it impossible for alternative broadband suppliers to enter the market on a commercially-viable basis," said Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for  Competition Policy.

Telefonica's  rivals had to buy wholesale broadband access from it because most broadband connections in Spain are provided through fixed telephone lines, with the only nation-wide network controlled by Telefonica.

By setting a high wholesale price,  Telefonica  made its rivals unable to make profit if they wanted to provide lower retail prices.
As a consequence of  Telefonica's  unfair practice, small businesses and consumers in Spain paid about
20 percent more than the average for high-speed Internet access in the old 15 EU member states, the
Commission claimed.

The fine is the biggest ever slapped on a European telecoms operator and the second biggest the commission has imposed for  abuse of market dominance after the U.S. software giant Microsoft was hit with a penalty of nearly half a billion euros in 2004.

"I want to send a strong signal to dominant undertakings in all sectors that could be tempted to engage in similar practices that I will not tolerate such behavior," Kroes said.

Europe's top  antitrust watchdog accused Telefonica  of "a very serious  abuse of its dominant position" by squeezing rival broadband access providers' margins for over five years in the way it set wholesale and retail prices.

"In so doing,  Telefonica  weakened its competitors, making their continued presence and growth difficult: competitors were forced to make losses if they wanted to match  Telefonica's  retail prices," the Commission said in a statement.
Kroes said that the arrangement made Spanish consumers pay 20 percent more than the average in the
European Union's oldest member states, stunting the market's growth.

"The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but also harmed customers significantly," Kroes said.

"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," she added.

MADRID, July 4, 2007 (AFP) -
Spanish telecommunications operator  Telefonica  vowed Wedenesday to challenge a 151.9-million-euro
fine imposed on it by EU  antitrust regulators in a campaign against uncompetitive practices.

TD
Telefonica  described the EU ruling as "inexplicable" and said it would appeal the finding at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was imposing the  fine, worth 206 million dollars, because Telefonica  had stifled  competition in the broadband Internet market.

Kroes said she wanted to "send a strong signal" to other companies that crush rivals unfairly using dominant market power, especially in key sectors such as telecommunications, energy and transport.

The fine is the largest ever slapped on a telecoms operator in Europe and the second largest the Commission has imposed for abusing market strength after a hitting Microsoft with a penalty of nearly half a billion euros in 2004.

"Telefonica  finds the decision by Brussels to be unjustified and disproportionate, both legally and economically," the company said in a statement.

It insisted that it had "scrupulously respected" the conditions demanded by the Spanish regulatory authority and said it had been caught between two contradictory sets of norms, one imposed by the Spanish regulator and another by the  European Commission.
The EU decision, it added, creates "legal uncertainty that will inevitably affect the future plans of
Telefonica  and (other) operators."

HD     EU fines Spain's Telefonica  more than €151 million for unfair Internet prices

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA €151.9 million (US$206.5 million) on Wednesday, claiming the company unfairly squeezed rivals by setting wholesale Internet prices too high to allow them turn a profit.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high fine -- second only in EU monopoly  abuse penalties to the landmark €497 million (US$613 million) fine on Microsoft Corp. -- reflected the fact that Telefonica  knew it was breaking EU  antitrust rules.

TD
"Telefonica's  price structures raised its competitors' costs, restricted  competition on the retail market, and made consumers pay the price," she told reporters, saying the decision was a warning to others in newly opened sectors -- such as energy.

The company said it would appeal the EU decision it called "unjustified and disproportionate," and said it contradicted ongoing supervision from the Spanish telecom regulator.

It said this created legal uncertainty about which regulator was in charge, which would inevitably affect its ability to launch new products and services.
"Telefonica  has legitimate reasons to believe it has strictly adhered to the regulations governing fair
competition and has acted in good faith," it said.

Spain's former national monopoly controls the fixed line telephone network used for 80 percent of all ADSL broadband Internet connections. Rivals need to buy wholesale access from  Telefonica  to offer competing retail services.

The European Commission said these wholesale prices on regional and national networks were set so high from 2001 to 2006 that they held back the rollout of broadband Internet in Spain. As a result, the EU said consumers there use the Internet less and pay a fifth more than other western Europeans.

"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," Kroes said. "Consumers have been put off from exploring the new services that broadband Internet allows."

The fine is far higher than other  antitrust fines on telecom companies in similar cases, such as a €12.6 million (US$17 million) penalty on Deutsche Telekom AG or a €10 million (US$13 million)  fine against France Telecom AG's internet arm  Wanadoo.

Kroes said these  fines had not been big enough if they had failed to deter  Telefonica  from also trying to cripple rivals.

"We have had to intervene because the incumbents still control the fixed local access networks built when they had exclusive rights, and this control gives them the ability and the incentive to exclude competitors from related markets, such as broadband Internet access," she said.


Page 67 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
She said she would not tolerate similar behavior in other newly liberalized markets, just days after the EU electricity sector fully opened up. The EU is investigating  antitrust abuse by European gas companies and has signaled it may open further probes.
"I will not allow dominant companies to use their market power to close down markets that the European
Union has opened," she said.

Regulators said Telefonica's  business plan and cost accounts showed that the company would have known that margins were too low to be cover costs. They said  Telefonica  is and was profitable along its entire supply chain but has been losing money in the retail market.

But Telefonica  had argued that the Commission had not proved that competitors were losing money, claiming no companies had been forced to exit the market and several had entered.

"The Commission's line of argument is totally contradictory, since high retail prices by definition provide competitors with a margin," it said.
Broadband has grown rapidly in Spain in recent years, it said, and  competition has increased with
Telefonica's  market share falling from 95 percent in 2001 to the current 55 percent.

Although the Spanish regulatory agency, the CMT, had cleared  Telefonica's  regional wholesale prices before it set a cap in 2006, the EU said it had used market and cost forecasts -- instead of the EU's historical data -- and had not looked into the margin squeeze problem or national network access.

"There is nothing extraordinary or exceptional in the fact that the Commission and the CMT found different results," it said.
The CMT ended the problem when it reduced  Telefonica's  wholesale prices by between 22 percent and
61 percent.

"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," Kroes said. "Consumers have been put off from exploring the new services that broadband Internet allows."

The fine is far higher than other  antitrust fines on telecom companies in similar cases, such as a euro12.6 million (US$17 million) penalty on Deutsche Telekom AG or a euro10 million (US$13 million) fine against France Telecom AG's internet arm  Wanadoo.

Kroes said these  fines had not been big enough if they had failed to deter  Telefonica  from also trying to cripple rivals.

"We have had to intervene because the incumbents still control the fixed local access networks built when they had exclusive rights, and this control gives them the ability and the incentive to exclude competitors from related markets, such as broadband Internet access," she said.

She said she would not tolerate similar behavior in other newly liberalized markets, just days after the EU electricity sector fully opened up. The EU is investigating  antitrust abuse by European gas companies and has signaled it may open further probes.
"I will not allow dominant companies to use their market power to close down markets that the European
Union has opened," she said.

Regulators said Telefonica's  business plan and cost accounts showed that the company would have known that margins were too low to be cover costs. They said  Telefonica  is and was profitable along its entire supply chain but has been losing money in the retail market.

But Telefonica  had argued that the Commission had not proved that competitors were losing money, claiming no companies had been forced to exit the market and several had entered.

"The Commission's line of argument is totally contradictory, since high retail prices by definition provide competitors with a margin," it said.
Broadband has grown rapidly in Spain in recent years, it said, and  competition has increased with
Telefonica's  market share falling from 95 percent in 2001 to the current 55 percent.

Although the Spanish regulatory agency, the CMT, had cleared  Telefonica's  regional wholesale prices before it set a cap in 2006, the EU said it had used market and cost forecasts -- instead of the EU's historical data -- and had not looked into the margin squeeze problem or national network access.

"There is nothing extraordinary or exceptional in the fact that the Commission and the CMT found different results," it said.
The CMT ended the problem when it reduced  Telefonica's  wholesale prices by between 22 percent and
61 percent.

HD     EU fines Spain's Telefonica  more than 151 million euros for unfair Internet prices

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA 151.9 million euros ($206.5 million) on Wednesday, claiming the company unfairly squeezed rivals by setting wholesale Internet prices too high to allow them turn a profit.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high fine -- second only in EU monopoly  abuse penalties to the landmark 497 million euro ($613 million) fine on Microsoft Corp. -- reflected the fact that Telefonica  knew it was breaking EU  antitrust rules.

TD
"Telefonica's  price structures raised its competitors' costs, restricted  competition on the retail market, and made consumers pay the price," she told reporters, saying the decision was a warning to others in newly opened sectors -- such as energy.

The company said it would appeal the EU decision it called "unjustified and disproportionate," and said it contradicted ongoing supervision from the Spanish telecom regulator.

It said this created legal uncertainty about which regulator was in charge, which would inevitably affect its ability to launch new products and services.
"Telefonica  has legitimate reasons to believe it has strictly adhered to the regulations governing fair
competition and has acted in good faith," it said.

Spain's former national monopoly controls the fixed line telephone network used for 80 percent of all ADSL broadband Internet connections. Rivals need to buy wholesale access from  Telefonica  to offer competing retail services.

The European Commission said these wholesale prices on regional and national networks were set so high from 2001 to 2006 that they held back the rollout of broadband Internet in Spain. As a result, the EU said consumers there use the Internet less and pay a fifth more than other western Europeans.

Reuters reported that  Telefonica  S.A. will have to pay EUR 151.9 million ($207 million) for squeezing out rivals from the ADSL Internet market, the EU's  antitrust authority stated on Wednesday. The European Commission stated, the Company's wholesale prices to other Internet providers were too high in comparison to its own retail prices -- a margin squeeze -- which meant rivals made losses when they resold the access to ordinary consumers. The Company has argued it was following market rules on pricing as established by Spain's telecoms market commission CMT, and that the EU was effectively overruling the national watchdog. But the Commission said CMT's pricing was based on the Company's forecasts.

Spain's telecoms regulator yesterday took umbrage at the European anti-trust authorities going over its head in a case involving Telefónica.

A brewing row over whether  Telefónica  was guilty of trying to stymie competition in the Spanish broadband market is expected to come to a head later this week with the European Commission slapping a huge fine on the former state monopoly for overcharging rivals for the use of its ADSL network in order to squeeze their margins.

TD
The Telecommunications Market Commission (CMT) had previously launched its own probe in 2003 following a complaint by a rival, and decided to shelve the case after finding that  Telefónica  had adhered to the wholesale ADSL pricing system the CMT itself had established.

"As head of the CMT, I don't take kindly to this," the chairman of the watchdog, Reinaldo Rodríguez said. "I believe we independent regulators know the sector better [than Brussels] and have better tools [to promote  competition],"he added.

If the Commission feels that there are grounds for taking legal action, it should do so against the CMT, not Telefónica,  Rodríguez said, and predicted that the dispute would have to be settled by the European Court of Justice. According to sources close to the EC,  Telefónica  could be fined over
€100 million.

Rodríquez defended the CMT's track record in freeing up the telecoms market. He pointed to the fact that Telefónica's  market share of the ADSL business in Spain had fallen to 55-56 percent due to the development of alternative networks from 95 percent when it decided to shelve the complaint filed by France Telecom's  Wanadoo.

However, he noted that broadband rates still remain above the European average, particularly for retail customers.

PRESS RELEASE

TD
The company has fully complied with the Spanish authority's regulation

TELEFONICA DISAGREES WITH  EUROPEAN COMMISSION DECISION AND WILL IMMEDIATELY REQUEST ITS ANNULMENT BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COURTS

The EU decision is wholly unjustified given the satisfactory evolution of the Spanish broadband market, publicly acknowledged by the national regulator.

Madrid, 4 July 2007.- Telefonica  announced today its firm intention to lodge an application for annulment of the European Commission ruling in connection with the proceedings initiated against Telefonica  de Espana for an alleged abuse of dominance in the Spanish market for broadband Internet access. It will file its request before the European Courts in the coming days.

Telefonica  considers the Commission decision unjustified and disproportionate.  Telefonica  contests the decision's legal, economical and market analysis, and underlines that it has fully complied with the existing regulation imposed by the Spanish authority, the Comision del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones (CMT). The company is convinced it has rigorously met the CMT's strict parameters which, for the sake of  competition and on an ex ante basis, regulate every initiative taken by Telefonica  to offer consumers a range of innovative and varied products and services, both in terms of price and quality.

It is the first time that the Commission identifies an illegal margin squeeze for a non-essential service such as wholesale indirect access, which does not exist as a regulatory obligation in some of our neighbouring countries. Moreover, the Commission's line of argument is totally contradictory, since high retail prices by definition provide competitors with a margin.

Furthermore, as publicly acknowledged by the CMT, the Spanish broadband market has seen increased competition, which makes the Commission decision even more surprising. New operators have entered the market while  Telefonica's  share of the broadband market has decreased steadily (from 95% in 2001 to the current 55%). To  fine Telefonica  for a breach of the  competition rules is not reasonable.

Spain has experienced an exponential growth in broadband connections between 2001 and 2005, in line with similar EU Member States. The  European Commission itself recognised this in its latest implementation report, stating that broadband penetration in Spain is developing satisfactorily.

The Spanish broadband market is characterised by the presence of strong and well-capitalised competitors, including cable operators who do not depend on  Telefonica's  infrastructure to offer their services. This differentiates the Spanish market from many other EU countries, further calling into doubt the Commission's decision.
Legal uncertainty


Page 75 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators - the national regulator (CMT) and the European Commission - which are at odds with each other. As a result, the decision by the Commission creates enormous uncertainty about the role played by the regulatory bodies and the competition authorities in the telecommunications sector, throwing into question the supervisory functions of the Spanish authorities.

The legal uncertainty created by this decision will inevitably affect  Telefonica's  and other operators' ability to launch new products and services, with a direct impact on the entire European telecommunications sector to the detriment of European consumers.

Telefonica  will nevertheless continue to offer broadband services in the highly competitive Spanish market, while at the same time maintaining its commitment to guaranteeing fair  competition and generating consumer benefits as core values within  Telefonica's  corporate strategy.

The events date back to 2003, when Wanadoo (a company with public participation of the French State) lodged a complaint before the European Commission against Telefonica  alleging an abuse of dominant position in the Spanish broadband market through a so-called "margin squeeze." In February
2006, the  European Commission initiated formal proceedings against  Telefonica  de Espana on the grounds of anti-competitive behaviour, without having considered the possibility of imposing precautionary measures to remedy the situation. These proceedings were initiated despite recurring and intense supervision by the Spanish telecommunications regulator CMT, which has monitored and regulated the company's pricing policy for broadband services without ever detecting a margin squeeze. For this reason, Telefonica  has legitimate reasons to believe it has strictly adhered to the regulations governing fair competition and has acted in good faith.

Telefónica  has been fined EUR151mn by the  European Commission for anti-competitive behaviour in the Spanish broadband market. As reported by BMI in late June, the penalty was confirmed in a draft decision, which was approved at a meeting of Commissioners on July 4. The sum is the second-highest fine ever handed out to a company for abusing its dominant market position, after the EUR497mn penalty handed out to Microsoft.

TD
The Spanish telecoms group was found guilty of using its leading position in the local broadband market to operate a margin squeeze on its competitors. In other words, the difference between the wholesale charges levied on alternative operators and the retail price of  Telefónica's  own services was so small that its rivals were unable to make their operations economically viable. Commenting on the  fine, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that 'when consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers. I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation.' Improving accessibility to broadband services is a key pillar of the EU's strategy to transform Europe into a high-tech knowledge economy. The Commission argues that Telefónica's  dominance is one of the main reasons why Spain has a lower broadband penetration rate than other Western European markets such as France or the UK.

However, there is some good news for Telefónica  in the mobile sector. According to news reports, the group's European wireless unit Telefónica  O2 is close to securing an exclusive deal to supply Apple 's iPhone in the UK market. The phone was recently launched in the US, amid much media hype, by AT&T. Apple is now preparing to launch the handset in three key European markets - the UK, France
and Germany - before expanding elsewhere in Europe and into Asia. O2 is the front runner to secure an iPhone deal in the UK, given that it is the market leader. At the end of 2006, the operator had 17.6mn subscribers, compared with 16.94mn at Vodafone and 16.9mn at T-Mobile. However, with all three operators so close in terms of subscribers and b>Orange not far behind on 15.3mn, Apple has a wide choice of partners, putting it in a strong bargaining position. Indeed, the computer and media group is already thought to have struck a hard bargain with AT&T, reportedly securing a share of the operator's customer revenues.

HD      COMPETITION : SPAIN'S TELEFONICA FINED RECORD 151 MILLION EURO WC    675 words
PD     5 July 2007
SN     Europolitics SC     EURREP LA     English

LP
The European Commission's competition team marked 4 July by fining Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica  €151.875 million, the second-highest  fine ever imposed in an abuse of dominance case (after, of course, Microsoft).

"Telefonica  has committed a very serious  abuse of its dominant position," said  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will not allow dominant companies to use their market power to close down markets that the European Union has opened."

TD
As the former telecoms incumbent prior to liberalisation,  Telefonica  is the largest internet provider in Spain. It is the only Spanish operator with a network covering the whole country and thus holds a dominant position in the market. The Commission's investigation found that, from 2001 to 2006, the company ran a pricing strategy that effectively stopped competitors advancing in the broadband internet
market. Telefonica  was charging competitors a fee for access to internet infrastructures which was almost the same as the price paid by consumers for using the service. This strategy effectively blocked rivals
from competing with  Telefonica  by preventing them from setting prices high enough to leave room for any profit. It also meant that no new entrants could hope to get even a foothold. If  Telefonica  themselves had been paying their own access fees, they would have clocked up considerable losses, the Commission found. This practice of so-called margin squeeze' constitutes an  abuse of the company's dominant
position contrary to Article 82 of the Treaty.

The overall effect, said Kroes, was to remove competitive incentives to lower prices, invest in infrastructure and introduce innovative services. This left Spanish consumers paying on average 20% more for broadband than their EU neighbours and has led to a penetration rate for such services in Spain trailing below the EU average.

And the commissioner had a wider message for other formerly state-run sectors - although she would not specify, energy is an obvious candidate. "I want to send a strong signal to dominant undertakings in all sectors that could be tempted to engage in similar practices that I will not tolerate such behaviour," she said.
THE SPANISH MARKET

Telecoms is, indeed, a regulated market and, said Kroes, it was action by the Spanish telecoms regulator CMT which put an end to the  abuse. Following a statement of objections sent by the Commission to Telefonica  in February 2006, CMT carried out their own analysis. This led to them setting new maximum wholesale prices in December 2006, thus opening the margin for possible profit. Just as well they did so, commented Kroes, as, had the  abuse continued,  Telefonica  would have found itself with an even higher fine.

The Commission was at pains to explain that there was no conflict with the CMT over the case, even though the results of the two investigations appear at variance. The regulators, explained a Commission memo, were judging the effectiveness of  competition ex ante using forecasts based on figures provided by Telefonica  itself. The Commission, however, was acting ex poste on the basis of actual cost figures and with the benefit of hindsight.
WARNINGS IGNORED

Telefonica  is by no means the first telecoms company to try to benefit from its former monopoly position. In May 2003, the Commission  finedDeutsche Telekom €12.6 million for similarly fixing prices below cost on internet markets. And two months later,  Wanadoo, a subsidiary of French incumbent France Télécom, was fined €10.35 million for the very same margin squeeze practices. In fact it was this  fine which prompted Wanadoo to make the complaint which led to the opening of the  Telefonica  investigation in
July 2003. And the Spanish company's blatant failure to take notice of the Commission's clear message from these cases, said Neelie Kroes, was a factor in the level of the  fines. The upshot has been a  fine for Telefonica  at over ten times the 2003 levels. The Commission is getting tougher and, as Kroes pointed out, the sums levied in 2003 were clearly "not a sufficient deterrent".

Yesterday, the European Commission fined Telefonica,  the Spanish telecommunications group,
151.8m euros for 'abuse of dominant market position in the Spanish broadband internet market'. The  fine
was the second-largest ever imposed in the European Union, after the  fine imposed on software giant
Microsoft (497m euros), and the largest ever imposed on a telco.

According to the Commission,  Telefonica  was guilty of providing rivals with wholesale access to its broadband network at such high prices that they were not able to cover the cost of providing internet services to retail customers. Brussels was of the view that this meant  Telefonica's  rivals had to incur losses or leave the market.  Telefonica  for its part, will appeal what it has described as the 'inexplicable' fine before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, on the grounds that it is 'unjustified and disproportionate'.

The 152m-euro fine imposed by the European Commission on leading Spanish telecoms group Telefonica  for abuse of dominant position in the internet broadband market has been considered a matter of state in business circles. The  fine, a result of a complaint lodged by France Telecom, in which the French state holds a stake, is fifteen times higher than the fine imposed on the French operator for the same reasons. It is also some fifteen times higher than the fine imposed on Deutsche Telekom, in which the German state holds a stake. France and Germany have a strong presence in European bodies, while the Spanish economy has been increasing rapidly over the last few years, taking also into account the recent substantial acquisitions carried out by Spanish companies in other European countries. Warnings and sanctions from Brussels to Spanish companies have increased over the last few months, mainly because of the tax incentives given to Spanish companies investing abroad.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for  competition, has been extremely hard on  Telefonica.  The operator has nearly doubled its size in barely three years, having entered the UK and German markets through the acquisition of mobile operator O2, and also the Czech market. Ms Kroes yesterday sent to Cesar Alierta, the chairman of  Telefonica,  a brief six-paragraph fax with the reasons behind the  fine and the amount to be paid - 152m euros, i.e. 2.4 per cent of the group's net profit in 2006 -, adding that there will be a 3.5 per cent interest charge if the fine is not paid within three months. The CMT, the Spanish stock market regulator, is defending Telefonica's  position, as it considers that Brussels wants to weaken the power of the CMT and other domestic regulators. The clashing regulations between Brussels and the CMT result in legal insecurity for  Telefonica  when it comes to defending its business.

The European Commission's decision yesterday to make an example of  Telefonica  for abuses of its dominant position in the broadband market is a fairly serious blow for the Spanish telecoms group.

Although the company is big enough to absorb the hefty Euros 152m (Dollars 207m)  fine - assuming its appeal fails - the sanction undermines a concerted campaign to shed its image in Spain as the big, bad market-abusing incumbent.

TD
Competitors and consumers readily agree that, in some cases, the company's marketing and pricing techniques are questionable at best and, yes, abusive at worst. Ironically, however, in the case of network access charges to broadband competitors,  Telefonica  appears to have been playing by the rules.

Executives have always maintained their innocence and those from some rival groups admit privately that Brussels may have come down a little hard on the incumbent.

Spain's Telecoms Market Commission (CMT), the market regulator, has been particularly critical of the sanction, arguing that, as it sets wholesale tariffs for fixed-line services, the scope for  abuse is minimal. When the tariff system was introduced in 2001, it argues,  Telefonica  enjoyed a whopping 95 per cent of the fixed-line market. This has since been pared to 55 per cent.

Although conceding that the country's broadband market has been slow to evolve, its system for calculating network access charges - based on subtracting from the final cost to consumers - is not the culprit, it argues.

The fact that the CMT has taken offence at the EC's charges against  Telefonica  is not surprising: the sanction is akin to a slap in the face for the regulator.

But it has given rise to a most surprising alliance. In normal circumstances, the CMT and  Telefonica  are at each other's throats, the former disallowing unfairly priced products and the latter complaining of overzealousness. Suddenly, they are comrades in arms. Whatever  Telefonica  and the CMT say about the EC, they may one day thank it for bringing them together.

HD        Telefonica  hit by Euros 152m antitrust fine. BY       By TOBIAS BUCK and MARK MULLIGAN

Telefonica  was yesterday told to pay a Euros 152m (Dollars 207m)  antitrust fine, after the  European   Commission found Spain's dominant telecoms group guilty of illegally freezing out rivals from the lucrative broadband market.

It is the largest  fine Brussels has ever imposed on a telecoms company, outstripping earlier penalties imposed on Deutsche Telekom and France's  Wanadoo for similar abuses by a factor of 10. With the exception of Microsoft, no other company has been punished more severely for abusing a dominant position.

TD
The EU's top  antitrust regulator said the fine was intended as a warning to other groups, and reflected Brussels' determination to defend competition in newly liberalised markets such as energy and telecoms.  Telefonica  rejected the charges, and vowed to appeal against the ruling.

"Telefonica's  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy," said Neelie Kroes, the EU  competition commissioner. "I want to send a strong signal to dominant undertakings in all sectors that could be tempted to engage in similar practices that I will nottolerate such behaviour," she added.

The Commission found  Telefonica  operated a "margin squeeze" on its rivals for more than five years beginning in September 2001. The group weakened its competitors by setting the wholesale cost of accessing Telefonica's  broadband network so close to the retail price that rivals were forced to make losses to stay in the market,Brussels said.

Ms Kroes said the group's behaviour had undermined the growth of broadband in one of Europe's largest economies: "Spain has a broadband penetration rate well below the EU average. Consumers have been put off from exploring the new services that broadband internet allows."

Telefonica  yesterday railed against the size of the  fine, describing it as "unjustified and disproportionate".

The Commission's case against  Telefonica  has also raised questions about the regulation of Spain's broadband segment, where network access charges are fixed by the Telecoms Market Commission (CMT). The group has repeatedly pointed to the CMT's approval of its rates in its defence against Brussels, exposing an embarrassing rift between the Spanish regulator and the Commission.

Telefonica  said it had always "complied scrupulously with the rules imposed by the CMT". It added: "We believe that the  fine punishes us for being caught between two sets of contradictory rules - those of the CMT and those of the European regulator." Until late 2003, retail charges were set by the Spanish government, and the CMT used these to calculate wholesale charges which were supposed to allow space for competitors to make money in the broadband market.

When retail prices were liberalised, it began calculating the wholesale tariffs according to real market prices provided by Telefonica.

The company said it would present its appeal "within the next few days".

HD         Telefonica fined €152m over broadband prices

The European Commission has fined Telefonica,  the Spanish incumbent telecoms company and owner of O2, a record €152m (£102m) over its wholesale broadband pricing, prompting a furious response from the company.

TD
The fine is a record for the telecoms sector and the second largest ever imposed by EU regulators, beaten only by the €497m penalty dished out to Microsoft for abusing its market position. It dwarfs previous penalties of tens of millions of euros imposed on Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom’s Wanadoo unit in 2003 over similar issues.

Telefonica  has been accused of abusing its market position in Spain by charging its competitors in the broadband sector excessive fees for its wholesale product compared to its own retail prices. EU regulators have said that this stifled  competition, as Telefonica’s  rivals in the broadband market were not able to make a sufficient margin when reselling high-speed internet services to consumers.

Neelie Kroes, the European Union  competition commissioner, said: “Telefonica’s  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe’s economy.”

Ms Kroes defended the size of the  fine, arguing that previous financial sanctions imposed over market abuse were not sufficient to act as a deterrent to other European companies. She said that small businesses and consumers in Spain pay around 20 per cent more than the EU average for high-speed internet and that Telefonica  could have “ended this  abuse” when the inquiry began in late 2003 after a complaint from Wanadoo.

Ms Kroes has taken a tough stance over anti-competitive issues since she took over as EU  competition commissioner in 2004 and said the  fine imposed on the Spanish telecoms provider should act as a warning to other incumbent or dominant players in industries such as energy and telecoms. “I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation.”

Telefonica  said it would immediately appeal the  European Commission’s ruling and will file an appeal with the European Court of Justice over the coming days. In a strongly worded statement,  Telefonica said the decision to  fine the company was “wholly unjustified and disproportionate”. The company argues that it has complied with the regulation imposed by CMT, the Spanish regulator, and that competition in the broadband market has been increasing. “Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators which are at odds with each other,” it said.

Telefonica  also said that its share of the broadband market has “decreased significantly and steadily in recent years”. It also said that the  European Commission itself has recognised the growth in competition in Spanish broadband in its latest implementation report, which stated that high-speed internet penetration in Spain is “developing satisfactorily”. The company argued that the market is characterised by the presence of strong competitors, including cable operators that do not depend on its wholesale product.

Mark James, an analyst with Collins Stewart, said that the fine was “anomalous” given that wholesale prices were set by the Spanish regulator, not by Telefonica.  Mr James said that while the  fine was unwelcome, it only represented 0.2 per cent of the compa-ny’s market value.

Interest rates The Times Monetary Policy Committee split 5 to 4 in a tight vote to recommend that the Bank of England should raise interest rates again today to a new six-year high of 5.75 per cent. The Bank's own MPC is widely expected to push through another increase in borrowing costs, the fifth since last August. Page 52

The services sector saw activity gather steam last month to record its strongest conditions since January, according to the latest CIPS/RBS purchasing managers' survey. Its headline index of activity rose to 57.7 for June, up from 57.2 in May, boosted by strong readings for outstanding business, new orders and future expectations. Page 52
Housing market More evidence emerged that Britain's housing market is coming off the boil, with
Halifax reporting that average UK house prices rose by a modest 0.4 per cent last month, after an even
more muted 0.2 per cent gain in May. Both increases were well down on those seen in the earlier
months of the year.

Mortgage equity withdrawal Britain's homeowners cashed in on the rising value of their homes to borrow another Pounds 13.2 billion through mortgage equity withdrawal during the first quarter -the equivalent of 6.2 per cent of household disposable incomes. The figure was close to that for the final quarter of last year.

Eurozone services sector activity accelerated last month to its fastest in a year, according to the latest RBS/NTC purchasing managers' survey of the sector. Its headline index of activity rose to 55.8 in June, from a May reading of 55.6, in the latest indication of the persistent strength of the eurozone economy.

France kept up its push for eurozone finance ministers to have more say over exchange-rate policy. Jean-Pierre Jouyet, Secretary of State for European Affairs, said that EU law already made clear that governments and not the European Central Bank had responsibility for framing such policy and argued that currency policies should fit with national growth and employment goals.

International Monetary Fund Tomasso Padoa Schioppa is expected to replace Gordon Brown as chairman of the IMF's ruling International Monetary and Financial Committee. Leszek Balcerowicz, former Governor of the Polish central bank, emerged as a potential candidate to succeed Rodrigo de Rato as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

Telefonica,  the Spanish telecoms operator, was  fined Euro 151 million (Pounds 102 million) by the European Commission yesterday for implementing anti competitive practices against its domestic rivals between September 2001 and December 2006.

The fine is the highest -after a Euro 497 million penalty given to Microsoft to be imposed on a company for abusing its dominant position.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the European  Competition Commissioner, said that  Telefonica's  behaviour had raised costs for competitors. "When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers. I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation," she said.

Telefonica  was found guilty of operating a margin squeeze between the high wholesale rates that it charged rivals wishing to use its broadband access and the retail prices that it set for its own customers.

The telecoms group said that it would appeal against yesterday's decision, which it described as "unjustified and disproportionate". "Telefonica  has legitimate reasons to believe it has strictly adhered to the regulations governing fair competition and has acted in good faith," the company said.

Operator outraged by 'unjustified and disproportionate' €152m  fine
The European Commission has ordered Telefónica  to pay a record fine for antitrust activities in the
Spanish broadband market.

TD
The €152m (£103m) fine was imposed over the Spanish telco's wholesale broadband pricing, which the
Commission ruled is holding prices at 20 per cent higher than other European companies.

Telefónica  hit back at the  fine describing it as "wholly unjustified and disproportionate" as it had complied with competition guidelines set out by the Spanish Telecommunications Market Commission.

European Union  competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said that the  fine had been increased dramatically from those handed to Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom in 2003 because they had not acted as a deterrent to other companies.

"Telefónica's  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy," said Kroes.
However, Telefónica  said that the ruling would have wider effects for the broadband market throughout
Europe.

"This decision creates a legal insecurity that will alter the future performance of  Telefónica  and all the operators, with a direct hit in the development of the sector and damage to European end users," said the firm in a statement.

The €152m fine is the largest awarded against a telecoms company. Microsoft's  antitrust fine of €497m is the only higher amount imposed by the EU courts.

Telefónica,  which owns mobile phone company O2, said it would appeal the ruling.

Global Insight Perspective
Significance               The
European  Commission hit Telefónica with the highest-ever penalty applied to a telecoms operator for abusing its dominant position in the local market. Implications               The local regulatory authority had approved the operator's charges and has thus come into direct confrontation with the European body.
Outlook                    Global Insight expects that this decision will
cause further problems for the European Union Information Society Commissioner
Viviane Reding, who favours the creation of a super-regulator on a European level.

TD
According to European Union (EU) officials in Brussels,  Telefónica—taking  advantage of its former incumbent operator status—fixed its broadband wholesale prices too high and did not leave enough margin for competing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to make a profit, thus undermining  competition in the market. As a result, Spanish broadband access subscribers paid an estimated 20% more than the average monthly price in the 15 EU member countries before the penultimate enlargement in 2004. This reflects the broadband penetration of the country, which is 20 percentage points lower than the average EU figure due to 30% lesser growth rates. The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, declared that, "I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation" and added that, "the margin squeeze that Telefónica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs, but also harmed customers significantly". Telefónica's  spokesman, Ángel Garzón, remarked that "we don't see any justification for this accusation, nor for any type of  fine". Garzón also observed that, "we've implemented all the requirements imposed by the Spanish regulator". The operator is expected to file an appeal within the next two months and 10 days, as outlined by the law.
Historical Background And The Regulator's Position

Yesterday's  fine resulted from anti-trust claims made by France Telecom, then operating under the Wanadoo brand, dating back to 2003, which accused  Telefónica  of fixing its resale broadband prices too high. The accusation involved the period between September 2001 and December 2006, despite the fact that all prices were approved by Spanish telecoms regulator Comisión del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones (CMT). The  European Commission announced that it does recognise the fact that resale prices were regulated by to the law, although it claims that  Telefónica  could have lowered its rates of its own accord, knowing that the profit margin was limited. After changes in the process, CMT analysed the market status in February 2006 and decided to lower  Telefónica's  resale prices in December 2006, which brought an end to the claims. According to Brussels, CMT allowed the Spanish incumbent to apply the same pricing strategy for over five years and this resulted to this week's  fine. CMT's president, Reinaldo Rodríguez, announced that the Spanish regulator's position was commensurate neither with the methodology nor with the European Commission's applied criteria to the  fine. Rodriguez claimed that
the fine refers to a period during which Telefónica  claimed an approximate 95% of the broadband market, whereas now its share has fallen to 56%. He also added that the  European Commission conforms to the  Competition Law, which involves legislation other than that applied by the national regulatory authorities. This law, he indicated, has not been capable of promoting  competition, and he further argued that the EU shoud not rule on cases that have already been assessed by the national regulators.

Outlook and Implications
Landmark Fine

The fine is the highest ever imposed by the European body on a telecoms operator and is several times higher than similar penalties imposed in the past. For example, the Commission applied a 12.6 million euro (US$14.76 million)  fine against German incumbent Deutsche Telekom for unfair pricing practices when providing access to its local loops (see Germany: 21 May 2003: ). According to the European body, Deutsche Telekom charged companies higher fees for wholesale access to the local loop than the price subscribers paid for their fixed-line subscriptions, thus discouraging new players from entering the market and reducing price competition for consumers. It also  finedFrance Telecom 10.4 million euro after
finding that its broadband-access charges were below its costs. Under EU rules, the Commission can impose penalties that can amount to as much as 10% of global annual sales for abusing their market positions under the common  Competition Law.
Super-Regulator Versus.National Authorities
This latest development is in line with the EU's plans to proceed with the creation of a single
super-regulator, as outlined by Information Society Commissioner Viviane Reding (see Europe: 1 June
2007: ). In a statement released on 31 May, Reding said she will launch the proposals by end of October
2007, seeking further powers to strengthen telecoms regulations in the region. "Telecommunications is
clearly a field where we need more Europe, not less," she said. "In many EU countries, I see that national
telecoms regulators are prevented from doing the best possible job, either because they are not
sufficiently independent or lack the required resources and instruments—it is here where Europe can
help". Reding also plans to force incumbent telcos to spin off their local-loop infrastructure. In relation to
Telefónica's  fine, CMT's president said that this is not part of the Commission's role, because "to take
such a decision you have to play by the same rules of the game" and that "European independent
regulators are specialised on the telecommunications sector, we know it better and we apply better
practices. Deciding over the correctness or not of the resolution of a certain commission…can serve as a
reference to the European Court of Justice".

The European Commission has issued a record fine to Spain's  Telefonica  for abuse of market position regarding the telecoms operator's broadband services. The Commissioner for Competition, Neelie
Kroes, approved the 151.9-million-euro  fine (US$206 million) for  Telefonica's  anti-competitive practices regarding Spain's broadband Internet market. Kroes accused the telecoms giant of "a very serious  abuse of its dominant position" by forcing rival broadband providers to buy wholesale broadband access from
the company, which, it is claimed, kept prices "artificially high", thereby squeezing the margins of its competitors.  Telefonica  is the only Spanish telecommunications operator that has a nation-wide fixed telephone network, which gave it a dominant market position.

TD
The Commission highlighted that as a result of such practices, "Spanish consumers are paying far more than the average for high-speed Internet access and many have chosen not to pay that price."Significance: The  European Commission is the European Union’s (EU)'s top  competition watchdog, and is fierce in safeguarding the liberalisation of markets within the bloc, particularly targeting the energy, telecommunications and transport sectors.  Fines are deemed to be an effective deterrent to anti-competitive practices, but in the past these have been more a symbolic gesture than anything else. The Commission has also often clashed with member-states over  competition, with the latter keen to defend "national champions" from exposure to full market liberalisation. One such example is the recent initiative from French President Nicolas Sarkozy to delete a crucial reference "fair and undistorted competition" from one of the basic principles of the EU charter. This has sent warning signals to the Commission, concerned at an erosion of its powers of regulation and supervision, which it has vowed to fight at all cost.

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators finedTelefonica SA 151.9 million euros ($206.9 million), saying the company used its grip Spain's telephone network to hamper rival providers of high-speed Internet services.

By raising fees for access to its telephone network and lowering its own retail broadband prices, Telefonica  squeezed other providers' margins, said the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm.

TD
The commission's penalty -- the highest against a telecommunications company -- is part of a broader effort to shake up the sector, still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. During the past year, the regulator has pressed for cuts in mobile-phone roaming charges and changes in several broadband markets. Last week it took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network.

Telefonica  was "making it virtually impossible for competitors to enter the market," the commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference.

The company said it will appeal the  fine, calling the commission's penalty "unjustified and disproportionate." It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecom regulator.

"Telefonica  finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the  European     Commission, which are at odds with each other," the company said in a statement.

Ms. Kroes said  Telefonica's  fine was justified because of the seriousness of the  abuse and the harm to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest
EU member countries, and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% below average, the commission said.
The hefty penalty shows the EU regulator is escalating its crackdown on  antitrust abuses.

In similar cases in 2003,  Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom SA, was  fined 10.4 million euros and Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros. In a range of recent alleged collusion cases,  fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago.

The company said its share of Spain's broadband market has declined steadily since 2001, to 55% from 95%. Its main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France Telecom, and Jazztel PLC. Orange first complained to the commission about  Telefonica's  business practices in
2003.
The commission's  fine "confirms the validity" of Orange's complaint, Orange said in a statement. A
spokesman for Jazztel declined to comment.

Being a former state-owned monopoly helped  Telefonica  rig Spain's broadband market, the commission said. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines.  Telefonica,  which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network.

Following the decision by Brussels to impose a 151.875m-euro  fine on Telefonica  for abuse of dominant position in the internet broadband market, the leading Spanish telecoms group has announced that within the next few days it will be lodging an appeal against the decision with the Luxemburg Court of Justice, asking for the  fine to be cancelled.

TD
Telefonica  considers that the decision is both unjustified and disproportionate, as the operator as always followed the regulations set by the CMT, the Spanish telecoms market regulator. It also mentions that the fine has been imposed following a request from France Telecom, in which the French state holds a stake and which has already fined for the same reason. Telefonica  also argues that the  European                    Commission has mentioned the lack of competition in the Spanish market, when in fact the operator's share of this market has fallen from 95 per cent in 2001 to 55 per cent in 2006. The Spanish operator also rejects the accusation that it has hindered the development of broadband in the country, and it also adds that Telefonica's  prices stand around the European average. Finally,  Telefonica  wonders why, if the European authorities were so concerned about the rights of the consumers, it has taken them four years
to make a decision without adopting any cautionary measures.

HD       Telefonica  slapped with $205 mil EC fine

LP
BRUSSELS -- Spanish telecoms giant  Telefonica  was fined €151 million ($205 million) Wednesday by the European Commission for stunting the Spanish broadband Internet market by stifling  competition.

The Commission -- the European Union's  antitrust authority -- said  Telefonica  charged wholesale rates that were almost as much as retail prices, preventing competing Internet providers from making a profit.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high  fine reflected the fact that the Spanish firm was aware it was breaching EU rules. The  fine is the largest ever slapped on a telecoms operator in Europe and the second largest the EC has imposed for abusing market strength after a hitting Microsoft with a €497 million penalty in 2004.

Kroes said Telefonica,  Spain's biggest telephone company and former national monopoly, was guilty of "very serious abuse" of its dominance in broadband Internet access. Kroes said the penalty set an important precedent for companies in other industries such as energy, transport and telecom services
that have recently been liberalized. "Let me be perfectly clear: I will not allow dominant companies to use their market power to close down markets that the European Union has opened," she said.

Spanish consumers pay 20% more than the average in the 15 countries that were EU members before enlargement in 2004, the EC said. The number of broadband subscribers in Spain is 20% below the average of the 15 nations, it added.

Telefonica  controls the fixed line telephone network used for 80% of all ADSL broadband Internet connections. Rivals need to buy wholesale access from  Telefonica  to offer competing retail services. But Telefonica  structured its wholesale and retail prices in such a way that the margin between them did not allow rivals to compete in the market without making losses. "Through this so-called 'margin squeeze,' Telefonica  insulated itself from the rigors of  competition by making it impossible for alternative broadband suppliers to enter the market on a commercially viable basis," Kroes said.

Telefonica  immediately announced it would appeal the decision at the European Court of First Instance, the EU's second-highest court. It described the ruling as "inexplicable," and insisted it had abided with
the Spanish regulatory authority, CMT. "Telefonica  finds the decision by Brussels to be unjustified and disproportionate, both legally and economically," the company said in a statement.

Telefonica  said that the EC's demands contradicted ongoing supervision from the CMT, and this would eventually create wider problems for the telecoms sector. "The legal uncertainty created by this decision will inevitably affect  Telefonica's  and other operators' ability to launch new products and services," it said.

At the same time, France Telecom, whose unit Orange competes with  Telefonica,  said it may file a damages claim against the Spanish operator.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission fines Telefónica  €151 million for abusing  its dominant position on broadband Internet access

Brussels, 04/07/2007 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 4 July, the European Commission fined the incumbent Spanish telecommunications operator,  Telefónica,  €151,875,000 for a very serious abuse of its dominant position on the Spanish broadband internet access market. By squeezing the margins between the wholesale prices charged to competitors and the retail prices charged to its own customers, the company weakened its competitors, making their continued presence and growth difficult.
According to  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, this practice is alleged to have brought about a
20% increase in retail prices compared to the EU average, with the effect of dissuading Spanish
consumers from subscribing to broadband internet.  Telefónica,  for its part, has already challenged the
“legal, economic and commercial analysis of the decision” and has declared its intention of bringing an
appeal to the European Court of Justice.

TD
This is an example of a phenomenon known as a “tariff scissor”, in which a company holds a dominant position on the wholesale market for a product or service, whilst at the same time being involved in the retail market. This configuration allows it artificially to inflate wholesale prices, keeping retail prices at a low level. The margin losses on the “retail” side are made up for by profit on the “wholesale” side. But retail competitors, which are obliged to purchase from the same wholesaler, do not have this option, and are therefore priced out of the market. “This behaviour by  Telefónica  [between 2001 and 2006] has harmed Spanish consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole and, by extension, the economy of Europe”, Ms Kroes told the press. The  fine, which is 15 times higher than the one handed down to Wanadoo for a similar scenario in France in 2003 (EUROPE 8506), is justified by the serious nature of the abuse, and
also by the fact that lower  fines did not appear to have any deterrent effect.

The actions of the Commission, however, are not completely in line with those of the Spanish regulator, the Comisión del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones (CMT), which had closed its investigation of 2003 (triggered by a complaint by  Wanadoo in Spain), having noted that  Telefónica  had stuck to the tariffs recommended by the CMT itself in 2001. “As president of the CMT, I do not appreciate [the Commission's initiative]”, explained Reinaldo Rodríguez, speaking to the Spanish daily newspaper El País. “We know the sector better [than Brussels]”. If the Commission takes the view that action must be taken, he said, then
this action should be taken against the CMT. The commissioner replied that she has no problem in principle with the actions taken by the CMT, but that she is obliged to note that this is a situation which is likely to cause confusion. “People have to know who the regulator is, and be able to trust that regulator”, put in Miguel Garzon of  Telefónica,  “otherwise it's a shambles, for investors and for everybody”. Telefónica  plans to table its appeal with the Court in the next few days. If applicable, the proceedings will then be opened at the Court of First Instance within a few months. (cd)

Regulation

EU regulators  fined Spain's  Telefonica  E151 million ($240 million), claiming the company unfairly squeezed rivals by setting wholesale internet prices too high to allow them to turn a profit.

TD
"Telefonica  weakened its competitors, making their continued presence and growth difficult," the European Commission said. "Competitors were forced to make losses if they wanted to match Telefonica's  retail prices."

It said Telefonica's  national and regional wholesale prices from 2001 to 2006 were set at a level that held back the rollout of broadband internet in Spain. As a result, the EU said, consumers there used the internet less and paid a fifth more than other western Europeans.

"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalisation."

Telefonica  -- Spain's former national monopoly -- argues that the Spanish market is healthy because new companies entered and its own market share dropped 10 percentage points to just over half today.

The fine is far higher than other anti-trust  fines on telecoms companies in similar cases, such as a E12.6 million penalty on Deutsche Telekom or a E10 million  fine against France Telecom's internet arm Wanadoo.

The EU defended the high level of the  fine, saying Telefonica's  actions warranted a severe sanction due to their "gravity and duration" and because it had prevented new companies offering broadband in Spain.

Most broadband connections in Spain are offered over fixed telephone lines on a network controlled by Telefonica,  so rivals have to buy wholesale access either at the local, regional or national level.

It said the difference between  Telefonica's  retail and wholesale prices from September 2001 to December 2006 did not allow competitors enough margin to cover costs. "This means that a competing provider of broadband that was just as efficient as  Telefonica  was faced with the choice of either exiting the market or incurring losses," the commission said.

The European Union's top  antitrust authority  fined Spanish telecom firm Telefonica  a record $218.7 million Cdn for squeezing out rivals from the high-speed Internet market. The European Commission said Telefonica's  wholesale prices to other Internet providers were too high compared to its own retail prices. Telefonica  said it would immediately appeal the "unjustified and disproportionate" decision.

Telecom giant hit with record €151-million  fine for strong-arming broadband rivals
The European anti-trust authorities slapped a record €

TD
151.9 million fine on Telefónica  yesterday after finding the former state monopoly guilty of trying to stifle competition in the Spanish broadband internet-access market.
In response, Telefónica  said it would appeal against the "unjustified and disproportionate" ruling by the
European Commission with the European Court of First Instance.

"Let me be perfectly clear - I will not allow dominant companies to use their market power to close down markets that the European Union has opened," the European commissioner for  competition Neelie Kroes told a news conference.

The Commission claimed that between 2001 and the end of last year  Telefónica  charged excessively high wholesale rates for use of its high-speed internet-access network, making it impossible for rivals
to compete in the market without making losses.  Telefónica  has the only countrywide network in Spain for broadband ADSL internet access.
Kroes said the ultimate victim of this so-called margin squeeze was the Spanish consumer. Continued on page 7

HOLIDAY ON ICE Scots bosses too busy to take a break

A SURVEY from the Chartered Management Institute claims that most mid-level executives in Scotland are not taking their full holiday entitlements, adding to a total of 21 million days unused each year across the UK. Some 63 per cent of the Scots asked admitted they will not use their full entitlement this year, a figure that has increased by half since 2003. One in three blames their workload and 39 per cent work
on holiday to reduce pressure when they return.

TD
The CMI also reveals that only a small proportion in Scotland (29 per cent) have the option to "sell back" unused holiday to their employer.

Sadly, after that the CMI's annual holiday habits survey then slips into the increasingly "correct" world of carbon emissions, going on to point out that when managers in Scotland do take time off, concern over climate change fails to dampen the holiday mood. The majority, it claims, ignore calls to reduce their "carbon footprint", with only 8 per cent planning to offset the gas created heading for favourite spots like the Greek Islands and Canada.
FACT OF THE DAY 200,000

THE number of hectares of grape vine that Europe's top wine-producing countries could be forced to dig up, almost 6 per cent of the 3.4 million total currently planted, under a scheme mooted by the  European Commission to dry up huge wine stockpiles and help bolster its position to compete against the New World.
Wine producers look like getting compensation of some 420 million. KILLER QUOTE
It's evidence that we do talk to shareholders and consult with investors and take on board their concerns."
Marks & Spencer's reaction to news that chief executive Stuart Rose will have to meet tougher targets
to earn this year's potential GBP 4.2m share bonus after it succumbed to dissent from the Association of
British Insurers whose members control 20 per cent of the equity.
GOOD DAY Morgan Crucible

Engineer Morgan Crucible said first- half revenue grew by around 8 per cent on a constant currency basis, but the weak dollar would hit earnings by about GBP 20 million and underlying operating profit by GBP 4m. Its shares survived the scare, rising 1.6 per cent.
BAD DAY  Telefonica

The European Commission has fined the Spanish telecom firm 151.9 million (GBP 102.5m) for stifling competition in the broadband internet market. It said the company's wholesale prices for other internet providers were too high compared to its own retail tariff.

The European Commission has fined Spanish incumbent  Telefonica  151 million Euro (U.S. $205 million) for imposing a “margin squeeze” on wholesale purchasers of its DSL (digital subscriber line) service.

Telefonica,  the commission found, charged wholesale prices from September 2001 to December 2006 for DSL service such that the margin between its retail prices and the wholesale prices were “insufficient to cover the costs that an operator as efficient as  Telefonica  would have to incur to provide retail broadband access.” Spanish regulators imposed new rates on the carrier in December 2006 after the commission’s opening of formal proceedings in February of that year.

TD
The commission said that the high wholesale costs weakened retail  competition in the broadband market, noting that Spanish consumers pay 20% more than consumers in the other largest European countries for broadband access. Spain’s broadband penetration rate is 20% below the “EU-15" average, and growth in broadband service is nearly 30% below that of the EU-15.

“The margin squeeze that  Telefonica  imposed on its competitors not only raised their costs but also harmed consumers significantly,” said Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner-competition. “When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers. I will not allow dominant companies to set prices that undermine telecoms liberalization.” - Brian Hammond, brian.hammond@wolterskluwer.com

BRUSSELS - The Associated Press

EU regulators  fined Spain's  Telefonica  SA 151.9 million euros ($206.5 million) on Wednesday, claiming the company unfairly squeezed rivals by setting wholesale Internet prices too high to allow them turn a profit.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high fine - second only in EU monopoly  abuse penalties to the landmark 497 million euros ($613 million) fine on Microsoft Corp. - reflected the fact that Telefonica  knew it was breaking EU  antitrust rules.

"Telefonica's  price structures raised its competitors' costs, restricted  competition on the retail market, and made consumers pay the price," she told reporters, saying the decision was a warning to others in newly opened sectors - such as energy.

The company said it would appeal the EU decision it called "unjustified and disproportionate," and said it contradicted ongoing supervision from the Spanish telecom regulator. It said this created legal uncertainty about which regulator was in charge, which would inevitably affect its ability to launch new products and services.

"Telefonica  has legitimate reasons to believe it has strictly adhered to the regulations governing fair competition and has acted in good faith," it said. Controlling the network: Spain's former national monopoly controls the fixed line telephone network used for 80 percent of all ADSL broadband Internet connections. Rivals need to buy wholesale access from  Telefonica  to offer competing retail services.

The European Commission said these wholesale prices on regional and national networks were set so high from 2001 to 2006 that they held back the rollout of broadband Internet in Spain. As a result, the EU said consumers there use the Internet less and pay a fifth more than other western Europeans.

"When consumers and businesses are harmed in such a major market, the entire economy suffers," Kroes said. "Consumers have been put off from exploring the new services that broadband Internet allows."

The fine is far higher than other  antitrust fines on telecom companies in similar cases, such as a 12.6 million euros ($17 million) penalty on Deutsche Telekom AG or a 10 million euros ($13 million)  fine against France Telecom AG's internet arm  Wanadoo.

In Spain, the communication users' association (AUC), internet users' association (AI) and the association for civil, economic and social rights (Adeces) yesterday protested against the fine imposed by the European Commission on leading Spanish telecoms operator  Telefonica  for abuse of dominant position in the broadband market.

The various associations claimed that the  fine did not take into account the pricing criteria imposed on the operator by the Spanish telecommunications regulator, the CMT, nor the fact that the regulator was responsible for overseeing its accounts. However, they did agree with the view of the Commission and the CMT that the broadband prices were higher in Spain than elsewhere in Europe, but stated that the narrowing of margins was not responsible for this. Instead, they blamed 'a policy that emphasised resale and, until very recently, produced margins of more than 40 per cent.'

HD       Contradictory fine

THE EUROPEAN Commission (EC) has imposed on Telefónica  (the leading Spanish telecommunications company, formerly a state monopoly, now privatized, but still in a dominant market position) a fine of - 152 million - the second largest in the history of European Union sanctions after that of almost - 500 million imposed on Microsoft - for serious  abuse of its dominant position in the Spanish broadband market. According to the European commissioner for  competition, Neelie Kroes, between
2002 and 2004 the Spanish operator (which has the only countrywide network for broadband ADSL Internet access) maintained a policy of excessively high wholesale prices, creating a margin squeeze effect that impeded the entry of competitors into the Spanish ADSL market. This  abuse "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy."

TD
If the conflict is a serious one, and goes beyond the limits of an ordinary sanction to a company, it is because the abusive wholesale prices now being punished by the EC were set by Spain's national Telecommunications Market Commission (CMT) - so that the correct procedure would have been to sanction the CMT. This fact has been recognized by the Spanish regulatory body, which has come to the defense of  Telefónica.

The trickiest aspect of this fine is the legal insecurity it introduces into the communications market. In juridical and regulatory terms, Telefónica  has been applying prices approved by the CMT, which then bring a disproportionate  fine, so heavy it is hard to explain even in terms of the "exemplary" character claimed by Brussels. A company that operates in a regulated market cannot be subject to the contradictory directives of two regulatory bodies, which, it seems, do not even communicate with one another.

The EC has thus created a politically impossible situation, in which a national company will not be sure of complying with European law when it applies the prices imposed by its national regulator. Kroes must understand that, though in the back rooms of the EC many are calling, reasonably enough, for a single European telecommunications regulator, it is a mistake to seek confrontation with national regulators.
This course will lead the European market to chaos, and quickly, too.

At first sight it would seem that this impasse can only be resolved by political negotiation, and indeed the Ministry of Industry already ought to be working in this direction. But the disorder generated by Brussels - which may get a little worse yet, if the Luxembourg Court rejects the  fine imposed by the EC on
Deutsche Telekom for misconduct even more serious than that imputed to  Telefónica  - ought to be kept separate from the all-too-true imputations often made about the high cost and low quality of ADSL service in Spain. Indeed this service is expensive; it has a very low index of penetration, probably due to lack of competition, and it is not as fast as the service given in the rest of Europe. Perhaps  Telefónica does not deserve a fine of - 152 million for applying the norms of the national regulatory body; but it should, at least, be required to make more investments to improve the quality of its service.

Government to take up issue with Commission if penalty unfair

The government said Friday it would consider taking up the huge  fine imposed by the European         Commission earlier this week on  Telefónica  with Brussels if it believed the Spanish telecoms giant was unfairly treated.

TD
"It's too early too make judgments because we haven't received the official notice yet from Brussels," Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega said. "When we receive it we will study it of course in detail in order to gauge, above all, whether there may have been discrimination with respect to cases in other countries and act accordingly."

Brussels on Wednesday  fined Telefónica  €151.9 million for  abuse of its dominant position in the Spanish broadband high-speed internet access market. That was the largest ever  fine imposed on a telecoms company, and the second biggest after a penalty of just half a billion euros the Commission slapped on Microsoft.
For similar earlier offences, Brussels had  finedDeutsche Telekom €
12.6 million and France Telecom €10.4 million.

Announcing the punishment, the European commissioner for  competition, Neelie Kroes, said the fines imposed on France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had been insufficient to dissuade other operators from anti-trust practices. "I hope that today's [Wednesday]  fine has a bigger impact," she said.

The Commission accused  Telefónica  of overcharging rivals for the use of its broadband network thereby making it difficult for them to compete whilst still making a profit. The practice is known as a margin squeeze. The case was prompted by a complaint from French Telecom unit  Wanadoo.
The Spanish Telecommunications Market (CMT) Commission launched its own probe into the
complaint but absolved  Telefónica  of wrongdoing.  Telefónica  said it had fully complied with the pricing
rules established by the CMT and would be appealing the Commission's ruling with the European
Court of First Instance.

The former state monopoly described the  fine as "disproportionate" and complained it had been caught in the crossfire between two regulators, a situation which created legal insecurity (see EDITORIAL page 2).
The CMT also complained about the Commission treading on its patch.

Yesterday, EU sources expressed surprise at the lack of response from the Spanish government to a
multi-million-euro fine imposed on Spanish telecommunications group Telefonica by the European        
Commission earlier in the week.  Telefonica  was fined 152m euros for abusing its dominant position in
the Spanish broadband internet market.

Rather than come out in defence of the Spanish operator, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, Spain's first deputy prime minister, merely indicated yesterday that her government will study the  fine imposed, in particular 'to assess whether  Telefonica  has been the target of discriminatory treatment in respect of
other countries and take the appropriate action'. Previously, the Commission had  fined French ISP Wanadoo and Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications group, 10m and 12m euros respectively for breaches of EU  competition law.

MADRID, July 8 (Reuters) - Spain may contest the size of a  fine imposed on telecoms firm  Telefonica by the European Union if it was shown to have received harsher treatment than companies elsewhere for similar practices, Spanish Industry Minister Joan Clos said on Sunday.

Telefonica  was fined 152 million euros ($206.7 million) by Brussels for squeezing out high-speed
Internet rivals.

TD
French company Wanadoo and Germany's Deutsche Telekom were  fined 10.35 million and 12.6 million euros, respectively, for similar practises, Clos told radio station Catalunya Informacio in an interview.

"We are analysing what is the justification of such a strong measure and we would take action in the event that we find different treatment between countries," Clos said, calling the  Telefonica fine a "spectacular amount".

The European Commission fined Telefonica  on grounds its wholesale prices to other Internet providers were too high in comparison to its own retail prices.

That created a margin squeeze that meant rivals made losses when they resold access to ordinary consumers, Brussels said.

The fine is the second-highest the European Union's top  antitrust regulator has levied in an "abuse of dominance" case, beaten by almost half a billion euros Microsoft had to pay in 2004. It is the highest fine for a telecoms company.

Joan Clos, Spanish minister of industry, has announced that the Spanish government will take action against the 151.8m-euro  fine imposed by the European Commission on telecoms operator  Telefonica  if it deems that the operator's treatment was 'discriminatory.' In an interview with the Catalan press, Mr Clos described the fine, which was imposed for  abuse of a dominant position, as 'astronomical' and
'unprecedented.' He said that the government was currently studying the matter in depth.

Mr Clos highlighted the fact that French and German operators had received similar sanctions in the past, but in each case the  fine had not exceeded 20m euros. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom were fined 10.5m and 12m euros, respectively, between 2003 and 2004.

Seated beneath a painting by Magritte, the Belgian surrealist artist, Cesar Alierta's conversation is anything but surreal.

The executive chairman of  Telefonica,  the world's fifth-largest telecoms company by market capitalisation, is absorbed in the gritty reality of his sprawling empire during an interview in his Madrid office with the Financial Times.

TD
Telefonica  has become an industry favourite for some investors, after delivering sector-leading growth trends.

In 2006, it reported revenue of 53bn ($72bn), which represents a 42 per cent increase, and net income of 6.2bn, up 40 per cent.
Such performance was fuelled by ambitious deal-making, but there was organic growth as well.

The question is whether this momentum can be maintained. The larger a company becomes, the harder it can be to outperform its peers.

Mr Alierta insists the outperform story will continue.  Telefonica  is promising to double its earnings per share by 2009, based on the 2005 level of 0.9.

But the executive chairman says the focus is on organic growth in  Telefonica's  core businesses in Europe and Latin America. The deal-making of the past five years may not be over, but it is expected to slow.

Reflecting on his acquisitions, Mr Alierta says: "We were looking for the right scale. Now we have the right scale in Latin America. We have the right scale in Europe?.?.?.?So we are concentrating on what we have."
That message is designed to reassure investors because industry analysts say the main risk for
Telefonica  is over-reach through more deal-making.

The potential scale of  Telefonica's  ambitions was underlined in April when it joined a consortium led by Italian financial institutions that is proposing to buy a controlling stake in Telecom Italia from Pirelli, the tyre-maker.

Telefonica  is planning an "industrial partnership" with Telecom Italia if the consortium's proposal is approved by regulators, which will enable both companies to realise cost savings by flexing their joint muscle when buying telecoms equipment such as phones.

But Mr Alierta admits  Telefonica's  decision to pay 2.3bn for a 10 per cent economic interest in Telecom Italia is also a defensive move. America Movil, the Latin American mobile phone group owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, had also been trying to buy the same stake from Pirelli.

That threatened a nightmare scenario for Mr Alierta in  Telefonica's  most important Latin American market. Mr Slim could combine Claro, America Movil's Brazilian mobile operator, with TIM Brazil, Telecom Italia's wireless subsidiary, to create the country's dominant player. Vivo,  Telefonica's  Brazilian mobile joint venture with Portugal Telecom, would lose its status as the leading wireless operator.

Page 121 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr Alierta plays down the prospect of  Telefonica  quickly seeking to buy out its partners in the consortium, highlighting how Italian politicians were keen for Telecom Italia to remain in domestic hands. But he does not rule out an eventual takeover.

Nevertheless, he has more immediate issues to deal with. The European Commission last week imposed a record fine on a telecoms company, telling Telefonica  to pay 152m for allegedly taking steps to freeze competitors out of the broadband market.

Speaking before the  fine was announced, Mr Alierta rejects the Commission's charges and says "we will win" an appeal.

Some of Telefonica's  European mobile businesses are feeling the pressure: notably those that are part of O2, the UK group bought for 26bn in 2005. O2 Germany and O2 UK saw operating income before depreciation and amortisation fall by 6 and 5 per cent respectively year on year in the first quarter of
2007 because of fierce  competition.

Mr Alierta expresses confidence in O2 UK, which is the largest operator in the country. It is set to be the exclusive UK network for Apple's iPhone, which he describes as a "good device" but not a "category killer".

Some analysts doubt the performance of  Telefonica's  fixed-line operations in Latin America, partly because of increasing  competition. Mr Alierta brushes aside their concerns, claiming  Telefonica  has an advantage over many rivals through its ability to offer mobile alongside fixed-line services.

He says he is "happy" with  Telefonica's  geographic reach. The company will increase its minority stake in China Netcom, the country's second-largest fixed-line phone company, from 5 to 10 per cent over the next 12 months, but Mr Alierta says he is not looking for acquisitions in Asia.

Telefonica's  net debt level is due to fall from 2.7 times operating income before depreciation and amortisation, to 2.5 times next year. Some analysts say it should come down further because of the foreign exchange and interest rate risk stemming from  Telefonica's  Latin American businesses.

Mr Alierta is only coy when asked about the secret of  Telefonica's  success and highlights early efforts to reduce labour costs and to innovate with internet television. But he acknowledges the company has benefited in Spain from more than a decade of strong economic growth second only to Ireland in the European Union.

Mr Alierta's predecessor bought many of the Latin American businesses that have become  Telefonica's engine, although the current executive chairman has also made significant acquisitions there.

He reveals he listens carefully to some competitors, including arch-rival Mr Slim, with whom he shares a passion for cigars.
"He is brilliant and that is the reason he is the wealthiest man in the world, yeah?"

The Spanish government is considering launching a legal appeal against the  European Commission's (EC) decision to  fine Telefónica  €151.9 million for abusing its dominant position in the broadband internet market, Industry Minister Joan Clos announced Monday.

Clos said that the government would not hesitate to join  Telefónica  in taking the case before the European Court of First Instance if there is evidence to suggest the EC had discriminated against Spain's former telecoms monopoly.

TD
"A fine like this has never been imposed before," Clos said in an interview with Catalunya Radio yesterday. "We are studying the ruling to try to find the justification for such drastic action."

Last Thursday, the  European Commission said it was imposing the record  fine on Telefónica  after finding the telecommunications group guilty of trying to stifle  competition in the Spanish broadband internet-access market. It said the company had charged excessively high wholesale rates for use of its broadband network, making it impossible for rivals to compete without incurring losses.

"Telefónica's  conduct harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy," the European Commissioner for  Competition Neelie Kroes said.

However, other companies have faced smaller  fines in the past. France Telecom's internet service provider Wanadoo, for example, was ordered to pay €10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom €12.6 million for similar cases in 2003.

Kroes argued that the larger sum demanded was because smaller  fines had failed to force companies to change their behavior.

Telefonica,  the Spanish telecommunications group, is preparing its response to a report by the European Commission in which it justifies the scale of the multi-million euro  fine imposed on the group. Telefonica was fined 152m euros for abuse of a dominant position in the broadband market, the largest fine
imposed on a telecoms group to date.
Of the total figure, the Commission stated that only 90m euros was linked directly to the offense itself;
22m euros reflected  Telefonica's  economic capacity, while the remainder of the  fine, 40m euros, was
designed to act as a deterrent to the group and the sector.  Telefonica  intends to challenge the data
relating to its market share and pricing system, which formed the basis of the Commission's calculations.

The European Commission (EC) launched an antitrust investigation into a proposed merger of two providers of GSM roaming data services, it said Wednesday. U.S. technology company Syniverse serves wireless telecommunications companies. The BSG Group's services include payment processing, data clearing, financial settlement and risk management for wired and wireless communications service providers. The businesses overlap only in the market for GSM roaming data clearing services, but the companies are among that market's leaders; in Europe, they compete directly, the EC said. A merger would reduce the number of players in Europe from three to two, it said. The Commission has 90 days to rule on whether the acquisition would harm the market.

"Competition by litigation" does not work, leaders from alternative telecommunications providers told European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes on Wednesday. Abusive behavior that recently led to Spanish incumbent Telefonica  being fined 152 million euros could recur across Europe if the
Commission does not ensure that high-speed and fiber networks are open to  competition from the start, European Competitive Telecommunications Association members said in a meeting with Kroes. The association wants an end to the "cycle of repeated  abuse and foreclosure by dominant incumbents," with regulators setting clear rules for how incumbents upgrade networks. In the 1990s, Internet market growth was spurred largely by alternative providers, as incumbents lagged behind, the group said. Now, as the historical providers exploit their power over the local loop to deny rivals access, they are regaining a strong advantage in the broadband market, the association said. Kroes should guard against a reversal
of Europe's trend toward open telecommunications markets, it said.

The U.K. privacy czar Wednesday slammed corporate chiefs for failing to guard workers' and customers' personal data. Launching his annual report in London, Information Commissioner Richard Thomas branded as "frankly horrifying" breaches the past year involving mobile operator Orange, banks, government agencies, public bodies, retailers and others. How, he asked, can online recruitment agencies let applicants see one another's forms, or let workers take unencrypted laptops holding customer account details from offices? He warned business and public officials to take their data protection duties more seriously or face enforcement actions and lose customer confidence.

Spending on fixed business data services in Europe will plateau in 2008 then slow drastically, consultant Analysys said Wednesday. Competitive pressures on suppliers and Ethernet's debut as an access technology for metropolitan networks and wide area networks mean companies will keep getting more bandwidth for the same money when they upgrade, said report author Margaret Hopkins. To survive, service providers will need new ways to generate revenue or they will have to consolidate, she said. Small to mid-sized businesses remain a largely untapped market because existing services and distribution networks do not meet their needs, but this is changing, the study said. And for them to make the shift assurances are needed for data customers not yet convinced that next-generation networks are as secure and reliable as legacy data networks, Analysys said.

MADRID (Dow Jones)--Spain's telecommunication regulator has requested the government bring an annulment action before the European Court of Justice against the EUR151.9 million  fine imposed by the European Commission on dominant telecommunications company  Telefonica  SA (TEF).

Earlier this month, the  European Commission fined Telefonica  on the grounds that the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rival broadband Internet providers.

TD
The CMT, as the regulator is also known, said in a press release that the commission never formally asked for the cooperation of the Spanish regulator, contravening European provisions.
The CMT said the commission decision "seriously and deeply affects" its regulatory competence. "This type of intervention jeopardizes the fulfillment of its objectives of regulation in the benefit of
Spanish consumers and promotion of effective  competition in the sector through the development of
telecommunications infrastructures alternative to those of the incumbent," the CMT said.
The European Commission opened a formal investigation into  Telefonica's  business practices in
February 2006. Telefonica  has said it will appeal the  fine.

MADRID, July 12 (Reuters) - Spain's telecoms regulator, the CMT, is asking the government to appeal the 152 million euro ($209.5 million) fine imposed by the European Commission against Telefonica  , the regulator said on Thursday.

TD
The fine was imposed against the country's dominant operator because it was considered to be squeezing out high-speed internet rivals.

Telefonica  stock was up 1.5 percent at 1443 GMT, shortly after the CMT statement, outperforming
Spain's Ibex stock index <.IBEX> which was 0.68 percent higher.

The EU fine -- the highest ever awarded against a telephony company -- "seriously and profoundly" damaged the CMT's powers as a regulator and threatened the powers of all national regulators, the CMT said in a statement.

"Indirect wholesale access [to ADSL] is also a non-existent service in many Member States and the European Commission has never demanded its regulation considering that it does not determine the competitive development of markets", it said.

Spanish industry minister Joan Clos had already said the government was considering whether to appeal the fine which he called a "spectacular amount".
The fine is the second-highest the European Union's top  antitrust regulator has levied in an "abuse
of dominance" case, beaten by almost half a billion euros which Microsoft had to pay in 2004.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Friday said it is confident its decision to fineTelefonica SA (TEF) for abusing its dominant position in the Spanish broadband markets will hold up in the European Court of First Instance if the Spanish telecommunication regulator decides to appeal the decision.

"The commission considers that its decision is legally sound. We have absolutely no reason to be afraid of a referral to the court of first instance," said commissions  antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

TD
The commission's decision to  fine Telefonica  was very clearly referring to illegal action taken by Telefonica  which was harming Spanish consumers and businesses, Todd said. It wasn't aimed at the Spanish regulator, CMT, in any way, he added. The commission found in its ruling that the CMT had done its job properly.
CMT has requested the Spanish government to bring an annulment action before the court against the
EUR151.9 million  fine imposed on Telefonica.

The Spanish regulator accuses the commission of never formally having asked for the cooperation of the Spanish regulator, thus contravening European provisions.
The CMT said the commission decision "seriously and deeply affects" its regulatory competence. The European Commission opened a formal investigation into  Telefonica's  business practices in
February 2006. Telefonica  has said it will appeal the  fine.

Spanish telecoms regulator CMT is planning to request that the government appeals against the
152-million-euro (US$207 million) fine imposed on incumbent Telefónica by the European                    
Commission. Telefónica  was fined for allegedly squeezing out its broadband internet rivals by charging
high wholesale broadband rates.Significance: The fine was imposed earlier in July after the European  
Commission decided that  Telefónica  was abusing its dominant market position by fixing its broadband
wholesale prices too high, thus not leaving enough margin for competitors to make a profit.
This—according to the Commission's charges—has undermined  competition in the market (see Spain:
5 July 2007: ).

The Spanish telecommunications supervisor on Thursday said that it had urged the government to appeal against a €152-million  fine imposed on Telefónica  by the European Commission for violating anti-trust rules.

The Telecommunications Market Commission (CMT) also lashed out at Brussels for invading its patch. The CMT had launched its own probe into allegations lodged by a competitor that Telefónica  had been overcharging rivals for access to its broadband ADSL internet network in order to stifle competition,
but absolved the Spanish telecoms giant of any wrongdoing.

TD
"The decision by the Commission seriously and profoundly affects the regulatory duties [of the CMT] in particular, and those of national regulatory agencies in general," the Spanish watchdog said in a statement. "This action compromises the achievement of [CMT's] objectives of regulating in defense of Spanish consumers," it added.

Telefónica  rejected Brussels' decision at the time as "unjustified and disproportionate," arguing that it had complied fully with CMT directives on pricing.

Following the European Commission's decision to impose a 152m-euro  fine on Spanish telecoms group Telefonica  for abuse of dominant position in the broadband internet market, the CMT, the Spanish telecommunications regulator, has asked the Spanish government to file an appeal against the  fine with the Luxemburg-based European Court of Justice. The CMT considers that the matter is the exclusive competence of the Spanish regulator and therefore outside the jurisdiction of Brussels.

TD
Appeals filed with the European Court of Justice against decisions made by Brussels can only be made by the company affected and the government of the member state in question. The Spanish government has so far only said that it will lodge an appeal if there is evidence of discrimination against  Telefonica  when compared with similar cases in other member states.  Telefonica  is being blamed for the fact that broadband access in Spain is 20 per cent more expensive and it reaches 20 per cent fewer people than
the European average. The Spanish government is looking carefully into the matter, as it does not want to defend Telefonica  at the expense of the users.

The Commission stated that the sanction was designed to condemn  Telefonica's  'illegal actions, which has had an adverse effect on Spanish consumers' over the past five years.

The European Commission said Friday it was sticking by its decision to  fine Telefónica

€152 million for anti-trust activities despite a dispute with the Spanish telecommunications regulator over the move.

TD
The Telecommunications Market Commission (CMT) on Thursday urged the government to challenge the fine, which was imposed on Telefónica  for overcharging rivals for access to its broadband ADSL internet network in order to stifle competition. The penalty was the largest every imposed on a telecoms company by Brussels.
The CMT had launched its own probe into allegations of a so-called margin squeeze by  Telefónica
lodged by a competitor, but absolved the Spanish telecoms giant of any wrongdoing.

Speaking at a news conference yesterday in Brussels, Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the Commission's competition department, said the European anti-trust authorities were convinced of the legal soundness of the decision to  fine Telefónica.

At the time the  fine was announced, Telefónica  said it would appeal against the Commission's "unjustified and disproportionate" ruling with the European Court of First Instance. The telecoms giant said it had fully complied with CMT directives on pricing and was caught between two regulators with conflicting opinions. Todd said the Commission had no problem with  Telefónica  appealing.

The CMT on Thursday also complained about interference by Brussels in its area of responsibility. It said the decision by the Commission "seriously and profoundly" affected the regulatory duties

of the CMT in particular and those of national regulators. It said it also undermined the CMT's duty of ensuring Spanish consumer were protected.

Prague - The Czech vending sector has been experiencing a recovery in the past three years after a previous stagnation, Karel Cvejn, director of Czech Vending Association (CVA) that promotes and supports the industry, said in an interview for Czech Business Weekly.

Vending machines account for three-to-four percent of aggregate retail sales in the country, and their number has increased to an estimated 20,000 from 6,000-7,000 in the middle of the 1990s, said Cvejn.
EC calls for more detailed euro adoption steps in Slovakia

Slovakia wants to introduce the euro on January 1, 2009.

UVO suits prosecutor, but insists on punishment for builders

Bratislava - Six Slovak building firms that the Office for Public Procurement UVO eliminated in 2006 from public tenders for five years owing to a cartel agreement, will probably still not be able to gain government orders, according to a statement UVO spokeswoman Helena Fialova provided to CTK today.

The UVO claims that it complied with the general prosecutor's challenge of the body's controversial decision. However, it issued at the same time a new verdict that may prevent the companies concerned from being granted orders.
Slovak telcos said to delay number portability for  Telefonica
Bratislava -  Telefonica  O2, the youngest mobile operator in Slovakia, criticises rivals Orange and

Telecoms commissioner Viviane Reding courts the wrath of rivals by choosing Finnish company's
DVB-H as the common standard. By David Gow in Brussels

The European commission today courted the wrath of broadcasters and mobile phone operators by endorsing Nokia's DVB-H technology as the common standard for handheld television against other contenders.

TD
Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner, stopped short of imposing Nokia's Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds but said she would include it in an official list of standards and look to mandating it in 2008. Operators and broadcasters would prefer Brussels to consider other technologies or allow each of the 27 EU states to adopt its own.

Ms Reding, who recently imposed binding "roaming" charges for overseas phone calls against a ferocious lobby by big mobile operators, insisted that a single standard technology would promote the uptake of mobile TV in time for next summer's Euro 2008 football tournament and the Beijing Olympics.

She wants a pan-European market and sees a strong risk of fragmentation through potentially 27 different sets of national rules, the uncoordinated use of spectrum and a lack of interoperability. She claims mobile TV could foster growth and jobs.

"Mobile broadcasting is a tremendous opportunity for Europe to maintain and expand its leadership in mobile technology and audiovisual services," she said. "Europe today is at a crossroads. We can either take the lead globally - as we did for mobile telephony based on the GSM standard developed by the European industry - or allow other regions to take the lion's share of the promising mobile TV market.

"Wait-and-see is not an option. The time has come for Europe's industry and governments to switch on to mobile TV."

Ms Reding argues that unless Europe takes concrete action immediately, it risks losing its competitive edge.

Penetration in Italy, the EU's most advanced market, is less than 1% compared with close to 10% in south Korea, Asia's most developed market. She estimates the market could be worth &#8364;20bn (£13.4bn) by 2011, reaching some 500 million customers globally.

The commission also urged governments to make radio spectrum - released by the switch from analogue to digital TV broadcasting - available for mobile TV as quickly as possible, including in the UHF band - and the so-called L-band as a backup. It called for "light touch" regulation of the nascent market.

The European Broadcasting Union said that the pace of technological development precluded the adoption of any one standard at this stage. It said it should be up to business to define attractive models that would entice consumers to opt for the standard they like best.

"Technology alone will not decide the future of mobile TV," said Fritz Pleitgen, EBU president and director-general of German public broadcaster WDR. "New devices will not be attractive unless they can show what the audience wants to see."

The commission, meanwhile, threw an olive branch to mobile operators by dropping anti-trust proceedings against three big European groups - Vodafone, O2 and T-Mobile - after a six-year inquiry into "excessive" roaming tariffs that could have led to multimillion euro  fines of up to 10% of their relevant turnover.

It said the issue had been resolved by the new mandatory roaming charges (eurotariffs) which came into effect on July 1 and slashed current rates by up to 70%. Officials said it would have been a waste of taxpayers' money to continue the cases. "Whether or not those companies were guilty of  abuse has not been resolved but rather than take further time to reach a conclusion ... we consider it is not a worthwhile use of taxpayers' money."

Telefónica  O2 Europe welcomed the decision, reiterating that the case against it was "completely without foundation". Analysts said dropping the case cast doubt over the EU's anti-trust enforcement as it was unclear whether Brussels had been able to establish a case or not and whether consumers had been improperly charged hundreds of millions of euros in the past.

HD         FT.com site : Brussels closes antitrust case on 'roaming'. BY         Sarah Laitner in Brussels

European Union  antitrust authorities closed on Wednesday long-running investigations into Vodafone and two other big mobile phone companies that allegedly charged excessive international call fees.

The decision to draw a line under the high-profile cases is unusual because EU competition regulators rarely stop such inquiries without either securing a settlement or imposing a fine.

TD
It comes amid heightened tensions between the  European Commission and mobile phone companies, many of which are enraged by a new EU law that forces them to cap lucrative international call tariffs.

The European Commission had in 2004 and 2005 issued formal charges against Vodafone UK and Germany, O2 UK and T-Mobile Germany, accusing them of abusing their dominant market position by demanding "unfair and excessive" roaming fees.

In particular, the regulator was concerned about the level of wholesale rates that they charged in the UK and Germany. These are fees that one operator pays another so that its customers can use the other's network.

However, the regulator said on Wednesday that the new law addressed the same issues as those raised in the antitrust proceedings and that it would close the cases as a result.

That controversial legislation, which surveys show is popular with consumers, was secured last month after a bruising fight between Brussels and the EU telecoms industry. The sector is estimated to make as much as 8.5bn ($11.7bn, GBP5.7bn) a year from roaming charges.

However, critics say that the law does not touch on pot-en-tial  competition infringe-ments, prompting speculation that the passage of the law provided a useful cover to drop investigations that had dragged for years.

A spokesman for Neelie Kroes, the EU  competition commissioner, said that with the law on roaming entering into force there was no longer any point in devoting time and resources to the  antitrust investigation.

The roaming legislation dealt with excessive charges in a very satisfactory manner, the spokesman added.

If the operators had been found guilty, they could have been  fined as much of 10 per cent of annual turn-over. However, it is rare for Brussels to impose the maximum penalty.

Telefonica  O2 Europe welcomed the decision to drop the allegations that O2 UK had breached
competition law. The company said that the case against it was completely without foundation.

Telefonica,  the Spanish telecommunications group, has decided to pay a  fine of 151.87m euros it was ordered to pay by the  European Commission earlier this month. While it could have opted to present a bank guarantee for this amount, it has decided not to and will pay the  fine. However, the decision to pay does not alter  Telefonica's  absolute rejection of the  fine; it is currently preparing its appeal to have the penalty declared null and void before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The appeal must be submitted by September 20.

This fine, the largest ever imposed by the European Commission on a telco, was imposed on the Spanish operator after the regulator ruled that Telefonica  had hindered competition in the Spanish ADSL market. Even so, the  fine will have a limited impact on Telefonica's  bottom line: in the three months to March 31, it recorded a net profit of 1.257bn euros, up 7.7 per cent on a year earlier.

VINCENT BENOIT, IR, FRANCE TELECOM: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Vincent Benoit speaking, and welcome to France Telecom's first half 2007 results conference call. The call will be hosted by Gervais Pellissier, Chief Financial Officer, with some members of FT management, who are also with us
for the Q&A session. We will start by a 40-minute presentation followed by a Q&A session. As usual, for the
Q&A session, in order to ask for the floor you will have to dial star followed by hash.

The presentation contains forward-looking statements and information on France Telecom's objectives, in particular for 2007. More detailed information on the potential risks that could affect France Telecom's financial results can be found in the Document de Reference filed with the Autorite des Marches Financiers and in the Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

TD
Market share figures at June 30, 2007 included in the presentation are France Telecom estimates, pending the release of official figures for the period from national regulatory authorities.
Thank you, and let me hand over to Gervais Pellissier.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER, CFO, FRANCE TELECOM: Thank you, Vincent. Good morning to some of you, and good afternoon to the others, maybe good evening to a few in the audience. And thank you for attending this conference call, where I am going to present, briefly, the results I guess you already know. So, I would like to be short in the presentation, to leave more time to the questions.

Let me first try to summarize in a few words the main achievements, and I will start with slide number nine, where there are a few highlights. I think the first good news of this first half is that we have been able to achieve what we wanted to achieve. This is the stabilization of our profitability, our gross operating margin. And with on top of it a better revenue situation than what we had last year, especially in the second quarter, with a 2% revenue growth compared to the situation we had a year ago.

This puts us in a situation where we are clearly on track to reach our 2007 guidance regarding profitability, CapEx, etc. But on top of that, to confirm also that we are able to commit on a stable organic cash flow for the period 2006/2008, as it was flat last year, in 2006.

Last point is that when we look at the situation of our different businesses and what has been done in the course of this first half, we think that we have developed enough action. It's never enough and we continue to do it for some areas. But we have developed enough action to sustain the performance in 2007, and
also to lay already some foundations for 2008.

A clear roadmap of the product launch for the second half. We are continuing to reengineer our processes within the Group, in order to enhance the level of service and to reduce our cost structure. And we continue to be on track to deeply transform the Group, aligned with the strong and deep business transformation we had or technology transformation we had.

You remember we were speaking, two years ago, of the move towards IP within the enterprise business. The IP move is now completely in the consumer business of the fixed line, and we start also shortly on the mobile with the first conversion product we have been announcing and launching, with some success likely.

Through what's some of the main figures of this first half on the next page, the performance in revenue, with 1.9% revenue growth, so EUR25.9b. And this comes from the strong performance both in domestic fixed and mobile operations, so France has been part of this achievement. Some recovery in other

European markets. A much better performance for enterprise than a year ago. And we have the sustained performance of the five growing markets, which continue to contribute strongly to growth.

Regarding gross operating margin, its stabilization comes from -- mainly from, again, [urban personnel] in France, where there is a recovery in the profitability, and the continuous contribution of fast-growing markets, where gross operating margin continued to increase in line with the increase in the revenue.

Regarding the level of spending in CapEx, it is slightly below 2006 at the end of H1. However, on the basis of the programs which are underway, in terms of large investments within the Group, we confirm the
full-year objective of 13% to revenue.

Down at the cash flow level, we have an organic cash flow which is slightly increased over first half 2006, and confirming -- making us able to confirm the full-year objective of EUR6.8b.

Regarding the situation of the debt, it's true that the organic cash flow, when it first started, is mainly dedicated to the payment of the 2006 dividend, which explains that the level of debt remains fairly stable compared to the beginning of the year. You know that in terms of timing it is the second half where the cash flow is used for the debt reimbursement.

To comment on some key operational achievements in terms of number of clients, on the next page, the total customer base is 163m customers, out of which 102.5m mobile customers, which is an increase of
15%. And what is also meaningful is that within the mobile customer base now 9m mobile customers are broadband mobile customers, which is a multiplication by three for the course of the last 12 months.

As regards the fixed broadband business, DSL, we have now 10.5m subscribers. We remain the leader on the European market. And probably our base is probably one of the more, I would say, dynamic and technically benefited in terms of triple play, with 50% of the customer base equipped with Livebox, 35% of our customers using Voice over IP, and 8% using IPTV. We see that, mainly in France, we are now at 12% of the customer base, of the DSL customer base, using TV over IP.

As regards to the enterprise business, on top of the global revenue performance, there is a continuous development of the convergence of services, especially Business Everywhere in France with 525,000 customers, plus 20% compared to a year ago. The IP/VPN accesses with 273,000, also 20% on top of last year. And also the strong performance in services revenues, which is increasing by 16%.

To -- before I'm turning to some of the financial figures, again, a few reminders regarding the strategy of the Company. Remember that we said one year and half ago -- excuse me, two years ago, in June 2005, when we launched the NExT strategy that a huge part of the future growth would come on value-added services on top of the access, and from convergence services.

When you look at that slide, you see that the part which is coming from value-added services, including Internet access plus content plus all the value-added services being priced on top of the access, is now representing 22% of the revenue in the major countries, whereas it was representing only 18% of the revenues in the major markets, mainly Western Europe markets, two years ago.

At the same time, traditional PSTN and voice access, which was representing 38% of the revenue in 2005, is now representing 29%. So there is a drop by about 10 points of the contribution of our legacy voice and access business to the revenue, whereas mobile has increased and are stable a little below 50% of the total.

This is now due -- explain two things. First of all, the fact that we were right to push for this technology move and technology evolution of our customer base, because this is one way to compete successfully in the future, and to maintain our market share in the new businesses. The second point is that this is also the explanation of the strong peer pressure we have had on the margin, and the need to adjust our skills, our tools, but also our cost structure, with those new technologies.

Same move but at a lower pay is also a first in the fast-growing markets, with also an increase of the data and new services, whereas mobile remains the main trigger for revenue and for growth in those markets.

Regarding these fast-growing markets, I am on slide 19, the situation is also a strong evolution in the global revenue picture of France Telecom. They are now accounting for 13% of our global revenues, whereas
they were representing 10% two years ago. So if you -- this is slide 10. I have mistaken the numbers regarding the slides.

So now slide 11. In terms of evolution of the profitability, you see on this chart the situation. And they're coming back to the stabilization at the level we had a year ago, which is also a performance we were expecting, but we had to work to achieve it. And when you look at the GOM before commercial expense, you see that it has even slightly improved more, especially in Q2, than the GOM after commercial expense.

Page 153 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This has allowed us to spend additional SACs, SRCs, especially in the mobile field, on some markets to reinforce our competitive position.

On slide 12, the result or, let's say, the causes of the -- of this good margin evolution is mainly coming from the improvement of the cost structure on top of the revenue dynamics. Labor costs, they have been decreasing by 0.4 points of revenue in one year. Interconnection costs have been much better managed in
2007. We had started to improve the situation at the end of 2006. If you remember, we had a deterioration of our interconnect expense in percentage point of revenue in 2005 and the first part of 2006.

And we have, as it were, a very positive growth of the mobile and the fixed business to improve the cost structure of our business, especially with the massive introduction of unlimited and abundance offers on our base, and to come down now to 15% to revenue. Other IT, networks non-labor has remained flat, whereas the commercial expenses are slightly increased.

Regarding the general, properties and others, the increase you observe is mainly linked with some accruals, moves and reversals of accruals, on some risks, especially a reversal of Lebanon in 2006 and some further accruals in 2007.

Regarding the headcount situation, we are -- we have been able to reduce the headcount by a little less than 8,000 people in one year, since June 2006, out of which 1,571 net departures have been realized in the first half of the year in France, implying that 60% of our three-year plan is now achieved at the end of June 2007.

We are confident that we will achieve the three-year plan, which accounts for 17,000 net departures between 2006/2008. But we knew that we had to do a very strong effort in the first half, because we are using other management tools and we have no longer the retirement program, so we are using other tools. And you have to find other dynamics. Especially there is some increase of the transfers to the public administration, what we call a personal accompanied project. And to help people in terms of a replacement.
Regarding the interconnect, IT and network costs we have, when we measure them as a whole including
the labor costs, we have improved them by EUR140m compared to a year ago, which means a decrease of
more than 2% compared to last year. This is linked with a better management of the gap between what we
pay to other operators and so to take the full benefit of the termination rate cuts when they are there, but at
the same time not to pay more in other situations and to be able to increase the revenue or not to decrease
the revenue.

We have some slight increase of the non-labor IT and network costs, a very small increase, which is linked with the deployment of a customer service platform and the ongoing rollout of networks, partially offset by the outsourcing of some of our [IT], especially in Belgium and Netherlands.
We found also an further savings potential with the network sharing agreement that we start working in
Spain in the second half of the year, and in 2008.

Regarding the operating income and the net income, we have increased the operating income by EUR324m at EUR5.5b, thanks to -- half of the improvement is linked with the GOM improvement, whereas there is an increase of the capital gains on assets disposals with the sale of our remaining stake in TDF and Eutelsat. But also partially offset by some increase of the depreciation on our fixed assets, also an increase in mobile investments in Spain, and in the fast-growing countries. We are also taking as a hit in the first half the cost -- or part of the cost of the employee free share program that has been implemented
in the spring.

The net income, at Group level, increased by -- at EUR3.3b, benefiting from a strong reduction in the tax P&L linked with the increase of deferred tax assets in France by a little less than EUR600m, and the decrease of the U.K. tax rate from 30% to 28%, which brings an additional EUR80m proceeds in the P&L. There is a reduction of the net income part of the minority shareholders linked with the sale of Yellow Pages, which is no longer in our account.

To try to measure the net income performance on comparable terms, if we [allow for] the exceptional items, we have increased our net income by EUR180m compared to last year, to come to EUR2.4b.
As regards the cash flow, I think I have not much to comment. The increase of the cash flow is mainly
linked with the increase of the gross operating margin, to be at EUR3.3b compared to EUR3.1b a year ago.
Again, this improvement makes us comfortable to achieve the total year objective.

As regards the evolution of the debt, I said at the beginning that -- we are on page 17. As regards the evolution of the debt, there is no change regarding the debt, because most of the [promising] more, the totality of the cash flow has been dedicated to the dividend payment. There are a few other movements between here - proceeds of sales of assets and some small acquisitions.
Page 154 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In terms of performance for the different regions, if we start on page 18 with -- on page 19, sorry, with France, we have a good performance on the personal division on the mobile business. These are stable revenues, slightly above what it was a year ago. And a small recovery in the second quarter compared to the situation at the end of the first quarter, where slightly declining. It has been done also with an increase of our profitability. We are now at 40.2% gross operating margin rate to revenue, compared to 39.5% a year ago.

Regarding the situation of the market itself, on page 20, we have been able to stabilize our market share in retail and to come back to a very good level of market share, including the MVNOs, at the end of the first half of 2007. At the same time, there has been a continuous strategic shift towards more pay monthly customers, which now represent more than 64% of the customer base, and also a very strong dynamic in terms of broadband mobile, with a multiplication by about three at the customer base, which is now a little more than 20% of the total customer base.

Regarding the situation of the home business, Internet plus fixed, this is on page 21. We have [indicated], if you remember, the first half, where it happened for the totality of the first half. We have now been able to fully offset the decline of traditional PSTN by the increase in Internet and multiplay revenues, which
appears on this slide. And this is good news. Whereas, at the same time, the gross operating margin has been increased from 32.4% to 35.4% in one year.

This comes from the good market performance, on page 22, with still a couple of different factors. The first one is the fact that there is still an increase of the total number of lines, of telecom lines, on the French market. There is now more -- there are now 27.84m lines, which is about 100,000 more than at the end of
2006. This creates -- whatever the situation of the line, retail or wholesale, it creates revenue for France
Telecom.

The second point is the fact that on the DSL market we have been able to keep our market share at 49.2% in installed base, thanks to good dynamics in acquisitions, because our market share of net adds has come back to the level of 47.8% in the second quarter of 2007.

Regarding the broadband ARPU, this is standing at a little more than EUR30 at the end of Q2, which is an increase of 11% compared to a year ago. And this is mainly thanks to the deployment of more multiplay offers on our customer base.

There is also another very interesting figure, which is new compared to a year ago. This is the strong development of VOD accesses, with 900,000 VOD accesses, paid VOD accesses, in the first half 2007, which is a multiplication by five compared to a year ago and a multiplication by two compared to the second half 2006.
We have also launched a new offer, especially regarding Voice over IP, to continue the deployment of
Voice over IP, which is now installed on 46% of our customer base in France compared to 28% a year ago.

Two specific points regarding the market in France. One is the focus on Unik, on page 23. In Unik there has been a strong increase compared to the situation at the end of 2006, with now 300,000 Unik terminals sold on our customer base. But also we've increased now the full range of models for the second half, which makes the product not only for specific customers or specific situations, but allows to increase the potential on the market.

On top of that, we have also opened Unik on the 30,000 Orange Wi-Fi hot spots in France, plus the possibility to connect also Unik phones on the Livebox of other DSL -- Orange DSL users, which makes the Unik phone a real Voice over IP and mobile phone, depending on the location where you are on the French territory.
Regarding fiber, the fiber development is on track with the plan we announced at the end of last year.
We've now a little more than 2,000 customers who have signed a fiber contract, which is two times what we
had at the end of last year. And 27,000 customers, potential customers, with 27,000 flats where fiber is
now available because agreements have been made with the building managers of those 27,000 flats.

Regarding CapEx, we have spent EUR10m until the end of June. And we confirm that we are either in the course of installing or about to install fiber in 10 cities outside of Paris.

Regarding priorities and action plan for France, I'll just leave you with the slide on page 25. But maybe to mention that clearly the focus on mobile is to maintain the market share in a situation where there is additional pressure with the number portability, which will take full effect in the second half of 2007. And also taking into account the roaming regulations, which is impacting revenues and gross operating margin in this year.


Page 155 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Regarding the home division, we have clearly to continue to push for better customer satisfaction. We are clearly ahead of our competitors, but we need to be even better. And we have to target more and more [aggressively] our customer base to really adapt the offer to the needs of our customer, especially between Naked DSL, traditional PSTN subscription, especially to focus on the dense areas where Naked DSL is a very strong tool to recover market share.

Regarding the situation in the U.K., we have good revenue growth, with 3.1% growth in the first half of the mobile business. This is linked with the increase -- improved quality of our subscriber base. I remind you that in the very competitive situation of the U.K. market we have decided to focus on the high-value customers, especially to remain the leader within the customer segment where our customers pay more than GBP35 per month.

We have also an increased - and this is interesting - an increased proportion of data and value-added tariff revenue on the customer base linked with the development of 3G. And we have some decrease in the equipment revenue linked with additional -- the fact that we have less prepaid customers. And we are giving more attention to loyalty and to subsidizing a little more the renewals of contracts.
Regarding the situation in terms of operations on the mobile in the U.K., you see that there has been a
good recovery in the second quarter of 2007, with strong net adds in terms of contract base, this helping us
to be with a strong increase of the customer base in terms of pay monthly customers, a 10% increase at
the end of first half compared to end of first half 2006.

There is also a good level of ARPU, where the ARPU remains especially at the highest level on the market for the contract customers at GBP562, whereas we have really put in the action plan we have to put more fuel to capture customers again in the prepaid area.
And a very important change on the U.K. market, and you remember it was one of our areas of concern
last year and it remains a strong area of concern, is pressure on distribution. This is on page 28. And there
is a shift towards direct -- more direct distribution. Now, direct distribution, as you know, represented 41%
of the net adds on the first half compared to 30% a year ago, hence we see the way to better marketing of
the customer base and to be able to create more value on the customer base.

Regarding the situation of the broadband market in DSL, the situation remains highly challenging, with the revenue down by 4%. This is mainly linked with the decline of narrowband, whereas it remains difficult to continue to deploy the unbundling and to acquire customers in DSL in the U.K. We have grown. In spite of the difficulty -- of those difficulties we have grown our DSL customer base by 9% in one year.

And we try to keep the stable ARPU in a very competitive environment, where most of the new entrants are presenting DSL access or Internet connections as a kind of add-on on something, either the Pay TV subscription, or the voice subscription or anything else. We continue to focus on quality of service.

We have also to mention that on the U.K. market, as I said, in spite of a legal -- a regulatory environment which appears fair on the paper, the real situation in terms of unbundling remains not so easy.

Regarding the action plan, we have to increase and to recover in prepaid market, but also keeping our high-value strategy on the prepaid market, not deteriorating the value. We have also to pursue the development of loyalty within our customer base, and to continue to work very strongly on the cost structure, including the infrastructure network costs with the implementation of our network sharing agreement with Vodafone to prepare these cost optimizations for 2008.

Regarding fixed and Internet, especially Internet, we need - and this is one of our weaknesses in the past - we need to raise our brand awareness in terms of Internet access. Orange is a strong mobile brand, has not been [listed] yet as a strong Internet brand. We have to work on that. We have also to take the opportunity of the launch of more attractive dual play and to start with some of the triple play, including TV offers, at the end of the year to compete against some market share.

In Spain the situation in mobile has been also better than we could have expected, especially with some increase in revenue and some recovery on the gross operating margin in second quarter compared to the situation of the first quarter. This is on page 31. We have had a few negative effects on the revenue, mainly linked with some unlimited offers which have created trouble at the margin and revenue level. But this is recovering in the second quarter.

Regarding the operations themselves, we have strong net adds in first quarter and even more in the second quarter. However, you remember, and we mentioned that at the end of first quarter, we have been obliged to take into account the loss of a huge part of the Euskaltel customers. And we have also decided to clean the prepaid customer base, where there were a lot of inactive customers.


Page 156 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This doesn't change the global picture, where we have now a stable customer base compared to a year ago and we have also a stable ARPU compared to a year ago.

Regarding the situation of the Internet and fixed business in Spain, we have very good growth in terms of customer base with 18% increase of the customer base. Strongly focused acquisitions, strongly focused on the unbundled areas. We are now at [60%] growth of the customer base in unbundled areas, whereas we are -- we have been declining the number of customers which are not in the unbundled areas. This has not been enough to offset in terms of revenue the strong decline of voice and narrowband, as we don't have enough revenue increase on the Internet to offset the decline in voice and narrowband. So it's strategic to continue in this customer acquisition dynamic, including to reinforce it with the integration with Ya.com. I remind you that Ya.com has been finally acquired on July 31.

If I come to the action plan in Spain, which is on slide 34, with a new management, you know that a new CEO has come on board at the end of June in Spain. We have clearly to keep the momentum in customer acquisitions in mobile, especially in contract. We have to continue and to finalize the coverage in terms of
3G, including doing it through our network sharing agreement with Vodafone. We have also to continue our fight to limit the churn, we have decreased the churn rate compared to a year ago, and also to really launch the MVNOs. Some MVNOs contracts have been signed in the course of last year. We see now there the potential to grow our customer base with MVNOs.

Regarding the home market, we need to continue to reinforce our DSL market share. Now, with Ya.com, we are clearly and from far the number one alternative to the incumbent, and we need to push for that in the course of second half.

On Poland I will be quite short because we have announced their results two days ago, so you saw them. Just to say that we are fighting in a very difficult environment with very good efforts in mobile. They have continued to increase their market share in mobile, and to maintain a very strong profitability with 38.5% gross operating margin rate.

Situation, I would say, a little more difficult on the fixed market, where the regulatory pressure has played a very strong role in the decrease of revenue and in the pressure on the margin. We -- in spite of that, we have continued to grow the customer base, especially for broadband, and we will continue to do that.

So the action plan for second half is on mobile to continue - it's on page 34 - is to continue to remain ahead in terms of market share, this is to continue to grow our market share, to pursue the stimulation of the 3G usage and especially customer growth.

Regarding broadband, we have put in place a new offer that should be operational in September, and that will help us to relaunch the dynamics on the market in spite of the strong regulatory constraints.

Regarding the other countries - it's on page 38 - you see that growth comes from either Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Caribbean, where most of those countries are growing above 20%, a little less in the Eastern Block, 17%. That means the continued growth of the customer base, more than 50% growth in Middle East, Africa, Caribbean, whereas our customer base growth remained at 17% in Eastern Europe. This helps to provide Group with additional profit. The total GOM rate for both countries, including the Western Europe countries, is at 41.8% compared to the 42% of a year ago.

Regarding the home market in the other countries, so this is on page 39, what has been a huge part of the customer base was represented by Orange Netherlands, which is on sale. But if you look at the broadband situation, we have now not far from 100,000 customers in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mauritius and Jordan, which is the beginning of the broadband Internet business in those countries. And we think that this will be
a strong area of development for the future, on top of the dynamics within mobile.

So the action plan is mainly - on page 40 - action plan is mainly to keep the growth momentum, and to start to develop alternative networks, including WiMAx or FTTH in some of the countries.

Regarding the enterprise division, the revenue, as I mentioned at the beginning, has been much better than a year ago with a strong improving trend, especially if you look at the situation in the second quarter, where revenue decline has been limited to 0.4% of revenue, where it was nearly 2% decline in the first quarter. And this is linked with a strong decline of some of our legacy business, especially the voice legacy revenue in France and the data legacy in France and outside of France.

We have, in terms of advanced business network, a continued increase of the IP revenue, even if it is at a slower pace than it was a year ago, which by the way helps the -- to maintain the legacy revenues, and in spite of strong pressure for international prices. ICT services have continued to grow at a higher rate than the market, 15.5%, and they now represent 24% of the revenues of the division.


Page 157 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Regarding the profitability of enterprise, there has been a decline of 2.5 points because it was last year when we restated it compared to -- to compare it to 2007. It was at 19.5%. This is below the figure that was published last year, because in fact we have reassessed our internal transfer price between enterprise and the home France division. So this explains this adjustment of margin. And so you cannot take the historical figure. You know that I'm not sure that all our competitors are so clear when they describe internal transactions within their different divisions.

In spite of that, at 17% to revenue we remain clearly above our major competitors, who are trying to act in terms of (inaudible), especially the British one and the German one.

Action plan for enterprise is to continue to secure the legacy business, to pursue the enhancement of our portfolio on Voice over IP, and to streamline -- to continue to streamline the cost base, because this is clearly the market where price pressure remains very strong, especially on the international part of the business. And we have to continue to work on that, while continuing to improve our margin in the ICT services.

To conclude, just a few words on our possible future, how we see the second half. And that's something that -- you know that we would not really want -- we don't want to give guidance on revenues. Some of you are approaching us with that. But it's not up to us to determine the revenue and the economy that is for the future. But when you have service, we think that the environment, within the countries where we are operating, is more favorable in terms of activity for the second half than it was one year ago. So we don't expect in the second half a big difference, which is what has happened in the first half in terms of revenue evolution.

In terms of profit, the situation is slightly different, because we know that there will be a little more regulatory pressure. I have mentioned the roaming, which will have an impact on the gross operating margin, particularly in Europe and France. We have the portability number effect in France, which could create some pressure on the profit, including the need to increase some of the subsidies to keep the customers.

We have clearly the difficulties of the regulatory environment that is in Poland, even with the decisions we know today we know that there are a lot of pressures on the margin. And we know that in some countries, like the U.K. or Spain, competitive environments will remain tough, either because the incumbent remains highly protected by the local regulatory authorities or because the nature of the market is that there are too many players likely to be replaced. So before consolidation happens, there is still huge  competition.

In spite of that, we confirm clearly our guidance for the second half in terms of margin, in terms of cash flow. And we will continue to work on our business portfolio, finalizing some of the decisions which have been made, like the sale of Orange Netherlands, and to continue to buy or to sell some of our businesses.

The last page, which is on page 46, is the confirmation of our guidance. So near stabilization of the gross operating margin, to maintain the CapEx rate at a level of 13%, and to maintain the organic cash flow at EUR6.8b in 2007 but also in 2008, including some investments where the decision is not made yet but I think that could impact very clearly the cash flow, like the acquisition of the 3G license in Egypt which was included in our figures.
Thank you. I am now available for your questions.

DAMIEN MALTARP, ANALYST, CAZENOVE: Thanks. It's Damien Maltarp here from Cazenove. I've got two questions. The first one, I was just wondering if you could comment on Iliad's application for the fourth
3G license. Do you see them as very much a credible competitor to your mobile business?

And secondly, any thoughts on their proposal to defer the payment of the license fee would be of interest. And do you think that is something you could potentially replicate as well?

And the second question is just going back to the changes to the mobile number portability. It's been a couple of months now since that was introduced into France. Can you just give us an indication of what your -- what you've seen so far, and therefore what are the implications for costs going forward? Thanks.

VINCENT BENOIT: Well, sorry, we didn't hear you very well. Can you summarize quickly your first and second questions, please?
DAMIEN MALTARP: Yes. Can you hear me now? VINCENT BENOIT: (Multiple speakers) top of your mike. DAMIEN MALTARP: Can you hear me now?


Page 158 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: A bit better, but if you can speak louder it would be nice.

DAMIEN MALTARP: Okay. I will try now. The first question was on Iliad's 3G license application, just your thoughts on whether you see them as a credible competitor to you on the mobile side, and also any thoughts on their proposal for the deferred payment of the license fee.

And also, just the second one was on mobile number portability. We are a couple of months in. Just what you are seeing, the initial view on what has changed since it was introduced.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I will hand over the question to Benoit. So, the first question is on the -- what do we think of the Iliad position in terms of 3G license. And the second question is on the effects, how do we see the effects of the number portability up to now.

BENOIT EYMARD, FRANCE SALES AND SERVICES, FRANCE TELECOM: So, regarding Iliad, as you have noticed it, as they are the only one who have been candidates, but the proposal they have made so far in their press release do not fit into the conditions that have been established by the French regulator. So it's up to now the reg authorities to make their comments on the Iliad proposal. And if they consider that it does not fit into the conditions that were set, they will have to consider that the bid for the license will
have to be reopened, which would open a new period of four to six months of new process for the fourth license in France.

I don't think it's in our position to make much more comment on Iliad's credibility, to take your question regarding the deployment of a fourth network in France. We just all know that it will take a lot of time and that, as you know, the French market is a difficult one for minor operators since France is the biggest country in Europe with more than 500,000 square kilometers. It is, therefore, the most expensive to cover, as we all know. Just to give a comparison, between our French operations and English operation, the cost is almost 30% more to cover to provide an accurate 3G network. This is one comment.

The second comment to be made is that, as you know, there are growing environmental pressures for any new network to be deployed, and this is clearly one of the stakes behind the subject of the fourth 3G license in France.

Regarding number portability, we think that the need is to be very cautious since, as Gervais stated it, it's only two months now that the number portability new condition has been put into place. Just as a reminder, number portability has been in France already three years but it was under a two-stop shopping process, and we have now -- we are now operating under a one-stop shopping process.

So far, we must also acknowledge that the first few years are better than what we could expect in terms of equilibrium regarding the Orange base of the effects of number portability, especially for the business market and for the value customers with subscription more than two hours, in which we have gained more than we have been losing to our competitors for number portability.

So, therefore, up to now we consider that the news are quite good. But once again, we remain very cautious because we consider that the key changes we should see on the French market will occur during Q3 and Q4 on the French market.
DAMIEN MALTARP: Okay. Thanks a lot.

NICK LYLE, ANALYST, UBS: Hi. It's Nick Lyle from UBS. Could I ask three quick questions? Just the first one, could you explain the benefit from the lack of sale -- or rather the benefit from the lack of rebranding in the Q2 numbers, just to give us a rough idea of what's lack of rebranding and what's genuine savings?

And secondly, you were talking about pushing Naked DSL harder. Does that mean you are now thinking about maybe increasing share of broadband, and how would the regulator view that?

And the final one was just a very quick one. You've mentioned Ofcom in the U.K. again as an issue with BT Openreach. How do you propose to solve that? Thanks.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Maybe, Jacques, could you answer the question of the broadband market share, and the view of the regulator?

JACQUES CHAMPEAUX, REGULATION, FRANCE TELECOM: Well, I think today the French Regulator considers that the broadband market is working well in France, and that the (inaudible) offers are working very well. So I don't think he cares too much about the difference or the duration that could happen on the retail market, given that the condition of offering of the wholesale offers are continued to be
non-discriminated.



Page 159 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NICK LYLE: I am sorry. Specifically on your market share, though, is it possible it could rise above 49% or is the comment more that you would stabilize it with your aggression on Naked DSL?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES, SEVP, GROUP TRANSFORMATION & FRANCE, FRANCE TELECOM: So, this is Louis-Pierre Wenes speaking. So far we are planning to stabilize it, as we said, and we have no different plans for today, and this is exactly what we are currently achieving.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the rebranding, we announced, if I remember, savings in the range of EUR100m last year linked with the rebranding operation. We are achieving those savings in terms of savings regarding what we are spending on maintaining the two brands or the three brands separately before. But all in all, we are spending a little more in terms of advertising to maintain our share of voice compared to competition in some countries. So it's true that we have some savings, and we are probably better than what we would have done versus -- if we did not have rebranded. However, you will not find in the global figures of our spending in A&C a decrease compared to a year ago.
Regarding the U.K. market, maybe, Bernard, you can comment.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART, EVP, ORANGE U.K., FRANCE TELECOM: Bernard speaking. Yes, on the Ofcom, just a quick comment on the side of that U.S. could be to compare the situation in terms of unbundling between France and U.K., to understand that we are very late in the U.K. compared to France in this respect. And another comment is about the fact that we have been discussing the price squeeze case, and that we have a very, very slow result in that area.
NICK LYLE: Thanks very much.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Yes. Hi. It's Matthew Bloxham here from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. One, just on Spain, just wondering if you could remind us of the structure of your ownership agreements, and whether there is any put or call options about the ownership, and if you have any desire over the medium term to buy in the minorities in the Spanish business.
Secondly, just wondering if you've got any specific thoughts for the likely proceeds from Orange
Netherlands.

And thirdly, just again relating to the fourth license process in France. Obviously one of the issues that could arise if that license is awarded is that the 900 and 1,800 frequencies get reallocated, which I guess would mean that you would get slightly less of that spectrum. I am just wondering whether that would create any temporary operational issues for you in terms of the amount of capacity you need to run your mobile network.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: We did not catch your first question. We have -- we understood the question on
Netherlands and the fourth license, but what was your first question.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Sorry. The first question was just whether there are any puts or call options in place with the minority shareholders in Spain, if you can give us any summary of what those are, if there are any, and whether FT has any intention to move to 100% ownership of that asset over time.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: In Spain there is, if you remember, it was announced at the time of the acquisition, there is a liquidity mechanism where we guarantee a certain price to the minority shareholders, but there is no obligation to buy. The fact that if we do not buy they can go to an IPO, so it's a mechanism, so there is
no put and call in the sense you describe it. But it's true that on the medium term we have said, and I think it has to be discussed in 2009, we will probably go beyond the 80% were we are today.
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding Orange Netherlands, we are in the process of selling. It's currently in the phase of discussions between the local workers council and the potential buyer Deutsche Telecom.
This is a phase that we hope to be concluded in the next week. And then we have to wait for the green light of the competition authorities to conclude the sale that we expect to be concluded in the course of (inaudible).
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. But --

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: And regarding the fourth license, I don't know if one of my colleagues wants to answer.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. (Inaudible). If I understood well your question, your question was what do we think about the fact that the fourth license would get some chunk of the 900 megahertz spectrum. Is that correct? Was that your question?

Page 160 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Yes, and just whether you can continue to operate. If tomorrow you had to give back some of your 900 spectrum, whether that would create any capacity issues for you, given you've got a big customer base and probably quite a lot of usage in certain areas in France.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. So, as you remember, one of the reasons why the fourth license process was reopened is because the French National Regulatory Authority wanted to solve this issue regarding this remaining 900 megahertz spectrum that up to now has been freezed. So we do
not consider that as a difficulty. We don't have any issue regarding staff resources. The French regulator has already given a green light for existing operators to reuse 900 megahertz spectrum for 3G network coverage, especially coverage beyond the existing coverage situation, 65% of the population.

We will do tests by the end of this year, with the approval of the regulator, tests about the 3G coverage in the 900 megahertz bandwidth. And on a short-term admin-term perspective, we do not see any shortage issue regarding the 900 megahertz bandwidth.

In the long-term issue, it is clear that the move of traffic from 2G to 3G bandwidth with the perspective of the digital dividend, we think will create a situation in which there won't be any long-term shortage regarding spectrum for us in France.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Great. Just coming back quickly on the Orange Netherlands issue, do you have any particular plans for the proceeds from that disposal or is it just going to go towards deleveraging for now?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: On the European --?
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: No, sorry, on Netherlands, Orange Netherlands.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: About the Netherlands, we expect to get some proceeds, yes. MATTHEW BLOXHAM: But you don't have any specific plans for that distribution ever?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: But it's part of the overall financing picture of the Group, and it doesn't change the cash allocation we have been mentioning at the beginning of the year. We will see how the situation comes at the end of the year. And, again, the cash allocation for this year, our Group, (inaudible) early 2008.
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Thank you.

LAURENT SIERRA, ANALYST, REDBURN PARTNERS: Hi. Laurent Sierra from Redburn in London. A couple of questions, the first one on the U.K. You reported a drop in DSL customers, whereas your competitors reported additions. What are you doing wrong there and what are you planning to do in order to counter that?

My second question was regarding Spain. Even ONO reported an up-trend in sales, but you are reporting in the fixed line a revenue decline, when I think that the situation in Q2 was slightly better. Do you still believe that  Telefonica  is abusing its domestic position?

And if I could add a third one on the retail, it seems like the retail line losses have accelerated in Q2. Do you think there is cannibalization between your wholesale services and your retail services? Thank you.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: You can start with the question on the U.K., Bernard.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Yes. We have said we are not satisfied with the performance we have in broadband and we are of course more happy about our mobile results. What I would say is that you all know that we have been having some difficulties in terms of customer experience and with the fact that we care for our brand. So our first priority has been to focus in improving our customer experience, and in this we have done some progress during H1. As an example, I can tell you that our service level in our customer service has been consistently over 90%, 9-0, which is quite a good performance. We have been also delighted by a factor of five, the number of single phones on the (inaudible). So the focus has been on the customer experience.

On the commercial performance, we are doing a certain number of things to come back in the market. We are preparing new propositions for H2. We are preparing a dual-play offer, a triple-play offer, a line rental and primary line voice bundle. We are obviously preparing our IPTV. In this domain we are quite cautious there again, because we know and I think that BT has shown that this is not -- this is a challenge in terms
of customer experience as well. But I can tell you that we are going to launch a friendly user trial on IPTV in Q3 and we are also obviously working on the content. We are also working on our distribution and to strengthen the distribution in broadband. And you will be pleased to know that we are now back in DFD
and we have very good results from the promotion that we've done there.

Page 161 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the situation on the broadband market in Spain, Antonio, could you answer?

ANTONIO ANGUITA, FRANCE HOME, FRANCE TELECOM: Sure. Well, I think most of you know that the situation in Spain is fairly unique.  Telefonica  enjoys an overly dominant position. Clearly we believe we've been saying all along that this has to do with the regulatory framework in which  Telefonica  plays in the domestic market. This opinion has been supported by  competition authorities in Spain, which
unfortunately have not carried much weight, and as you know, more recently by the  European                   Commission.

Vis-a-vis that, what we are doing is three things. First, make sure that we continue to do a good job in delivering the kinds of innovative services that Spanish customers appreciate. Second is scale up our operations and so the recent acquisition of ya.com has to be interpreted in that light. Vis-a-vis a dominant incumbent and almost no competition, it is important to scale up. And third, we need to leverage upon the recent decision by the European Commission to continue to ensure that the regulatory framework in Spain evolves in an appropriate equitable way, and is -- becomes more aligned with the regulatory frameworks in most other European countries.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the French market, the evolution of the number of wholesale lines, Louis-Pierre?
LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: Yes. And you're right to mention this. I think the first point we have to keep in
mind is that the number of lines in France has been increasing altogether, which means that basically we're
getting more revenues from more lines. Now, you're right, the number of retail lines is currently declining
but it's coming from several factors. The first one is the full unbundling, which has, I would say, no real
change in the pace it's happening, if you take season effects, seasonality effect. So this is almost
something we know.

Then there is the wholesale line rental. If you remember correctly, we've been launching this at the end of last year for us to be able to put some of our offers in the market. Nothing happened almost until Q2 this year. There was a bump in Q2 and then it's slowing down again. So it's very difficult to understand how far this will go. Just let me add on that that when some first -- the customers were moved to the offer by our competition were almost not any more under our control because most of them were on the pre-selection. So the only contact they had with us was the fact that we were sending them an invoice for the
subscription, and that was it, so. And at the end of the day the difference for us in terms of ARPU is less than EUR2. But, of course, if you look at the number of lines, it makes a big number of lines but a short impact on revenue.

The third factor is Naked ADSL. As you also -- for sure, you will remember, our  competition was faster than us to do this because we wanted to do it in a very careful way, which was part of the explanation of our average performance in Q4 '06. Now we are back on track, at par with our  competition. It's of course an additional factor compared to what's happened in the past. But for us I would say the result is very positive because it was the main (inaudible) we've been using to regain market share in the very dense areas which are absolutely critical for us. And we had very good results, for example, in the last weeks in Paris, better than we had for years.
So altogether it's something we have to watch carefully, but so far we feel okay with what's happening. LAURENT SIERRA: Thank you.
JAMES BRITTON, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Hello. It's James Britton from Lehman Brothers. The first question is just on the outlook statement. I know you don't want to be pushed into the revenue outlook, but can I just clarify, when you talk about revenue evolution not deteriorating in the second half,
presumably you're referring to the revenue growth level rather than revenues in absolute terms?

The second question would be on broadband ARPU, which is growing very strongly at more than 10%. Given that multi-play is just below 50% of this, can you just break down the main components of multi-play ARPU for us, to help us understand really what's driving that so strongly?

And then, third, on tax. You've recognized a deferred tax asset in France. Can you just explain why you're recognizing a deferred tax asset in a highly profitable company now? And does this have implications for cash taxes over the next couple of years? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: The two -- I will answer to the two financial questions and regarding the ARPU, (inaudible). Regarding revenue, I was mentioning revenue growth, you're right. It's true that the -- in terms of absolute values that these revenues are different from one semester to the other. My comment was meaning in terms of growth compared to a year ago.

Page 162 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Regarding the tax, you know that, depending on the countries, that on France we are recognizing within the balance sheet the tax assets with a timeframe of five years ahead. This means that there -- if you remember, at the end of last year there was EUR7b in total for the Group of deferred tax assets that we have not categorized in the balance sheet. So it's just the fact that each year and each half-year we follow the move, and we look and we take into account in terms of tax movement what is the taxation we must have on the period. And this consumes some of the assets. And we include some of the additional assets when we are in December month, and based on the layer year by year of tax assets, this gives the figure that you have taken into account for the French environment.

Regarding the detailed broadband ARPU, we don't give it, but your analysis is broadly true in terms of dynamics.

JAMES BRITTON: Okay. Can I just clarify on the tax, then, that you have EUR7b of unrecognized assets that you would expect to recognize over the next five years in that French business (multiple speakers)?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I cannot tell you exactly what will be the amount year after year for the years to come, because it depends -- it's not too easy to get earnings. But it's just for you that there is still EUR7b, out of which we have consumed a small part. Okay?
JAMES BRITTON: Okay. Thank you.

NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON, ANALYST, HSBC: Hi. Nicolas Cote-Colisson from HSBC. I have a couple of questions on Unik in the French market. Amongst the Unik customers, what is the proportion of clients who buy one of the voice options? And I was interested in the proportion of clients buying the unlimited option at EUR20.

And, more generally, my second question is about the proportion of Unik phones as a percentage of your mobile customer base in France that you would like to see in the next year or two?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: As you've seen, on the Unik phone we had a strong increase on the number of handset, so based on the range. The proportion of people taking the option is significantly moving up since now several months. And we are planning to have it increased even more. Now, in terms of goal at
year-end, we always said that it would be 700,000 and you see that we're on that track because now we are already at 300,000.

NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON: Okay. If I can ask you another question, this time regarding the U.K., what is the proportion of your client base in your mobile customer base which gets broadband for free?
BERNARD GHILLEBEART: We have at the end of H1 '07 259,000 converged customers over a base of -- NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON: No, this number is  fine. Thank you.
BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Okay. Thanks.

UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Hello. It's Jonathan from Bear Stearns. I guess three real questions. The first one is, looking at what's happened in mobile in Spain and the U.K., is there some -- do you guys have a sort of management policy? What sort of revenue growth versus margin dilution are you willing to accept in France to reinvigorate French mobile growth?

And secondly, in with Orange in the U.K. on the broadband side, what was the rationale behind not buying Pipex or not -- I think at the last conference call you have talked about wanting to increase inorganically subscribers in U.K. broadband, and Pipex came and went.
And then, just broadly, do you separate or can you separate out the losses or profits from Spanish and
U.K. broadband, and how those will change over the next six to 12 months after the Spanish acquisition?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: To start with, your question on acquisitions. We are doing acquisitions when we think the conditions are fulfilled to make them successful. In our view, currently on the U.K. market we have to implement the right organic growth dynamic before thinking on acquisitions. When I look at the performance of some of the more -- of some of the bigger broadband players, including the incumbents in terms of net adds, on the first half, I'm not sure size is completely of the matter in terms of growth dynamic.

So, as I said, and Bernard has commented it in some answers, we are preparing our plans to improve our offer. We have improved the brand position for the second half. And I think to -- at the same time to
manage an acquisition would completely jeopardize the internal focus and the focus on organic growth. So, again, it doesn't mean that we never do anything but for the time being let's focus on how to improve the internal situation and to recover the absolutely needed internal dynamic we must have on the market.
For the next question, Louis-Pierre.
Page 163 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: Yes. I'm not sure why you asked that question about reinvigorating the mobile market in France, because if you look on slide 20 we now have a market share which is stabilized, we had a good -- a Q2 improved over Q1. And if you add our MVNOs, we are increasing our market share in France, while at the same time we're increasing our margin. So if we continue like this I would be very happy, so I don't see why you're asking to us about reinvigorating the market, especially if you consider that we've been doing this within the context of the number portability.
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. That's me put in my place.

TERRY SINCLAIR, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Afternoon. It's Terry Sinclair from Citi. Two questions. First of all, the Spanish margin's down. Given your level of investment there, your investment in customers, would you expect margins to improve in the next six to 18 months in Spain?

And secondly, I wonder if I could ask a capital return question again. Given that you reiterated your leverage target, should we expect an increase in the payout to equity shareholders once that leverage target is met?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the situation in Spain, it was that our plan, our target for recovery in the margin, how will that happen in the second half of the year, a little later. I will not be more precise in terms
of external communication but it's clear that [our trend --] our target is some recovery on the gross operating margin rate on the next couple of years. We believe that there is a potential of the pressure on the Spanish market to recover in terms of margin. And by the way, we have had even a slight market improvement in the second quarter.
Regarding the leverage, the debt and cash allocation, I said in the call at the start that the guidance of two
is a floor under which the management has no intent to go. Once we will achieve (technical difficulty) I think
we will have to consider some of the (technical difficulty) you are mentioning regarding cash allocation.
TERRY SINCLAIR: Thank you very much indeed.

JAMES RATZER, ANALYST, NEW STREET RESEARCH: Hello. It's James Ratzer here from New Street Research. I have three questions, please. The first one was just looking forward to your wireline business profitability in future years, and you've had a good performance in the first half of this year, coming off a lower base last year with revenues growing around 1% per annum. Do you think growth in that business can continue or are we going to re-enter another phase of investment at EBITDA level going forward?

The second question on the wireline business was regarding fiber. Back in December you mentioned that you were planning to spend around EUR190m in 2008. Given that we're now eight months further on, has that changed? And it's below what people like Iliad and Neuf are likely to spend. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that.

And finally, I just had a question on point of details regarding two legal claims against you. I was wondering if it was possible to get an update on them. I think there's still an outstanding European Union tax claim against you from '91 to 2002 that could be worth EUR1.5b.

And secondly, I think a case might be due to go to court starting September 19 from Gerhard Schmidt that could be worth around EUR7.5b. I was wondering if it was possible just to give an update on your thoughts on that. Any chance you could settle on that case before it goes to court, given the magnitude of the claim? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Okay. Regarding your first question on the wireline business profitability, it's true that to maintain the overall profitability of the wireline business (inaudible) and that we have started to demonstrate in this first half that we are able to absorb the shift of technology towards IP, and to have a strong deployment of Internet and whilst maintaining, even increasing, the margin. I don't guarantee that this will happen exactly the same way every semester for the years to come. However, this is effective on the period to be in this direction.

Regarding FTTH, we are on track with our plans and we have always said that there will be an increase of the investment at the end of the period, with increase of deployment. And I just remind you that in terms of real implementation amongst the different French players we are the only one to have true paying customers.

Regarding the two issues in terms of legal cases you are mentioning, on the situation with Brussels there is no change regarding what was the situation at the end of 2006. So the case remains pending in front of the European Court and our case analysis is exactly the same than what it was six months ago. So no change on that. And regarding the situation with the former shareholder of MobilCom, there is also no change,
even if, you're right, this has to come in front of the court one day or the other. And there is no change in the analysis of our position.

JAMES RATZER: If I can just check on the fiber spend, does your target of EUR190m for next year stay intact or is there a chance that could increase when the regulation is finalized?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: The initial investment of EUR270m has been decided on the next two years,
2007/2008, and the split between 2007 and 2008 is not finalized. It depends on whether the (inaudible)
over the next two years and proves that this initial investment is independent of the regulatory nature.
JAMES RATZER: Okay. Thank you.
REMI THOMAS, ANALYST, CHEUVREUX: Thanks. This is Remi Thomas from Cheuvreux. Just to
follow-up on FTTH, when I had some contacts with the people in charge of the FTTH deployment they told
me that roughly you had gained 500 customers in March, and then June you had 2,000. So it seems to
suggest that the average gain per month has been around 500, whereas I was hoping for an acceleration.
So I don't know how much you can comment on this but could you tell us how good you feel about your
progress in customer acquisition?
And then, on the U.K. home market, you mentioned the progress you were hoping to achieve in terms of
the quality of the network and how that will enable you to offer an IPTV service. Can you update us on your
strategy in acquiring content? Because I think one of the main reasons why it's been difficult for BT to be
successful in the field was the fact that Sky continues to have a monopoly on football and on premier
movies. So how exactly are you intending to differentiate yourselves from Sky in the U.K?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: On the fiber question - Louis-Pierre Wenes speaking - we have to do basically two things. The first one is to deploy the fiber in the street, and this is going on according to plan. Then, if you want to get clients, you have first to get the approval from the people who are running the housings, the (inaudible) in French. We have now -- we're almost now 3,000 agreements signed and when we have these agreements you have then to go out to the clients to have them sign on.

This is why at the beginning we're slow. We suspect that we should end the year with in excess of -- largely in excess, I would say, of 10,000 clients, which is exactly according to our plan to reach over 150,000
clients by the end of 2007 -- 2008, sorry.
REMI THOMAS: Okay.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: (Multiple speakers) the position on the U.K. market and regarding content. I think the first step is that we will try to get the implementation and to finalize the implementation of the right technology and the right services to provide the content. That's the first step. And you see we'll have our launch of IPTV, especially many of the buildings in London area at the end of this year, is one first step.

Then I don't think the issue in the marketplace in the U.K. is the differentiation from the main content providers. It is to get the access to content, starting from providers, and this is what we are currently negotiating, to be able to get access to content once the platform will be in place.
REMI THOMAS: Okay. Thank you.

MARK CARDWELL, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Hi. It's Mark Cardwell at Bernstein. If I could just follow-up a little bit more on the fiber side as my first question. I'm still trying to fully understand the strategy ongoing with fiber to the home. If I understand it correctly, you're going to have multiple providers in Paris with fibers to the same building. I'm trying to understand how you expect that to survive from a pricing point of view in a reasonable way.

And secondly, you're now talking about doing the first 10 cities outside of Paris. Have you got any kind of input yet from the regulator in terms of what the economics are going to look like for that on a wholesale basis that gives you the confidence to go ahead and do it? Do we have any real input? Can you give us an update on where you are behind the scenes with the regulators?

My second question is on U.K. mobile. I heard everything you said on the call. I'm still trying to understand what really drove the jump in subscriber acquisitions, particularly in contract subscriber acquisitions. Do
you have new plans? Is it a roll off from Flex TV a year ago? Is there something else going on? What really led to the change of the rate in acquisitions in the U.K? If you could help to understand that better, I'd appreciate it.

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: On the fiber, you have to remember that in Paris laying the fiber in the street is not a issue. We have no [particular] work, so it -- I would it's say very low cost, which means that all providers can have fiber in the same street. What is costly is when you get into the building, so it's connecting really the building to the street and then going into the flats. And this is where we said that the first provider who comes in is cabling the building, basically laying the fiber in the building, and then we will share that fiber with the other providers when they need to access to the client. And this is currently what

Page 165 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
we've committed to, and this is where what we are discussing on how to achieve this in a very pragmatic way.

Now, outside Paris we have been starting, as we said, in five towns and we will also, as we said, start in five other towns. And so far it's what we all -- and then what we told almost, I think more than six months ago, there is no change. And we have no indication that this is an issue because, again, there we said we are ready to share and to give access to our  competition to the infrastructure we're laying out.

MARK CARDWELL: But in both of those cases, if I can follow up, doesn't the fact that you're going to share more than anyone's going to share in the case of Paris, the fiber, don't you need a very strong wholesale price to make the economics of that work? And do you have some assurance that you're going to get that?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: We are currently discussing with the regulation authorities, as all providers, and to come to a mutual agreement on how we will handle that.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Okay. On mobile U.K., I can assure you there is no black magic. In fact, we -- as I said at the end of '06, we have a strategy of putting our distribution into order, working with partners
and we can incentivize them to churn actively our customers. It's also about increasing the direct mix. It's to launch propositions that are compelling for the market and we have been putting most of the advantage for the customers, as Gervais said, above the GBP35 price point. And the strategy is about loyalty and we're beginning to deliver on this strategy.

In addition to that, you know that we had a quiet Q1 and we were very much -- we were very focused on H2 to make all of this work, and we are now seeing the first dividends of this strategy. So in the distribution, what -- the result you see is the result of what we have done. As Gervais pointed out, our mix is increasing. And in loyalty you see that our rolling churn has decreased from 29.4% to 24.4%. So we're not declaring a victory, but I think that we are very happy with this result.
MARK CARDWELL: So, were there new offers in Q2 that were behind the implementation of that strategy? BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Not new offers, because in fact this was the famous animal packages that you
know, and we launched in August. What we did is that we extended this unlimited proposition to the indirect
channels and -- but we did not refresh the offer in terms of price, not at all.
MARK CARDWELL: Okay. Thank you.

FRED BOULAND, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi. Good afternoon. It's Fred Bouland from Morgan Stanley. A few questions on the costs side. Could you update us on your costs program, especially on the IT and network initiative, of 200 basis points of margin improvement?

Second point, if you could elaborate on potential savings from network sharing deals in the U.K. and Spain. Vodaphone have provided a few numbers, so I'd like to have your views on that.

And lastly, on restructuring costs, what we should expect for the year. Have you seen a decline in costs for leavers? I think the last time you updated us on that you were expecting costs per departure to fall from
130,000 in '06 to 140,000 in '07. So what's your latest thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Concerning the ITN costs, as Gervais mentioned, we are perfectly on track with what we announced beginning of the year. We announced that we were saving between EUR500m to EUR800m compared to 2005 in terms of OpEx. So we are on track. As you understood, we have a decrease of a bit more than 2% for the first half of this year. We expect this kind of decrease for the next part of this year. So this is called globally an item cost, so we are on track; no problem with that.

Concerning the network sharing agreement, we have this agreement with Vodaphone in Spain, which is implemented now. We start to extract the first benefit of this network sharing agreement. In U.K. we are finalizing the network sharing agreement with Vodaphone for U.K. and we are starting to see if it makes sense to make also a network sharing agreement in other countries. But we said during the last investor day that to do that we need to find a partner we can go with.
VINCENT BENOIT: This is Vincent speaking. As far as the restructuring costs are concerned, we are on
line with what we said on December 15 last year, meaning that the costs have been divided by four globally
for one -- for each departure.

FRED BOULAND: So what do you expect in terms of restructuring costs for the year? Divided by four is last year, or that's really what I understood from the recent trends.



Page 166 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: We said, if you remember, that it was a statement we made last year, that in terms of cash impact we will not have more cash impact with the new departures than what we experienced last year in terms of cash spending for the (inaudible) embedded. Now we see that it's a bit below that you are spending now. We can reduce this amount. But it's a few thousand million euro more or less and it doesn't change anything now for the year. Okay?
FRED BOULAND: All right. Thanks.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD, ANALYST, ODDO SECURITIES: Yes. Hello. Frederic Doussard from Oddo in Paris. So two questions, first regarding Spain. You said that you expect a strong recovery -- sorry, that you had a strong recovery in margin in Q2 versus Q1. So can you tell us what was the margin in Q2 and what was the margin in Q1? And does the improvement come only from your new -- so your adaptation of unlimited offers?
And regarding Spain, do you think that your anti-churn strategy in prepaid will bring fruits as soon as H2? GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the margins, you have it. It was on slide 31 on the right. There was a
small rectangle with the split between Q1 and Q2, and you see that it moves from 20.9% in Q1 to 26% in
Q2. So you have it, all of the figures.

(Multiple speakers) major reason for improvement is the (inaudible) and the better management of the interconnect costs and of the unlimited offer. But there are other sources of improvement, including a continuous work on the cost structure, on top of what has been obtained over the year. And of exceptional items.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And do you think that the margin -- sorry, the margin could improve with your anti-churn prepaid strategy as soon as H2 or do you confirm --?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: (Multiple speakers) remember we -- I answered already to that question, so I said that we expect a margin improvement now. We -- at what pace will it come, we are not -- I'm not giving you a detailed figure for guidance, if you remember.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And then a last question regarding the enterprise business. So I'm not sure, the pro forma in H2 2007, that was 19.7% or there will be a change, because there was a change for H1? And if there is no change regarding the pro forma H2 '06 margin, so that means that the margin has declined by 200 basis points in H1 '07. So do you think the trend will continue?

BARBARA DALIBARD, SEVP, ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION SERVICES, FRANCE TELECOM: Okay. So this is Barbara Dalibard speaking. So first let me first explain precisely the evolution of the GOM rate on a comparable basis. First, as mentioned by Gervais, there were some changes in the established prices between enterprise and home phones, and this represents something that is around EUR60m plus, just by this change. Okay? Second impact on the pro forma business is ForEx, which represents a 0.4 points impact when you compare H1 2006 and H1 2007. Okay? So overall the profile now represents a decrease of 2.1 points between H1 2006 and H1 2007.

And then, of course, due to the evolution of our business, there is a decrease that is directly linked to the evolution of the business, the first one being of course the connecting fees (technical difficulty) where we have -- we still have really important competitive pressure on data international prices.

Then the second one is in the transformation of our business mix. As you have seen, we have quite some company. We have done, I think, a rather good job in deploying our service business with nearly 16% of growth, meaning that there is a change of mix in our run rate, related to this change between connected services and these new IP services.

So if I come back to now the evolution, if I compare H2 2006 and H1 2007 on the same basis, we have had a slight decrease and we expect to have the same kind of decrease going on.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I guess it's a question of communication. I guess we have not committed outside the H2 from that for (inaudible) yet, but you can imagine the situation you see on the first half will be reflected in the second half.
FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And when do you think you could stabilize the margin in this business? BARBARA DALIBARD: As I said, if I compare H1 -- H2 2006 and H1 2007 on a pro forma basis, we had a
slight decrease, around 0.5 points, and so it -- we will go on with this kind of trend.
FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay.
BARBARA DALIBARD: With a slight decrease.
Page 167 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Thank you.

ANTOINE PRADAYROL, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Hi. It's Antoine Pradayrol with Exane. Two questions, please. First, coming back on the margin for the fixed line business, is there any -- and more precisely on the question on the outlook for the margin on the fixed line in France. Is there any reason why we should expect the margin to decline year on year in H2 '07? Margin was up strongly in H1. Is there any reason which could reverse the trend in H2, in particular in H2 '07?

The second question on the margin in mobile U.K. You said, I think, that you need more fuel, I think in the presentation, to really boost the prepay performance -- prepaid performance in mobile U.K. Should we expect an impact on the margin in H2 '07 of this additional fuel, i.e. can we expect a flat margin year on year in H2 or could the margin go down or can it go up? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Yes, in France. Again, I remind you what I said regarding any countries. We don't give a detailed outlook by country. I don't know if you try to get but we don't do it. I tried to give you an indication for helping you, but regarding France.

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: We don't see any deterioration of the margin structure in France compared -- in the second half compared to the first half. Taking into consideration our normal seasonality we have, and you know that we have different profile of spending, really, between the first half and the second half, so generally the margin is lower in the second half than what it is in the first half.

Second point, however, to mention, and if you come back to the situation of last year, there was already a pick-up situation in the second half of last year compared to the first half. We have already some of the improvements already taken into consideration in the second half of this year but I'll give some clues from which you can deduct where we think we will go.
Regarding prepaid, Bernard.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Yes. First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on the prepaid, because we feel that we are losing ground. In fact, we are losing a bit of momentum. I would not give too much significance to the number of customers because, first of all, we have a somewhat conservative way of accounting for active customers in prepaid. And second, I think that with what we see, the flooding of SIM-only cards on the market, it's difficult to distinguish active and inactive customers. So what is relevant is the revenue and I can tell you that we still have positive revenue growth at the end of H1
'07 compared to H1 '06 in terms of prepaid revenue growth.

This being said, on the margin, as Gervais said, we do not give guidance, precise guidance. I just can tell you that, first of all, if you compare GOM end of H1 '07 to '06, it might not be the most relevant comparison because, if you remember, well in H1 '06 we were in the price war with T-Mobile and we had been suffering and losing market share. So we had less customer investment and better margin. So probably, around this respect, the comparison with H2 '06 is more relevant. This being said, our goal is to keep the GOM margin around the full year '06 level at the end -- for the full year '07 margin.
VINCENT BENOIT: Now, perhaps we can take the last question.

THIERRY BAUDIN, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: Hi. This is Thierry Baudin from Societe Generale in Paris. Most of my questions have been asked but two points nevertheless. Going back to enterprise, can you tell us where you think the trough will be? You did indicate that you maintain margins higher than competition. Where, beyond H2 '07, where do you think eventually the margin's going to trend to?

And then secondly, on the home France margin improvement that we've seen quite dramatically in H1, can you be a little more specific and elaborate on how it relates to the EUR200m transformation cost of H1 '06? How much has been kept on or has been basically removed from the cost structure, of the IT&N cost
cutting process as well and then the staff cuts? If you could a little break down the different impacts on the quite remarkable margin improvement we've seen in home France.

VINCENT BENOIT: Thierry, we didn't catch very well your first question. Could you repeat it? We have the second but not the first one.

THIERRY BAUDIN: The question was just on enterprise. Mrs. Dalibard just indicated how there will be -- could be a slight erosion again in H2 of the margin, but we -- it's difficult to good visibility on this business. Where do you think eventually the margin could stabilize for that division for you in the context where you said that you still keep a margin level higher than  competition?

BARBARA DALIBARD: I think what it -- one of the main parameters, and I think I have already elaborated on this one during one of the last calls, is going to be the Voice over IP implementation within our customers. That's something that we do not master entirely. What we can say is that for the time being the

Page 168 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
migration to Voice over IP has stabilized at, I would say, a peaceful rate, meaning that -- and one of the reasons of the stabilization of our GOM when it relates to the French operation, because our customers are a little bit cautious and we have kept, I would say, a very strong legacy base, which is I think good news
and we see that and for the future months as an ongoing basis.

Now, of course the impact of Voice over IP migration and fiber to the home in the long run could have another impact. So for the time being it's a little bit difficult to forecast for the next few years a steady evolution of the GOM. What I can just say is the fact that for the time being we will continue on the same rate to migrate towards new IP services through the space of network-related services, as we have planned during our next plan. And for the half to come, we do not expect a major change in the evolution towards Voice over IP (inaudible).

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I think the execution of the transformation costs you mentioned, you're right, in France for the first half 2006 you mentioned [it at 85]. It's [EUR100m] of costs. We do not mention it this year because it's true that it was as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, we're clearly in the ongoing process of transformation this year. I think now part of those costs are part of the structure, especially all
the costs to support the new offers are now embedded in the structure. And on some of the others we have worked to get them down. This explains some of the improvements we have. I'm not sure it's worthwhile to continue to focus on that, but it's rather I think they are now beyond this stage of transformation. Even if there's still a lot to go on the [home] part of the business.
THIERRY BAUDIN: So you would consider they are down to a fraction of what they were a year ago? GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Yes.
THIERRY BAUDIN: Okay. And the bulk of the staff cuts impact of EUR85m quarter on quarter and the
IT&N savings that were highlighted, you would argue that to a large extent they would be allocated to home
France along with the new pricing arrangements with the enterprise segment?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I'm not sure I am completely -- no, I'm not sure that's completely right. But -- because if you transform the infrastructure, you see a evolution enterprise compared to the evolution on
the French home margin. You see that the proportion of businesses are very different. So the weight in the margin are different. What's important for the enterprise division is less important in terms of impact for the home France division because of the respective sizes of the business. So you cannot make a comparison one for one. So that's one point.

The second point is that I think this change of prices has already reached really for (inaudible) of the debate. It is also linked with the trends in the business. We have to change the base and there are a lot of internal debates whether these are the right prices, but it's also a reflection of some of the prices evolution of some the other parties.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you. And thank you all for having participated to this call. I'm really pleased with my colleagues, especially Vincent and the Investor Relations team, to meet most of you maybe just after a few vacations. So for those who are leaving, I wish you a good vacation and I hope that these results we have provide to you has allowed you to have a good vacation. Thank you.

revenue, which is increasing by 16%. 4. NExT Strategy: 1. Stated two years ago in June 2005, when FTE launched the NExT strategy, that a huge part of the future growth would come on value-added services on top of access and from convergence services. 2. Path coming from value-added services, including Internet access plus content plus all the value-added services on top of access is now representing 22% of the revenue in the mature countries. 1. It was representing only 18% of the revenues in mature markets, mainly Western Europe markets, three years ago. 3. Traditional PSTN and voice access, which was representing
38% of revenue in 2005 is now representing 29%. 1. A drop by 10 points of the contribution of legacy voice and access business to the revenue. 4. Mobile has increased and is stable, a little below 50% from the
total. 1. The fact that FTE was right to push of this technology move and technology evolution of the customer base, because this is one way to compete successfully in the future, and to maintain market share with new businesses. 2. This is the explanation of content pressure FTE has had on the margin, and
the need to adjust skills, tools with this cost structure with this new technology. 5. Fast-Growing Markets: 1. Strong evolution in the global revenue picture. 2. They are now accounting for 13% of global revenue, whereas it is representing 10% two years ago. 6. Profitability: 1. FTE is coming back to the stabilization at the level it had a year ago. 2. GOM before commercial expense has even slightly improved more,
especially in 2Q07 than GOM after commercial expense. 3. Good margin evolution is mainly coming from the improvement of the cost structure on top of the revenue dynamics. 4. Labor costs have been decreasing by 0.4% of revenue in one year. 5. Interconnection costs have been much better managed in
2007. 1. FTE had started to improve the situation at the end of 2006. 2. Had a deterioration of interconnect expense in percentage point of revenue in 2005 and 1H06. 3. Has growth on the mobile and the fixed business to improve the cost structure of the business, especially with massive introduction of unlimited and abundance offers on its base, and to come down now to 4. 15% to revenue. 6. Other IT and network costs remained flat. 7. Commercial expenses have slightly increased. 8. General, properties and others: 1. Increase was mainly linked with some accruals, moves and reversals of accruals on some risk, especially a reversal of Lebanon in 2006 and some further accruals in 2007. 7. Headcount: 1. Has been able to reduce the headcount by a little less than 8,000 people in one year since June 2006. 1. Out of which 1,571 net departures has been realized in 1H07 in France, implying that 60% of three-year plan is now achieved at
the end of June 2007. 2. FTE is confident that it will achieve the three-year plan, which accounts for 17,000 net departures between 2006-2008. 8. Interconnect, IT & Networks Costs: 1. When measuring them as a whole, including labor costs, FTE has improved them by EUR140m vs. a year ago, a decrease of more
than 2% vs. last year. 1. This is linked with better management of the gap between what FTE pays to other operators and so to take the full benefit of the termination rate cuts when they are there. 2. Not to pay more in other situations, and got to increase revenue or not to decrease the revenue. 2. Has some slight increase of the non-labor IT and network costs, which is linked with the deployment of the customer service platform and the ongoing roll out of networks. 1. Partially offset by the outsourcing of some of the dealers, especially in Belgium and Netherlands. 3. Counts on further savings potential with the networking agreement that FTE starts to be working in Spain in 2H07 and in 2008. 9. Operating Income & Net Income: 1. Has increased operating income by EUR324m at EUR5.5b. 1. Half of the improvement is increase to GOM improvement.
2. There is an increase of the capital gains on the assets disposals, with the sale of the remaining stake in TDF and Eutelsat. 3. Partly offset by some increase of the depreciation on fixed assets, also an increase in mobile investments in Spain and in fast-growing countries. 2. Net income at Group level at EUR3.3b, benefiting from a strong reduction in the tax P&L linked with the increase of deferred tax assets in France by little less than EUR600m, and the decrease of the UK tax rate from 30% to 28%, which brings an additional EUR80m proceeds in the P&L. 1. There is a reduction of net income part of the minority shareholders and increased sale of Yellow Pages, which is no longer in FTE's account. 2. Excluding the
exceptional items, FTE has increased net income by EUR180m vs. last year to come to EUR2.4b. 10. Cash Flow & Debt: 1. Increase of cash flow is mainly linked with the increase of GOM, to be at EUR3.3b vs. EUR3.1b a year ago. 1. This improvement makes FTE comfortable to achieve thee total year objective. 2. There is no change regarding the debt, as the totality of the cash flow has been dedicated to the dividend payment. 1. There are few other movements between proceeds of sales of assets and some small acquisitions. 11. 1H07 France: 1. Has good performance on the personal division, on the mobile business with a stable revenue, slightly above a year ago. 2. A small recovery in 2Q07 vs. the situation at the end of [3Q06] where FTE is slightly declining. 3. 40.2% GOM rate to revenue vs. 39.5% a year ago. 4. Has been able to stabilize market share in retail and to come back to a good level of market share, including MVNOs at the end of 1H07. 1. There has been a continuous strategic fit with more pay monthly customers, which now represent more than 64% of the customer base. 2. Strong dynamics in terms of broadband mobile,
with a multiplication by about three of the customer base, which is now a little more than 20% of the total customer base. 5. Internet plus Fixed: 1. Has now been able to fully offset the decline of traditional PSTN by the increase in Internet and multi-play revenues. 2. GOM has increased from 32.4% to 35.4% in one year. 1. There is still an increase of the total number of telecom lines on the French market. 2. There are now 27,840 lines, which is about 100,000 more than at the end of 2006. 3. On the DSL market, FTE has
been able to keep its market share at 49.2% installed base, due to good dynamics in acquisitions, because market share of net adds has come back to deliver a 47.8% in 2Q07. 6. Broadband ARPU: 1. Standing at a little more than EUR30 at the end of 2Q07, an increase of 11% vs. a year ago. 1. Due to the deployment of more multi-play offers on customer base. 7. New vs. year ago: 1. Strong development of VOD accesses, with 900,000 paid VOD accesses in 1H07, which is a multiplication by five vs. a year ago and a
Page 172 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
multiplication by two vs. 2H06. 2. Has now launched new offers this year regarding VoIP to continue the deployment of VoIP, which is now sold on 46% of customer base in France vs. 28% a year ago. 8. UNIK: 1. There has been a strong increase vs. the situation at the end of 2006, with now 300,000 UNIK terminals sold on customer base. 1. Increasing of the full range of models for 2H07, which makes the product not
only for specific customers or specific situations, but allows to increase the potential on the market. 2. Has opened UNIK on the 30,000 Orange Wi-Fi hot spots in France. 1. Plus facility to connect UNIK phones on the Livebox of other Orange DSL users, which makes the UNIK phone a real VoIP and mobile phone depending on the location on the French territory. 9. Fiber: 1. Fiber development is on track with the plan announced at the end of 2006. 2. Has a little more than 2,000 customers who have signed a fiber contract, which is two times what FTE had at the end of last year. 3. 27,000 potential customers, 27,000 flats where fiber is now available because agreements have been made with the building managers of 27,000 flats. 10. Has spent EUR10m in CapEx until the end of June. 11. FTE is either in the course of installing or about to install fiber in ten cities outside of Paris. 12. Priorities & Action Plan: 1. Focus on mobile is to maintain the market share in a situation where there is additional pressure with the number portability, which FTE takes full effect in 2H07. 2. Taking into account the roaming regulation, which is impacting revenues and GOM in this year. 13. Home Division: 1. FTE has to continue to push for better customer satisfaction. 1. Ahead of competitors, but needs to be even better. 2. Has to target more and more precisely customer base to adapt the offer to the needs of customer, especially between naked DSL. 3. Traditional PSTN subscription is to try to focus on the (indiscernible), where naked DSL is a strong tool to recover market share. 12. UK: 1. Has good organic growth, with 3.1% growth in 1H07 on the mobile business. 1. This is an improved quality of subscriber base. 2. In the very competitive situation of the UK market, FTE has decided to focus on the
high-value customers, especially to remain the leader within the customer segment, where customers pay more than GBP35 a month. 3. An increased proportion of data and value-added tariff revenue on the customer base linked with the development of 3G. 4. Mobile Operations: 1. They are seeing a good recovery in 2Q07. 2. Strong net adds in terms of contract days. 3. Strong increase of the customer base in terms of pay monthly customers, a 10% increase at the end of 1H07 vs. end of 1H06. 4. Good level of ARPU. 5. Direct distribution represented 41% of the net adds on 1H07 vs. 30% a year ago. 6. Broadband:
1. Situations remain highly challenging, with revenue down by 4%. 1. This is mainly linked with the decline of narrowband whereas this remains difficult to continue to deploy the unbundling, and to acquire
customers in DSL in the UK. 2. Has grown DSL customer base by 9% in one year. 3. Tries to keep a stable ARPU in a very competitive environment, where most of the new entrants are presenting DSL access or Internet connections as add-ons on something like pay-TV subscriptions or voice subscriptions or anything else. 4. Continues to focus on quality of service. 5. In spite of a regulatory environment, real situation in terms of unbundling remains not so easy. 7. Action Plans: 1. Has to increase and to recover in prepaid markets, but also keeping the high-value strategy on the prepaid market, not deteriorating the value. 2. Has to pursue the development of loyalty within the customer base and to continue to work strongly on the cost structure, including the infrastructure and network costs with the implementation of network-sharing agreements with Vodafone to prepare for acquisitions in 2008. 8. Internet: 1. One of the weaknesses in
1H07, FTE needed to raise brand awareness in terms of Internet access. 2. Orange is a strong mobile brand. 3. Has to take the opportunity of the launch of more aspects in dual play and to start with some triple play, including TV offers at the end of the year to conquer again some market share. 13. Spain: 1. Situation in mobile has been better than expected, especially with some increase in revenue and some recovery on GOM in 2Q07 vs. 1Q07. 2. Had few negative effects on the revenue, mainly linked with some difficulties
with some unlimited offers, which have created trouble at the margin and revenue level. 1. This is recovering in 2Q07. 3. Has strong net adds in 1Q07 and even more in 2Q07. 1. Has been obliged to take into account the loss of Euskaltel DSL customers. 2. Has decided to clean the prepaid customer base, where there were lots of inactive customers. 3. Has a stable customer base vs. a year ago. 4. Has stable ARPU vs. a year ago. 4. Internet & Fixed: 1. Has good growth in terms of customer base, 18% increase of the customer base. 2. Strongly focused acquisitions and strongly focused on unbundled areas. 3. FTE is now at 60% growth of the customer base in unbundled areas. 4. Declining the number of customers, which are not in the unbundled areas. 1. This has not been enough to offset in terms of revenue. 2. Strong decline of voice and narrowband, does not have enough revenue increase on the Internet to offset the decline in voice and narrowband. 5. Integration with Ya.com, Ya.com has been finally acquired on 07/31/07. 5. Action Plan: 1. A new CEO has come on board at the end of June in Spain. 2. FTE is going to keep the
momentum in customer acquisition in mobile, especially in contract. 3. Has to continue and to finalize the coverage in terms of 3G, including doing it through networking agreement with Vodafone. 4. Has to
continue its fight to limit the churn. 1. Has decreased churn rate vs. a year ago. 5. To launch the MVNOs: 1. Some MVNOs contract has been signed in the course of last year. 2. There is a potential to grow customer base for MVNOs. 6. Home Market: 1. Needs to continue to reinforce DSL market share. 2. With Ya.com, FTE is clearly the number one alternative to the incumbent, and needs to push that in the course of 2H07.
14. Poland: 1. Good success in mobile. 1. They have continued to increase their market share in mobile and to maintain a strong profitability with 38.5% GOM rate. 2. FTE has continued to grow the customer base, especially for broadband, and it will continue to do that. 3. Action Plan: 1. Action plan for 2H07 is on mobile to continue to remain ahead in terms of market share, to continue to grow market share, to pursue the stimulation of the 3G usage, and specific customer growth. 2. Regarding broadband, FTE has put in place a new offer that should be operational in Sept. 15. Other Countries: 1. Growth comes from either
Page 173 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Caribbean, where most of those countries are growing above
20%, a little less in Eastern Europe, 17%. 2. With continued growth of the consumer base, more than 50%
growth in Middle East, Africa, Caribbean whereas customer base growth remained at 17% in Eastern
Europe. 1. This has helped to provide Group with additional profit as the total GOM rate for both countries,
including the Western Europe countries, is at 41.8% vs. 42% a year ago. 3. Home Market: 1. A huge part of
the customer base was represented by Orange Netherlands, which is on sale. 2. Looking at the broadband
situation, FTE has now not far from 100,000 customers in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mauritius, and Jordan,
which is the beginning of the broadband Internet business in those countries. 3. Believes this is an area of
development for the future, on top of the dynamics within mobile. 4. Action plan is mainly to keep the
growth momentum and to start to develop alternative networks, including WiMAX or FTTH in some of the
countries. 16. Enterprise: 1. Revenue has been much better than a year ago, with a strong improving trend,
especially looking at the situation in 2Q07 where revenue decline has been nearly to 0.4% of revenue,
where it was [nearly 2%] decline in 1Q07. 1. This is linked with the clear decline of some of the legacy
business, especially the voice legacy revenue in France and outside of France. 2. In terms of advanced
business network, FTE has a continuous increase of the IP revenue, even it is at a slower pace than it was
a year ago, which helped to maintain the legacy revenues and in spite of strong pressure for international
prices. 3. ICT services have continued to grow at a higher rate of the market 15.5%, and they now
represent 24% of the revenues of the division. 4. Profitability: 1. There has been a decline of 2.5 points,
because it was last year when FTE restated it to compare it to 2007, it was at 19.5%. 1. This is below the
figure that was published last year. 2. Has reassessed its internal transfer price between enterprise and the
home France division. 2. In spite of that at 17% to revenue, FTE remains clearly above major competitors
who are trying to act in terms of [high yield], especially the British one and the German one. 5. Action plan
for enterprise is to continue to secure the legacy business, to pursue the enhancement of portfolio on VoIP,
and to continue to streamline the cost base. 17. Outlook: 1. FTE does not expect in 2H07 a big difference
vs. 1H07 in terms of revenue evolution. 2. In terms of profit, situation is slightly different, because FTE
knows that there will be a little more regulatory pressure. 1. Roaming will have an impact on GOM in
France. 3. Has the profitability number effects in France, which could create some pressure on the profit,
including the need to increase some of the subsidies to keep the customers. 4. Has clearly the difficulties of
the regulatory environment in Poland. 5. Knows that in some countries like the UK or Spain, competitive
environment will remain tough, because the incumbent remains highly protected by the local regulatory
authorities or because the nature of the market that there are too many players likely to be placed. 1.
Before consolidation happens, there is still huge  competition. 6. Confirms guidance for 2H07 in terms of
margin, in terms of cash flow. 7. Will continue to work on business portfolio finalizing some of the decisions,
which have been made like the sale of Orange Netherlands, and to continue to buy [certain] of the
businesses. 8. Confirmed Guidance: 1. Near stabilization of GOM. 2. To maintain CapEx rate at the level of
13%. 3. To maintain organic cash flow at EUR6.8b in 2007, but also in 2008, including some investments,
that could impact directly the cash flow like acquisition of the 3G license in Egypt.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY

DAMIEN MALTARP, ANALYST, CAZENOVE: Thanks. It's Damien Maltarp here from Cazenove. I've got two questions. The first one, I was just wondering if you could comment on Iliad's application for the fourth
3G license. Do you see them as very much a credible competitor to your mobile business?

And secondly, any thoughts on their proposal to defer the payment of the license fee would be of interest. And do you think that is something you could potentially replicate as well?

And the second question is just going back to the changes to the mobile number portability. It's been a couple of months now since that was introduced into France. Can you just give us an indication of what your -- what you've seen so far, and therefore what are the implications for costs going forward? Thanks.

VINCENT BENOIT, IR, FRANCE TELECOM: Well, sorry, we didn't hear you very well. Can you summarize quickly your first and second questions, please?
DAMIEN MALTARP: Yes. Can you hear me now? VINCENT BENOIT: (Multiple speakers) top of your mike. DAMIEN MALTARP: Can you hear me now?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER, CFO, FRANCE TELECOM: A bit better, but if you can speak louder it would be nice.

DAMIEN MALTARP: Okay. I will try now. The first question was on Iliad's 3G license application, just your thoughts on whether you see them as a credible competitor to you on the mobile side, and also any thoughts on their proposal for the deferred payment of the license fee.


Page 174 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And also, just the second one was on mobile number portability. We are a couple of months in. Just what you are seeing, the initial view on what has changed since it was introduced.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I will hand over the question to Benoit. So, the first question is on the -- what do we think of the Iliad position in terms of 3G license. And the second question is on the effects, how do we see the effects of the number portability up to now.

BENOIT EYMARD, FRANCE SALES AND SERVICES, FRANCE TELECOM: So, regarding Iliad, as you have noticed it, as they are the only one who have been candidates, but the proposal they have made so far in their press release do not fit into the conditions that have been established by the French regulator. So it's up to now the reg authorities to make their comments on the Iliad proposal. And if they consider that
it does not fit into the conditions that were set, they will have to consider that the bid for the license will have to be reopened, which would open a new period of four to six months of new process for the fourth license
in France.

I don't think it's in our position to make much more comment on Iliad's credibility, to take your question regarding the deployment of a fourth network in France. We just all know that it will take a lot of time and that, as you know, the French market is a difficult one for minor operators since France is the biggest country in Europe with more than 500,000 square kilometers. It is, therefore, the most expensive to cover, as we all know. Just to give a comparison, between our French operations and English operation, the cost is almost 30% more to cover to provide an accurate 3G network. This is one comment.

The second comment to be made is that, as you know, there are growing environmental pressures for any new network to be deployed, and this is clearly one of the stakes behind the subject of the fourth 3G license in France.

Regarding number portability, we think that the need is to be very cautious since, as Gervais stated it, it's only two months now that the number portability new condition has been put into place. Just as a reminder, number portability has been in France already three years but it was under a two-stop shopping process, and we have now -- we are now operating under a one-stop shopping process.

So far, we must also acknowledge that the first few years are better than what we could expect in terms of equilibrium regarding the Orange base of the effects of number portability, especially for the business market and for the value customers with subscription more than two hours, in which we have gained more than we have been losing to our competitors for number portability.

So, therefore, up to now we consider that the news are quite good. But once again, we remain very cautious because we consider that the key changes we should see on the French market will occur during Q3 and Q4 on the French market.
DAMIEN MALTARP: Okay. Thanks a lot.

NICK LYLE, ANALYST, UBS: Hi. It's Nick Lyle from UBS. Could I ask three quick questions? Just the first one, could you explain the benefit from the lack of sale -- or rather the benefit from the lack of rebranding in the Q2 numbers, just to give us a rough idea of what's lack of rebranding and what's genuine savings?

And secondly, you were talking about pushing Naked DSL harder. Does that mean you are now thinking about maybe increasing share of broadband, and how would the regulator view that?

And the final one was just a very quick one. You've mentioned Ofcom in the U.K. again as an issue with BT Openreach. How do you propose to solve that? Thanks.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Maybe, Jacques, could you answer the question of the broadband market share, and the view of the regulator?

JACQUES CHAMPEAUX, REGULATION, FRANCE TELECOM: Well, I think today the French Regulator considers that the broadband market is working well in France, and that the (inaudible) offers are working very well. So I don't think he cares too much about the difference or the duration that could happen on the retail market, given that the condition of offering of the wholesale offers are continued to be
non-discriminated.

NICK LYLE: I am sorry. Specifically on your market share, though, is it possible it could rise above 49% or is the comment more that you would stabilize it with your aggression on Naked DSL?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES, SEVP, GROUP TRANSFORMATION & FRANCE, FRANCE TELECOM: So, this is Louis-Pierre Wenes speaking. So far we are planning to stabilize it, as we said, and we have no different plans for today, and this is exactly what we are currently achieving.


Page 175 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the rebranding, we announced, if I remember, savings in the range of EUR100m last year linked with the rebranding operation. We are achieving those savings in terms of savings regarding what we are spending on maintaining the two brands or the three brands separately before. But all in all, we are spending a little more in terms of advertising to maintain our share of voice compared to competition in some countries. So it's true that we have some savings, and we are probably better than what we would have done versus -- if we did not have rebranded. However, you will not find in the global figures of our spending in A&C a decrease compared to a year ago.
Regarding the U.K. market, maybe, Bernard, you can comment.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART, EVP, ORANGE U.K., FRANCE TELECOM: Bernard speaking. Yes, on the Ofcom, just a quick comment on the side of that U.S. could be to compare the situation in terms of unbundling between France and U.K., to understand that we are very late in the U.K. compared to France in this respect. And another comment is about the fact that we have been discussing the price squeeze case, and that we have a very, very slow result in that area.
NICK LYLE: Thanks very much.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Yes. Hi. It's Matthew Bloxham here from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. One, just on Spain, just wondering if you could remind us of the structure of your ownership agreements, and whether there is any put or call options about the ownership, and if you have any desire over the medium term to buy in the minorities in the Spanish business.
Secondly, just wondering if you've got any specific thoughts for the likely proceeds from Orange
Netherlands.

And thirdly, just again relating to the fourth license process in France. Obviously one of the issues that could arise if that license is awarded is that the 900 and 1,800 frequencies get reallocated, which I guess would mean that you would get slightly less of that spectrum. I am just wondering whether that would create any temporary operational issues for you in terms of the amount of capacity you need to run your mobile network.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: We did not catch your first question. We have -- we understood the question on
Netherlands and the fourth license, but what was your first question.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Sorry. The first question was just whether there are any puts or call options in place with the minority shareholders in Spain, if you can give us any summary of what those are, if there are any, and whether FT has any intention to move to 100% ownership of that asset over time.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: In Spain there is, if you remember, it was announced at the time of the acquisition, there is a liquidity mechanism where we guarantee a certain price to the minority shareholders, but there is no obligation to buy. The fact that if we do not buy they can go to an IPO, so it's a mechanism, so there is
no put and call in the sense you describe it. But it's true that on the medium term we have said, and I think it has to be discussed in 2009, we will probably go beyond the 80% were we are today.
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding Orange Netherlands, we are in the process of selling. It's currently in the phase of discussions between the local workers council and the potential buyer Deutsche Telecom.
This is a phase that we hope to be concluded in the next week. And then we have to wait for the green light of the competition authorities to conclude the sale that we expect to be concluded in the course of (inaudible).
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. But --

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: And regarding the fourth license, I don't know if one of my colleagues wants to answer.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. (Inaudible). If I understood well your question, your question was what do we think about the fact that the fourth license would get some chunk of the 900 megahertz spectrum. Is that correct? Was that your question?

MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Yes, and just whether you can continue to operate. If tomorrow you had to give back some of your 900 spectrum, whether that would create any capacity issues for you, given you've got a big customer base and probably quite a lot of usage in certain areas in France.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. So, as you remember, one of the reasons why the fourth license process was reopened is because the French National Regulatory Authority wanted to solve

Page 176 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this issue regarding this remaining 900 megahertz spectrum that up to now has been freezed. So we do not consider that as a difficulty. We don't have any issue regarding staff resources. The French regulator has already given a green light for existing operators to reuse 900 megahertz spectrum for 3G network coverage, especially coverage beyond the existing coverage situation, 65% of the population.

We will do tests by the end of this year, with the approval of the regulator, tests about the 3G coverage in the 900 megahertz bandwidth. And on a short-term admin-term perspective, we do not see any shortage issue regarding the 900 megahertz bandwidth.
In the long-term issue, it is clear that the move of traffic from 2G to 3G bandwidth with the perspective of
the digital dividend, we think will create a situation in which there won't be any long-term shortage regarding
spectrum for us in France.

MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Great. Just coming back quickly on the Orange Netherlands issue, do you have any particular plans for the proceeds from that disposal or is it just going to go towards deleveraging for now?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: On the European --?
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: No, sorry, on Netherlands, Orange Netherlands.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: About the Netherlands, we expect to get some proceeds, yes. MATTHEW BLOXHAM: But you don't have any specific plans for that distribution ever?
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: But it's part of the overall financing picture of the Group, and it doesn't change the cash allocation we have been mentioning at the beginning of the year. We will see how the situation comes at the end of the year. And, again, the cash allocation for this year, our Group, (inaudible) early 2008.
MATTHEW BLOXHAM: Okay. Thank you.

LAURENT SIERRA, ANALYST, REDBURN PARTNERS: Hi. Laurent Sierra from Redburn in London. A couple of questions, the first one on the U.K. You reported a drop in DSL customers, whereas your competitors reported additions. What are you doing wrong there and what are you planning to do in order to counter that?

My second question was regarding Spain. Even ONO reported an up-trend in sales, but you are reporting in the fixed line a revenue decline, when I think that the situation in Q2 was slightly better. Do you still believe that Telefonica  is abusing its domestic position?

And if I could add a third one on the retail, it seems like the retail line losses have accelerated in Q2. Do you think there is cannibalization between your wholesale services and your retail services? Thank you.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: You can start with the question on the U.K., Bernard.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Yes. We have said we are not satisfied with the performance we have in broadband and we are of course more happy about our mobile results. What I would say is that you all know that we have been having some difficulties in terms of customer experience and with the fact that we care for our brand. So our first priority has been to focus in improving our customer experience, and in this we have done some progress during H1. As an example, I can tell you that our service level in our customer service has been consistently over 90%, 9-0, which is quite a good performance. We have been also delighted by a factor of five, the number of single phones on the (inaudible). So the focus has been on the customer experience.

On the commercial performance, we are doing a certain number of things to come back in the market. We are preparing new propositions for H2. We are preparing a dual-play offer, a triple-play offer, a line rental and primary line voice bundle. We are obviously preparing our IPTV. In this domain we are quite cautious there again, because we know and I think that BT has shown that this is not -- this is a challenge in terms of customer experience as well. But I can tell you that we are going to launch a friendly user trial on IPTV in
Q3 and we are also obviously working on the content. We are also working on our distribution and to strengthen the distribution in broadband. And you will be pleased to know that we are now back in DFD and we have very good results from the promotion that we've done there.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the situation on the broadband market in Spain, Antonio, could you answer?

ANTONIO ANGUITA, FRANCE HOME, FRANCE TELECOM: Sure. Well, I think most of you know that the situation in Spain is fairly unique.  Telefonica  enjoys an overly dominant position. Clearly we believe we've been saying all along that this has to do with the regulatory framework in which  Telefonica  plays in the
Page 177 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
domestic market. This opinion has been supported by  competition authorities in Spain, which
unfortunately have not carried much weight, and as you know, more recently by the European                   
Commission.

Vis-a-vis that, what we are doing is three things. First, make sure that we continue to do a good job in delivering the kinds of innovative services that Spanish customers appreciate. Second is scale up our operations and so the recent acquisition of ya.com has to be interpreted in that light. Vis-a-vis a dominant incumbent and almost no competition, it is important to scale up. And third, we need to leverage upon the recent decision by the European Commission to continue to ensure that the regulatory framework in Spain evolves in an appropriate equitable way, and is -- becomes more aligned with the regulatory frameworks in most other European countries.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the French market, the evolution of the number of wholesale lines, Louis-Pierre?
LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: Yes. And you're right to mention this. I think the first point we have to keep in
mind is that the number of lines in France has been increasing altogether, which means that basically we're
getting more revenues from more lines. Now, you're right, the number of retail lines is currently declining
but it's coming from several factors. The first one is the full unbundling, which has, I would say, no real
change in the pace it's happening, if you take season effects, seasonality effect. So this is almost
something we know.

Then there is the wholesale line rental. If you remember correctly, we've been launching this at the end of last year for us to be able to put some of our offers in the market. Nothing happened almost until Q2 this year. There was a bump in Q2 and then it's slowing down again. So it's very difficult to understand how far this will go. Just let me add on that that when some first -- the customers were moved to the offer by our competition were almost not any more under our control because most of them were on the pre-selection. So the only contact they had with us was the fact that we were sending them an invoice for the
subscription, and that was it, so. And at the end of the day the difference for us in terms of ARPU is less than EUR2. But, of course, if you look at the number of lines, it makes a big number of lines but a short impact on revenue.
The third factor is Naked ADSL. As you also -- for sure, you will remember, our  competition was faster
than us to do this because we wanted to do it in a very careful way, which was part of the explanation of our
average performance in Q4 '06. Now we are back on track, at par with our  competition. It's of course an
additional factor compared to what's happened in the past. But for us I would say the result is very positive
because it was the main (inaudible) we've been using to regain market share in the very dense areas which
are absolutely critical for us. And we had very good results, for example, in the last weeks in Paris, better
than we had for years.
So altogether it's something we have to watch carefully, but so far we feel okay with what's happening. LAURENT SIERRA: Thank you.
JAMES BRITTON, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Hello. It's James Britton from Lehman Brothers. The first question is just on the outlook statement. I know you don't want to be pushed into the revenue outlook, but can I just clarify, when you talk about revenue evolution not deteriorating in the second half, presumably you're referring to the revenue growth level rather than revenues in absolute terms?

The second question would be on broadband ARPU, which is growing very strongly at more than 10%. Given that multi-play is just below 50% of this, can you just break down the main components of multi-play ARPU for us, to help us understand really what's driving that so strongly?

And then, third, on tax. You've recognized a deferred tax asset in France. Can you just explain why you're recognizing a deferred tax asset in a highly profitable company now? And does this have implications for cash taxes over the next couple of years? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: The two -- I will answer to the two financial questions and regarding the ARPU, (inaudible). Regarding revenue, I was mentioning revenue growth, you're right. It's true that the -- in terms of absolute values that these revenues are different from one semester to the other. My comment was meaning in terms of growth compared to a year ago.

Regarding the tax, you know that, depending on the countries, that on France we are recognizing within the balance sheet the tax assets with a timeframe of five years ahead. This means that there -- if you remember, at the end of last year there was EUR7b in total for the Group of deferred tax assets that we have not categorized in the balance sheet. So it's just the fact that each year and each half-year we follow the move, and we look and we take into account in terms of tax movement what is the taxation we must have on the period. And this consumes some of the assets. And we include some of the additional assets
Page 178 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
when we are in December month, and based on the layer year by year of tax assets, this gives the figure that you have taken into account for the French environment.

Regarding the detailed broadband ARPU, we don't give it, but your analysis is broadly true in terms of dynamics.

JAMES BRITTON: Okay. Can I just clarify on the tax, then, that you have EUR7b of unrecognized assets that you would expect to recognize over the next five years in that French business (multiple speakers)?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I cannot tell you exactly what will be the amount year after year for the years to come, because it depends -- it's not too easy to get earnings. But it's just for you that there is still EUR7b, out of which we have consumed a small part. Okay?
JAMES BRITTON: Okay. Thank you.

NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON, ANALYST, HSBC: Hi. Nicolas Cote-Colisson from HSBC. I have a couple of questions on Unik in the French market. Amongst the Unik customers, what is the proportion of clients who buy one of the voice options? And I was interested in the proportion of clients buying the unlimited option at EUR20.

And, more generally, my second question is about the proportion of Unik phones as a percentage of your mobile customer base in France that you would like to see in the next year or two?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: As you've seen, on the Unik phone we had a strong increase on the number of handset, so based on the range. The proportion of people taking the option is significantly moving up since now several months. And we are planning to have it increased even more. Now, in terms of goal at
year-end, we always said that it would be 700,000 and you see that we're on that track because now we are already at 300,000.

NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON: Okay. If I can ask you another question, this time regarding the U.K., what is the proportion of your client base in your mobile customer base which gets broadband for free?
BERNARD GHILLEBEART: We have at the end of H1 '07 259,000 converged customers over a base of -- NICOLAS COTE-COLISSON: No, this number is  fine. Thank you.
BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Okay. Thanks.

UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Hello. It's Jonathan from Bear Stearns. I guess three real questions. The first one is, looking at what's happened in mobile in Spain and the U.K., is there some -- do you guys have a sort of management policy? What sort of revenue growth versus margin dilution are you willing to accept in France to reinvigorate French mobile growth?

And secondly, in with Orange in the U.K. on the broadband side, what was the rationale behind not buying Pipex or not -- I think at the last conference call you have talked about wanting to increase inorganically subscribers in U.K. broadband, and Pipex came and went.

And then, just broadly, do you separate or can you separate out the losses or profits from Spanish and U.K. broadband, and how those will change over the next six to 12 months after the Spanish acquisition?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: To start with, your question on acquisitions. We are doing acquisitions when we think the conditions are fulfilled to make them successful. In our view, currently on the U.K. market we have to implement the right organic growth dynamic before thinking on acquisitions. When I look at the performance of some of the more -- of some of the bigger broadband players, including the incumbents in terms of net adds, on the first half, I'm not sure size is completely of the matter in terms of growth dynamic.

So, as I said, and Bernard has commented it in some answers, we are preparing our plans to improve our offer. We have improved the brand position for the second half. And I think to -- at the same time to
manage an acquisition would completely jeopardize the internal focus and the focus on organic growth. So, again, it doesn't mean that we never do anything but for the time being let's focus on how to improve the internal situation and to recover the absolutely needed internal dynamic we must have on the market.
For the next question, Louis-Pierre.

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: Yes. I'm not sure why you asked that question about reinvigorating the mobile market in France, because if you look on slide 20 we now have a market share which is stabilized, we had a good -- a Q2 improved over Q1. And if you add our MVNOs, we are increasing our market share in France, while at the same time we're increasing our margin. So if we continue like this I would be very

Page 179 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
happy, so I don't see why you're asking to us about reinvigorating the market, especially if you consider that we've been doing this within the context of the number portability.
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. That's me put in my place.

TERRY SINCLAIR, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Afternoon. It's Terry Sinclair from Citi. Two questions. First of all, the Spanish margin's down. Given your level of investment there, your investment in customers, would you expect margins to improve in the next six to 18 months in Spain?

And secondly, I wonder if I could ask a capital return question again. Given that you reiterated your leverage target, should we expect an increase in the payout to equity shareholders once that leverage target is met?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the situation in Spain, it was that our plan, our target for recovery in the margin, how will that happen in the second half of the year, a little later. I will not be more precise in terms
of external communication but it's clear that [our trend --] our target is some recovery on the gross operating margin rate on the next couple of years. We believe that there is a potential of the pressure on the Spanish market to recover in terms of margin. And by the way, we have had even a slight market improvement in
the second quarter.
Regarding the leverage, the debt and cash allocation, I said in the call at the start that the guidance of two
is a floor under which the management has no intent to go. Once we will achieve (technical difficulty) I think
we will have to consider some of the (technical difficulty) you are mentioning regarding cash allocation.
TERRY SINCLAIR: Thank you very much indeed.

JAMES RATZER, ANALYST, NEW STREET RESEARCH: Hello. It's James Ratzer here from New Street Research. I have three questions, please. The first one was just looking forward to your wireline business profitability in future years, and you've had a good performance in the first half of this year, coming off a lower base last year with revenues growing around 1% per annum. Do you think growth in that business can continue or are we going to re-enter another phase of investment at EBITDA level going forward?

The second question on the wireline business was regarding fiber. Back in December you mentioned that you were planning to spend around EUR190m in 2008. Given that we're now eight months further on, has that changed? And it's below what people like Iliad and Neuf are likely to spend. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that.

And finally, I just had a question on point of details regarding two legal claims against you. I was wondering if it was possible to get an update on them. I think there's still an outstanding European Union tax claim against you from '91 to 2002 that could be worth EUR1.5b.

And secondly, I think a case might be due to go to court starting September 19 from Gerhard Schmidt that could be worth around EUR7.5b. I was wondering if it was possible just to give an update on your thoughts on that. Any chance you could settle on that case before it goes to court, given the magnitude of the claim? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Okay. Regarding your first question on the wireline business profitability, it's true that to maintain the overall profitability of the wireline business (inaudible) and that we have started to demonstrate in this first half that we are able to absorb the shift of technology towards IP, and to have a strong deployment of Internet and whilst maintaining, even increasing, the margin. I don't guarantee that this will happen exactly the same way every semester for the years to come. However, this is effective on the period to be in this direction.

Regarding FTTH, we are on track with our plans and we have always said that there will be an increase of the investment at the end of the period, with increase of deployment. And I just remind you that in terms of real implementation amongst the different French players we are the only one to have true paying customers.

Regarding the two issues in terms of legal cases you are mentioning, on the situation with Brussels there is no change regarding what was the situation at the end of 2006. So the case remains pending in front of the European Court and our case analysis is exactly the same than what it was six months ago. So no change on that. And regarding the situation with the former shareholder of MobilCom, there is also no change, even if, you're right, this has to come in front of the court one day or the other. And there is no change in the analysis of our position.

JAMES RATZER: If I can just check on the fiber spend, does your target of EUR190m for next year stay intact or is there a chance that could increase when the regulation is finalized?


Page 180 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GERVAIS PELLISSIER: The initial investment of EUR270m has been decided on the next two years,
2007/2008, and the split between 2007 and 2008 is not finalized. It depends on whether the (inaudible) over
the next two years and proves that this initial investment is independent of the regulatory nature.
JAMES RATZER: Okay. Thank you.
REMI THOMAS, ANALYST, CHEUVREUX: Thanks. This is Remi Thomas from Cheuvreux. Just to
follow-up on FTTH, when I had some contacts with the people in charge of the FTTH deployment they told
me that roughly you had gained 500 customers in March, and then June you had 2,000. So it seems to
suggest that the average gain per month has been around 500, whereas I was hoping for an acceleration.
So I don't know how much you can comment on this but could you tell us how good you feel about your
progress in customer acquisition?
And then, on the U.K. home market, you mentioned the progress you were hoping to achieve in terms of
the quality of the network and how that will enable you to offer an IPTV service. Can you update us on your
strategy in acquiring content? Because I think one of the main reasons why it's been difficult for BT to be
successful in the field was the fact that Sky continues to have a monopoly on football and on premier
movies. So how exactly are you intending to differentiate yourselves from Sky in the U.K?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: On the fiber question - Louis-Pierre Wenes speaking - we have to do basically two things. The first one is to deploy the fiber in the street, and this is going on according to plan. Then, if you want to get clients, you have first to get the approval from the people who are running the housings, the (inaudible) in French. We have now -- we're almost now 3,000 agreements signed and when we have these agreements you have then to go out to the clients to have them sign on.

This is why at the beginning we're slow. We suspect that we should end the year with in excess of -- largely in excess, I would say, of 10,000 clients, which is exactly according to our plan to reach over 150,000
clients by the end of 2007 -- 2008, sorry.
REMI THOMAS: Okay.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: (Multiple speakers) the position on the U.K. market and regarding content. I think the first step is that we will try to get the implementation and to finalize the implementation of the right technology and the right services to provide the content. That's the first step. And you see we'll have our launch of IPTV, especially many of the buildings in London area at the end of this year, is one first step.

Then I don't think the issue in the marketplace in the U.K. is the differentiation from the main content providers. It is to get the access to content, starting from providers, and this is what we are currently negotiating, to be able to get access to content once the platform will be in place.
REMI THOMAS: Okay. Thank you.

MARK CARDWELL, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Hi. It's Mark Cardwell at Bernstein. If I could just follow-up a little bit more on the fiber side as my first question. I'm still trying to fully understand the strategy ongoing with fiber to the home. If I understand it correctly, you're going to have multiple providers in Paris with fibers to the same building. I'm trying to understand how you expect that to survive from a pricing point of view in a reasonable way.

And secondly, you're now talking about doing the first 10 cities outside of Paris. Have you got any kind of input yet from the regulator in terms of what the economics are going to look like for that on a wholesale basis that gives you the confidence to go ahead and do it? Do we have any real input? Can you give us an update on where you are behind the scenes with the regulators?

My second question is on U.K. mobile. I heard everything you said on the call. I'm still trying to understand what really drove the jump in subscriber acquisitions, particularly in contract subscriber acquisitions. Do you have new plans? Is it a roll off from Flex TV a year ago? Is there something else going on? What really led
to the change of the rate in acquisitions in the U.K? If you could help to understand that better, I'd appreciate it.

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: On the fiber, you have to remember that in Paris laying the fiber in the street is not a issue. We have no [particular] work, so it -- I would it's say very low cost, which means that all providers can have fiber in the same street. What is costly is when you get into the building, so it's connecting really the building to the street and then going into the flats. And this is where we said that the first provider who comes in is cabling the building, basically laying the fiber in the building, and then we will share that fiber with the other providers when they need to access to the client. And this is currently what we've committed to, and this is where what we are discussing on how to achieve this in a very pragmatic way.

Page 181 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now, outside Paris we have been starting, as we said, in five towns and we will also, as we said, start in five other towns. And so far it's what we all -- and then what we told almost, I think more than six months ago, there is no change. And we have no indication that this is an issue because, again, there we said we are ready to share and to give access to our  competition to the infrastructure we're laying out.

MARK CARDWELL: But in both of those cases, if I can follow up, doesn't the fact that you're going to share more than anyone's going to share in the case of Paris, the fiber, don't you need a very strong wholesale price to make the economics of that work? And do you have some assurance that you're going to get that?

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: We are currently discussing with the regulation authorities, as all providers, and to come to a mutual agreement on how we will handle that.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Okay. On mobile U.K., I can assure you there is no black magic. In fact, we -- as I said at the end of '06, we have a strategy of putting our distribution into order, working with partners
and we can incentivize them to churn actively our customers. It's also about increasing the direct mix. It's to launch propositions that are compelling for the market and we have been putting most of the advantage for the customers, as Gervais said, above the GBP35 price point. And the strategy is about loyalty and we're beginning to deliver on this strategy.

In addition to that, you know that we had a quiet Q1 and we were very much -- we were very focused on H2 to make all of this work, and we are now seeing the first dividends of this strategy. So in the distribution, what -- the result you see is the result of what we have done. As Gervais pointed out, our mix is increasing. And in loyalty you see that our rolling churn has decreased from 29.4% to 24.4%. So we're not declaring a victory, but I think that we are very happy with this result.
MARK CARDWELL: So, were there new offers in Q2 that were behind the implementation of that strategy? BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Not new offers, because in fact this was the famous animal packages that you
know, and we launched in August. What we did is that we extended this unlimited proposition to the indirect
channels and -- but we did not refresh the offer in terms of price, not at all.
MARK CARDWELL: Okay. Thank you.

FRED BOULAND, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi. Good afternoon. It's Fred Bouland from Morgan Stanley. A few questions on the costs side. Could you update us on your costs program, especially on the IT and network initiative, of 200 basis points of margin improvement?

Second point, if you could elaborate on potential savings from network sharing deals in the U.K. and Spain. Vodaphone have provided a few numbers, so I'd like to have your views on that.

And lastly, on restructuring costs, what we should expect for the year. Have you seen a decline in costs for leavers? I think the last time you updated us on that you were expecting costs per departure to fall from
130,000 in '06 to 140,000 in '07. So what's your latest thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Concerning the ITN costs, as Gervais mentioned, we are perfectly on track with what we announced beginning of the year. We announced that we were saving between EUR500m to EUR800m compared to 2005 in terms of OpEx. So we are on track. As you understood, we have a decrease of a bit more than 2% for the first half of this year. We expect this kind of decrease for the next part of this year. So this is called globally an item cost, so we are on track; no problem with that.

Concerning the network sharing agreement, we have this agreement with Vodaphone in Spain, which is implemented now. We start to extract the first benefit of this network sharing agreement. In U.K. we are finalizing the network sharing agreement with Vodaphone for U.K. and we are starting to see if it makes sense to make also a network sharing agreement in other countries. But we said during the last investor day that to do that we need to find a partner we can go with.
VINCENT BENOIT: This is Vincent speaking. As far as the restructuring costs are concerned, we are on
line with what we said on December 15 last year, meaning that the costs have been divided by four globally
for one -- for each departure.

FRED BOULAND: So what do you expect in terms of restructuring costs for the year? Divided by four is last year, or that's really what I understood from the recent trends.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: We said, if you remember, that it was a statement we made last year, that in terms of cash impact we will not have more cash impact with the new departures than what we experienced last year in terms of cash spending for the (inaudible) embedded. Now we see that it's a bit below that you are


Page 182 of 186 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
spending now. We can reduce this amount. But it's a few thousand million euro more or less and it doesn't change anything now for the year. Okay?
FRED BOULAND: All right. Thanks.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD, ANALYST, ODDO SECURITIES: Yes. Hello. Frederic Doussard from Oddo in Paris. So two questions, first regarding Spain. You said that you expect a strong recovery -- sorry, that you had a strong recovery in margin in Q2 versus Q1. So can you tell us what was the margin in Q2 and what was the margin in Q1? And does the improvement come only from your new -- so your adaptation of unlimited offers?
And regarding Spain, do you think that your anti-churn strategy in prepaid will bring fruits as soon as H2? GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Regarding the margins, you have it. It was on slide 31 on the right. There was a
small rectangle with the split between Q1 and Q2, and you see that it moves from 20.9% in Q1 to 26% in
Q2. So you have it, all of the figures.

(Multiple speakers) major reason for improvement is the (inaudible) and the better management of the interconnect costs and of the unlimited offer. But there are other sources of improvement, including a continuous work on the cost structure, on top of what has been obtained over the year. And of exceptional items.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And do you think that the margin -- sorry, the margin could improve with your anti-churn prepaid strategy as soon as H2 or do you confirm --?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: (Multiple speakers) remember we -- I answered already to that question, so I said that we expect a margin improvement now. We -- at what pace will it come, we are not -- I'm not giving you a detailed figure for guidance, if you remember.

FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And then a last question regarding the enterprise business. So I'm not sure, the pro forma in H2 2007, that was 19.7% or there will be a change, because there was a change for H1? And if there is no change regarding the pro forma H2 '06 margin, so that means that the margin has declined by 200 basis points in H1 '07. So do you think the trend will continue?

BARBARA DALIBARD, SEVP, ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION SERVICES, FRANCE TELECOM: Okay. So this is Barbara Dalibard speaking. So first let me first explain precisely the evolution of the GOM rate on a comparable basis. First, as mentioned by Gervais, there were some changes in the established prices between enterprise and home phones, and this represents something that is around EUR60m plus, just by this change. Okay? Second impact on the pro forma business is ForEx, which represents a 0.4 points impact when you compare H1 2006 and H1 2007. Okay? So overall the profile now represents a decrease of 2.1 points between H1 2006 and H1 2007.

And then, of course, due to the evolution of our business, there is a decrease that is directly linked to the evolution of the business, the first one being of course the connecting fees (technical difficulty) where we have -- we still have really important competitive pressure on data international prices.

Then the second one is in the transformation of our business mix. As you have seen, we have quite some company. We have done, I think, a rather good job in deploying our service business with nearly 16% of growth, meaning that there is a change of mix in our run rate, related to this change between connected services and these new IP services.

So if I come back to now the evolution, if I compare H2 2006 and H1 2007 on the same basis, we have had a slight decrease and we expect to have the same kind of decrease going on.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I guess it's a question of communication. I guess we have not committed outside the H2 from that for (inaudible) yet, but you can imagine the situation you see on the first half will be reflected in the second half.
FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay. And when do you think you could stabilize the margin in this business? BARBARA DALIBARD: As I said, if I compare H1 -- H2 2006 and H1 2007 on a pro forma basis, we had a
slight decrease, around 0.5 points, and so it -- we will go on with this kind of trend.
FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Okay.
BARBARA DALIBARD: With a slight decrease. FREDERIC DOUSSARD: Thank you.

ANTOINE PRADAYROL, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Hi. It's Antoine Pradayrol with Exane. Two questions, please. First, coming back on the margin for the fixed line business, is there any -- and more precisely on the question on the outlook for the margin on the fixed line in France. Is there any reason why we should expect the margin to decline year on year in H2 '07? Margin was up strongly in H1. Is there any reason which could reverse the trend in H2, in particular in H2 '07?

The second question on the margin in mobile U.K. You said, I think, that you need more fuel, I think in the presentation, to really boost the prepay performance -- prepaid performance in mobile U.K. Should we expect an impact on the margin in H2 '07 of this additional fuel, i.e. can we expect a flat margin year on year in H2 or could the margin go down or can it go up? Thank you.

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Yes, in France. Again, I remind you what I said regarding any countries. We don't give a detailed outlook by country. I don't know if you try to get but we don't do it. I tried to give you an indication for helping you, but regarding France.

LOUIS-PIERRE WENES: We don't see any deterioration of the margin structure in France compared -- in the second half compared to the first half. Taking into consideration our normal seasonality we have, and you know that we have different profile of spending, really, between the first half and the second half, so generally the margin is lower in the second half than what it is in the first half.

Second point, however, to mention, and if you come back to the situation of last year, there was already a pick-up situation in the second half of last year compared to the first half. We have already some of the improvements already taken into consideration in the second half of this year but I'll give some clues from which you can deduct where we think we will go.
Regarding prepaid, Bernard.

BERNARD GHILLEBEART: Yes. First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on the prepaid, because we feel that we are losing ground. In fact, we are losing a bit of momentum. I would not give too much significance to the number of customers because, first of all, we have a somewhat conservative way of accounting for active customers in prepaid. And second, I think that with what we see, the flooding of SIM-only cards on the market, it's difficult to distinguish active and inactive customers. So what is relevant is the revenue and I can tell you that we still have positive revenue growth at the end of H1
'07 compared to H1 '06 in terms of prepaid revenue growth.

This being said, on the margin, as Gervais said, we do not give guidance, precise guidance. I just can tell you that, first of all, if you compare GOM end of H1 '07 to '06, it might not be the most relevant comparison because, if you remember, well in H1 '06 we were in the price war with T-Mobile and we had been suffering and losing market share. So we had less customer investment and better margin. So probably, around this respect, the comparison with H2 '06 is more relevant. This being said, our goal is to keep the GOM margin around the full year '06 level at the end -- for the full year '07 margin.
VINCENT BENOIT: Now, perhaps we can take the last question.

THIERRY BAUDIN, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: Hi. This is Thierry Baudin from Societe Generale in Paris. Most of my questions have been asked but two points nevertheless. Going back to enterprise, can you tell us where you think the trough will be? You did indicate that you maintain margins higher than competition. Where, beyond H2 '07, where do you think eventually the margin's going to trend to?

And then secondly, on the home France margin improvement that we've seen quite dramatically in H1, can you be a little more specific and elaborate on how it relates to the EUR200m transformation cost of H1 '06? How much has been kept on or has been basically removed from the cost structure, of the IT&N cost
cutting process as well and then the staff cuts? If you could a little break down the different impacts on the quite remarkable margin improvement we've seen in home France.

VINCENT BENOIT: Thierry, we didn't catch very well your first question. Could you repeat it? We have the second but not the first one.

THIERRY BAUDIN: The question was just on enterprise. Mrs. Dalibard just indicated how there will be -- could be a slight erosion again in H2 of the margin, but we -- it's difficult to good visibility on this business. Where do you think eventually the margin could stabilize for that division for you in the context where you said that you still keep a margin level higher than  competition?

BARBARA DALIBARD: I think what it -- one of the main parameters, and I think I have already elaborated on this one during one of the last calls, is going to be the Voice over IP implementation within our customers. That's something that we do not master entirely. What we can say is that for the time being the migration to Voice over IP has stabilized at, I would say, a peaceful rate, meaning that -- and one of the reasons of the stabilization of our GOM when it relates to the French operation, because our customers are

a little bit cautious and we have kept, I would say, a very strong legacy base, which is I think good news and we see that and for the future months as an ongoing basis.

Now, of course the impact of Voice over IP migration and fiber to the home in the long run could have another impact. So for the time being it's a little bit difficult to forecast for the next few years a steady evolution of the GOM. What I can just say is the fact that for the time being we will continue on the same rate to migrate towards new IP services through the space of network-related services, as we have planned during our next plan. And for the half to come, we do not expect a major change in the evolution towards Voice over IP (inaudible).

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I think the execution of the transformation costs you mentioned, you're right, in France for the first half 2006 you mentioned [it at 85]. It's [EUR100m] of costs. We do not mention it this year because it's true that it was as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, we're clearly in the ongoing process of transformation this year. I think now part of those costs are part of the structure, especially all
the costs to support the new offers are now embedded in the structure. And on some of the others we have worked to get them down. This explains some of the improvements we have. I'm not sure it's worthwhile to continue to focus on that, but it's rather I think they are now beyond this stage of transformation. Even if there's still a lot to go on the [home] part of the business.
THIERRY BAUDIN: So you would consider they are down to a fraction of what they were a year ago? GERVAIS PELLISSIER: Yes.
THIERRY BAUDIN: Okay. And the bulk of the staff cuts impact of EUR85m quarter on quarter and the
IT&N savings that were highlighted, you would argue that to a large extent they would be allocated to home
France along with the new pricing arrangements with the enterprise segment?

GERVAIS PELLISSIER: I'm not sure I am completely -- no, I'm not sure that's completely right. But -- because if you transform the infrastructure, you see a evolution enterprise compared to the evolution on the French home margin. You see that the proportion of businesses are very different. So the weight in the margin are different. What's important for the enterprise division is less important in terms of impact for the home France division because of the respective sizes of the business. So you cannot make a comparison one for one. So that's one point.

The second point is that I think this change of prices has already reached really for (inaudible) of the debate. It is also linked with the trends in the business. We have to change the base and there are a lot of internal debates whether these are the right prices, but it's also a reflection of some of the prices evolution of some the other parties.

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you. And thank you all for having participated to this call. I'm really pleased with my colleagues, especially Vincent and the Investor Relations team, to meet most of you maybe just after a few vacations. So for those who are leaving, I wish you a good vacation and I hope that these results we have provide to you has allowed you to have a good vacation. Thank you.
