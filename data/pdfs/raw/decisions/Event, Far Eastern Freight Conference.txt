CONFERENCE carriers operating in trades with European Union countries could be forced to cease charging intermodal tariffs from the middle of next month.

TD
A meeting of the EU Advisory Committee has formally backed calls by the  European Commission for a total and immediate cessation of intermodal tariff  fixing.

However, the majority of those present suggested the commission should allow conference carriers time to get their house in order.

While the advisory committee's view was directed against member lines of the  Far Eastern Freight    Conference  (FEFC), it will affect all conference carriers operating into and out of European ports.

The advisory committee also agreed that FEFC member lines should not be open to  fines on the issue as it was a test case for the rest of the  liner industry.
The advisory committee:

Agreed with the commission's geographic and surface market definitions and said the FEFC's landside pricing policy violated article 85 of European regulation 4056.

Ruled that European regulation 1017 and not regulation 4056 was applicable when charging tariffs on the inland leg.

Agreed that the lines were not eligible to gain exemption under articles three, four and five of regulation 1017.

The commission is obliged to seek the comments of the advisory committee prior to ruling on issues such as this.
It is not obliged, however, to heed the committee's views.
Under the terms of European regulation 1017, the commission cannot finally decide on the issue until
20 days after the advisory committee's comments.

Legal sources said they were surprised at the committee's decision to back a recommendation barring member lines from gaining individual exemption from European rules.

The FEFC is understood to be in favour of taking the commission to court if it ignores pleas for a transition period.
A conference spokesman refused to comment on the development. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1994.

HD     TAA down but not out as FMC approves  successor. (Trans-Atlantic Agreement; Federal Maritime
Commission)

Shippers were hoping to attend a funeral for the Trans-Atlantic Agreement after the  European                   Commission declared the 15-member  shipping conference had operated unlawfully for the past two years. Instead, they must contend with the conference's resurrection under a different name and
somewhat different rules.

The Trans-Atlantic Agreement was formed in 1992 by ocean carriers that currently control about 75 percent of U.S.-North Europe traffic. The group's avowed purpose was to stop its members' severe financial losses and return them to profitability. The TAA's subsequent "rate restoration" program resulted in capacity restrictions on the competitive trade route and sharp rate hikes for many shippers on both sides of the Atlantic. Allegations of discriminatory rate and negotiating practices soon began to surface here and in Europe.

TD
Shippers in Europe and in the United States pressed their respective governments to investigate and perhaps dissolve the  cartel. The U.S. Federal Maritime Commission eventually approved the TAA's operation in general, but ruled that the conference had to change certain practices it considered to be anti-competitive. The FMC also conducted a nationwide series of hearings in which shippers presented evidence of the TAA's alleged violations of U.S.  shipping laws.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the  European Commission's Competition Directorate was conducting a more strenuous investigation into the TAA's practices. After almost two years of research, the commission finally announced in October that the TAA had violated European competition laws and therefore was an illegal entity. The three illegal practices cited were a two-tier rate structure; rate setting for both ocean and inland moves; and capacity restraints.

The commission could not  fine the conference due to a technicality of European law. But the ruling penalizes the TAA by forcing it to drop certain practices--in effect, dissolving the group. The TAA also faces punitive action by its customers: the  European Commission ruled that any rate increases
implemented by the TAA were illegal and gave shippers the right to seek refunds by suing the conference. Some shippers have noted, however, that legal costs may outweigh the possible reparations.

Despite the favorable outcome of the European investigation, the battle is not yet over. The TAA has "reinvented" itself, dropping some of the activities and rules that shippers and government agencies found most objectionable.

On Oct. 24, the group received approval from the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission to operate as the "Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement" (TACA). The  European Commission, however, is still investigating the TACA and at press time had not yet issued a ruling on the new group's legality.

To win the FMC's blessing--and perhaps that of the  European Commission--the TACA agreed to change a number of its rules. Those changes include: removing the capacity-restriction program; removing the
1000-TEU minimum volume required for service contracts; allowing member carriers to take independent action on just three days' notice; requiring only five votes to approve service-contract applications; dropping authority to negotiate inland rates in Europe; and eliminating authority to enter into agreements with other carrier groups.

The FMC's approval of the TACA provoked an angry exchange of letters between FMC Chairman William Hathaway and National Industrial Transportation League President Edward M. Emmett. Emmett had charged that shippers should have had more input into the FMC's investigations, and that the TACA's changes would do little to prevent further anti-competitive abuses. Hathaway fired back an answer, dismissing the NITLeague's position as inaccurate and inflexible. That certainly won't be the end of the story, however, as U.S. shippers are likely to reply with another volley once they know the outcome of the European Commission' s investigation.

HD          Commission set to outlaw Far East container trade deal. BY          By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (Reuter) - The European Commission is expected to rule soon that the Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC) of shipping companies operating in the Europe-Asian container trade is breaking EU competition rules, industry and lawyers said on Tuesday.
The decision could be accompanied by  fines because the FEFC deal was not notified to the
Commission for clearance, a lawyer said. "I believe  fines will be imposed," he said.

TD
FEFC members include Denmark's Maersk Line, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd from Singapore and
Britain's P&O Containers Ltd.

The Commission is expected to ban FEFC price arrangements for the inland transport of containers to and from ports following complaints from the German shippers council DSVK.

"The decision on FEFC is to be taken before the end of 1994," a Commission spokesman said, adding that the issue was not on the Commission's agenda this week.

In October the Commission blocked the Trans-Atlantic Agreement between 15 shipowners also because companies had agreed prices for the land section of  container tranport. The Commission is currently vetting a revised deal called the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement.

Liner conferences are granted automatic exemption from competition rules if the price agreements concern only sea transport.

But with the containerisation of trade,  shipping companies tend to agree prices for door-to-door services, combining land with sea transport -- the so-called multi-modal rate agreements.

EU transport ministers last month expressed concern about the Commission's tough approach to multi-modal conference agreements.

A second negative ruling in under three months would be a considerable blow to the  container trade business, the lawyer said.

"If the Commission outlaws  liner conferences setting inland rates that will mean members of a conference will have to compete between themselves on the land section which undermines the conference itself," he said.

A recent meeting of the EU's advisory committee on competition on the FEFC case agreed with the Commission's view that rate-fixing  on inland transport is not covered by the block exemption, the sources said.

Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told transport ministers that the Commission could consider a block exemption for multi-modal  liner agreements but a case-by-case assessment was needed first.
Multi-modal agreements are not automatically prohibited but they must present an advantage for
container users.

_F Brussels, Dec. 21 (Jiji Press)-The  European Commission Tuesday banned a group of 14 shipping firms serving the Far Eastern route from forming a price  cartel on overland containerized cargo transport in the regional market.
The firms named include three from Japan-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and
Nippon Yusen K.K.

TD
The commission said it "decided to prohibit the members of the  Far Eastern Freight Conference
from fixing  prices for the inland transport of containerized cargo."
"The practice does not fall within the scope of the group exemption for  liner conferences," it said. Moreover, since it does not fulfill the conditions of an article of a European Union treaty on
competition, "it cannot be granted individual exemption," it said.

The EU allows price  fixing  by regular surface cargo liners as an exception to its competition rules, but the commission argued that if such price  fixing  applies to inland transport as part of multimodal cargo business, it could put a squeeze on freighters specializing in the transport.
In Wednesday's action, the commission also slapped a uniform "symbolic  fine" of 10,000 European
Currency Units on all the FEFC member liners but one firm.

BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuter) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had banned an inland transport price-fixing  agreement by the Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC) on the grounds that it violated European Union competition rules.

It said another member of the FEFC, Wilh. Wilhelmsen Ltd, was not  fined because it was not involved in an infringement.

BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuter) - The  European Commission on Wednesday banned a price-fixing agreement by European and Asian shippers and threatened to impose heavy  fines if the collusion were not stopped.

"If they go beyond three months with this practice we think is illegal...there will be considerable  fines," European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference.

TD
The Commission, the EU's executive, ruled that an inland transport price-fixing  agreement by the  Far   Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC) violated European Union competition rules. The agrement is part of a broader accord on the maritime transport of containers.

It levied symbolic  fines of 10,000 European currency units ($12,000) on each of more than a dozen companies in the freight conference.

"The Commission decided today to prohibit the members of the  Far Eastern Freight Conference  from fixing  prices for the inland transport of containerised cargo (between northern Europe and the Far East)," it said in a statement.

Anti-trust lawyers said the decision meant it was open season for any other  liner conferences involved in inland rate fixing.

"The position of the Commission has now been made clear: inland rate  fixing  by liner shipping companies within a  liner conference as in the FEFC case infringes the (EU) treaty," Brussels-based law firm Norton Rose said.

Under EU rules shipping conferences are permitted to agree on sea  container transport prices but not on rates for the land section of transport to and from ports.
The German shippers council DSVK complained to the Commission about the FEFC agreement in
1989, leading to Wednesday's ruling.

Fines were imposed on AP Moeller-Maersk Line, P&O Containers Ltd, Orient Overseas Containers, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Neptune Orient lines, Compagnie Generale Maritime, Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, Croatia Line, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, Lloyd Triestino di Navigazione SpA, Malaysian International  Shipping, Mitsui OSK Lines, and Nedlloyd Lijnen.

Another member of the FEFC, Wilh. Wilhelmsen Ltd, was not  fined because it was not involved in an infringement.
In Denmark, shipper AP Moeller-Maersk Line said it and other lines in the conference might take the
European Commission to the European Court of Justice over the decision.

"In our opinion, it is a question of a limiting and incorrect interpretation of EU law," AP Moeller said in a statement.

"We are surprised and disappointed," it said, adding that the FEFC was following a global practice supported by the United States and by European governments and  shipping lines.

Page 10 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Despite threatening heavier  fines, the Commission's Van Miert said he was optimistic that at least some of the companies involved were already revising the deal and would be notifying it soon to the Commission for clearance.
He also ruled out any near-term relaxation of the Commission's rules on inland transport price  fixing. "Eventually some time in the future there could be a case for a block exemption (for rate-fixing  on
door-to-door container transport)," he told the news conference.
"But it is premature now to take such a commitment." (c) Reuters Limited 1994

COPENHAGEN, Dec 21 (Reuter) - Denmark's AP Moeller-Maersk Line on Wednesday said it and other shipping lines in the Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC) may take the  European Commission to the European Court over a price-fixing  ban.

The European Union executive has banned an inland transport price-fixing  agreement by the FEFC, a group of shipping companies operating Europe-Asia  container transport.

TD
The Commission levied a symbolic  fine of 10,000 Ecus ($12,130) on each company.

"The affected  shipping lines are considering taking the case to court on grounds of principle," an AP Moeller statement said.
In addition to AP Moeller, the following companies were  fined:

Britain's P&O Containers Limited and Orient Overseas Containers, Japan's Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Singapore's Neptune Orient lines, Companie Generale Maritime, Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, Croatia Line, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, Lloyd Triestino di Navigatizione SpA, Malaysian International Shipping, Mitsui OSK Lines, and Nedlloyd Lijnen.

"In our opinion, it is a question of a limiting and incorrect interpretation of EU law," the AP Moeller statement said.
The Commission said the FEFC violated EU competition rules.

Under European Union competition rules  liner conferences can agree on sea  container transport prices but not on rates for the land section of transport to and from ports.
The decision stems from a 1989 complaint by the German shipper's council DSVK.

"We are surprised and disappointed," the Moeller statement said, adding that the FEFC was following a global practice supported by the United States and by European governments and  shipping lines.

HD   COMMISSION PROHIBITS EUROPE-ASIA INLAND TRANSPORT PRICE-FIXING. WC  591 words

"SYMBOLIC"  FINES.

TD
Brussels, 21/12/1994 (Agence Europe) - Upon the proposal of Commissioner Karel van Miert (competition), the European Commission decided on Wednesday to prohibit the "Far East Freight Conference" (FEFC) from fixing  prices for inland transport of goods between northern Europe and the Far East. "Inland transport" means the transport of containers by lorry and/or rail from the forwarder to the ship and from the ship to the final recipient. As Mr van Miert told the press, inland transport is not covered by the group exemption for  liner conferences contained in Article 3 of Regulation 4056/86 of the EC Treaty; moreover, the FEFC's practice does not meet the criteria set by the Commission for eligibility for an individual exemption on the basis of Article 85(3) of the Treaty. In order to give a "clear signal" and a "last warning" to shippers that this practice will no longer be tolerated by the Commission, it was decided to impose a "symbolic"  fine of 10,000 Ecus on any FEFC member companies involved in the affair. This includes the following firms: Compagnie Generale Maritime, Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, Croatia Line, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Limited, Lloyd Triestino di Navigazione, AP Moller-Maersk Line, Malaysian International Shipping, Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., Nedlloyd Lijnen BV, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, Orient Overseas  Container  Line and P&O Containers Ltd.
The Commission granted these companies (as well as all other shippers which fix prices for inland
transport in their maritime activities, said Mr van Miert) a three-month grace period in which to reestablish a
normal situation in their inland transport activities. Mr van Miert warned, "This three-month period, which
seems very reasonable to me, gives shippers the necessary time to reorganise; but it is clear that if it is not
respected, the Commission will take immediate action by imposing much larger  fines." He also recalled
that the Commission decision "should not surprise" the companies concerned, because they were aware of
the Commission's investigation of the initial complaint submitted by the Council of German Shippers
(DSVK) in 1989. Mr van Miert underscored that indi-vidual exemptions to the ban "granted on a
case-by-case basis" are still possible. He said, "I would not be surprised to receive notifications to this
effect in the coming weeks." To the question of whether the Commission will consider granting a group
exemption to the multimodal transport sector (which would, thus, also cover inland transport), Mr van Miert
was reticent, saying that the Commission could not consider such a global measure, except on the basis of
the results of concrete experience with regard to individual exemptions. As the Commission does not yet
have such data, the question has not yet arisen.

EUROPE recalls that last October, the Commission already banned the "Transatlantic Agreement" (TAA) concerning maritime transport between Europe and the United States, saying that it did not fulfill either the necessary conditions for benefitting from a group exemption for maritime conferences or an individual exemption (see EUROPE of 21 October, p. 8). The 15 companies concerned then notified the Commission of a new version of the agreement, the TACA. Mr van Miert said that the Commission has still not taken a decision on a possible "communication of complaints," and he said that he would await the results of a hearing that will take place in January with the parties in question before proposing a decision to the Commission.

HD        WORLD TRADE NEWS - EU FINES SHIPPING GROUP OVER PRICE-FIXING. BY        By EMMA TUCKER.

The European Commission yesterday acted to prohibit price-fixing  arrangements by a group of shipping companies in what could be the first of many cases against potentially illegal  shipping agreements.

Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for competition policy, said members of the  Far Eastern Freight Conference  - a group of 14 shipping companies - were banned from  fixing  prices for the land transport of container cargo.

TD
He ruled that  shipping companies were allowed to set common rates for sea transport but not for the land-based leg of journeys.

The decision means that from now the FEFC will not be allowed to fix prices with road-haulers and other land-based carriers for the transport of containers to and from ports within the EU.

The FEFC, one of the world's largest  liner shipping conferences, reacted angrily to the decision and said it would appeal to the European court of Justice. Its members include P&O Containers, Compagnie Generale Maritime and Orient Overseas  Container  Line.

Each of the 14 companies was given a 'symbolic'  fine of ECU 10,000 ( $12,100). The commission said this was to mark the existence of the offence and the need for compliance with EU competition rules.

Mr Patrick Giles, FEFC director-general, said: 'The commission has failed to recognise the international nature of the trade and has ignored th many representations of both EU and non-EU governments and shipowners... the stability afforded by the present conference inland tariff is essential. Thought-through evolution and investment is preferable to abrupt revolution.'
An existing EU regulation permits  shipping companies to fix prices for sea transport services. But in
1989 the commission received a complaint from the German Shippers' Council that members of the
FEFC were agreeing prices not only for sea transport but also for inland transport services.

The FEFC is one of many global  shipping 'conferences' - the traditional way in which the world's shipping trade is organised. Others can now expect similar treatment from the commission. This could lead to a shake-up in the provision of 'door-to-door' services by  shipping companies dealing with container cargo.

The FEFC argued that all its price-fixing  activities were covered by EU rules that exempted price-fixing for sea transport. Further, it said that the absence of collective inland rate-fixing  would endanger the stabilising role of  liner conferences by undermining the rates set collectively for maritime services.

The commission rejected these arguments on the grounds that an exemption for one activity could not justify an exemption for all other revenue-producing activities. It added that other providers of inland transport services, which were not allowed to fix prices, were put at a competitive disadvantage.

The European Commission banned an inland transport price-fixing  agreement run by shipping companies, including P&O Containers between Europe and the Far East and imposed a "symbolic"  fine of 10,000 ecus (#7,800) on the firms. The commission said the  Far Eastern Freight Conference  violated EU competition rules, which allow firms to agree on prices for sea transport of containers but
not for inland transport.

NATIONAL carrier Neptune Orient Lines and 12 other lines, all part of a  cartel of carriers, were given symbolic fines by the European Commission yesterday. Reuter news agency reported that the EC had fined the companies 10,000 European currency units (S$17,700) each for violating the commission's competition rules.

The cartel, known as the  Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC), is a London-based group of lines that covers the Far East trade, except Japan.

TD
The EC had banned an inland transport price-fixing  agreement by the FEFC companies because it felt that the lines - all  shipping giants in Europe and the Far East - had been able to control almost all transport of  liner freight between the two continents.

FEFC members are: Denmark's AP Moller-Maersk Line; Britain's P&O Containers Ltd; Hongkong's Orient Overseas  Container  Line; Japan's Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Mitsui OSK Lines and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd; Singapore's NOL; France's Companie Generale Maritime; Germany's Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft; Croatia Line; Italy's Lloyd Triestino di Navigatizione SpA; Malaysian International Shipping; and Nedlloyd Lines of the Netherlands.

HD           EU'S BAN CHALLENGES INLAND RATE-MAKING AUTHORITY - FEFC. WC          436 words

THE Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC), expressing regret over the  European Commission's ruling on its intermodal rate arrangement, said the ban challenges the inland rate-making authority of conferences.

"The FEFC much regrets the decision of the EC in the DSVK (German Shippers Council) intermodal case," the conference said in a statement yesterday.

TD
The DSVK complained to the Commission about FEFC's agreement in 1989, which led to
Wednesday's ruling.

The Commission ruled that the inland rate  fixing  by lines in the Europe-Asia  container trade conference breaks EU competition rules. It has threatened the European and Asian lines with heavy fines if the collusion is not stopped.
The Commission, the EU's executive, ruled that the inland transport price-fixing  agreement by the
FEFC violated EU competition rules.

The FEFC said it will appeal against the decision. In the meantime, it proclaims, "it is business as usual".

The Commission levied symbolic  fines of 10,000 European currency units, about $12,000 ($1 = RM2.56) on each of the FEFC lines.

Fines were imposed on AP Moeller-Maersk Line, P&O Containers Ltd, Orient Overseas Containers, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Neptune Orient Lines, Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM), Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, Croatia Line, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Lloyd Triestino di Navigazione SpA, Malaysian International  Shipping Corp, Mitsui OSK Lines and Nedlloyd Linjen.

Another FEFC member, Wilh Wilhemsen, was not  fined because it was not involved in an infringement, the EC said.
CGM has since pulled out of the FEFC Europe-Far East trade.

FEFC director-general A.P. Giles said since 1897, the Conference has offered intermodal services in the trade and following containerisation in 1971, it has offered a full-scale intermodal tariff.

"Intermodalism is an accepted international practice throughout the world and the US recognised the fact in its 1984  Shipping Act.

"Recently the Australian Government reaffirmed the benefits of conference intermodal rate making authority," he said.
Giles said should the Commission's decision be upheld, the stability offered by the Conference
Intermodal Tariff would be lost.
Shippers, he said, will inevitably suffer.
"Clearly, too, the present conference tariff which recognises some geographically distant areas in the
EU as base ports may be jeopardised.

"The decision is all the more surprising when the inland portions of the conference tariff are an optional facility which most shippers want but which none is forced to use," he said.

The Commission, he added, has failed to recognise the international nature of the trade and has ignored the many representations of both EU and non-EU governments and shipowners.

HD       EDITORIAL - A FINE SYMBOL? - FAR EASTERN FREIGHT CONFERENCE. WC      632 words

SN       Lloyd's List International

THE Far Eastern Freight Conference  members, and indeed deepsea liner operators everywhere, have received a bleak Christmas message from the European Commission in the shape of "symbolic" fines and an unfriendly judgment on the issue of inland price fixing.
While shippers' organisations rejoice at European competition commissioner Karel van Miert's backing
for the validity of their case, the owners argue that this is a blow against the whole concept of multimodal
transport, and the pure simplicity of systems designed for through transport facilitation.

TD
There has been little room for compromise in this prolonged dispute, which has revolved around points of important principle.

The conference has stressed its traditional role of a trade stabiliser, with landside services viewed as a logical extension of the sea leg.

To prohibit conference arrangements from applying on shore would call into question the whole rationale of through transport, actively encouraging an anarchic and illogical situation in which landside services fight furiously to handle cargo to and from the carefully constructed shipside tariffs and schedules.

The whole producer to consignee system should thus logically qualify for exemption from price  fixing prohibitions. The commission, which, it must be said, has consistently exhibited a far from neutral demeanour in its approach to the conference lines, and made little secret of its inherent hostility to every form of cartel, has naturally been unimpressed by these arguments.

Taking up the cudgels on behalf of German shippers (or more specifically their representative organisation), it has now judged that only those FEFC members which actually organise joint inland activities can qualify for exemption.

Merely to maintain that the permitted  cartel on the sea leg can be extended automatically on shore is unjustifiable, insists the commission, placing other inland transport services at a competitive disadvantage.

Throughout this lengthy dispute, which has been perhaps elevated and personalised into something of a symbolic clash of titans rather than an exercise in regulatory definition, there has been a tendency to simplify the issues.

It has largely ignored the fact that in other parts of the world notable for well-developed  container trades, such as the US and Australia, precisely the opposite view has been taken and inland tariffs are permitted. So there is a clash of opinions between jurisdictions, which is something that will cause all manner of practical difficulty for global operators.

Of course, the issue is by no means over, as appeals will inevitably be considered and more years of good work for lawyers elapse before a final judgment once and for all.

Realistically, one has to suggest that the conferences will have to admit to the reality of the situation, rather than risk the sort of enormous  fines which other miscreants, such as steel or cement producers, have attracted for their price-fixing  propensities.

Shippers' organisations who have regarded the dispute between the FEFC and the German shippers' council as a famous test case, will be keen to test the waters further.
Page 23 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Shipowners are faced with a stark choice. They can back off and hope that total chaos will not result from an explosion in landside competition, or alternatively, they can start to provide joint services on shore of a type that will satisfy the commission that they deserve exemption.

To do this, they must be in a position to demonstrate that efficiency and lowered costs are delivered to the delighted shippers.

To some it might seem abhorrent that the provision of goods and services, and contracts between providers and users must be forced to run the gauntlet of bureaucratic supervision plus the risk of constant legal challenge and stiff penalties. But it is part of the world we live in, and we had better recognise it.

European Commission action against FEFC attacked as `self-righteous and one-sided' by transport ministry.

JAPAN has reacted angrily to last week's decision by the  European Commission to ban conference carriers from fixing  multimodal freight rates.

TD
The Japanese Ministry of Transport described the action as "extremely self righteous" and said it would take any action necessary to support the  shipping lines involved.

In a statement, the ministry expressed disgust over the commission action and said it was unreasonable for it to  fine member lines of the  Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC).

The commission followed through its threat to clamp down on  shipping conferences by banning members of the FEFC, and subsequently all other conference carriers visiting European ports, from fixing  intermodal rates. The 13 member lines of the FEFC were also  fined Ecu10,000.

Competition commissioner Karel van Miert said last week that the symbolic  fines were imposed as a way of marking the existence of the offence and to underline the need for future compli-ance with European competition rules.

The Japanese Ministry of Transport said: "By disregarding opinions and views from various circles on the issue, it is absolutely self-righteous and one-sided for the commission to take such an action."

Meanwhile, shippers are unlikely to take legal action to claim retrospective damages following last week's decision.

Henrik Baasch, ESC secretary general, said he doubted whether shippers would be prepared to go back over the years to work out what the individual inland rates would have been.

They would be more concerned to ensure that future inland charges better reflect costs borne by the shipowners.

European legal experts believe shippers could be buoyed up by the commission's latest decision and could be aggressive in pursuing their rights.

Philip Wareham, head of Holman, Fenwick & Willan's European and competition law practice, said there was the possibility that shippers who could show that they had suffered loss as a result, could claim damages and appropriate injunctive relief from national courts.
But what should other conferences do in light of the commission judgment?
According to Mr Wareham, the commission has not ruled out the possibility that multimodal rate  fixing
could be individually exempted if it could be shown that shippers benefit from such an arrangement.

He said: "Nevertheless, lines that want to take advantage of this possibility must notify their conference agreement to the commission."

HD   Law and politics in the European Union: a reply to Garrett. (article by Geoffrey Garrett in this issue, p. 171)

LP
Geoffrey Garrett now agrees with most of what we set out to prove in our original article.(1) First, we all now concur on the significance of the phenomenon under study.

TD
Garrett originally described the European Community legal system as the straightforward implementation of member state wishes.(2) He now acknowledges that we have witnessed the construction of a "remarkable legal system," one not foreseen by the signatories to the Treaty of Rome.(3) Second, Garrett now accepts our description of the court as a strategic rational actor in its own right, with a well-internalized mandate to promote European integration according to the aims set forth in the treaty.(4) Third, whereas Garrett's original model takes account only of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the member states as the principal actors, he now agrees with our claim that the primary mechanism for the expansion of European law has been the court's co-optation of judges (and lawyers) in the member states, thereby creating a community of actors above and below the state.

What, then, is left to debate? We continue to disagree with Garrett about the nature of the state interests that the court takes into account, and hence the significance of the fact that it does take state interests into account. We also disagree on the nature of the judicial decision-making process. Finally, given these theoretical divergences, we disagree on the correct analysis of Cassis de Dijon and the generalizations that can be drawn from that analysis.
Two views of interest analysis

Most of Garrett's response focuses on what he claims to be our third point: "that the European legal system is not in the interests of member governments but that they have been unable to reorient the system in accordance with their preferences." He concludes, by way of counterexample, "that the German government's behavior in Cassis was wholly rational." But is this the issue? If the question is whether we can reconstruct a rational account of German action, the answer is inevitably yes. Any number of courses
of action would have been rational, depending on the underlying assumptions about German preferences and the specification of the constraints limiting governmental action.

We never claimed that the member states acted irrationally or that the European Community legal system per se is not in the interests of the member states. We argue that at each major step of the construction of that system, the court was able systematically to override member states' true preferences as perceived by individual states at the time and was able to impose constraints on the ability of those states to fight back. Our real argument with Garrett turns on his definition of the relevant preferences and constraints.

Three potential categories of state preference suggest themselves. First are preferences for an effective dispute resolution system - a mechanism for enforcing voluntary agreements and bargains. Second are preferences concerning the pace, scope, and degree of European integration. These preferences transcend any one particular case, generally reflecting a particular political or economic ideology. Third are specific economic or political preferences in individual cases - a desire to support citizens over foreigners, economic interests over social interests, or one economic sector over another.

With respect to the first category, Garrett is correct that the member states of the European Community, like parties to any international bargain, would prefer a functioning court to resolve disputes, fill in missing contract terms, and hold parties to their word. Such preferences keep courts in business the world over, domestically and internationally.(5) From this perspective, Articles 169 and 170 of the Treaty of Rome, authorizing the court to hear cases brought by one member state against another or by the  European         Commission against a member state, are analogous to the articles in the United Nations Charter providing

for resort to the International Court of Justice or to those in the European Convention on Human Rights providing for resort to the European Court of Human Rights. The problem is that this observation does not help us explain variance in the relative effectiveness of different international dispute resolution mechanisms. The relative effectiveness of the community legal system as compared with these other systems is due not to Articles 169 and 170 but to Article 177, which allows - and in some cases requires - national courts to refer questions of EC law to the ECJ. It is the success of the court's use of that article that needs to be explained.

With respect to the second category, Garrett originally denied any significant variance between the preferences of the court and of the member states. The court, he claimed, faithfully implements member state wishes.(6) We argued, by contrast, that the preferences of the member states and the court diverge in material respects. The judges do have "une certaine idee de l'Europe (a certain idea of Europe) of their own."(7) In any given instance, they were likely to interpret the Treaty of Rome as requiring faster and deeper integration than member state preferences would have specified. It is true, however, that the court faced outer limits on the implementation of its preferences; it could not outrun its constituency without losing its legitimacy.(8) It is in this context that the court may have used the commission as a "political bellwether" to see how far it could go in landmark decisions.(9)

Even assuming that the commission did signal the court concerning the outer limits of how far it could push the member states, the question remains as to how it could push the member states at all. We argued that law provides both a mask and a shield. It hides and protects the promotion of one particular set of political objectives against contending objectives in the purely political sphere. The court's effectiveness in advancing its own agenda thus depends on how convincingly it speaks as the technical and apparently nonpolitical voice of "the law." It must remain, for instance, minimally faithful to both substantive legal doctrine and the methodological constraints imposed by legal reasoning.(10) Within these constraints, however, the court can interpret and apply the Treaty of Rome and EC secondary legislation to reach outcomes that depart significantly from member state preferences in case after case.

With respect to the third category, Garrett suggests that the court takes into account the interests of individual states before it in a particular case. Such particularistic interest balancing contravenes the most basic precepts of the rule of law. Age-old precepts of legal reasoning require the court to apply a principle developed in the context of one case consistently across similarly situated actors in an entire category of cases. It can of course distinguish different classes of actors, but not solely on the basis of calculable economic interests. By contrast, if the court followed Garrett's model it would quickly get a reputation for arbitrary and capricious "political" decisions, thereby undermining its legitimacy. Garrett himself could not square this model with his emphasis on the court's long-term concern for its legitimacy and power.
Inside the judges' chamber

Garrett's account of the decision-making process of the court is more appropriate to a legislative than a judicial chamber. His claim that judges grapple with the political and economic interests of the litigants before them flows from a false premise: that the law itself cannot guide decisions.

"The law," in a sense of a clear, determinate body of rules, is far less clear than nonlawyers think it is. All texts, all rules are open to interpretation, to arguments and counterarguments. By exaggerating this ambiguity, however, Garrett distorts the ECJ's decision-making process beyond recognition. He concludes that "in most cases pertaining to the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people ... there is no coherent legal basis to inform court behavior" (emphasis added). This is an extraordinary statement; if true, it would mean that lawyers counseling economic actors in the European Community would have to explain that the rules likely to regulate their behavior are completely unpredictable.

Garrett's single example of this alleged legal indeterminacy is even more remarkable. He points to the "coexistence of contradictory articles in the Rome treaty": Article 30, which sets out a blanket prohibition on quota-like restraints on the free movement of goods, and Article 36, which sets out a limited number of justifications for such restraints. This is not a contradiction. It is a simple rule and exception, the exegesis of which is relatively straightforward for lawyers and political scientists alike. Unless a state can justify a particular measure under one of the heads set forth in Article 36, the measure falls under the prohibition in Article 30. Garrett argues further that the exceptions in Article 36, "public morality, public policy, or public security," are "vague and potentially of wide scope." In fact, however, in the Cassis de Dijon case Germany was unable to justify its minimum alcohol requirement on any of the enumerated grounds. The closest it could come was public health; it tried to argue that minimum alcohol restrictions discourage drinking because consumers will content themselves with one very strong drink rather than several weaker ones. This argument, as lawyers say, did not pass the "giggle test." And the court gave it the treatment it deserved.
How does the court decide? On the basis of prior cases, directives, and treaty texts, supplemented by the
Advocate Generals' technical, detailed, and often masterful opinions, as well as a wealth of academic

commentary. Even if a judge has a fixed political destination in mind, how far she or he can advance toward it depends on her or his skill as a lawyer. The judge must be able to make arguments that conform to the ordinary meaning of a written text and that fit with the context of that text - the structure, organization, and stated purposes of a treaty or law.

At issue here is more than disciplinary pride and prerogative. Without understanding the way lawyers and judges think and reason on their own terms, it is impossible to grasp the mask/shield concept we put forward. Indeed, it is impossible to understand the neofunctionalist concept of indirect penetration of the political domain. Political significance ultimately will attach to legal decisions, as Ernst Haas once argued they would to economic decisions.(11) But political objections both during and after the decision-making process will have to be framed as legal objections - as alternative readings of the relevant legal text. In this context, as long as the court preserves sufficient fidelity to protect its legitimacy and persuade its audience of national courts, it enjoys a significant advantage over the member states.
Charting the course of the court

We applaud Garrett's willingness to specify hypotheses based on a theoretical model. Only thus can scholarly debate generate valuable empirical research. Unfortunately, however, the hypotheses he generates fail even on the one example he offers as confirmation for his model, the court's rejection of liquor import restrictions in the Cassis de Dijon case. Nor can they be extended to other cases without a precise and externally verifiable theory of state interests.

Garrett's model predicts that: (1) a member state will evade an adverse court ruling if the market share and political clout of an industry harmed by the decision is large; and (2) where such evasion is likely on the part of a powerful member state, the court will avoid ruling against that state in the first place. As evidence for these predictions, Garrett offers several explanations for the German government's compliance with the Cassis decision.

His first explanation rests on the primacy of sectoral interests in government calculations. The German government's willingness to comply with an adverse decision in Cassis, he claims, was based on the calculation that the decision would affect only a small segment of the German liquor industry, the producers of fortified wines, rather than the powerful wine and beer industry. This proposition is squarely contradicted, however, by a nearly identical case decided seven years later involving the German beer industry. The German government argued for the legality of German beer purity requirements on the grounds, as in Cassis, that these requirements protected public health.(12) Here is an example of precisely the sector that Garrett speculates would have led the German government, and hence the court, to reverse the positions taken in Cassis. Yet as in Cassis, the court found against Germany; and as in Cassis, Germany complied with the decision.(13) Moreover, even in Cassis itself, if Germany did recognize the decision as laying down a general principle of mutual recognition - allowing the import of any alcoholic beverage lawfully produced and marketed in another member state - then all domestic alcohol producers should have been concerned about the ruling. Sectoral pressures should have changed accordingly.

Garrett's second explanation for German compliance with Cassis posits an overlay of general economic interests on top of specific sectoral ones. After the decision was handed down and established as the foundation for a general principle of mutual recognition, he argues, Germany should have perceived its advantage as "the most competitive economy in Europe" and pushed for the principle as an instrument of trade liberalization. Yet Germany historically has opposed mutual recognition as a principle not of trade liberalization but of acquiescence to other nations' standards.(14)

In sum, Garrett's own theory, operationalized with evidence of Germany's actual positions, predicts that both sectoral and general interests should have pointed toward noncompliance with Cassis. But Germany complied.

A deeper methodological problem is at work here. Garrett is able to cut Cassis to fit his mold because he does not subject the interests he posits to external verification. Most of the cases that come before the ECJ are sufficiently complex that they may be plausibly said to affect any number of potential state interests, particularly in retrospect. Conflicting interpretations of both the issues at stake and the significance of the court's ruling introduce additional ambiguity. Meaningful testing of models like Garrett's against thirty years of ECJ case law thus will require careful specification of a preference function that takes full account of the complexity of modern economic management and that is independently verified.
Conclusion

Overall, our best argument against Garrett is the ECJ'S evident record of success and member state reactions to that success. Anthony Arnull recently reviewed the signs of member state distress, ranging from Chancellor Kohl's public charge of unwarranted judicial activism in 1992 to the restrictions on the court's jurisdiction set forth in the Maastricht treaty.(15) Kohl was unequivocal: "\The Court of Justice\ does

not only exert its competencies in legal matters, but goes far further. We have an example of something that was not wanted in the beginning."(16)

Has the court then dropped its mask? A neofunctionalist analysis would argue that in the march toward European Union, as community building gathered speed, the issues before the court have become more politically salient. With heightened political visibility, the mask of law becomes more porous and the shield more brittle. Even here, however, the member states tacitly accept that although they can limit the court's sphere of operation by curtailing its jurisdiction, they cannot intervene within that sphere by asserting their preferences against the court's creeping extension of community norms.

It is time to move forward. The next round of this debate needs a fresh infusion of data - specific evidence of whose interests are being advanced, and how. It will not, however, be a debate between rational choice theorists and lawyers who purportedly believe, to borrow Garrett's phrase, in "the innate power of 'the law,'" as if the label alone conferred coercive force.

This is a canard that should be banished once and, for all. It is entirely rational for individuals to decide to be governed by a set of rules, applicable to and ascertainable by all on the basis of logic, consistency, and ordinary meaning. To so decide is to hive off a domain from pure political struggle. It is also to empower lawyers and judges, whose power derives from their special expertise. In the European Union, it is to establish a context in which one set of preferences, developed within a self-interested technical community on the basis of an initial legal instrument, will be systematically preferred over another set of more immediate preferences advanced by member states in any given instance. This is the dynamic that Haas described with respect to economics. We argue that it worked in law. And we argue that neofunctionalism offers a powerful analytical framework precisely because it offers a political explanation of legal power. (1.)

(53). This is also a point that Arbatov emphasized. He criticized the Soviet propaganda campaign against SDI - after the fact - as having played into the Americans' hands by encouraging the Soviet side to develop costly and unnecessary responses. See Arbatov, Zatianuvsheesia vyzdorovlenie (1953-1985 gg.), pp. 206 and 348. Sagdeev's views were similar.

Andrei Sakharov is, of course, the most famous proponent of these views, but they were evident in the statements and actions of other Soviet scientists, including prominent members of the Committee on Soviet Scientists, such as Sagdeev.

"battle management" as part of a nationwide ballistic missile defense system, but they also found Soviet claims of a space-tracking role for the radar implausible. In their view the radar was best suited for early warning of a missile attack-which, as we now know, was its original intention - though they were not particularly impressed with its capabilities even in this area.

Gorbachevym, p. 121; and Sagdeev, The Making of a Soviet Scientist, p. 273. (74.) Akhromeev and
Kornienko, Glazami marshala i diplomata, p. 109. Akhromeev claimed that Shevardnadze was prepared to
unlink START from SDI as early as December 1987, whereas he and First Deputy Foreign Minister
Kornienko insisted that the U.S. forswear pursuit of defenses. See ibid., pp. 142 and 192. (75.) The only
alternative explanation for Soviet behavior of which I am aware is Paul Nitze's argument that the change in
Soviet policy came about because the "Soviet Union apparently had decided it had more to learn from
on-site inspection than we did." His only evidence for this argument is his observation that U.S. military
officials evinced considerable reluctance to allow Soviet inspectors into U.S. facilities once the Soviets had
accepted the principle of on-site inspection. See Paul N. Nitze, From Hiroshima to Glasnost (New York:
Grove Weidenfeld, 1989), p. 442. In fact, Soviet military officials - and, indeed, members of the public at
large - remained extremely wary of allowing the West access to Soviet military sites even as part of agreed
measures for implementing arms accords such as the INF treaty, regardless of what Soviet inspectors got
to see on the other side. But in the most significant initiatives - the inspection of Krasnoiarsk and the laser
research facilities - Nitze's argument does not even apply. The Soviet concessions were unilateral and
unconditional. They entailed no Soviet inspection of U.S. facilities. For some evidence, see Matthew

(85.) The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986 probably influenced Gorbachev's
decision to extend the nuclear testing moratorium and support other efforts, such as the joint seismic
experiment, to boost the prospects for a test-ban treaty. (86.) The U.S. case provides a striking contrast.
The cooperation required of the U.S. government in the monitoring scheme was fairly modest - the granting
of export licenses, visas for visiting Soviet scientists, and permission for setting up seismic stations on U.S.
territory. Although at the highest levels most U.S. officials were unenthusiastic about the NRDC-SAS
Page 34 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
project, their views seemed to have little effect on how the various aspects of the project were handled. The decentralization of the U.S. system meant that many decisions were taken by middle- or low-level bureaucrats following standard operating procedures and adhering to statutory regulations. The result was that some potentially controversial questions - on the export of sensitive technologies needed for seismic monitoring - went rather smoothly, whereas other seemingly routine matters - issuing visas - ran into
trouble. The contrast between the domestic structures of the United States and Soviet Union seems to account for the differences. See Philip G. Schrag, Listening for the Bomb: A Study in Nuclear Arms Control Verification Policy (Boulder, Colo.: Westview, 1989). (87.) Akhromeev and Kornienko, Glazami marshala i diplomata, p. 56. (88.)

Ironically, the project - called Bear - had evidently benefited considerably from published Soviet research on laser technology in the late 1960s. Soviet research, according to Colonel Thomas Meyer, head of SDI Office's directed energy program, "enabled the U.S. to shrink the machinery enough to loft it into space." See Arms Control Reporter, pp. 575.B.369, 375, and 392. (92.) Ibid., p.
575.B.375. (93.) In August 1989, for example, a U.S. congressional delegation visited a laser research facility in Sary Shagan, which was affiliated with Velikhov's Kurchatov Institute. See Michael R. Gordon, "U.S. Visitors See Soviet Laser Firing," New York Times, 17 August 1989; Frank von Hippel, "Visit to a Laser Facility at the Soviet ABM Test Site," Physics Today (November 1989), pp. 34-35; Frank von Hippel and Thomas B. Cochran, "The Myth of the Soviet `Killer' Laser," New York Times, 19 August 1989; and Arms Control Reporter, p. 575.B.373. (94.) The prospects for such transnational antidisarmament coalitions were, of course, enhanced not only by the Soviet domestic structural transformation but also by the
changes in the international environment. Even under the previous cold war system, however, hawkish politicians on both sides of the Iron Curtain "could form what amounted to a de facto coalition in favor of hostility and arms-racing just by giving belligerent speeches." See Snyder, "East-West Bargaining," p. 116. (95.) In November 1990, Keith Payne, of the National Institute for Space Policy, for example, cited an article in the Soviet journal Voennaia Mysl' Military thought) arguing that the Soviet Union was becoming more accepting of strategic defenses.

(Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1991), pp. 287-325, esp. p. 315. (110.) It received little attention,
however, in the United States and had no impact on U.S. plans for nuclear testing. Members of the
transnational test-ban coalition tried to come up with ways to tap the power of the grassroots Kazakh
movement to influence U.S. policy. Velikhov at one point jokingly suggested flying one-hundred thousand
Kazakhs to Washington, D.C., on Aeroflot, with or without visas, to demonstrate at the White House. Based

structure from less centralized to more centralized would have the opposite effect on the fortunes of
transnational actors, all else being equal (including, for example, favorable "policy windows"). I owe these
points to John Odell. (127) Clinton's reversal of the Reagan and Bush policy owes a great deal to the efforts
of members of the U.S. side of the transnational disarmament coalition, particularly Christopher Paine and
Thomas Cochran of the NRDC and Frank von Hippel of the FAS. Their influence on U.S. policy grew as
that of their counterparts in Russia declined. See NRDC News 15 (Fall 1993), p. 49; Douglas Jehl, "Energy

of Scientific Revolutions, 2d ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970) comes from Hall, "Policy
Paradigms, Social Learning, and the State," but seems to inform much of the literature on learning. For a
more extensive critique of the learning metaphor as applied to Gorbachev's foreign policy, see Evangelista,
"Sources of Moderation in Soviet Security Policy." (136) In "Internal Battles and External Wars," Mendelson
broadens the definition of epistemic community to "a group of experts in different fields who share common
understandings and beliefs about certain issues as well as some idea of how best to implement their belief";
see p. 329 n. 7. This definition is broader than that of Haas and his colleagues. Given that Mendelson's
actors comprise people at several levels of the Soviet system, from politicians, to scholars, to journalists,
and that her community is not a transnational one, it is not clear that her otherwise  fine analysis either
contributes to or benefits from the literature on epistemic communities. (137) Risse-Kappen, "States and

"An Economic Theory of Alliances," pp. 272-73. The theory of collective action itself, on which Olson and
Zeckhauser's collective goods theory of alliances is based, acknowledges that few goods meet the strictest
definition of a public good. Referring to Paul Samuelson's classic work and Richard Musgrave's and John
G. Head's discussions of it, Olson noted that the twin defining characteristics of a public good,
nonexcludability and jointness of supply (nonrival consumption), are rarely exhibited in the real world. He
emphasizes infeasibility of exclusion as the key defining feature of collective goods, though many also
exhibit "a large measure of jointness." Indeed, with regard to the cases under examination in this essay, in
which the collective good of alliance security is supplied by nuclear deterrent forces, the requirement of
jointness of supply or nonrival consumption poses few problems, as noted below. On the real-world
appearance of public goods, see Mancur Olson, The Logic of Collective Action, rev. ed. (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1971), pp. 14, n. 21; 28, n. 44; and 40, n. 61. Also see James M. Buchanan, "An
Economic Theory of Clubs," in Bruce M. Russett, ed., Economic Theories of International Politics (Chicago:
Markham Publishing Company, 1968), pp. 51-63. On the infeasibility of exclusion, see Olson, The Logic of
Collective Action, pp. 14-15 n. 21. (4.) See van Ypserle de Strihou, "Sharing the Defense Burden Among
Western Allies," p. 530; Oneal and Elrod, "NATO Burden  Sharing and the Forces of Change," pp. 445-47;

Collective Action and Burden  Sharing in NATO." (5.) Cf. van Ypserle de Strihou, "Sharing the Defense

Cauley, "On the Economic Theory of Alliances," p. 334; and Sandler, "Impurity of Defense," pp. 447-48.
This expectation of greater free riding in the 1950s seems to hold even for Mark Boyer, who includes allies'
nonmilitary contributions. See Boyer, International Cooperation and Public Goods, pp. 84-85. (7.) A few
participants in this scholarly debate briefly noted the problematic assumption of nonexclusiveness even with
regard to deterrence-based alliance strategies, but the implications of this observation for the usefulness of
the public goods theory of alliances were not fully explored. See especially van Ypserle de Strihou,
"Comment," pp. 60-62; but also Sandler and Cauley, "On the Economic Theory of Alliances," p. 335, n. 6;
Russett, What Price Vigilance, p. 95; Sandler and Forbes, "Burden  Sharing, Strategy, and the Design of
NATO," p. 427; Oneal and Elrod, "NATO Burden Sharing and the Forces of Change," p. 440; and Oneal,
"The Theory of Collective Action and Burden Sharing in NATO," p. 384. For an argument linking the purity
of the public good to the substitutability of allies' forces rather than the distinction between deterrent and
defensive strategies, see Thies, "Alliances and Collective Goods," pp. 328-29. (8.) Murdoch and Sandler
and to some extent Oneal and Elrod emphasize the changing military strategy. See Murdoch and Sandler,
"A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of NATO"; and Oneal and Elrod, "NATO Burden  Sharing and the
Forces of Change." Oneal and Elrod, however, defended the central assertions of Olson and Zeckhauser's
theory by noting that disproportionality in burden  sharing  persisted after the mid-1960s even if the extent of
free riding did lessen somewhat. Gates and Terasawa, focusing not on weapons systems or strategy per se
but on the extent to which levels of commitment affect the public good character of security benefits
supplied by allies, explored doubts about U.S. commitment to NATO that developed only after 1970. See
Gates and Terasawa, "Commitment, Threat Perceptions, and Expenditures in a Defense Alliance." (9.)

an extreme example of the difficulties in estimating expenditures by China, see Avery Goldstein, "Robust
and Affordable Security: Some Lessons from the Second-ranking Powers During the Cold War," The
Journal of Strategic Studies 15 (December 1992), pp. 475-527 and p. 507 n. 8 in particular. (11.) Moreover,
a definition of burden  sharing  that restricts itself to military spending ignores the nonmilitary contributions
allies may make to comprehensive security. See Boyer, International Cooperation and Public Goods. (12.)

focus on NATO in the debate about the collective goods theory of alliances, see Thies, "Alliances and

(13.) Some argue that significantly outgunned nuclear powers cannot credibly deter their adversary. For
consideration of these arguments, as well as the British, Chinese, and French belief that relatively small
nuclear deterrents did enable them to dissuade a superpower adversary, see Goldstein, "Robust and
Affordable Security." (14.) On the nonsecurity motives for developing nuclear weapons, see ibid., p. 506 n.

Experience," Security Studies 2 (Spring/Summer 1993), pp. 218-19 and 233-34. (15.) Two traditional great powers, Britain and France, continued their interwar relative decline. The one anointed great power, China, failed to fulfill its promise. At first, China was represented in the UN by the Kuomintang regime, which was then presiding over a civil war torn country. Later, it was represented by the Kuomintang government in exile on Taiwan. After 1971, the effective rulers of the mainland, the Communists, assumed their international role as representatives of China, but the country's weak economic foundation limited its international clout, despite ample territory and a large population. Ironically, the two defeated great powers, Germany and Japan, would reemerge phoenix-like from the ashes of their wartime destruction. See A.F.K. Organski and Jacek Kugler, The War Ledger (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), chap. 3. But through the late 1980s, at least, international and domestic political constraints prevented them from translating their economic capabilities into international political influence. (16.) I use the term "bipolarity" to signify the distribution of capabilities in the international system, not the extent of ideological polarization associated with the cold war or the tightness of security alignments in which less powerful actors
associated themselves with one of the superpowers. Bipolarity is used here simply to indicate that despite variations in the ability to manage their respective alliance partners and impose solutions on regional actors, in the postwar world the Soviet Union and the United States were set apart by their capacity to influence, though not control, events around the globe.

On the interdependence of commitments, see Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press 1966), pp. 55-59 and 116-25. On the complexity of manipulating perceptions of a state's reputation, see the discussion of Robert Jervis's reputational paradox in Barry Nalebuff, "Rational Deterrence in an Imperfect World," World Politics 43 (April 1991),pp. 313-35. The reputational stakes are raised not only by the strategic effects of the nuclear revolution but also by bipolarity that enhances the apparent zero-sumness of international political competition between the duopolists. See Waltz, Theory of International Politics, pp. 170-72. (20.) With the outbreak of the Korean
War, the U.S. Seventh Fleet positioned itself in the Taiwan Straits and General MacArthur advanced toward the Yalu. This began a sequence of events during the decade that clarified the seriousness of the military threat the United States posed to Chinese national interests. For a recent review of the Chinese perception of the U.S. threat in the early 1950s, see Y.F. Hao and Z.H. Zhai, "China's Decision to Enter the Korean War: History Revisited," China Quarterly 121 (March 1990), pp. 94-115. See also Thomas J. Christensen, "Threats, Assurances, and the Last Chance for Peace: The Lessons of Mao's Korean War Telegrams," International Security 17 (Summer 1992), pp. 122-54. (21.) U.S. nuclear threats were reflected both in declaratory policy in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations and in the deployment of nuclear-capable forces to the East Asian theater. See John W. Lewis and Litai Xue, China Builds the Bomb (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1988), p. 229; Chong-pin Lin, China Nuclear Weapons Strategy (Lexington, Mass.: Lexington Books, 1988), p. 77; Richard K.

Conflict," International Security 13 (Winter, 1988/89), pp. 92-112. China's threat perceptions were also
based on the U.S. rhetoric about rolling back the postwar gains of communism and by the U.S. signing of a
security treaty with and arming a regime on Taiwan dedicated to reversing the outcome of the Chinese Civil
War. For a detailed survey of Sino-American threat perceptions during this period, see Shu Guang Zhang,
Deterrence and Strategic Culture: Chinese-American Confrontations, 1949-1958 (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell
University Press, 1992); and Yuanchao Li, "The Politics of Artillery Shelling: A Study of the Taiwan Strait
Crises," Beijing Review, 7 September 1992, pp. 32-38. Chinese attempts at a conciliatory approach
represented by the spirit of Bandung bore no fruit in terms of dealing with the U.S. threat. See Harvey W.
Nelsen, Power and Insecurity: Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, 1949-1988 (Boulder, Colo.: Lynne
Rienner, 1989), pp. 38-40. (22.) Thus, the ride was never completely free. Political, rather than economic,

For a view that sees the Chinese as sticking to its nationalist principles, see Nelsen, Power and Insecurity, pp. 101-2. (30.) As one critical Chinese analyst put it, "although we have established strategic relations with the United States, our views are still divergent.... The United States has formulated the so-called `Taiwan Relations Act' and violated the principle of the establishment of Sino-American diplomatic relations, and reneged on its commitment."

Enemies, pp. 190-94; and Nelsen, Power and Insecurity, pp. 41-45. (46.) Mao's cautiousness in the face of
U.S. nuclear threats contrasts sharply with his public posture of indifference and defiance. Circumspect
behavior could have reflected either Mao's fear of U.S. might or, as Christensen's work suggests, his limited
aim of provoking a war scare for domestic consumption, but no war. See Li, "The Politics of Artillery
Shelling"; Zhang, Deterrence and Strategic Culture, chap. 8; and Christensen, "Domestic Mobilization and
International Conflict," chap. 6. (47.) In the now famous line from foreign affairs minister Chen Yi, China

encouraged the strengthening of NATO, a move that would have, of course, limited the Soviets' ability to
concentrate their resources against China on the eastern front. See John W. Lewis, "China's Military
Doctrines and Force Posture," in Fingar, China's Quest for Independence, pp. 183-85; Ross, "From Lin

Europe resurfaced in the mid-1980s, especially during the run-up to signing the Intermediate-range Nuclear

second-ranking powers at times also worried about entrapment. See Jan Melissen, "Prelude to

weapon and rely entirely on America should Russia or some other power develop it." See Peter Malone,
The British

Nuclear Deterrent (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1984) p. 49. The conditions of cooperation were contained in the August 1943 Quebec agreement.

principles, much remained to be worked out by the Combined Policy Committee it established. See Malone,

entrapment aroused by MacArthur's risky adventurism in Korea reinforcing the determination of the Atlee
government to push ahead with the British bomb as the means to a degree of foreign policy independence.

1958, not in 1957 as Macmillan seemed to have claimed, and that a usable weapon was produced only in
late 1960. See Tom Wilkie, "First H-bomb Built Amid Safety Fears," The Independent, 25 June 1993, p. 3,

U.S. delivery-systems technology offered a cost-effective solution to guaranteeing Britain's continued ability to field an independently controlled deterrent.

by a recently declassified report that indicates "the French continued their nuclear program" during the
1960s "\i\n spite of U.S. efforts" to "constantly thwart ... France's nuclear ambitions" as part of a

Without dismissing altogether a role for the CW prohibition, Legro offers an organizational culture explanation for the unpreparedness of militaries and the nonuse of CW. See Jeffrey Legro, Cooperation Under Fire (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1995). (7.) The quotation is from Paul Harris, "British Preparations for Offensive Chemical Warfare 1935-1939," Journal of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies
125 (June 1980), p. 61, emphasis mine. Similarly, the international legal restraints against CW were at least partially responsible for the low priority given to CW allocations in Germany. See Dr. Hans Fischer and Dr. Wirth, "What Were the Plans and Intentions of the German High Command in the Question of Using Chemical Warfare? What Were the Reasons for Refraining from the Use of Chemical Warfare?" Historical Office of the Chief of the Chemical Corps, German Chemical Warfare, part 2, Civilian Aspects (Washington, D.C.: Historical Office of the Chief of the Chemical Corps, 1956), p. 328. (8.) The no-first-use pledge was
not written into the protocol itself but instead resulted from the reservations most nations attached to their accessions. These reservations stipulated that the protocol would cease to be binding toward any power
that violated it. (9.) See Herman Ochsner, The History of German Chemical Warfare in World War II, Part 1, The Military Aspect (Washington, D.C.: Historical Office of the Chief of the Chemical Corps, 1949), p. 23; and Omar N. Bradley, A Soldier's Story (New York: Henry Holt and Co., 195 1), p. 279. (10.) See Robert Harris and Jeremy Paxman, A Higher Form of Killing.- The Secret Story of Chemical and Biological Warfare (New York: Hill and Wang, 1982), p. 135; Ochsner, The History of German Chemical Warfare in World War II, p. 23. (11.) See SIPRI, The Rise of CB Weapons, p.325; and Harris and Paxman, A Higher Form of Killing, p. 325. (12.) The maintenance of the taboo owes no small part to the fortune of history that such circumstances never arose and to the subsequent importance of the resulting abstinence (whatever the reasons), which built a tradition of nonuse and reinforced the stigma against CW. The fact that CW were
not used during World War 11 has in and of itself become a major justification for the CW prohibition. For example, during U.S. Senate hearings over Iraq's use of CW in the early 1980s, it was remarked that CW surely were reprehensible since even Hitler did not use them. No one present knew why Germany refrained from employing CW during World War II, but the salient fact remained: "We do know it did not happen." See U.S. Congress, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Policy Toward Iraq - Human Rights, Weapons Proliferation, and International Law: Hearing Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, 101st Congress, 2d sess., 15 June 1990, p. 51. (13.) These are the words of Major General Henderson. See Harris and Paxman, A Higher Form of Killing, p. 110. (14.) According to a military intelligence officer, the
war was expected to be "chemical probably from the very first hour." See Melissa Healey, "Chemical Attack Would Escalate Allied Retaliation," Los Angeles Times, 21 February 1991, p. A1. (15.) See United Nations Security Council, doc. S/24828; and Chemical Weapons Convention Bulletin, no. 17, September 1992, p.
12. (16.) Quoted in Healey, "Chemical Attack Would Escalate Allied Retaliation. (17.) Thus, CW were not used even as other restraints against U.S. use of CW versus the Japanese began to erode toward the end

of the war. These included the death of President Roosevelt, who had been staunchly opposed to CW use, and the effects of American racist propaganda, which demonized the Japanese and made the use of gas more palatable to much of the American public. See SIPRI, The Rise of CB Weapons, pp. 294-335. (18.) Although the United States did not use lethal CW in Vietnam, it did use riot-control agents and defoliants, maintaining that use of those agents did not constitute chemical warfare. See ibid., pp. 162-210. Allegations of Soviet use of CW in Afghanistan, while rampant in the atmosphere of the cold war, never have been substantiated. (19.) In a similar spirit, the first volume of the SIPRI study argues that while many factors prevented the use 6f CW, "at a deeper level, there was the whole question of accepting gas as a weapon of war, with all the institutional and psychological disturbances that this would involve." See ibid., p. 331. (20.) See, for example, Nicholas Fotion and Gerard Elfstrom, Military Ethics: Guidelines for Peace and War (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986), p. 168. (21.)

1981), chap. 4. (23.) Indeed, this taken-for-granted quality of the poison taboo was in evidence at the Hague Conferences. Article 23(a) banning poison was reached without controversy or even substantive discussion; the moral taboo against poison had become an uncontested norm that needed no rationale or justification. See William I. Hull, The Two Hague Conferences (Boston: Ginn and Co., 1908), pp. 232-33. This was in evidence some years earlier at the Brussels conference. See T.J. Lawrence, Principles of International Law Lorimer, The Institutes of the Law of Nations (Edinburgh: Blackwood and Sons, 1883), Appendix 2. (24.) For references to the early disdain for poison see Hugo Grotius, The Law of War and Peace (De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres), trans.

Roberts, Poison in Warfare (London: William Heinemann, 1915), pp. 52-57. (25.) Georg Schwarzenberger, Legality of Nuclear Weapons (London: Stevens and Sons, 1958), p. 31. (26.) Grotius, Law of War and Peace, bk. 3, chap. 4, section 15. Vattel in 1758 offered a similar defense of
the prohibition against poison weapons, arguing that such means only made war more deadly without either side gaining advantage. See Emer de Vattel, Le Droit des Gens (The law of nations) (Leide, France: Aux depens de la compagnie, 1758), vol. 2, bk. 3, chap. 8, par. 155-56. A more recent study has followed a similar line, noting that "the rule entered into international law primarily because medieval monarchs were often eliminated by their rivals via poison in food or drink. Poison was thus a very individualistic method of doing away with an enemy." See Ann Van Wynen Thomas and A.J. Thomas, Development of International Legal Limitations on the Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons, vol. 2, report prepared for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 1968, p. 254. (27.)

In another formulation, it has been argued that "a weapon will be restricted in inverse proportion, more or less, to its effectiveness; that the more efficient a weapon or method of warfare the less likelihood there is of its being restricted in action by the rules of war."

Asphyxiating shells were discussed at The Hague even though they had yet to be developed. Isolated precursors of chemical warfare had appeared sporadically in the history of warfare,
but their appearance was so rare that they play a negligible role in the development of a CW discourse. The history of such methods can be found in Rudolf Hanslian, ed., Der Chemische Krieg (The chemical war),

See especially Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale, trans. (New York: Vintage Books, 1989). This concern recently has gained adherents in the natural sciences. In his work on evolutionary theory, Stephen Jay Gould has expounded upon his contention that "current utility may not be equated with historical origin." See, for example, the chapter entitled "Of Kiwi Eggs and the Liberty Bell," in Bully for Brontosaurus (New York: W.W. Norton and Co., 1991), p. 114. (43.) Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, Preface 3. (44.) The term "interpretive" highlights the differences between the "how" questions of understanding meaning and the "why" questions of explaining causal outcomes, while the term "constructivist" calls attention to the ontological assumptions and causal models that distinguish postpositivist methods from the naturalist premises of positivism.

careful to point out in his work on norms that power is not his particular focus of concern. Rather, he
concentrates on the consensual choices of reasoning that lead to collective knowledge. He acknowledges,
however, that understanding how socially dominant understandings become authoritative involves
investigating not simply rational debates but also historical and cultural experiences - the focus of the
genealogist's inquiries. See Friedrich Kratochwil, Rules, Norms, and Decisions: On the Conditions of

and a "psycho-cultural aversion" that simply fails to meet the realist expectation that effective prohibitions
are attained only for useless weapons. See Van Creveld, Technology and War, p. 177; and Manfred R.
Hamm, "Deterrence, Chemical Warfare, and Arms Control," Orbis 29 (Spring 1985), pp. 119-163 at p. 119,
respectively. (60.) As such, it answers the call for interpretive approaches to the study of norms made by
Friedrich Kratochwil and John Gerard Ruggie, "International Organization: A State of the Art on the Art of
the State," International Organization 40 (Autumn 1986), pp. 753-75; and offers a concrete rejoinder to
Keohane's challenge for a demonstration of the value of the "sociological" approach of "reflectivist" scholars
(which he opposes to the neopositivist models of rational actor theory in the study of norms and
institutions). See Robert Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches," in Keohane, International

Institutions and State Power (Boulder, Colo.: Westview, 1989), pp. 158-79. (61.) From the large literature on the political, social, and moral status of technology, I will confine myself to noting Langdon Winner's summary in Autonomous Technology: Technics Out-of-Control as a Theme in Political Thought
(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1977); George Grant's incisive essays in Technology and Empire (Toronto: Anansi, 1969) and Technology and Justice (Toronto: Anansi, 1986); and the essays in Tom Darby, ed., Sojourns in the New World (Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1986) and in Paul Durbin, ed., Technology and Responsibility (Dordrecht, Netherlands: D. Reidel, 1987). (62.) Keeley, "Towards a Foucauldian Analysis," pp. 96-99. (63.) A more comprehensive study is provided in Richard Price, "A Genealogy of the Chemical Weapons Taboo" Ph.D. diss., Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., 1994. (64.) Although the ban was rejected by the U.S. delegation at both Hague conferences, the remarks of one member of the U.S. commission attests to the tentative emergence of a norm proscribing gas shells. As he noted, "a certain disposition has been observed to attach odium to the view adopted by this Commission in this matter." See Scott, Documents, p. 37. (65.) On the emergence of the notion of a civilized family of nations, see Gerrit W. Gong, The Standard of `Civilization' in International Society (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984). (66.) See, for example, Times (London, 21-29 April 1915; and James Morgan Read, Atrocity Propaganda: 1914-1919 (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1941), pp. 195-96. While many argued that the use of CW was cruel, these arguments rarely compared the effects of CW with other weapons such as high explosives.
This stands in contrast to the arguments of those who have opposed prohibitions on CW. This has been a consistent feature of the discourse on the legitimacy of CW. (67.) See Ministry of Munitions, pt. 2 of "Chemical Warfare Supplies," History of the Ministry of Munitions, vol. 11, The Supply of Munitions (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1921); C.H. Foulkes, Gas] The Story of the Special Brigade (London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1934); and L.F. Haber, The Poisonous Cloud (Oxford: Clarendon
Press, 1986). (68.) Rudolf Hanslian, Der Chemische Krieg (The chemical war) (Berlin: E.S. Mittler and Son,
1937), p. 20; and SIPRI, The Rise of CB Weapons, p. 45. The French at first banned the use of shells
containing phosgene and prussic acid (as did the British) and only permitted the former when the situation
at Verdun appeared critical at the end of February 1916. The prussic acid ban was withdrawn later, the
agent was employed for the first time by the French at the Somme on 1 July 1916. See Foulkes, Gas, p.
305. While postwar accounts must be treated with due caution, it should be noted that the director of the
French chemical services argued in 1919 that these shells were held in reserve until the Germans had used
gas shells that had a toxicity comparable to phosgene - that is, until the Germans had violated the letter of
the Hague declaration. See E. Vinet, "La Guerre de Gaz et les Travaux des Services Chimiques Francais"
(The gas war and the operations of the French Chemical Service), Chemie et Industrie 2 (1 January 1919),
p. 1403. (69.) For evidence that nonuse of CW was the product of such a restraint, see Ministry of
Munitions, The Supply of Munitions, pp. 10-11; Haber, The Poisonous Cloud, pp. 224-25; Foulkes, Gas, p.
296; and Brown, Chemical Warfare, p. 45. (70.) This view has been expressed by groups such as the
American Legion and can be seen in Foulkes's rather enthusiastic assessments of gas as a weapon. See
Congressional Record, 69th Congress, 2d sess., 10 November-6 December 1926 and January 1927, vol.
68, pt. 1; and Foulkes, Gas, respectively. (71.) The quotation is from Ann Van Wynen Thomas and A.J.
Thomas, Legal Limits on the Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (Dallas, Tex.: Southern Methodist
University Press, 1970), p. 141. (72.) The fact that violations often play a crucial role in the development of
norms, as noted by Foucault, points to a difficulty of applying the positivist model of explanation to norms: a
violation of a norm does not necessarily invalidate it. See Friedrich Kratochwil and John Gerard Ruggie,

Before the Special Committee Investigating the Munitions Industry, 73rd Congress, 2d sess., 1935, pt. 11
and 12, pp. 2403-4 and 2470-71. For example, a New York Times headline (13 March 1921, p. 1)
proclaimed "War's Newest and Deadliest Weapon; 3 Drops of Poison Kill Any One They Touch," based on
reports circulated by the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service. (78.) The turnaround in assessments of gas
warfare by these propagandists was remarkable. In contrast to earlier warnings of the catastrophic potential
of CW, see the revised assessments by members of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service in New York
Times, 10 September 1926, p. 6; and 26 November 1926, p. 12. In a moment of unsurpassed irony, the
president of the American Chemical Society declared that the widespread feeling against gas was the result
of hysteria and propaganda. See New York Times, 11 December 1926, p. 3. (79.) SIPRI, The Rise of CB
Weapons, p. 247. See also Editorial, Times (London), 3 April 1923, p. 7; and Haber, The Poisonous Cloud,
pp. 288, 307, and 317. By 1927, a New York Times editorial (16 February 1927, p. 22) had dismissed the
exaggerated fears of CW as "sheer romancing," noting that the previous war had demonstrated that high
explosives were far more destructive. (80.) This argument parallels the case made by David Campbell that
representations of "outside" threats are endemic to all states in the ongoing process of securing national

identities. These depictions of danger are not simply the response to objective conditions but involve the interpretive scripting of danger through political discourse. See David Campbell, Writing Security (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1992). (81.) Balfour is quoted in U.S. Department of State, Conference on the Limitation of Armament, p. 750. (82.) The quotations are both from ibid., p. 594. (83.) Thus the United States pushed for the prohibition at the Washington conference of 1921-22 and the Geneva conference of 1925 even though it recognized that it "would undoubtedly give up a material advantage if gas warfare were abolished." See U.S. Congress, Senate Subcommittee on Disarmament, Disarmament and Security: A Collection of Documents 1919-55. 84th Congress, 2d sess. (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1956), p. 701. (84.) The rise of the society of states is associated with the work of Bull and Watson. See in particular Hedley Bull, The Anarchical Society (New York:
Columbia University Press, 1977); and Hedley Bull and Adam Watson, eds., The Expansion of International Society (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984). (85.) See Gong, The Standard of `Civilization' in International Society. On the history of the questioning and discrediting of the idea of war, see John Mueller, Retreat
from Doomsday: The Obsolescence of Major War (New York: Basic Books, 1989). (86.) Van Creveld, Technology and War, p. 71. (87.) O'Connell, Of Arms and Men. (88.) See, for example, Anthony Eden's impassioned speech reported in the New York Times, 21 April 1936, p. 18. (89.) For example, the U.S. military "denied that there were any lessons to be learned from the use of gas as a weapon of opportunity against a totally unprepared enemy in a colonial war." See Brown, Chemical Warfare, p. 145. For a similar German assessment, see Rolf-Dieter Muller, "World Power Status Through the Use of Poison Gas? German Preparations for Chemical Warfare 1919-1945," in Wilhem Deist, ed., The German Military in the Age of Total War (Warwickshire, England: Berg Publishers, 1985), pp. 171-209. (90.) George Quester,
Deterrence Before Hiroshima (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1986), p. 78. Thus, while reports of
Japan's use of CW against the Chinese were ignored, even the suggestion that CW was being
contemplated in Spain drew preemptory attention from Britain. The use of tear gas by government forces
was reported and the insurgents claimed that they, too, had gas but "refuse to break the international law
which forbids its use." See Times (London), 19 August 1936, p. 10. In response, Britain sent its diplomats to
investigate these allegations and convey the grave consequences that might follow from the use of gas
even in reprisal. See Times (London) 8 September 1936, p. 12. (91.) Mueller, Retreat from Doomsday.
Similarly, Fukuyama has drawn a sharp distinction between the power politics behavior of the Third World
and peaceful relations among industrial democracies - the historical and posthistorical parts of the world.

than race, religion, morality, or other factors - that served as the chief standard by which the West judged
the degree of civilization of other societies. See his exhaustive account in Michael Adas, Machines as the

weapons threatens humanity. Now we are learning that for other, less costly, easier-to-make weapons, far
less sophistication is required, although they may pose a threat approaching the horror of nuclear war and
nuclear arms. That is why some are calling chemical and biological weapons the poor man's atomic bomb."

Yet, even before the destabilization campaign exacted its toll, the hostile stance of the Reagan administration deterred corporate activity by increasing the anticipation of risk. A 1982 Business International study of Nicaragua pointed to positive signs, such as internal stability, minimal labor problems, a good repayment record on debt servicing, and a surprisingly liberal investment code. Its conclusion, however, predicted that "little incoming investment is likely ... until the level of rhetoric between the United States and Nicaragua subsides."(69) These conditions also induced some foreign investors to disengage. Castle and Cooke's September 1982 termination of its banana marketing contract with Nicaragua provides
such an example. The firm cited commercial rather than political reasons for the pullout - i.e., the depressed banana market and the fact that it was losing money.(70) Yet political circumstances play into commercial decisions. If a global firm plans to curtail its overseas operations, prudence dictates that the first cutbacks should be in countries where the risk of politicization is highest. The decision also imposed costs on Nicaragua by forcing it to offer heavy discounts to export bananas outside the established corporate distribution network.(71)

In sum, the Reagan administration was unable to obtain the allegiance of MNCs or exercise regulatory control over their global networks. Banks and investors acted more like private firms responding to opportunities and risks than as instruments of economic warfare. Nonetheless, the state was able to induce corporate disengagement by imposing costs on the Nicaraguan economy and by creating an environment
of severe uncertainty. As a result, it reinforced conditions that discouraged the kind of foreign investment and lending activity that would have been necessary to sustain Nicaraguan economic recovery, particularly during the early years of the revolution. Although it could not directly enlist MNCs and banks as agents of destabilization, the U.S. government could heighten corporate perceptions of risk so that prudent investment strategies achieved the same ends.

Libya
Libya represented a second case where the Reagan administration used sanctions to confront a Third
World government, this time over support for terrorist groups by the regime of Mu'ammar Qaddafi. In pursuit
of this aim, the United States sought to reduce Western economic ties with Libya, with the goal of either
destabilizing the regime or limiting the resources available to it. In pursuit of this strategy, the most
important private actors that Washington tried to influence were the seven American oil companies that
lifted crude oil in joint ventures with the Libyan National Oil Company (LNOC). In July 1981 the United
States advised the companies to remove their American personnel, and in December 1981 it revoked their
passports. In 1982 the Reagan administration boycotted Libyan oil from the American market (then
estimated at 150,000 barrels per day (b/d), and in 1985 it extended the boycott to refined products made
from Libyan crude. Finally, after allegations of Libyan involvement in coordinated terrorist attacks at the
Rome and Vienna airports in January 1986, the U.S. government invoked comprehensive trade sanctions
and ordered American oil companies operating in Libya to depart.(72)

As in the Nicaraguan case, private economic actors initially objected to public preferences and did not want to politicize business ties with Libya. Prior to the imposition of formal sanctions, the oil companies defended their right to stay in Libya to maintain their long-term access to its crude reserves.(73) The companies consequently resisted U.S. advice to withdraw their American staff until they were legally required to do so, at which time they replaced them with foreign technicians.(74) Oil company officials also approached the U.S. State Department on behalf of Qaddafi shortly after the expulsion of the Libyan embassy from Washington in May 1981.(75) Initially, the American oil companies acted less as instruments of U.S. coercive strategies and more as conduits for host state influence by helping Libya earn revenues that augmented its capabilities and making representations on its behalf in the American political system.

In November 1981, however, the Exxon Corporation broke ranks and announced its decision to withdraw from Libya. Despite the coincidence of the announcement with escalating Libyan-U.S. conflict, company officials and industry analysts attributed Exxon's move to commercial rather than political motives - i.e., Libya's high tax rate and its attempt to maintain a high posted price at a time of market surplus.(76) Yet, Exxon's departure was unprecedented. Oil companies generally responded to such policies by redirecting purchasing and production to cheaper sources until the host country provided more reasonable terms. Withdrawal, in contrast, entailed a cost in terms of long-term access to reserves - a cost no other international oil company had accepted in comparable environments. This fact led a number of radical critics to suggest that Exxon's departure was motivated by political, rather than narrow commercial, considerations.(77)

Political considerations, however, cannot easily be disentangled from commercial calculations of risk. For Exxon, a large diversified firm with a strong global position, the loss of Libyan reserves was not that crucial. Conversely, the risks of politicization from future U.S. government sanctions or from public antipathy based on an appearance of bankrolling a terrorist regime were potentially high. The decision also showed considerable foresight since Exxon was able to salvage $95 million in compensation (out of a book value of
$123 million) for its assets.(78) Those companies that stayed in Libya until the 1986 sanctions were invoked were forced to suspend their operations and virtually abandon their assets to the Libyan government.

The only other company to depart voluntarily was Mobil Corporation, another large geographically diversified firm. The remaining companies - Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Oil Company, Amerada Hess, Conoco, and W.R. Grace and Company - were more resistant to U.S. preferences. These "independent" oil companies had fewer alternative sources of crude and placed a higher premium on maintaining access to their Libyan reserves. To some observers, this outcome appeared to foreshadow a repetition of what had happened in the early 1970s. Qaddafi was then able to exploit the same companies' dependence upon Libyan oil to force them to make concessions in pricing, taxation, and ownership that challenged, and ultimately undermined, traditional industry practices.(79)

In contrast, when the companies were ordered to get out of Libya by the 1986 sanctions, they responded that as American companies they would obey U.S. law.(80) The U.S. Treasury Department did give the companies a temporary exemption to allow them to continue their operations and place their profits in escrow until they disposed of their assets. The companies, however, were placed in the position of forced sellers and were unable to find buyers willing to pay an acceptable price. In the end, the Treasury Department allowed them to retain title to their Libyan concessions while LNOC assumed operational control.(81)

What is noteworthy about this example of corporate compliance with public preferences is that the companies refrained from actions that, while profitable and technically legal, would have violated the spirit if not the letter of the sanctions. As in the Nicaraguan case, the Reagan administration chose not to apply the Libyan sanctions to foreign affiliates to "avoid the disruptive conflict that might come from broad extraterritorial application of new controls," in the words of then Secretary of State Shultz.(82) Given the
Page 50 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
unwillingness of the Europeans to follow the U.S. lead, the regulations could not have prevented a
foreign-incorporated subsidiary of one of the departing oil companies from operating its old concession or
buying crude from it as long as no U.S. person was involved in the transaction. The companies, however,
did not take advantage of this right. Moreover, they went beyond the formal requirements of the regulations
and voluntarily prevented their non-U.S. affiliates from buying Libyan crude or having any dealings with
Libya.(83)

This outcome can be understood in terms of the changing perceptions of interest and risk of the so-called independents. The companies were far less dependent on Libyan crude in the 1980s than they were in the
1970s, given the emergence of an oil glut. Moreover, most of these companies had diversified in ways that made them less vulnerable to the loss of Libyan oil. For example, Occidental Petroleum bought Cities Service Oil and Gas Corporation, more than doubling its crude reserves, and expanded production in Peru and the North Sea.(84) Other firms, such as Conoco and Marathon, had themselves been bought by large diversified firms, such as DuPont E.I. De Nemeurs and Company and U.S. Steel, for whom the oil represented a small part of their overall operations.(85)

While the costs of losing access to Libya decreased, the risks of flouting U.S. preferences rose. Given the extreme antipathy toward Libya in American public opinion, a continued association with Libyan oil might have been risky vis-a-vis Congress, shareholders, and customers. It also could have complicated relations with the U.S. government, as noted by Robert Bonczak, a representative of DuPont, the owner of Conoco: "As a widely-diversified firm, we need to maintain a good working relationship with Treasury and State. We're dependent upon them for so many services that it would be stupid to needlessly risk that relationship over maintaining a prerogative that isn't even all that profitable."(86) As a result, the risks of flouting a policy for which there was strong support in the executive branch, the Congress, and the public elicited voluntary home office cooperation in policing its affiliate's behavior.

Outside of the oil companies, another twenty-five to thirty U.S. firms did business with Libya before the embargo. Most of these firms either provided oil-field services or had construction and engineering contracts for several of the large projects Qaddafi initiated during the oil boom. Since the 1986 sanctions
did not apply extraterritorially, these firms legally could do business with Libya through their foreign affiliates as long as no U.S. persons were involved and less than 20 percent of the content of traded goods and technology .originated in the United States. As a result, firms such as Halliburton and Dresser Industries continued their operations through their European offices.(87)

Nonetheless, a U.S. General Accounting Office study found that trade between overseas affiliates and Libya declined by 73.6 percent during the first year of the sanctions, even though these activities were legally unaffected.(88) In part, this was due to voluntary enforcement by the home office for reasons similar to those of the departing oil companies.(89) It was also due to a severe decline in Libya's creditworthiness and its serious arrears to foreign firms - something that has induced a pronounced contraction in European business activity with Libya even though their home governments opposed U.S. sanctions and supported normalized economic relations.(90)

The main reason for this contraction was the dramatic decrease in the world price of oil and the growth of alternative low-sulphur sources in Angola and the North Sea. Libya's oil revenues, which accounted for almost all of its foreign exchange earnings, plummeted from $22 billion in 1980 to $5 billion in 1986, contributing to a severe drain on its capital reserves and an acute shortage of foreign exchange.(91) This foreign exchange shortage not only vitiated relations with the foreign business community but also yielded fewer resources with which Libya could buy arms, support foreign interventions as in Chad, or subsidize like-minded political organizations overseas.

While market forces clearly were the primary cause of Libya's problems, U.S. government actions played a role in amplifying them. In times of market surplus, a captive market with links to a vertically integrated industry provides a measure of security from falling prices.(92) U.S. actions in inducing an oil company withdrawal removed this security by forcing Libya to sell 263,000 b/d outside the integrated multinational network. As a result, Libya was forced to offer steep discounts in competing with Algeria and Nigeria for the sale of its light crudes on the spot market. It consequently had difficulty maintaining its OPEC quota, and an increasing share of its exports comprised barter deals with creditors or with the Soviet Union, which generated no hard currency.(93)

In sum, while the Reagan administration was unable to command affiliate behavior directly, its extreme antipathy toward Libya influenced corporate calculations. As a result, American oil companies voluntarily prevented affiliates from doing business with Libya, thereby making it more difficult for Libya to export its crude during a period of market surplus. This in turn reinforced market conditions that limited the economic resources available to the Qaddafi regime and eroded Libya's creditworthiness to U.S. and foreign firms.
South Africa

The congressional move toward sanctions against South Africa followed the Reagan administration's policy of constructive engagement, which had endorsed cooperation rather than public pressure as the best means of encouraging an evolution away from apartheid.(94) The assumption underlying that strategy of economic statecraft was that economic growth, supported by Western trade and investment, would play a liberalizing role. The policy therefore advised that South Africa be treated as a "normal" state in dealings in the world economy. As a result, the U.S. relaxed restrictions on strategic sales and supported a $1.1 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan in November 1982 to rectify a serious balance-of-payments deficit following a stiff drop in the price of gold.(95)

Beginning in 1983, Congress steadily chipped away at the presumption that South Africa should be treated as a normal state and pushed for the use of economic pressures to force the pace of change. Its first success was a 1983 amendment to the IMF Replenishment Act that instructed the U.S. delegate to the IMF to vote against IMF loans to any country that practices apartheid.(96) In 1985, as the violence in the townships increased and as South Africa declared a state of emergency, the Reagan administration preempted congressional action by imposing its own limited measures, tightening export controls and banning public sector loans.(97) In 1986, Congress overrode a presidential veto and passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA). Its main features were bans on (1) imports of iron, steel, agricultural goods, coal, and uranium; (2) exports of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and nuclear technology; (3) sales of computers to the South African government and anything to the military, police, or what were designated as apartheid-enforcing agencies; and (4) new loans and investments. In theory, Congress replaced constructive engagement with a strategy of tactical linkage; economic normalization would be conditioned on Pretoria's willingness to implement a number of reforms, such as the release of political prisoners, the unbanning of political parties, the abolition of racial laws such as the Group Areas
Act and the Pass Laws, the termination of the state of emergency, and good faith negotiations with representatives of the black majority.(98)

This congressional initiative, however, faced many of the same constraints that had beset previous sanctions efforts. While some European states adopted tighter restrictions, the European Economic Community (EEC) only recommended a ban on new investments and bank loans and generally imposed less comprehensive export controls.(99) Since the CAAA lacked an extraterritorial reach, the United States could not prevent the overseas operations of its corporations and banks from channeling new investments into South Africa through affiliates in nonboycotting countries.(100) MNCs could also have sidestepped the CAAA and sold computers to the South African government or goods and services to apartheid-enforcing agencies through their foreign subsidiaries as long as their U.S.-content was less than 20 percent.(101) Finally, the failure to achieve a multilateral ban on bank lending meant that public officials could not control offshore activities of U.S. banks, particularly lending in syndicates with foreign banks. Nor, given the fungibility of capital, were foreign banks debarred from borrowing from U.S. banks to lend capital to South Africa.(102) In theory, the internationalization of American business and banking limited the ability of Congress to legislate prohibitions on the extension of credit and investment or the sale of strategic goods.

Despite these loopholes, however, much of what U.S. multinationals could have done in theory was not done in practice. First, after mid-1985, South Africa virtually was cut off from world capital markets after a decision by a number of prominent U.S. banks to call in their short-term loans as they came due and freeze unused lines of credit. This led to massive capital flight and a sharp weakening of the rand. In response, on
1 September 1985, South Africa imposed exchange controls and declared a unilateral moratorium on the repayment of its short-term debts to private creditors, placing roughly $14 billion in a standstill net. The end result was that South Africa was cut off from foreign borrowing, without which it faced persistent foreign exchange shortages that threatened its ability to achieve economic growth and political stability.(103)

Second, while some American firms sourced their parts and components in third countries to get around U.S. export controls, many voluntarily made commitments that prevented their South African subsidiaries from taking this route.(104) Moreover, almost no U.S. firms took advantage of the loopholes regarding new investments. Even prior to the sanctions, most firms were retrenching their operations and repatriating capital. The most visible example of this was the disinvestment of over two hundred American firms after the eruption of political violence in 1984. Less visible, but probably more costly, were efforts to cut off new capital flows to affiliates and repatriate capital through transfer pricing and accelerating dividend payments abroad.(105)

On the surface, congressional actions seem peripheral to this outcome when compared with marketplace pressures. The early 1980s witnessed an increase in foreign business activity, particularly lending to the South African private sector, because investors assumed that the economy was strong and that Pretoria was in control of events. These assumptions were called into question by the growing unrest and repression after 1984 and a severe recession brought on by drought, falling gold and diamond prices, and
austerity measures. The political risk consulting firm, Frost Sullivan, consequently ranked South Africa on "a par with some of the higher risk Third World countries."(106)

The banks saw that many of the firms to whom they had lent substantial capital were now running into losses. Moreover, the banks' initial enthusiasm contributed to an unstable debt structure - a doubling of South Africa's debt to $24 billion from 1982 to 1985, with $14 billion due in the next twelve months. As a result, they sought to decrease their exposure in what increasingly seemed like a high credit risk.(107) Similarly, direct investors saw a depressed market for many of the manufactured goods they produced and an uncertain political future. This deterred new investments and induced firms to withdraw capital - particularly during the window of opportunity that existed before the imposition of exchange controls in September 1985.(108)

These marketplace pressures were magnified by the activities of subnational actors. Anti-apartheid groups used shareholder resolutions, consumer boycotts, stock divestments, and protests to place pressures on companies doing business with South Africa. During the 1980s, they persuaded 124 state and local governments in the United States to pass ordinances that conditioned municipal contracts on various forms of corporate withdrawal from South Africa.(109) These actions imposed costs on American firms in terms of executive and board time diverted from more lucrative opportunities or more serious threats. Also, since many firms derived more revenue from municipal contracts than from their operations in South Africa, an increasing number of MNCs were induced to sacrifice what had become a decreasingly profitable and increasingly time-consuming part of their global operations.(110)

Congressional actions also contributed to this process of disengagement. Their most influential impact, however, did not come through the direct exercise of public authority over corporate decision making; rather, it came from augmenting marketplace and nongovernmental pressures in further weakening business confidence.

First, by mandating a negative vote on IMF loans, Congress undermined the presumption that South Africa would be treated as a normal state when confronted with balance-of-payments problems. Future arrangements were now less likely because the 1982 loan required strong U.S. support in overcoming substantial opposition and in circumventing many of the IMF's normal procedures.(111) This outcome had provided the banks a kind of safety net that enabled them to be more confident in expanding their lending until 1985. With the safety net removed, their long-term confidence diminished. As a result, several banks preemptively acted to recover what they could once a crisis be an to emerge.(112)

Second, Congress weakened Pretoria's creditworthiness not only by removing the financial safety net but also by imposing direct costs on the South African economy. While South Africa did find alternative markets and suppliers for sanctioned goods, it could do so only by offering steep discounts on exports, paying high premiums on imports, and spending additional resources for import substitution. One study calculated that the sanctions imposed by the United States and others since 1985 cost the South African economy $550 million per year.(113) Moreover, the possibility of future sanctions deterred many foreign businesses from investing in South Africa's export industries that, given the depreciation of the rand, would have been more competitive.(114) Sanctions, actual and potential, reduced South Africa's export earnings, exacerbating its liquidity problems and compounding the incentives for creditors to lower their exposure to protect their assets.

In the area of debt rescheduling, however, the banks' self-interest in protecting their assets worked at cross-purposes with economic sanctions despite protests from the anti-apartheid movement and many congressional supporters of sanctions. Operating through a former Swiss banker, Fritz Leutwiler, the foreign banking community negotiated three interim accords spreading out the debts owed by South Africa within the standstill net, thereby alleviating some of the financial pressure placed on Pretoria. (115) A
clause in the second of these accords afforded Pretoria more breathing space by allowing banks to convert their short-term loans into long-term 9.5-year loans outside the standstill net where principal payments would not begin until the last 2.5 years. That way, foreign banks would be guaranteed repayment over a longer time frame and would avoid participation in politically contentious negotiations with the South African government. According to one South African business journal, roughly 70 percent of the $2.4 billion owed
by American banks was converted through this device.(116)

This outcome points to a limitation of strategies of economic statecraft that employ inducements rather than commands. The banks remained independent actors whose primary interest was the protection of their assets. Anti-apartheid pressures and economic sanctions reinforced the incentives for the banks to equate that interest with the private credit boycott. On the issue of rescheduling, however, the protection of assets required negotiations with South Africa (117.) Becker, "Economic Sanctions Against South Africa," p. 164. (118.)

Articles 169 and 170 allow for cases to be brought in the Court of Justice against national governments for violating their treaty obligations. Article 171 explicitly states that members must comply with ECJ decisions. Article 177 encourages national courts to request from the ECJ preliminary rulings on the application of European law
to domestic cases. See Treaties Establishing the European Communities (Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 1987). (9.)

Each member government selects one justice; they jointly choose one additional justice. (18.) Cinetheque, 1 CMLR/365 (1986). (19.) The importance the French government attaches to the film industry was demonstrated graphically in the end game to the Uruguay Round. (1.) Anne-Marie Burley and Walter Mattli, "Europe Before the Court: A Political Theory of Legal Integration,"International Organization 47 (Winter 1993), pp. 41-76. (2.) Geoffrey Garrett, "International Cooperation and Institutional Choice: The European Community's Internal Market,"International Organization 46 (Spring 1992), pp. 533-60. The following quotations are drawn from Geoffrey Garrett, "The Politics of Legal Integration in the European Union,"International Organization, this issue. Since that article forms the basis of the present response, it
will subsequently be quoted without further footnote citations. (3.) Garrett continues to insist "that the signatories did choose to create a very powerful legal system" but presents no evidence for this claim. By contrast, the best available account of the negotiations regarding the European Court of Justice indicates that the member states intended the Treaty of Rome to operate like any other international treaty. On this latter point, see Pierre Pescatore, "Les Travaux du 'Groupe Juridique' dans la Negociation des Traites de Rome" (The works of the juridical group in the negotiations of the Treaties of Rome), Studia Diplomatica 34 (1981), pp. 159-92. (4.) Burley and Mattli, "Europe Before the Court," p. 60; see also p. 54, note 60. In his analysis of the Cassis de Dijon case, he extends his earlier reasoning "by arguing that the Court of Justice is also a strategic rational actor. The justices' primary objective is to extend the ambit of European law and their authority to interpret it." For the text of the Cassis de Dijon case, see Case 120/78, Rewe-Zentral AG
v. Bundesmonopolverwaltung fur Branntwein, Preliminary ruling requested by the Hessisches
Finanzgericht, ECR 649 (European Court of Justice, 1979). (5.) Martin Shapiro, Courts: A Comparative and
Political Analysis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981). (6.) As noted above, Garrett's extended
analysis does allow for some variance along the lines suggested by our own study. (7.) Pierre Pescatore,
"The Doctrine of Direct Effect: An Infant Disease of Community Law," European Law Review 8 (June 1983),
pp. 155-77 and p. 157 in particular. (Pescatore served on the ECJ from 1967 to 1986.) Another former
judge of the court concurs: "The Court frequently goes beyond the conceptions which the member states
may have had and sometimes still have, as parties to the Community treaties. As so often, the work is more
belligerent than its creator and goes its own way." See Ulrich Everling, "The Member States of the
European Community Before their Court of Justice," European Law Review 9 (August 1984), pp. 215-41.
The quotation is drawn from p. 217. (8.) Many of the judges we cite acknowledge this point openly. See
Burley and Mattli, "Europe Before the Court," p. 71. (9.) This was Eric Stein's conclusion after reviewing
eleven major cases. See Eric Stein, "Lawyers, Judges, and the Making of a Transnational Constitution,"

178/84, Re Purity Requirements for Beer.- E. C. Commission v. Germany, ECR 1227 (European Court of

imports has increased steadily ever since 1988. See Bundesministerium fur Ernahrung, Landwirtschaft,
Forsten, Statistisches Jahrbuch uber Ernahrung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten (Statistical yearbook on
nutrition, agriculture, and forestry) (Munster-Hiltrup: Landwirtschaftsverlag, 1993), p. 244. (14.) To take only
the most recent study, Alter and Meunier-Aitsahalia find that "Germany and France have been the strongest
opponents of mutual recognition because, being high standard countries, they have the most to lose." See

THE Far Eastern Freight Conference  (FEFC) has hit out at the  European Commission for failing to notify it of the decision to ban the conference from  fixing  multimodal tariffs.

TD
FEFC director general Patrick Giles said it was "absolutely disgraceful" that the press should be told of the commission's decision but that the defendant had yet to be formally notified.
The EC decided on December 21 to press ahead with reforming traditional  liner practices by banning the
FEFC, and subsequently all other conferences, from charging conference tariffs on the inland leg into
and out of European ports.

The action was accompanied by symbolic  fines of Ecu10,000 against the FEFC lines involved as well as a harsh warning that all carriers have three months in which to comply with the rules or face more severe fines.
Mr Giles said only four of the 13 FEFC member lines affected had received correspondence from
Brussels. It consisted of a two-page facsimile detailing the level of  fines and the articles infringed.

He added: "It really is extraordinary that the first thing we hear of the commission decision is when the press ring up asking for our comments. What must be noted is that many of the affected lines are Asian and to the best of our knowledge they have still to be notified."

Lawyers acting for the FEFC cannot apply for a suspension order until the conference has been formally notified of the EC decision. They then have two months to seek a suspension of the ban.

Meanwhile, other conferences visiting European ports have pledged to continue charging multimodal rates pending the results of an FEFC appeal. But a number of conferences said they were preparing for the possibility they might have to alter their tariffs on the inland leg. One argued the ban would affect smaller carriers more than larger operators as they lacked the necessary inland transport infrastructure to mount their own haulage operations.

Smaller carriers are also convinced they will suffer from the EC's proposed draft regulations on consortia which, according to European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert, will be adopted in March or April.

Lawyers acting for member lines of the former Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) confirmed they have filed two applications for suspension at the European Court of First Instance (CFI). They relate to the EC's decision last year to ban the TAA and its December ruling prohibiting carriers from  fixing  multimodal rates.

From Sean Moloney,  Shipping Correspondent, Brussels

THE European Shippers' Councils (ESC) has been asked by the  European Commission to help it assess applications from  liner carriers seeking individual exemption from competition rules banning conferences from  fixing  multimodal rates.

TD
Henrik Baasch, ESC secretary general, said his organisation would be offering its opinion on applications for individual exemption as part of the commission's consultative process. He said work would not start until applications had been received.

The move follows the December decision by the  European Commission to ban member lines of the Far Eastern Freight Conference,  and subsequently all other conference carriers, from charging conference tariffs on the inland leg.

The commission's competition directorate indicated that carriers could apply for individual exemption if they could show they operated joint transport services on the inland leg.

Mr Baasch said he was unsure exactly what the commission wanted from the ESC. "But we will study whether there is a real involvement by the carriers in jointly producing transport services or whether they are just involved in price  fixing"  he added.

The majority of conference lines operating into and out of European ports have already indicated they will wait for the outcome of an appeal by the FEFC against the commission decision before applying for individual exemption.

Because of the threat of heavy  fines against lines choosing to continue charging conference tariffs on the inland leg, applications for individual exemption are expected to be signficiant.
Mr Baasch said the ESC would shy away from getting directly involved in the details of the applications. Alfonse Guinier, secretary general of the European Community Shipowners' Association (ECSA) said he
was surprised by the commission's actions but added that if it agreed to grant an application for
individual exemption the decision would be published in the official journal to which everyone had the
right to react.
He said the commission had its procedures and could consult whoever it wanted to. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1995.
