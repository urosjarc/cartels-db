LP
U.S. workers often gaze longingly at labor policies enacted across the Atlantic, especially in Sweden, a democratic socialist mecca. But all 15 European Union countries, including Sweden, offer a cautionary tale for those hoping paid family leave policies and a shorter work week will both help overworked parents and enhance women's position in the labor force.

In Europe, working mothers piece together their own solutions to the work/family dilemma based in part on national work time and family leave policies that are generous by U.S. standards. But these important policies seem to be reinforcing sex segregation of jobs as men fail to take advantage of them. Women, meanwhile, are finding it easiest to work part-time or take extended leaves, surrendering better-paying
full-time jobs once they become mothers. This solution offers few answers for women supporting families on their own, who need full-time wages and time for family responsibilities.

TD
Even worse, European women have been thrust into the center of a classic clash over work time between a male-led labor movement and management. Unions and employers in Germany and elsewhere are agreeing to work reorganization policies that limit the official work week while increasing overtime. Men have the social backing to stay late at the job or deal with increasingly erratic work schedules. But married women, with their socially supported commitment to their families, are pushed even further into the
part-time workforce.

That's why European feminists urge work redistribution schemes that combine a shorter work week with shared responsibility for work in the home. This approach offers more promise than policies implicitly or explicitly promoting overtime for men and part-time work for women. In particular, working women want a shorter work day, not "flexible scheduling" of the work week if that means unpredictable work hours or working four long, 10-hour days. But even far-sighted Sweden chose to emphasize family leave policies over shorter work days to solve the time crunch. And now that the debate over working time has moved to the level of European Union institutions, feminist proposals aimed at promoting gender equity once again are being eclipsed.
FAMILY LEAVE IN SWEDEN

Sweden is the poster child of alternative work schedules, including the shorter work week. Its family leave policy is one of the most generous in the world, allowing parents 18 months off - paid. Historically Sweden has been a leader in women's employment trends: Swedish women first entered the trades and sales occupations as early as 1810. In 1845 they secured the right to inherit property. Laws limiting married women from working were dropped in 1938. By the 1980s, the percentage of men and women in the labor force was almost identical.

In most EU countries, unions took the lead in backing shorter work weeks as a way to generate more jobs and reduce Europe's persistently high unemployment. In Sweden, gender equity, rather than job creation, has been central to the shorter work week movement. In the 1970s, the women's divisions of both the
trade union federation and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) backed a six-hour day and 30-hour week for both men and women, explicitly as ways of achieving gender equity. Everybody - men, women, fathers
and mothers - would work less. It was an attempt to thwart the traditional path of women who commonly reduce their ties to the labor market when they become mothers. The SDP's women's division has been leading the charge for this policy ever since.

Despite this support, both the SDP and nonsocialist governments chose to expand parental leave as a means of encouraging women's participation in the labor force. They paid little attention to proposals to reduce the workweek. In 1974, the Swedish government began offering paid leave for the birth or sickness of a child, gradually extending the available leave time from six to 18 months. The government replaces
the lost paycheck in full for a parent on leave in a two-earner household, while single earner households receive a low, flat rate. The policy encourages more women to join the labor force at least part-time because it does not require both parents to work full-time to receive the higher benefit.

In 1979, Sweden broadened its parental leave policies, allowing parents to shorten their daily hours (with a corresponding reduction in pay) until their child is ten to twelve years old. Despite the gender-neutral wording of the law and efforts encouraging men to take advantage of it, only 6% of leave-takers are men,
a figure that has remained unchanged for 15 years. And women tend to take the full time allowed, while men use it for a much shorter time.

Encouraged by these policies, women in Sweden primarily use part-time jobs to balance work and family responsibilities. In the end, most Swedish women become part-time employees after their first child is born. Even women working in male-dominated fields tend to shift into part-time, dead-end jobs in
female-dominated sectors once they become mothers. This way they avoid the penalties and discrimination that arise if they take leaves from their nontraditional jobs.

Many feminists support family leave and shorter hours for both parents as ways to maintain women's connection to paid work over their lifetime. Yet generous parental leave policies seem only to have reinforced women's occupational segregation in Sweden, which is worse than in many other European countries. Swedish policies have given women significant gains for their home life, but remain a mixed blessing at work.
SHORTER HOURS FOR ALL?

While Sweden accommodated traditional gender roles by emphasizing family leave, feminist-backed shorter work week policies try to change the "male model" of full-time employment. From this point of view, the only way to achieve gender equity in the workplace - and home - in the long run is to reduce the
number of hours in everybody's standard work week. This is a position increasingly heard in countries with high proportions of women working part-time, not just Sweden, but the Netherlands and Germany as well.

The Social Democratic Union of Swedish Women was a pioneer of this position in the 1970s. Ylva Ericsson, a former staffer, pointed out that "... if everybody gainfully employed today were to work the same amount of time, Sweden would have a work week of just under thirty hours." The Dutch
Emancipation Council, along with activists in the women's movement there, endorsed a shorter work week in 1989. In 1992, Frank Boddendijk, a member of the Dutch Council, claimed, "As long as men still have
full-time jobs and women only part-time jobs, there will be no real equality, since in that case women have the full responsibility for domestic labour, including child care." You hear the same perspective from Friederike Maier,a consultant on women's issues to the  European Commission.

Despite these feminist voices, gender equity has not been the driving force behind efforts to shorten the standard work week in Europe. Spearheaded by the European Trade Union Confederation, unions argued that a shorter work week would force employers to hire more workers; the goal was to share and redistribute employment, even if those with jobs had to sacrifice some income.

The first real breakthrough came in 1984, when a major industrial action by Germany's largest union, IG Metall, forced  Volkswagen and other employers to reduce the work week from 40 hours to 38.5 hours in the male-dominated industries of printing and metalworking. This standard was extended to other sectors of the economy in 1985 and 1986. In 1987, IG Metall won a further cut to 37 hours by 1989; other industries again followed suit.
Inspired by these successes, British unions began to press for a 35-hour work week in 1989. By March
1990, over 50 companies, including British Aerospace and Rolls Royce, agreed to a enact a 37-hour work
week.

That Germany gave rise to the strongest working time movement is not surprising. Germany has strong, centralized collective bargaining. Policies initiated by key unions tend to set standards for other workers. That the movement originated in male-dominated industries sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy is also not surprising. Working women have been more sheltered from the brunt of unemployment because they work largely in the service sector, where jobs are growing.

There's no fairy tale ending to these campaigns. What began in the 80's as a drive by unions to reduce working hours has been usurped in the 90's by employers seeking to improve competitiveness through "flexibility." Employers have won the right to shift schedules of workers at will and demand overtime, even as the official full-time work week becomes shorter. Flexibility will solve Europe's unemployment problem,

employers claim, by enabling them to be more responsive to changes in demand for their products. They could increase the pace of work when demand is up, and ask for fewer hours from their workers when demand is down. The freedom employers have in setting hours in the United States, they say, is one of
the reasons unemployment has dropped here. While the United States requires employers to pay overtime for wage workers working over 40 hours per week, in continental Europe (though not the United Kingdom) the limits on overtime have been stricter. European countries - including Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden - should not restrict the amount of overtime that can be taken on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, the employers insist. Nor
should these countries require that employers give workers time off in exchange for overtime.

Along with expanded overtime, employers and policymakers are selling part-time work to women workers. "Over a short period of time, part-time work has been transformed from the Cinderella in the kitchens of
the labour force to the Prince Charming of new employment initiatives," say Ursula Barry and Pauline Jackson, two feminist writers from Northern Ireland. Part-time jobs do hold appeal for many working women. A Eurostat press release put an optimistic spin on the findings of their Labour Force Survey, headlining that "16% of EU Workers are Part-Time; Most are happy that way." But part-time work also suits employers' desire to adjust hours of work and hold down wage costs. Unfortunately, as long as men are pressured to work long hours and cannot participate equally in child care and domestic chores, women's desire to work part-time is not truly voluntary. They also will continue to take on most of the housework.
DIRECTIVES FROM EUROPE

In 1993, the Brussels-based European Union adopted a directive for its members to reduce the length of the work week and allow businesses to summon more overtime. This Directive on Working Time is silent on gender issues - at least on the surface. But by facilitating overtime, without dealing with issues of
part-time employment (that will be in a separate directive), it reinforces the same division between male and female workers as did the national initiatives.

The Directive on Working Time is the result of efforts to harmonize employment conditions in EU countries and create a unified market. Constructing the policy was extremely controversial. Not only did the agendas of unions and employers differ, the governments of member countries had strong opinions on what the policy should look like. The British government, for instance, staunchly opposed any mandate regulating working time.

EU countries finally reached a compromise in 1992, after two years of discussion. To permit passage by a qualified majority (rather than unanimity) of the Council of Ministers under European Union rules, the directive was categorized as a health and safety issue. It established health and safety standards for the organization of working time, including minimum periods of daily rest, weekly rest, and annual leave; breaks; and maximum weekly working time. The Directive also addresses night work, shift work, and other work patterns.

Employer organizations managed to include provisions undermining what have been strong institutional constraints on overtime throughout the European continent. They won the flexibility in soliciting overtime they long sought. The cornerstone of their efforts was the so-called "annualization of hours." This policy - captured in "Article 6" - allows employees to work overtime so long as their weekly hours add up to a national standard that is no more than 48 hours, but averaged over a four month time period. That period is potentially expandable to six months. Moreover, the  fine print of the directive allows member
governments to permit employers to negotiate time periods of as much as twelve months - "annualization." Finally, member states have the option to ignore Article 6 completely, as long as they ensure that workers have acquiesced to the excess overtime in advance and employers do not subject a worker "to any detriment" for refusing long hours.

Negotiations for a European directive protecting part-time and other "atypical" workers - often women - finally reopened in 1996 after languishing for two decades following objections by the British and German governments. By June 1997, representatives of labor, employers, and European governmental institutions devised a tentative proposal. It would prohibit discrimination against part-time workers, giving them the same rights to training, holidays, and social security benefits as full-time workers. Emilio Gabaglio, President of the European Trade Union Confederation, hailed the agreement as guaranteeing "that
part-timers can no longer be treated as second-class workers."

European feminists attribute unions' new defense of part-time workers to their desire to recruit them as members. It's a defensive tactic initiated after a long period of hostility. Kea Tijdens, a Dutch feminist economist, compares the shift to unions' sudden support of equal pay for equal work earlier in this century. Then too, unions wanted to prevent employers from replacing their male members with cheaper female workers. Gender equity was and is not their primary concern.

THE VIEW FROM THE MEMBER STATES
The European Union's 15 members enjoy considerable leeway in how they implement these EU
directives. They need only stay within the standards set out in the directive. Despite this leeway, in country
after country, observers are noting a similar trade-off. Unions are giving in to employers' desire for
flexibility in exchange for work redistribution policies that save jobs. As part of this compromise, unions are
accepting the expansion of both part-time and overtime work, giving control over work schedules to
employers rather than individual employees and their representatives.

This compromise only reinforces a Europe in which gender roles are defined not by whether a man or woman has a job, but by the amount of time men and women spend on the job. Almost one of three working women in the European Union works part-time, compared with only one of 20 men. Male workers spend more time at their jobs than women (see graph). The difference is greatest in the United Kingdom, where men's overtime is firmly established. It is also high in the Netherlands, where the majority of women work part-time. The gap is narrowest in Finland, Austria, and the southern European countries. Southern Europe generally has a more traditional gender division of labor; the relatively fewer women in the labor force are ones most in need of full-time jobs, such as the unmarried or poor. In twelve of the fifteen countries, men work over forty hours per week. Although men's usual weekly hours are less than the
newly-legislated 48-hour threshold, overtime is concentrated in male dominated sectors such as manufacturing.

Increasingly, feminist and labor activists are accepting attempts to cushion rather than fight the expanding number of part-time jobs. They argue that upgrading the working conditions of part-time workers will concretely improve the lives of European working women. However, the proliferation of part-time work and overtime still encourages individual solutions to the problems of balancing work and family. As European countries adhere to the patterns established in the U.S. and U.K., new obstacles are being created to women's full and equitable integration into the workforce and men's sharing of domestic labor.

Public policy provides only a partial solution. Working women must demand that male members of their households contribute to the work of raising families, as well as pressure policymakers and employers. Unless that is done, there is no assurance that shortening paid work time for all will succeed in redistributing work between men and women.
RELATED ARTICLE: GERMANY vs. FRANCE

While Germany and France have very different histories in reducing the workweek and allowing flexible work schedules, they have ended up with similar gaps in men and women's work time. Men work an average of about 41 hours a week in both countries, and women work an average of about 33 hours a week in Germany and 35 hours a week in France.

Work time was reduced in Germany due to unions' bargaining, while in France work time was reduced due to government legislation. And while France has historically pressured EU institutions to incorporate policies in pursuit of gender equality, Germany lagged in this area.
The German union IG Metall negotiated a 1993 bargaining agreement with  Volkswagen for a four-day,
28.8-hour week with a 20% cut in earnings. An industry-wide agreement in 1994 implemented a 30-hour
week, also with a cut in pay. In exchange for shorter hours, the union conceded to employer demands for
greater flexibility in organizing working time. Employers won the right to negotiate hours on a
company-level based on firm and even individual plant needs - a radical departure from the traditional
practice of negotiating hours in an entire sector. Other employers followed suit. The result has been
increased overtime and weekend work (for men) and part-time jobs (for women).

France implemented the EU's Working Time Directive using a five-year plan, commonly called the Robien law, passed in December 1993. The French program includes direct government subsidies to employers to encourage worksharing, and the "annualization" of hours. Government assistance goes to employers who reduce work time (along with pay) by at least 15%, hire new employees to make up the work, and maintain the same size workforce for three years. After the Socialist Party, in coalition with other leftists, won a parliamentary victory in last June's elections, the French government newly committed itself to the goal of a 35-hour workweek. In October, a National Conference on Employment devised a proposal for parliament to consider.

France has pursued these policies entirely separately from its five-year program "in favor of family life" that will be fully implemented by 1999. This law aims to "achieve a better reconciliation between family and working life through a reorganization of parents' working time." Most of its measures follow the Swedish model of encouraging, through subsidies, part-time employment for parents of young children. It also permits the parent of a sick child to take leave or to shift to part-time employment for 6 months to one year.

VOLKSWAGEN faces fines from the European Commission for flouting European Union competition and single market rules. The German carmaker stands accused of refusing to sell to customers from outside Italy from dealerships there.

An EU source said the commission will act on the Italian case in the next few weeks. The commission has the power to  fine the company up to 10% of annual turnover, although, in practice,  fines are usually well below that ceiling.

TD
European carmakers have been given special permission under EU law to run exclusive distribution systems on the condition that they don't prevent individuals from crossing borders to buy cars. The commission began investigating  Volkswagen in 1995 after receiving complaints from consumers in Germany, France and Austria, who were seeking to take advantage of the fall in the Italian lira. - Julie Wolf in Brussels.

By the end of January, the European Commission is expected to take a Decision which could lead to a massive fine being imposed on Volkswagen and withdrawal of the German car maker's right to operate an exclusive dealer network, EU and trade sources indicated on January 6. Commission competition experts have for a long time been looking into allegations that VW is forcing its tied dealers in Italy and Austria to refuse to sell new models to German nationals who cross the border looking for bargains. Prices up to 30% cheaper than those charged in German showrooms can be obtained in these neighbouring countries by determined bargain-hunters from the Federal Republic, a trend which VW is allegedly trying to block
through a set national sales policy that breaches Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty. In 1996, Commission investigators raided  Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg and carried off documents detailing the company's policies and its arrangements with national dealerships.

TD
As European Report went to press on January 6, German TV station ARD also announced that its current affairs programme Plusminus would provide details during an evening broadcast of similar cases involving VW dealers in Denmark and the Netherlands. Article 85 of the EC Treaty basically forbids collusive arrangements which restrain competition, but also provides for the Commission to grant exemptions for car distribution and other vertical retailing agreements - such as the one currently enjoyed by  Volkswagen.

VOLKSWAGEN WILL BE PENALIZED FOR REFUSING CAR SALES IN ITALY TO AUSTRIAN AND GERMAN CUSTOMERS.

Brussels, 07/01/1998 (Agence Europe) - The  European Commission is expected to be deciding soon to impose fines on the Volkswagen group in reaction to an abusive and discriminatory refusal to allow certain car sales in Italy, a case that came to light in 1995. The Community's antitrust services have evidence that Austrian and German citizens interested in buying VW or Audi cars at a lower cost in Italy have met with categorical refusals, on the instructions of the German group. The Commission could even, as a penalty for these actions, withdraw  Volkswagen's entitlement to benefit from the regulation authorizing "exclusive distribution" in the car sector.

Volkswagen is also mentioned in another case concerning Denmark and the Netherlands, being handled in a separate procedure.

DEUTSCHE Telekom's plans to levy charges on customers switching to a rival company could face European Commission scrutiny. A spokesman for Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said that although no complaint had yet been lodged over the 95 mark (48 ecu) charge for household customers changing operator and 53 marks (26.9 ecu) if they wished to keep the same telephone number, the Commission might intervene in any event.

GERMAN carmaker  Volkswagen faces a fresh round of Commission scrutiny after German, French and Austrian customers complained they were not allowed to take advantage of cheaper prices at Italian distributor Autogerma. Press reports also allege that VW is blocking German customers from buying cars in Denmark and the Netherlands, where prices before tax can be up to 30% cheaper than in their home country. If the Commission finds the company has acted illegally, it could face hefty  fines. This comes weeks after the Commission ended a row with VW and the German authorities over state aids paid to the firm.

A POLL of Belgian managers showed that over four-fifths now believe the single currency will be launched on time on 1 January 1999. The survey by Belgian daily paper L'Echo found that 39% of the managers thought that the launch of the euro on time was "truly certain", while 48% thought it was "probable".

THE Commission has approved a move by German cash-and-carry company Metro to increase to 100% its share holding in Dutch cash-and-carry firm Makro. Although both firms are active in the same sector, the Commission said the two operated in different countries and that the move did not lead to any additional market power nationally.

GREECE presented a draft 1998 tax bill this week, which it hopes will see its 1998 budget deficit fall to a projected 2.4% of gross domestic product from an estimated 4.2% in 1997. Hitting this target would
mean that the country would meet the fiscal criterion for the single currency. The bill also introduces 12 new taxes, including a 0.03% tax on stock sales, an incentive in the withholding tax on interest income from state debt paper and new presumptive taxes on a host of items.

SCRUTINY of transatlantic airline alliances has been widened with the Commission's decision to examine the separate partnership agreements between Air France and US carriers Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines. Air France intends to deepen the partnerships to cover more than code and revenue sharing and loyalty programmes at a later stage. Competition officials are already examining six other transatlantic partnerships, but have still to rule on any of them.

HD         EU lawsuits leave Britain  unscathed. BY          By Martin Walker.

The 'reluctant' European is one of the most amenable, Martin Walker writes in Brussels
France leads the unusually long list of offenders, with four separate complaints

TD
A BLIZZARD of lawsuits and formal complaints filed this week by the  European Commission against most member states, on issues ranging from water standards to French discrimination against foreign modelling agencies, left a law-abiding Britain untouched.

Britain's immunity happily coincided with the launch of its presidency of the EU, the full Commission holding meetings with the Government in London yesterday.

France led the unusually long list of offenders, with four separate complaints to enforce the Commission's rules on pollution, free movement of labour and the single market. Belgium and Italy received three each.

The Commission uses a long and complex procedure against members thought to be breaching EU rules, designed to reach a settlement before the ultimate step of taking the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Despite Britain's reputation as the reluctant European, it emerges from the latest European Court of Justice statistics as one of the most law-abiding members, the subject of only one of the 93 legal actions brought by the Commission against members in 1996.

There were 20 actions against Belgium, 17 against Greece, 11 against France, and nine each against Italy, Germany and Spain. There were no lawsuits filed against Finland, Sweden or Denmark, which like Britain have good records of observance of EU directives.

The complaints against France relate to failure to report its monitoring of ozone levels, blockage of German plastic waste shipments, food-processing rules which discriminate against exports from other EU countries, and its requirement for new modelling agencies to deposit more than #10,000 with the French authorities - "an infringement of the provision for freedom of trade in services".

The Commission dropped another case against France this week, for failing to classify the Loire estuary as a special nature protection area, after it agreed to extend the boundaries to include bird sanctuaries.

Although the EU remains some way from fulfilling that notorious forecast of the former Commission president Jacques Delors that 80% of legislation would soon come from Brussels, the range of the Commission's authority is now vast.

This week it decided to call in Air France's proposed alliances with Delta and Continental airlines, to make sure they followed competition rules.

It brought a legal case against Italy's idiosyncratic weights and measures system, and warned Greece to change its laws on the sale of pesticides to prevent discrimination against other EU exporters.

Page 13 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The burst of legal activity included actions against Italy and the Netherlands for failing to file plans to deal with agricultural nitrates in ground water, against Spain and Portugal for failings in waste-water treatment, and against Belgium for being 12 years late in observing quality standards in bathing waters.

Spain, Portugal and Greece were also hit for failing to open their public procurement contracts to EU competition. Greece could face  fines after failing to comply with a 1996 ruling on the matter by the Court of Justice.

And Volkswagen faces fines for refusing to sell its cars through Italian dealers, whose prices are lower, to German and Austrian nationals.
The flood of lawsuits on competition and procurement should ebb soon since most of them stem from
100-plus directives issued in 1990 and 1991, a number which fell to just 16 last year. But environmental
lawsuits look likely to replace them.

BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (AFP) -  Volkswagen faces big fines from the European Commission next Wednesday for having forced its Italian dealers not to sell its cars to Germans and Austrians, European sources said on Saturday.

They said that the German automaker would be punished with hefty  fines that would reflect the seriousness of the offence under the European Union's common-market principles, which state that consumers can buy whatever they want, wherever they want within the EU, at whatever price they can find.

TD
Volkswagen's offences go back to 1993, but only drew the attention of  European Commission investigators in November 1995, when Germans and Austrians complained of having trouble buying Volkswagens in Italy, where the weaker lira made the cars cheaper.

Volkswagen tried to hit back by instructing its Italian dealers to halt sales to Germans and Austrians, despite the fact that such cross-border value hunting has been commonplace among European car buyers for some time.

Evidence against the automaker is "indisputable," sources said, as it includes written instructions to regional distributors that were passed on to dealers.

The latter responded not by flatly refusing to sell cars to Germans and Austrians, but rather by imposing conditions that would make them give up their buying intentions.

HD        FOCUS-EU to fine VW over Italian sales practices. BY         By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to hit German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VW) hard on Wednesday for barring its Italian distributor from selling to German and Austrian residents.

Volkswagen, Europe's largest car manufacturer, was expected to be  fined "well over 100 million marks" ($56 million), a source close to the investigation said on Monday.

TD
If confirmed -- the Commission still has to decide the final amount -- it would be the biggest  fine ever imposed by the Commission on a single company.

The Commission is to announce the size of the  fine on Wednesday.  Volkswagen had no immediate reaction.

Under European Union rules, car manufacturers are allowed to operate exclusive networks of authorised dealers which are allocated separate distribution territories.

The rules were modified in 1995 to allow dealers to sell to individuals, or companies acting on behalf of individuals, seeking to take advantage of price differences within the 15-nation EU single market.

Pre-tax prices for cars vary more than 30 percent in the EU, according to the Commission's biannual report on the issue released in July.

EU single market rules allow customers to buy their car wherever it is the cheapest and pay taxes in the country of importation.

The Commission raided some of the German carmaker's offices a few years ago after German and Austrian residents complained  Volkswagen's Italian distributor Autogerma had refused to sell them a Volkswagen car, or one made by the company's Audi unit.

The source said the Commission had found "devastating" evidence this had been the case, hence the record fine aimed at punishing  Volkswagen for the length and gravity of the alleged infringement. It was also designed to act as a deterrent to similar practices in other EU states involving VW or other manufacturers, the source said.

"(Volkswagen's) practice has been going on for 10 years and was aggravated since 1993," said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

About a year ago, the Commission also carried out surprise checks on Mercedes and the Adam Opel subsidiary of General Motors Corp. The results of those checks have not been made public.

The Commission is also conducting a separate investigation into problems met by residents of Germany when trying to buy cars in Denmark where pre-tax prices are among the lowest in Europe.
In 1997, it  fined Irish Sugar 8.8 million ecu ($9.7 million) for hindering imports of sugar from other EU
countries and in 1996 it penalised German chemical giant Bayer for restricting sales of a popular heart

-- The European Commission is expected to impose heavy  fines on Volkswagen AG on Wednesday for forcing its Italian dealers not to sell to Germans and Austrians. According to unnamed sources, the evidence against VW is "indisputable", and includes written instructions to regional distributors that were passed to dealers (International Herald Tribune p13)

-- Spanish coalminers' unions have agreed to a provisional deal which goes some way to meeting Commission demands for production cuts. The original proposals had caused strikes, but under the new deal the government will offset the cuts with 1,000 new hirings, mainly in the mining industry (FT p2)

-- The Commission has announced proposals to enable communities to cut unhealthy noise pollution levels through a system of labelling offending equipment. Labelling rules could be followed up by maps, on which local authorities would have to pinpoint the worst affected areas. The British government has expressed interest in the proposals (FT p2)

-- The Commission has cleared a proposed global television alliance between Dow Jones and NBC, the U.S.-based television station owned by General Electric. The alliance would result in the merger of the two companies' European and Asian business channels, with Dow Jones' European service being replaced by a jointly-owned CNBC service to be launched in early 1998. The European channel will be available to 15m homes full-time and 50m homes part-time (WSJE p2)
-- The Commission has opened an inquiry into a proposed digital television merger between Kirch
Group and Bertelsmann, on the grounds that the combined company may raise competition concerns in
Germany. Kirch released a statement saying it "welcomed" the probe, as it would enable the group to
start a dialogue with the Commission, but it added it hoped the audit would not last the full four months
allowed for such reviews (WSJE p7)

-- A newly formed right-wing German political party said on Sunday it would campaign in September's election on an anti-European, anti-immigrant ticket. The Alliance of Free Citizens has about 2,000 members (International Herald Tribune p2)<
BRITAIN

-- British regions may lose out because of draft proposals from the Commission to cut the number of regions receiving EU aid and change the criteria for granting it. The proposals, for the period
2000-2006, would mean regions which currently qualify for aid because they require "structural adjustment" after the decline of their industries, would lose the EU support because their unemployment rate is well below the EU average (The Guardian p16)

-- Rentokil chief executive and president-elect of the Confederation of British Industry Sir Clive Thompson, said on Sunday that membership of a European single currency would be positive for Britain. In an interview with CNN, he said the single currency represented "the opportunity for stability, the opportunity for lower interest rates, which in means growth in markets, growth in levels of employment" (The Independent p18)

-- The British government will appoint a team of linguists and European tax experts to means-test thousands of EU students preparing for undergraduate courses in Britain to establish whether they are eligible to pay the new 1,000 stg tuition fees (The Guardian p6)

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - German automaker  Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary may be  fined at least 100 million marks ($56 million) for violating European Union fair trade rules, officials said Monday.

The European Commission is to rule Wednesday on charges that VW prevented its Italian dealers from selling to clients from outside Italy who looked for cheaper cars than those on sale in their own countries.

TD
Under EU rules, consumers have the right to shop for the best buy anywhere in the 15-nation EU.

Under EU competition rules, the Commission has powers to  fine a company the size of VW up to 10 percent of its global sales.

The German weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported Monday the  fine could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.

An official close to the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if a  fine is imposed it will exceed 100 million marks.

VW could also lose the benefits of EU antitrust exemptions that enable car makers to sign contracts tying distributors and dealers to a single manufacturer. If that exemption goes, VW and Audi dealers will be free to stock other brands.

EU antitrust regulators began investigating VW's Italian dealerships in 1995 after German, Austrian and French consumers complained dealers there refused to sell to them.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission is expected to  fine Volkswagen AG on Wednesday for allegedly breaking European Union competition rules that guarantee citizens the right to purchase cars outside their home country.

The fine, which won't be set until just before the commission's weekly meeting Wednesday, is likely to total 100 million European currency units ($109.3 million) or more, EU officials said.

TD
Following the commission's move, the company's Italian operations will no longer benefit automatically from an antitrust exemption allowing European car makers to operate exclusive distribution networks, the officials said. That exemption, which runs until Sept. 30, 2002, specifically obliges car makers to allow cross-border auto purchases by individuals or their agents.

The commission accuses VW and its Audi subsidiary of instructing their dealers in Italy not to sell to customers from outside the country. The commission's case is based on documents found during raids in late 1995 of the two companies' offices and dealerships in Italy, according to one EU official. The
raids came after the commission received complaints from consumers in Germany, France and Austria, who were seeking to buy their cars in Italy to take advantage of the fall in the Italian lira.

Recently, there have been similar complaints against other car makers, and the commission is likely to point to the  fine as a sign that it is cracking down on those who don't abide by the terms of the antitrust exemption.

The commission's  fine will open the way to legal challenges of the VW and Audi distribution system in Italy, the EU official said. In practice, this could free dealers in Italy from the requirement that they sell only Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, he added. It's unclear, however, whether dealers will try to opt out of the system.

EU consumers increasingly are looking outside their own country to take advantage of car-price differences, which can be greater than 40%. While some of these gaps are due to currency fluctuations, European consumer groups accuse the car makers of using the exclusive distribution systems to
cordon off national markets and reduce competition.

But European auto makers blame the variety of prices found in the EU to differing local conditions, including taxation, currency levels and consumer habits.

Consumers, car makers and the commission all agree that the creation of a true single market in cars has been hampered by currency turmoil. The EU's planned economic and monetary union next year will put an end to such fluctuations, although not all of the EU's 15 member states are due to adopt the single currency.

BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to  fine German car maker Volkswagen around 200 million marks on Wednesday over alleged anti-competitive distribution practices in Italy, EU sources said on Tuesday.

The final amounts will be decided at the Commission's weekly meeting on Wednesday, but an advisory committee of EU national antitrust experts agreed with the draft proposal on Monday, the sources said.

TD
The Commission has been investigating for several years allegations that the Italian distributor for
Volkswagen and its Audi unit refused to sell cars to residents in neighbouring Germany and Austria.
The Commission found "devastating" evidence that this was happening during raids on  Volkswagen
several years ago, the sources said.

Under EU rules, car manufacturers are allowed to operate exclusive distribution networks but cannot ban individuals or companies acting on their behalf from buying cars wherever it is cheapest in
15-nation EU.

BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to punish  Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, on Wednesday for preventing consumers in the European Union from taking advantage of cheaper car prices in the 15-nation bloc.

EU sources expected the German company to be  fined around 200 million marks ($112 million) for allegedly instructing its Italian distributor Autogerma not to sell to residents in neighbouring Germany and Austria.

TD
The final amount was expected to be the subject of grim discussions at the Commission's weekly meeting on Wednesday. The  fine will be set in European currency units, the bloc's basket currency which is worth slightly over a U.S. dollar.

European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and possibly others were expected to argue the fine was out of proportion with the alleged offence. Bangemann has in the past sprung to the defence of the automobile sector against his competition counterpart Karel Van Miert,

If confirmed, the proposed  fine would be the largest imposed by the Commission on a single company since it levied 75 million Ecus ($82.6 million) from Swedish carton maker Tetra Pak in 1991. That  fine was to punish Tetra Pak for bullying rivals and slashing prices to control the market for over a decade.

Volkswagen stands accused of restrictive trade practices for more than 10 years.

The Commission sees the offence as all the more serious because the 1993 creation of the EU's single market allows Europeans to shop around for the cheapest price of what is often their most significant single purchase after a house.
Pre-tax car prices can vary more than 30 percent from one EU country to the other, according to a
Commission report released in July.

Under EU single market rules, a German consumer, for example, can buy a car in the Netherlands, where last year's prices were considerably cheaper than in his own country, and pay Value Added Tax in Germany.

Italy was comparatively cheap in recent years after the devaluation of the lira in 1992 -- a point that may still help VW win some EU compassion -- although the lira has since strengthened against the mark.
"Some argue that currency devaluations should count as mitigating circumstances," one source said. However, chances the proposed  fine will be reduced are slim after an advisory committee of EU
national antitrust experts on Monday agreed with the proposal put forward by Van Miert's officials.
EU sources have said the Commission had found "devastating" evidence that the Italian distributor for
Volkswagen and its Audi unit had refused to sell cars to customers outside Italy as a matter of policy.

Such refusal to sell is specifically prohibited under EU rules allowing car manufacturers to operate exclusive distribution networks of authorised dealers.

HD        VW faces heavy fine over Italian practices.

The European Commission is tomorrow expected to  fine Volkswagen, the German carmaker, a record penalty of about DM 200m ( #67m) for alleged anti-competitive sales practices of some of its Italian dealers.

The steep  fine - the highest ever imposed on a single company - would cap a two-year Commission investigation into allegations that Italian dealers refused to sell cars to buyers from outside Italy, contravening the European Union's single market and competition rules.

TD
The EU's previous largest  fine was ECU 75m ( #50m), levied on Tetrapak for market behaviour.

The precise level of the penalty was due to be agreed at a meeting last night, but an official confirmed that it would be "in the region of DM 200m".
The Brussels anti-trust authorities are understood to have uncovered evidence that VW in effect
ordered its Italian car dealers not to sell outside their allocated territory. This followed raids on premises
belonging to VW and its Italian distributors several years ago.
VW insisted yesterday it had done nothing wrong and no pressure had been put on its traders. Some industry experts were surprised at the harshness of the punishment.
VW is likely to challenge the Commission's decision at the European Court.

Brussels pressed the case after complaints from citizens in Austria and Germany who had gone to Italy in search of cheaper models. Similar problems in Denmark have prompted a separate Commission investigation there.

Under special competition rules that apply to the European car sector, manufacturers are allowed to sell their cars through exclusive networks of authorised dealers but they are not allowed to refuse to sell to individuals, or companies acting on behalf of individuals, who take advantage of the single market to shop around for the best prices.
Exchange rates and different tax levels mean it is still cheaper to buy certain types of cars in some EU
countries than in others.

A year ago competition officials raided the offices of Mercedes-Benz in relation to sales practices in Belgium, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, and of General Motors' Opel subsidiary in relation to sales in the Netherlands.

German auto maker  Volkswagen AG and its Audi subsidiary may be  fined at least 100 million marks ($56-million U.S.) for violating European Union fair trade rules, officials said yesterday. The  European   Commission is to rule tomorrow on charges that VW prevented its Italian dealers from selling to clients from outside Italy who looked for cheaper cars than those on sale in their own countries. Under EU
rules, consumers have the right to shop for the best buy anywhere in the 15-nation EU. The commission has powers to fine a company the size of VW up to 10 per cent of its global sales.

The German auto maker  Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary may be  fined at least 100 million marks ($56 million) for violating European Union fair trade rules, officials said yesterday. The European Commission is to rule tomorrow on charges that VW prevented its Italian dealers from selling to customers from outside Italy who looked for cheaper cars than those on sale in their own countries.
Under European Union rules, consumers have the right to shop for the best deal anywhere in the
15-nation union. The commission has powers to  fine a company the size of VW up to 10 percent of
its global sales. VW could also lose certain European Union antitrust exemptions. If the exemptions
are taken away, VW and Audi dealers would be free to sell other makes of cars.

HD         Brussels to fine VW #65m over price controls. BY          By Charles Bremner in Brussels.
WC         529 words

LP
THE European Commission is expected today to impose an unprecedented  fine of about #65m on Volkswagen in the strongest attempt yet by Brussels to force carmakers to allow consumers to shop across frontiers for the best deal on new vehicles.

The action is intended to punish the German company for allegedly forcing its Italian dealers to refuse sales to Austrian and German residents who sought to take advantage, when the lira lost value in
1994, of much lower prices than they would have paid for the same VW and Audi models back home. The highest company  fine previously imposed was #50m on Tetrapak, the packaging firm.

TD
EU inspectors raided VW offices and found evidence that the company had threatened to refuse to supply Italian dealers who sold cars to those resident in other EU countries, Commission sources said. Volkswagen is denying any illegal conduct and is expected to challenge the  fine in the European Court.

The Volkswagen case, directed by Karel van Miert, the Competition Commissioner, is the latest in a long EU battle to remove obstacles to a single European car market. Although manufacturers benefit from a temporary exemption that allows them to maintain exclusive dealerships, EU law bans them from discriminating against foreign purchasers.

Cross-border car shopping increased sharply in the early 1990s when consumers became aware of steep price differences, often within only a few miles. Under EU rules, a buyer registers a vehicle in his or her home country and pays the VAT there. While some areas, such as the Spanish/French border region, have done a roaring trade in personal orders, would-be purchasers often run into obstacles once sales staff ask them where they live.

Although price differences have been dropping, currency movement and local traditions mean similar models can still cost up to 50% more in one state than another. Britain now has by far the highest vehicle prices in the EU, thanks in part to the appreciation of the pound, Commission figures will show next month.
In a survey published in July, the Commission found that British cars cost an average of about 25%
more than the lowest continental prices. Portugal had the least expensive cars.

Manufacturers have argued that price differences are inevitable, mainly because of currency movement. They also argue, more quietly, that they have to take account of widely differing local taxes and other factors in the overall cost to buyers.

Differences in car costs, along with the prices of all other goods, will become more visible from next January when the EU single currency is launched among 11 states. The euro's advocates say prices will level down.

FRANKFURT, Jan 28 (Reuters) -  Volkswagen AG on Wednesday fiercely criticised a  fine by the
European Commission relating to its alleged sales practices in Italy, calling it politically motivated.

VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters that  Volkswagen would appeal against the decision and that the fine, a record 102 million Ecus ($112 million), would not affect the results of the carmaker, which has annual sales of over 100 billion marks ($55.5 billion).

TD
European Commissioner Karel Van Miert on Wednesday announced that VW must pay the  fine for allegedly ordering its Italian distributor not to sell cars to residents from neighbouring European Union countries.

"This behaviour creates the impression of a political campaign," Kocks said. "Van Miert has been improperly talking about this decision before it was even made."

Volkswagen has three months to pay the fine and two months to take all necessary measures to eliminate the restrictive practices, the European Commission said.

FRANKFURT, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The European Union will  fine Volkswagen AG about 200 million marks for preventing consumers in the European Union from taking advantage of cheaper car prices in the 15-nation bloc, European Commissioner Karel Van Miert told a newspaper in an interview on Wednesday.

Germany's Die Zeit newspaper, in a statement ahead of publication on Thursday, quoted Van Miert as saying that other companies violating EU competition rules could also face  fines.

TD
The European Commission was discussing on Wednesday a proposal to  fine VW over its alleged sales practices in Italy. A formal announcement was not expected before 1400 GMT.

"We have the proof, and therefore VW must pay a  fine of about 200 million marks," Van Miert told the newspaper.
He told the newspaper that VW "is not the only carmkaer that must pay a  fine due to such practices". VW was to be  fined for allegedly instructing its Italian distributor Autogerma not to sell to residents in
neighbouring Germany and Austria. Pre-tax car prices can vary more than 30 percent from one EU
country to the other, according to the EC.
((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com))
A commission spokesman said earlier on Wednesday that the commission discussed a proposal to  fine
VW over the alleged practices this morning, but still had not taken a final decision.
He declined to comment on whether the 20-member commission was divided over the size of the  fine. The commission was not expected to make a formal announcement before 1400 GMT after informing
the company.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined German car maker Volkswagen a record 102 million Ecus ($112 million) on Wednesday for allegedly barring its Italian distributor from selling cars to residents in Germany and Austria.

Volkswagen had three months to pay the  fine and two months to take all necessary measures to eliminate the restrictive practices, the Commission said.

TD
"The Commission's decision shows that the behavior of  Volkswagen/Audi -- Europe's biggest car manufacturing group -- threatens the normal operation of the (European Union's) single market and constitutes a very serious infraction of the European competition law," the statement said.

Under EU rules, car makers are allowed to operate selective distribution networks, but cannot prevent dealers from selling to individuals, or companies acting on their behalf, who want to take advantage of price differentials in the 15-nation bloc.

The Commission said it had found "written evidence" during 1995 raids on the  Volkswagen group and the distributor Autogerma of pressure exerted on dealers, including the termination of dealership contracts, to refuse cross-border orders.

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - European competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday it was not surprising that German car maker  Volkswagen was threatening to challenge an EU fine in court.

"When the Commission takes such a decision the company concerned or the companies concerned are free to take the case to court. It's part of the game," Van Miert said.

TD
"It's up to the Commission (therefore) to make sure that the decision it takes sticks: that the reasoning leading to a...sanction is a solid one and I think we really did so."
The European Commission earlier fined VW 102 million Ecus ($112 million) for alleged
anti-competitive sales practices in Italy. A VW spokesman said the  fine smacked of a "political
campaign" against the car maker and it would be challenged in the EU's Court of Justice.

Van Miert said the level of the  fine reflected the severity of the anti-trust offence it allegedly committed. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com))

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European             Commission on Wednesday:

Spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said the Commission had not yet decided the amount of the  fine to be levied against Volkswagen for violating EU competition rules (see separate stories) nor on the proposed reform of tobacco subsidies or the 1999 budget. He said there would be an additional briefing on the Commission's results at 1700/1600 GMT.

a European Commissioner and holding political office at 1600/1500 GMT.

Van der Pas said the Commission had adopted a recommendation to negotiate a partnership agreement with the ACP countries. He said the Commission had also approved a communication on an information strategy for the euro. He said the budget approved for 1998 was 30 Mecus, with 38 Mecus envisaged for
1999.

FRANKFURT, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The German Automobile Industry Association VDA said on Wednesday that it regretted the decision by the  European Commission to impose a record 102 million Ecus ($112 million)  fine on Volkswagen.

The EC imposed the penalty on VW for allegedly barring its Italian distributor from selling cars to people living in Germany and Austria.

TD
"As well as controversial and often difficult-to-prove elements there is a question of the appropriateness of the fine in relation to the number of actual individual cases of re-importing," the VDA said in a statement.

The fine was the largest  fine imposed by the Commission on a single company, overtaking the 75 million Ecus it levied on Swedish carton maker Tetra Pak in 1991.

Under EU rules, car makers are allowed to operate selective distribution networks, but cannot prevent dealers from selling to individuals, or companies acting on their behalf, who want to take advantage of cheaper prices in the 15-nation bloc.
"Effective competition requires a serviceable network of dealers," the VDA said.

Cars usually cost less in countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal because of currency fluctuations or due to a deliberate policy by manufacturers to preserve their share of the market. ((Clifford Coonan, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com))

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG has two months to challenge a  European                  Commission decision on Wednesday to fine it 102 million Ecus for alleged anti-competitive sales practices in Italy.

The German carmaker said immediately after the Commission's announcement it would appeal the decision.

TD
Antitrust lawyers thought Volkswagen would contest both the Commission's accusations of improper behaviour and the size of the record fine.

They speculated that VW could file for interim measures with the European Court of First Instance (CFI) which, if accepted, would have the effect of suspending payment of the  fine pending a ruling on the substance of the case.

But this could backfire because if the court upheld the Commission's decision,  Volkswagen would have to pay the  fine plus interest.

An appeal before the CFI, which is the court for challenging Commission decisions based on competition rules, normally takes one year to two years.
But a final ruling could take up to four years since CFI rulings are often challenged in the European
Court of Justice, the European Union's highest court. (Amelia Torres +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - German car maker  Volkswagen AG will be  fined four billion Belgian francs by the  European Commission for alleged selling practices in Italy, Belgian radio said on Wednesday.

The radio said it had learnt that commission experts had found hard evidence of restrictions on selling by Italian VW dealers to French, German and Austrian customers and that the decision on the  fine would be ratified by the full commission later on Wednesday.

A commission spokesman said earlier on Wednesday that the commission discussed a proposal to
fine VW over the alleged practices this morning, but still had not taken a final decision.
He declined to comment on whether the 20-member commission was divided over the size of the  fine. The commission was not expected to make a formal announcement before 1400 GMT after informing
the company. ((Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 6810, fax +32 2 230 7710,

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to  fine German carmaker Volkswagen about 200 million marks on Wednesday for barring its Italian distributor from selling cars to residents in Germany and Austria.

A formal announcement, possibly by Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, is now expected after 1600 GMT, a Commission spokesman said.

TD
Commission officials had no immediate comment on a report on Belgian radio that the  fine would equal four billion Belgian francs. The amount will be announced in European currency units.

European Union sources have predicted in the last few days that the  fine would be about 200 million marks, or about 100 million ecus. Van Miert confirmed that figure in an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit.
Van Miert's spokesman denied reports that the final amount was the subject of a dispute within the
20-member EU executive. "There is no question of a fight between the commissioners," he told the
Commission's daily briefing.

He said that the Commission had discussed the issue in the morning, but the final decision would be taken when the executive resumed meeting in the afternoon.

The Commission has been investigating for about 10 years allegations that  Volkswagen has instructed its Italian distributor, Autogerma, not to sell its cars or those of its Audi unit to residents of neighbouring Germany and Austria.

Car prices before tax are usually cheaper in Italy, and this was even more so in the years following the lire's exit in 1992 from the European exchange rate mechanism for several years.

Under EU rules on selective distribution of cars, manufacturers cannot refuse to sell to individuals from other countries -- or companies acting on their behalf -- who are trying to take advantage of cross-border price differentials.

Mercedes and Opel have been raided by the Commission in relation to similar alleged practices. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com))

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined Volkswagen a record 102 million Ecus ($112 million) on Wednesday for allegedly barring its Italian distributor from selling cars to people living in Germany and Austria.
It was the largest  fine imposed by the Commission on a single company, overtaking the 75 million
Ecus it levied on Swedish carton maker Tetra Pak in 1991.

TD
Volkswagen, Europe's largest car maker, quickly slammed the Commission's decision, saying it smacked of a political campaign and vowed to challenge it in the EU's court of justice.

In a hard-hitting statement, the Commission said VW, its Audi unit and their Italian distributor had over the last decade "systematically" rejected orders from foreign customers seeking to take advantage of lower Italian car prices.

Volkswagen had three months to pay the  fine and two months to take all necessary measures to eliminate the restrictive practices, the Commission said.

"The Commission's decision shows that the behaviour of  Volkswagen/Audi -- Europe's biggest car manufacturing group -- threatens the normal operation of the (European Union's) single market and constitutes a very serious infraction of the European competition law," the statement said.

Under EU rules, car makers are allowed to operate selective distribution networks, but cannot prevent dealers from selling to individuals, or companies acting on their behalf, who want to take advantage of cheaper prices in the 15-nation bloc.

Cars usually cost less in countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal, because of currency fluctuations or due to a deliberate policy by manufacturers to preserve their share of the market.

Italian prices were even more attractive after the lira's exit in 1992 from the European exchange rate mechanism which was accompanied by a strong depreciation of the currency.

The Commission said it had found "written evidence" during 1995 raids on  Volkswagen and Audi and their distributor Autogerma, based in the northern Italian town of Verona, of pressure exerted on dealers to refuse cross-border orders.

A dozen dealers had had their contracts terminated for not respecting  Volkswagen's instructions and a total of 50 had been warned of the risk they would take if they accepted to sell to foreigners, it said.

Documents gathered by Commission inspectors also showed that  Volkswagen and Audi were fully aware that its Italian sales practices were illegal under EU law.

The Commission's investigation, which took several years, was triggered by "numerous" complaints from consumers in Austria and Germany, which had been refused to buy a make from VW or Audi in Italy.

The EU executive is currently probing similar allegations involving Mercedes and the Adam Opel subsidiary of General Motors which were also raided about a year ago.

HD     EU fines VW 112 million dollars  over cross-border sales (RECASTS, ADDS background) WC    431 words

BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (AFP) - The EU Commission Wednesday handed down its largest ever  fine to an individual company, fining German car manufacturer  Volkswagen 102 million ECUs (112 million dollars) for obstructing sales of its cheaper Italian models.

The fine represents about 10 percent of annual profits for the German car giant which immediately announced it would appeal.

TD
After a lengthy inquiry, the Commission found that VW had "systematically forced" Italian dealers not to sell their cheaper versions of the cars to Austrians and Germans, a move slammed as contravening EU policy on cross-border sales.
The fines were announced by Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert who said: "It is the biggest  fine
ever inflicted by the Commission on an individual company."

Van Miert told a press conference: "It is an extremely serious breach over a long period and was systematic."

In a statement,  Volkswagen said the fine was "incomprehensible" and "completely disproportionate" saying it had anyway "respected EU rules."

"Volkswagen will complain to the European court against the  European Commission's decision to clear up the different interpretations of the situation in legal terms," it said.

The company said it had not blocked legal cross-border sales but had acted against "parallel market" reimportation to Germany and Austria.
The firms' instructions "only targeted unauthorised resales," it said.

As the Commission ruling stands,  Volkswagen has three months in which to pay the  fine and within two months must end its restrictions.

A spokesman for Van Miert said that the  fine was severe because Volkswagen, being the biggest car manufacturer in Europe, "threatens the normal functioning" of the market.

The Commission had also taken account of the duration of the breach of competition which had lasted for more than 10 years and had punished the company for using its economic hold over its network of dealers "to establish these restrictive practices".
The size of the  fine "shows the Commission's determination not to tolerate such practices and to act
vis-a-vis other constructors who intend to restrict the internal (European) market," said the Commission.
The Commission has recently carried out investigations at the Mercedes and Opel groups.

According to German auto industry experts one in seven new cars in Germany has made its way to the market via another EU country.

Volkswagen, like other German manufacturers, sells cheaper models of their cars in certain EU
countries, such as Italy, often with a 10 or 20 percent markdown, generating the resale trade, according to
the experts.

FINE FOR VOLKSWAGEN FOR RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE PRACTICES IN CARS OF AROUND DM 200 MILLION.

Brussels, 27/01/1998 (Agence Europe) - It is on Wednesday that the European Commission will formally decide on the fine to impose on the German car manufacturer Volkswagen for restrictions practiced on certain types of intra-Community trade in cars. In 1995, when the Italian lira was particularly weak, cars were cheaper in Italy than in other Member States, and Austrian nationals tried on several occasions to purchase their cars from Italian retailers. According to the Commission's enquiry (which claims to have proof), the firm had given instructions to refuse these sales. It is therefore, according to the Commission, a serious infringement of the principle of the free movement of goods.

TD
The company says it has no knowledge of these facts and that it never gave such instructions.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German stock prices settled Wednesday above their previous close, on the back of a strong opening on Wall Street and a firmer dollar.
The weighted 30-share Xetra DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, settled at
4385.29 points, up 69.24 points, or 1.6%, from Tuesday's settlement. Electronic dealing takes place
from 0730 GMT to 1600 GMT.

TD
Starting Nov. 28, electronic trading in the cash market has taken place on the new Xetra system, which fully replaces IBIS trading. The DAX and the Xetra DAX are composed of the same stocks and weightings, though they track trends in two separate market places. Floor trading ends at 1230 GMT.

Earlier, during the three-hour floor-trading session, the DAX index closed at 4391.02 points, up 112.26 points, or 2.6%, from Tuesday's close.
The dollar supported German share prices Wednesday in the export-oriented sectors. Around 1600
GMT, just after electronic trading ended, the dollar was quoted at DEM1.8104, up from DEM1.7865
late Tuesday in New York.

Among individual shares, Deutsche Bank rose DEM8.55, or 7.8%, to settle at DEM118.65 on the announcement of a new restructuring scheme, despite news the bank's 1997 operating profit will be around one-third lower due to risk provisions for Asia.


Meanwhile,
Volkswagen shares rose DEM16.50, or 1.7%, to DEM1,007.50 on
the stronger dollar. After trading ended, however, the European Commission announced a ECU102 million (DEM201.33 million) fine for the automaker for anti-competitive practices in Italy.

HD          EU Hits Volkswagen With Record Fine For Italian-Market Sales Curbs

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission Wednesday fined German auto maker Volkswagen AG and its subsidiary, Audi AG, a record 102 million European currency units ($112.4 million) for restrictive sales practices in the Italian market, EU antitrust chief official Karel Van Miert said.
The commission ruled that  Volkswagen (VLKAY) "systematically forced Italian dealers to refuse to sell
VW and Audi cars to foreign customers, notably Germans and Austrians."

TD
The commission, which oversees antitrust matters for the 15-nation European Union, said Volkswagen has three months to pay the  fine, which is the largest individual sanction the agency has ever imposed on a company. The commission also gave  Volkswagen two months to "eliminate" the restrictive practices.

Volkswagen has claimed that it has done nothing illegal and said it has begun the process to appeal the judgment.

In presenting the decision, van Miert said the policy operated by the VW group showed "a systematic covert operation endorsed by the management of the company." He added that the commission continues to field complaints because "the practice is still going on."
He said the auto maker knows "perfectly well this was a persistent, serious offense."

The decision, which was expected, follows raids in October 1995 on various VW, Audi and Autogerma dealerships in the north of Italy. Autogerma, a 100%-owned unit of VW, is the official  Volkswagen importer in Italy. Documents seized during those raids proved that VW had a policy not to sell to
non-Italian customers, van Miert said. Such practices are outlawed under EU single-market laws.

Following the raids, the commission listed antitrust complaints with the VW sales policy. It told VW that consumer complaints alleged "a strategy designed to prohibit Austrian consumers as well as German and French consumers from buying their cars cheaper on the Italian market and thus benefiting from the advantages of the EU's single market."

The commission cited threats by VW to its Italian dealers that if they sold to foreign clients, it would break their supply contracts. VW also threatened to reduce bonuses to car dealers if they sold to clients "outside their territory," the commission said.
Van Miert said VW had carried out its threat with 12 dealers and threatened a further 50 dealers for
"doing things" which he characterized as "perfectly legal."

In a detailed statement, the commission quoted from documents seized during the raids, citing, for instance, a paper in which VW admitted the conditions it was imposing on its Italian dealers "weren't compatible with European law on the distribution of automobiles."

That document, according to the commission, also noted that the aim of VW's policy was to "restrict cross-border trade." The document even suggested that  Volkswagen knew what could lie ahead, since it admitted that the policy was "highly susceptible to be subject to  fines."



Page 64 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Other confiscated written evidence showed that VW and Audi had told their Italian dealers "not to tell their foreign clients the real reason for the refusal-to-sell policy in Italy ... and to come up with pretexts" such as differences in auto parts and difficulties in implementing guarantees to discourage clients and to make it clear to them that the VW group wasn't behind the policy.

The commission said that in fixing the amount of the  fine, it took into account that the restrictive policy had gone on for more than 10 years as well as the fact that VW and its subsidiaries "exploited their economic power over their distribution network in Italy to put restrictive practices into place."

The commission also is looking into the sales practices of German car maker Mercedes-Benz AG, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG (DAI) as well as General Motors Corp.'s (GM) Adam Opel AG unit.

Wednesday's decision means VW also loses the benefits of an antitrust exemption granted to the EU car industry. The exemption allows VW, for instance, to conclude exclusive arrangements with its dealerships, under which they sell only VW and Audi vehicles. Because of the company's violation, VW dealers will now be free to stock other brands of cars.

Van Miert said the only way to reverse that is to make sure within a given time these illegal practices cease.

The commission has long argued that consumers should be able to buy a car in any EU market, if need be, benefiting from currency fluctuations. It noted Wednesday that consumers who feel they are being affected by any similar practices should take their case to national competition authorities or national courts.
The commission can fine a company up to 10% of its global sales.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks rallied sharply for the second-straight session Wednesday amid continued enthusiasm over corporate earnings reports. Transportation issues, drug stocks and technologies paced Wall Street's advance. Treasurys were little changed, while the dollar ended sharply higher against the mark.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 100.39 points, or 1.3%, to close at 7915.47 - the Dow's highest finish since Jan. 5. Tuesday, the blue-chip index leaped 102 points. Big Board gainers outpaced losers 13 to 7 on heavy volume of 706.8 million shares, the Big Board's sixth-busiest trading session ever.

Airline issues rallied, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average leap 87.89 points, or 2.7%, to close at 3312.59. Alaska Air jumped 6 1/8, or 14%, after the carrier posted much better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

AlliedSignal climbed 2 1/2, DuPont rose 1 3/4, and Coca-Cola added 15/16 as all three companies reported quarterly earnings that were about as expected. Among other blue chips, Minnesota Mining climbed 3 15/16, Disney climbed another 2 1/4, and United Technologies gained 2 3/8.

Philip Morris Cos.' fourth-quarter net income, hurt by legal costs, fell 12% but overall sales rose 3.2%, including increases in the financially troubled Asia-Pacific region.

The tobacco, food and beer company's bottom line was lowered in part by funds set aside to pay the company's portion of a $15.3 billion industrywide settlement with the state of Texas. Net income excluding items was $1.6 billion, or 66 cents a diluted share, in line with estimates.

The company warned that economic woes in Asia may temporarily slow its business there, and the proposed resolution of tobacco litigation and regulation in the U.S. is "entering a particularly critical period."

HD    COMPETITION - VW FACES MASSIVE FINE OVER RESTRICTIVE SALES POLICY. WC   415 words
PD    28 January 1998
SN    European Report
SC    EURREP
LA     English
CY    (c) 1998 European Report.

LP
On January 28, the European Commission will, as expected, announce the imposition of a massive  fine on German car manufacturer Volkswagen AG for breaking EU competition rules which allow Community consumers to buy vehicles from Member States where they do not reside. VW's Italian dealerships have been found to be maintaining anti-competitive practices. The  fine, which will be set somewhere between
150 and 200m Deutschemarks, is thus likely to be the highest ever imposed by the EU watchdog on a single company for anti-competitive behaviour.

TD
The basis of the case goes back to 1993, when the company is alleged to have forbidden Italian car export firm Autogerma to sell VW or Audi makes to nationals of Germany, Austria and France attempting to take advantage of wide price differentials. VW also withdrew permission from a number of Italian dealers to sell its vehicles and put added pressure on other dealers in the country to toe the company line on sales to avoid cannibalisation of its customer base within Germany, where prices are up to 30% higher. These practices came to light during raids carried out by Commission officials at VW headquarters in Wolfsburg
in late 1995 (for more details see European Report Number 2280).

The Commission decision will also result in  Volkswagen losing its automatic right to benefit from the EU block exemption on exclusive distribution of motor vehicles. The exemption - outlined in an updated Commission Regulation of April 1995 which is due to expire in Autumn 2002 - provides that car makers maintaining a network of tied dealers throughout the Member States are free from challenge under the normal anti-cartel rules set out in Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty. The Commission believes that such exclusive networks benefit the consumer by allowing a high standard of customer advice and maintenance work by specialised mechanics.

However, having been found guilty of breaking the rules which forbid sales restrictions on the basis of nationality or residence,  Volkswagen will lose its automatic right to the exemption. Individual dealers and other interested parties will now be able to challenge VW sales policy in the courts. Similar "refusal to sell" cases involving VW dealers in Denmark and the Netherlands have already arisen, which could soon be the subject of judicial proceedings soon. Meanwhile, unnamed sources at VW indicate the company will
appeal against the Commission decision in the European Court of Justice.

News in brief

The European Commission imposed a record fine of #68m on Volkswagen, accusing the German car maker of systematically violating EU competition and single-market rules. Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said VW instructed its Italian subsidiary not to sell cars to people from outside the
country over a period of nearly 10 years. This practice is forbidden to counter an exemption from EU competition rules that allows European carmakers to run exclusive dealership networks. VW vowed to appeal to the European Court of Justice. - Julie Wolf in Brussels.

Brussels fines VW #68m

The European Commission yesterday fined German car giant  Volkswagen 102m ecu (#68m) for forcing its Italian dealers to refuse to sell cars to Austrian and German customers, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said. He said it was the largest  fine ever imposed by the commission on
a single company, and that the infringements of EU law had been going on since 1987.  Volkswagen AG
said it would lodge an appeal with the European Court against a  fine.

VOLKSWAGEN has been hit by a Pounds 70million EU  fine for illegally stopping motorists shopping around Europe for the cheapest prices.

A spokesman for the  European Commission said the firm 'had systematically forced Italian dealers to refuse to sell VW and Audi cars to foreign customers'.

The fine is the largest the Commission has imposed on a company. The German car giant, which denies illegal conduct and is expected to challenge the decision, has two months to 'eliminate' the restrictive practices.

European consumers have the right to shop across borders for the best buy anywhere in the EU. But many complain that obstacles are put in their way.

HD   EU/COMPETITION - HEAVY FINE IMPOSED ON VOLKSWAGEN AS THE INFRINGEMENT IS SERIOUS, SAYS KAREL VAN MIERT.

Brussels, 28/01/1998 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the  European Commission decided to impose a particularly heavy fine on Volkswagen as a penalty for its systematic refusal to sell to foreign customers in Italy, especially German and Austrian nationals wanting to purchase cheaper VW and Audi cars in the
trans-Alpine republic. The amount is set at ECU 102 million (around one third of the net profits on its Italian sales in 1996), due to the duration (over ten years) and seriousness of the infringement, and also because of aggravating circumstances. Having checked the many complaints lodged by consumers since 1995, the Commission decided that "the  Volkswagen group, its Italian subsidiary, Autogerma, as well as Audi agreed with their Italian dealiers on a strategy intended to prevent and/or substantially limit trade from Italy going to other Member States, in particular Austria and Germany".

TD
It concludes from this that the conduct of  Volkswagen/Audi - number one European automobile manufacturer - "threatens the normal functioning of the internal market and is a very serious infringement to the rules of Community competition law". The group now has three months to pay up the  fine and two months to put an end to the illegal practices. The benefits of sectorial exemptions have to be automatically withdrawn and in future the company will have to use an individual request for it to be handed back. "For each case of infringement, the Commission will not hesitate to take necesssary measures, if, on the one hand, automobile makers have a certain margin to organise their retail networks, on the other, the rules oblige them to leave consumers the inaliable right to purchase a car anywhere within the EU's territory", Mr Van Miert recalled.

VOLKSWAGEN was this week ordered by the  European Commission to pay fines of 102 million ecu for preventing customers in the EU from taking advantage of cheaper car prices in some member states. Commission officials said the German carmaker had instructed its distributors in Italy - where cars are relatively cheap - not to sell new vehicles to customers arriving from Germany and Austria. This practice is specifically outlawed by EU competition rules. Prices of cars can vary by up to 30% before tax from one member state to another. The VW  fine is the largest against a single company since the
Commission fined Swedish carton company Tetra Pak 75 million ecu in 1991.

FRENCH horse-race betting group Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) was granted illegal tax breaks by the government,

TD
the European Court of First Instance ruled this week. This followed a complaint by Britain's Ladbroke Racing that France's allocation of levies, exemption from the one-month delay for the deduction of VAT, deferred payments of certain levies on betting and other tax breaks gave PMU an unfair advantage.

TRANSPORT Commissioner Neil Kinnock said this week that he would soon announce proposals on whether airlines should be allowed to sell take-off and landing slots at EU airports. He said their aim
would be to "help develop the means of facilitating the transfer of slots and avoiding a static and inflexible situation at congested airports".
UNILEVER, the world's largest ice-cream maker, has warned that it will go to the European Court if the
Commission rules against it next week in a row with Mars Inc over the distribution of ice-cream.

The Anglo-Dutch food giant is awaiting a decision on whether it can ban rival products from freezer cabinets it lends to shops in Ireland. Although the ruling will focus on Ireland, a negative decision would in practice outlaw the practice across the EU.
DUTCH financial group ING has been given the go-ahead for its planned acquisition of Belgian bank
BBL. The Commission said the two banks' activities were largely complementary and the move would not
lead to the creation of a dominant position in any market. The Commission also approved plans by US
publisher Dow Jones & Company Inc and US television company NBC to share control of their European
business TV channels EBN and CNBC. Officials said the venture would not have a major impact on
competition in free-access television broadcasting or the transmission of news programmes.

GERMANY's digital television alliance between Bertelsmann's CLT-UFA unit and the Kirch Group faces a full enquiry by the Commission amid fears that their jointly owned pay-TV company Premiere could become a lasting monopoly.
The Commission said it was concerned that the pooling of Kirch's digital TV technology, including its
set-top decoder box, and the participation of Deutsche Telekom in the alliance, would make a challenge
by any potential competitor too difficult. However, a joint statement from Kirch and CLT-UFA said the two
were confident they could overcome the Commission's concerns.

INTERNAL market Commissioner Mario Monti last week unveiled guidelines on how companies should apply two EU directives on accountancy. He said it was "essential that EU member states and companies know how to interpret the provisions". The guidelines were part of the Commission's strategy aimed at improving the comparability of accounts drawn up by companies in different EU states, he added.

The European Commission fined Volkswagen AG a record 102 million European currency units ($163 million) yesterday because its Italian dealers broke European Union antitrust law by refusing to sell cars to Germans and Austrians seeking lower prices.  Volkswagen, which only last November resolved a year-long subsidy dispute with EU competition authorities, said it will appeal the decision, calling the fine "incomprehensible" and the amount "entirely out of proportion." The commission said Europe's largest car maker was "systematically forcing its Italian dealers to refuse to sell VW and Audi cars to foreign customers." The EU's executive agency began investigating complaints from German and Austrian consumers in 1995.

The European Commission fined Volkswagen AG 102 million European currency units ($112.4-million U.S.) for what it called serious breaches of European Union competition and single-market rules. The decision, which VW vowed to appeal, raises questions about the future of a special exemption from EU competition law granted to car makers in Europe. The measure, which expires in 2002, allows auto makers to establish exclusive-dealership networks. VW and its Audi AG and Autogerma units systematically violated the terms of the exemption by refusing to sell cars in Italy to people from outside that country, the commission said. Raids on company offices in Germany and Italy in 1995 were prompted by complaints from non-Italian resident buyers who sought to benefit from the fall in the lira between 1992 and 1995.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 28 -- The  European Commission has fined Volkswagen A.G. a record 102 million European Currency Units, or about $111 million, because its Italian dealers broke European Union antitrust law by refusing to sell cars to Germans and Austrians seeking lower prices.

Volkswagen, which only last November resolved a 98 million mark, yearlong subsidy dispute with
European Union competition authorities, said it would appeal the decision, calling the  fine
''incomprehensible'' and the amount ''entirely out of proportion.''

TD
The commission said VW, Europe's largest car maker, was ''systematically forcing its Italian dealers to refuse to sell VW and Audi cars to foreign customers.'' The union's executive agency began investigating complaints from German and Austrian consumers, who had sought to cross the border into Italy to buy VW's and Audis for less than at home, in 1995.

Karel van Miert, Competition Commissioner for the European Union, said today's ruling should serve as a warning for other car makers, which he did not name, that were also being investigated.
VW denies it blocked sales and said it would appeal.

VW said it was opposed only to sales by unauthorized dealerships. ''Gray market imports by unauthorized dealers are in contravention of European law,'' VW said in a statement.

The commission said that it had found letters at VW's German and Italian headquarters that were addressed to 50 Italian dealers and threatened to end their contracts if they sold cars to foreign customers. VW ended its contracts with 12 of those dealers.
Audi, VW's luxury car unit, violated an Italian supply contract by canceling a shipment of 8,000 cars to
Italy in 1995, the year the Italian lira plunged against the mark, the commission said.

Beside having to pay the highest  fine ever levied by the commission on a single company, VW may not be able to take advantage of a union exemption from antitrust rules that allows auto makers to set up exclusive arrangements with dealer networks, the commission said.

To be eligible for the exemption, car makers must insure consumers' freedom to buy cars anywhere in the European Union.

STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BUSINESS DAY: Now, let's move on to the marketplace this morning and check currencies for you. The U.S. dollar right now trading at - against the Japanese yen -
125.1 is the quote. The dollar a little higher there. The dollar is virtually unchanged on the mark at 180. The
British pound coming in this morning at $1.64.
As for European stock markets, they're all higher.

TD
London up 38 points - it's now above 5400.
The Frankfurt DAX is up another 40 points. In Paris, the CAC40 up 38.
Now, for all the corporate news from overseas, let's go to Todd Benjamin. He's in our London bureau this morning.
Good morning, Todd.

TODD BENJAMIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Stuart. You're right - Europe's leading stock markets are racing ahead. London, Zurich, Milan, and Madrid building on Wednesday's record gains. Paris is going for a new high. Frankfurt's still 6 points shy of its all-time high.

Well, staying in Frankfurt, Volkswagen (URL: http://www.vw.com/) is up 1/2 percent after the market closed Wednesday. The European Commission fined the German car maker $112 million for unfair sales practices. VW says it will appeal. The car maker, meanwhile, hopes combining the Beatles with the Beetle will have a huge appeal to potential buyers. VW's negotiating with Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr to help market the new Beetle. The car is sleeker than the original and sales start in the United States in the spring. It will cost around $15,000 each.

Luxury car maker BMW () had a record year last year. Sales jumped to more than $33 billion. A fall in Asian sales was offset by a rise in both U.S. and Europe.

Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson (URL:  http://www.ericsson.com/) posted record profits for 1997 and proposed a one-for-one bonus stock issue to shareholders.

And staying in telecoms, a compromise has been reached on the ETSI mobile telephone conference. Now, companies are meeting to decide on standards for the next generation of cellular phones.

And finally, America Online (URL:  http://www.aol.com/) , Germany's Bertlesmen and two French companies are cooperating in a French Internet deal. The two French companies will take a majority stake in America Online France.
And that's it for now. I'll be back in half an hour with more, but now back to Stuart in New York. END

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Prices for  Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) cars are likely to fall 15% to 25% due to the  European Commission's ruling imposed on the German car maker, Juergen Niebling, attorney and legal representative of German car dealers, said on German television Friday.

As reported, VW was  fined DEM201.33 million Wednesday by the Commission for restrictive sales practices in the Italian market.

TD
This judgment by the Commission will likely increase competition among car dealers, Niebling said.

Independent car dealers would have a competitive edge over authorized VW dealers because they don't have to meet as many requirements, he said, adding that investment would also be lower.

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Prices for  Volkswagen cars are likely to fall 15% to 25% in the wake of the European Commission's fine imposed Wednesday on the German car maker, a representative of German car dealers said Friday.
As reported, the EU  fined Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) and its subsidiary, Audi AG, a record 102 million
European currency units ($112.4 million) for restrictive sales practices in Italy.

TD
Juergen Niebling, attorney and legal representative of German car dealers, said the judgment by the
Commission will likely increase competition among car dealers.

Independent car dealers would have a competitive edge over authorized VW dealers because they don't have to meet as many requirements, he said, adding that investment would also be lower.
The commission ruled that  Volkswagen "systematically forced Italian dealers to refuse to sell VW and
Audi cars to foreign customers, notably Germans and Austrians."

Volkswagen has claimed that it has done nothing illegal and said it has begun the process to appeal the judgment.

In presenting the decision, EU antitrust chief official Karel van Miert said the policy operated by the VW group showed "a systematic covert operation endorsed by the management of the company." He added that the commission continues to field complaints because "the practice is still going on."
Van Miert said the auto maker knows "perfectly well this was a persistent, serious offense." Copyright (c) 1998 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The battle lines have been drawn between Europe's car industry and the  European Commission
after Brussels' decision to impose a record  fine on Volkswagen for alleged uncompetitive practices.

The VW chief, Mr Ferdinand Piech, lashed out at the  European Commission on Thursday, describing the fine as "a political penalty," while European competition commissioner Mr Karel van Miert warned that other car companies could also be  fined for following similar practices.

TD
These involve manipulating different exchange rates and tax levels which means that certain types of cars are cheaper in some European Union markets.The VW case concerned claims that its Italian dealers had refused to sell cars to buyers from outside

Italy, which the commission ruled on Wednesday as contravening the EU's single market and competition rules.

VW, which is also Europe's biggest car maker, is planning a legal challenge to the commission's ECU102 million European currency units ($172 million)  fine, which was the highest penalty ever levied on a single company by the commission.

HD   EU/CONSUMERS - BEUC WELCOMES VOLKSWAGEN FINE BUT DEEMS THIS INDIVIDUAL MEASURE INSUFFICIENT.

COMMISSION SHOULD INTRODUCE CLOSE MONITORING OF ENTIRE AUTOMOBILE MARKET.

Brussels, 30/01/1998 (Agence Europe) - The European Bureau of Consumers' Unions (BEUC) is pleased that, in response to complaints from consumers, the Commission has decided to impose a heavy  fine on Volkswagen (see Europe of 29 January, p. 14), which deliberately attempted to deprive consumers of the benefits of the single market by preventing them from taking advantage of the more competitive prices applied in other Member States. According to the BEUC, this decision clearly illustrates the illegality of the Volkswagen group's actions, but it maintains that the  European Commission should be more vigilant and tougher towards automobile manufacturers guilty of such distortions of Community law. Following are the BEUC's demands, as set out in a statement:

TD
1. Aware that the Commission based its decision on the complaints of consumers to whom Italian dealers had refused to sell cars, the BEUC wants the Commission to conduct a careful examination of the entire Volkswagen distribution network to ensure that similar illegal practices are not committed in other Member States by dealers acting on  Volkswagen's orders.

2. As this type of irregularity is not exclusive to  Volkswagen, but constitutes current practice by many automobile manufacturers (according to the BEUC, which cites consumers' complaints to their representative organisations and investigations proving that manufacturers and dealers refuse to sell or create obstacles to the sale of cars to consumers from other Member States), the Commission cannot be satisfied with responding to complaints nor delay so long in taking measures. The Commission must take preventive action by introducing close monitoring of the entire market to determine whether the Member States are enforcing competition rules correctly and whether car manufacturers are complying with them. The BEUC emphasises that seeking redress for losses from national authorities, as the Commission has indicated that c
onsumers may do, is by no means a genuine or practical solution for individual consumers.
3. Beyond this global monitoring of

the market, the Commission must intervene whenever the difference in price for the same car differs significantly and unjustifiably from one Member State to another, as is currently the case, since the most recent price list published by the Commission (on 1 May) indicates price differentials of up to 20% for 43 of the 75 models surveyed. Such discrepancies would justify an investigation to determine whether the observed price increases are related to an agreement on prices or to other illegal activities on the part of manufacturers.

The BEUC reiterates its opposition to the block exemption Regulation for the automobile sector, taking the view that the exclusive and selective distribution system authorised by this Regulation constitutes an significant obstacle to the completion of the single market for cars, for three reasons: it allows automobile manufacturers to continue to segment the market; it restricts competition; and it is detrimental to consumers forced to pay high prices. Therefore, the BEUC claims, it should be abolished.

HD   EU/COMPETITION - VOLKSWAGEN CONTESTS EXISTENCE OF "SYSTEMATIC" INFRINGEMENT OF EUROPEAN LAW.

Brussels, 30/01/1998 (Agence Europe) - As announced in yesterday's issue of Europe (pp. 8-9), the Volkswagen group intends to appeal the  European Commission's decision to fine it ECU 102 million for creating obstacles to the smooth functioning of the single market in automobiles. Volkswagen described this sanction as "completely disproportionate" and denied having "systematically" prevented its Italian dealers from selling cars to foreign nationals.

TD
In a statement, the  Volkswagen group declared that "there could be no question of systematic infringement of (competition) rules", as the group had always allowed sales to individual customers; it opposed only trafficking in re-imported cars by intermediaries. On 21 January, the group's managers met with Commissioner Karel Van Miert "to appeal, if necessary, to the Court of First Instance of the EU to clarify the difference in opinion on the essentials of the case as well as on its legal aspects". "In the future", the group noted in its statement, "we must consult each other more closely to settle conflicts earlier".

The Federation of the German Automobile Industry, the VDA, has also contested the  fine, claiming that the amount "bears no relation to the small number of complaints" filed in Brussels. VDA President Bernd Gottschalk maintained that the industry is fully aware of consumers' right to buy cars wherever they wish. The industry respects competition rules, in particular the ban on market segmentation, he said, citing as proof the "high rate of re-import" among new cars registered in Germany. According to the VDA, some
100,000 vehicles were re-imported into Germany in 1997. For the same year, the Federation of
Independent Automobile Importers estimated the number of vehicles reimported into the country at
500,000.

HD    COMPETITION POLICY - COMMISSION FINES VW A RECORD ECU 102m FOR UNFAIR SALES PRACTICES.

SN    European Report

LP
As expected, the European Commission formally announced on January 28 its Decision to  fine German car maker Volkswagen AG a massive ECU 102m (just over DM 200m) for persistent infringement of EU competition rules. The company had used its economic muscle for over 10 years to stop its Italian dealerships supplying both VW and Audi models for export to German and Austrian final customers, a Commission investigation found.  Volkswagen now has three months to pay the  fine and two months to put an end to the infringements in question. The Decision means the company will also automatically lose its right to benefit from the EU block exemption from normal competition rules accorded to exclusive car distribution arrangements. However, VW announced its intention to take the matter to the Court of Justice, claiming it had only sought to impede disruptive parallel imports by unauthorised dealers.
"Systematic" infringements.

TD
The ECU 102m  fine is equivalent to 10% of  Volkswagen's profits in the territories affected. The largest ever financial penalty inflicted by the EU watchdog on an individual company had been imposed in view of the fact that  Volkswagen's practices constituted an "extremely serious infringement of EU legislation, carried on systematically over a long period of time", and "threaten the normal functioning" of the Single Market, announced EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert in Brussels on January 28. VW is alleged to have sought to partition the Single Market by preventing EU customers enjoying the benefits of car prices up to 30% cheaper available in Italy. The Commissioner also indicated that VW's reluctance to cooperate with the inquiry and foot-dragging in ending the abuse - even though "they knew full well what they were doing" - had contributed to the severity of the  fine.

Commission investigations carried out at VW and Audi premises in Germany and at Autogerma, the company's import subsidiary, at Verona in Italy in Autumn 1995 had revealed a series of illegal practices, including:

* threatening some 50 dealers with termination of their contracts if they supplied foreign purchasers, and actually ending relations with a dozen dealers;

* systematic reduction of profit margins and bonuses obtainable by dealers who sold VW/Audi models outside their territory;
* rationing deliveries to Italian dealers (the company refused to supply some 8,000 cars in 1995 alone to
Italian dealerships which had obtained confirmations from Autogerma);

Incriminating evidence.

A Commission communique of January 28 quotes hard written evidence of  Volkswagen management's full awareness that they were breaking the rules. One note written by an Audi manager warned colleagues that deliberate blocking of re-imports from Italy "carries a certain risk". A note found at VW acknowledges that
Page 86 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
cutting bonuses to dealerships "is not compatible with the European regulation on car distribution, as its objective is to stop cross-border trade which the Commission is precisely trying to favour" and warns that "such measures may leave us open to a  fine".
Effects of the Decision.

Commission legal experts have advised that the Decision to  fine VW entails automatic loss of the protection afforded by the EU block exemption for vehicle distribution networks. Regulation Number
1475/95 provides for conditional exemption from the competition rules set out in Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty for the exclusive car dealer networks which are the norm in the motor industry. The Commission believes such limited restrictions on free competition benefit the consumer by allowing for a high standard
of quality guarantees, customer advice and maintenance work by specialised mechanics. However, since moves to stop tied dealerships selling to non-national dealers or individual foreign purchasers are banned by the Regulation, the relevant clauses in VW/Audi dealers' contracts may now be challenged before national courts in Italy, Germany or Austria, the experts stress. Some commentators believe legal challenges may also be levelled in other Member States where the car manufacturer is alleged to have maintained the same restrictive policy.

Volkswagen's defence.

Meanwhile, Volkswagen lost no time in protesting its innocence. A company spokesman called the  fine "incomprehensible and completely disproportionate", insisting VW had always intended to comply with EU law and had sought to clarify interpretations of the legislation in discussions with the Commission. The car maker had never sought to block sales to individuals, claimed the spokesman, adding that the intention had been to counter the "grey market in re-imported vehicles sold through unauthorised dealers".

The blocking action is quite legal and helps to protect the official dealer network in Germany and Austria, claims VW. Article 3 N degrees s 10 and 11 of EU Regulation 1475/95 allow car makers to block sales to non-authorised dealers and intermediaries outside the accredited network. Only restricting "the freedom of final users, mandated intermediaries or authorised distributors to obtain supplies from an enterprise of their choice within the network" is blacklisted under the block exemption rules.

Regarding the block exemption, the VW spokesman said its rights would be unaffected in practice. "It's simply a threat in the event we do not bow to the requirements imposed by Brussels within the next two months", he added.
Pros and cons.

The German Automobile Manufacturers' Association (VDA) has come out squarely behind  Volkswagen in its travails. On January 29, the VDA President Bernd Gottschalk called the  fine "overdone" in view of the small number of complaints received. He castigated the professional "re-importers" who tried to undercut the prices charged by authorised German car dealerships. On the other hand, the German-based Automobilclub Europe welcomed the  fine on VW. Car enthusiasts have the right to shop around for the best price in Europe, said a spokesman.
BEUC attacks the block exemption.

BEUC, the EU consumer organisation, took the opportunity of reiterating its steadfast opposition to the entire existence of the block exemption for car dealerships. "The system allowed by the Regulation constitutes a major obstacle to the completion of the Single Market in cars", as it allows manufacturers to continue to segment the market, said a BEUC communique of January 28. Welcoming the  fine on VW, the consumer watchdog said  Volkswagen had clearly acted illegally in trying to prevent consumers benefiting from the Single Market, and also called on the Commission to investigate the massive price differentials prevailing between one Member State and another. Pointing to price differences of 20% or more on 43 out of 75 models listed in the most recent EU survey, BEUC asked the EU executive to verify that "price fixing" was not in fact the true cause of these anomalies.
More cases on the way?

Meanwhile Karel Van Miert hinted that other Decisions against major motor manufacturers may be in the pipeline. "Volkswagen will not be the only one" to be brought to book, warned the Commissioner. The EU executive is currently looking into a range of similar compliants levelled against Mercedes Benz in Belgium and Spain and Opel in the Netherlands.

Karel van Miert may not be a name that trips off the lips of millions. But perhaps it should be. For if anything can bring home the merits of the much-maligned  European Commission, it is Mr Van Miert's tough stance on monitoring the single market. Without a strong policeman to stamp out anti-competitive practices, the EU's bigger companies could all too easily abuse their position to the detriment of European consumers.

In his latest sally, the Belgian European commissioner has slapped a ECU 102m  fine on Volkswagen for allegedly bullying its Italian dealers into refusing to sell cars to non-Italian customers. Brussels was responding to protests from German buyers that they had been turned away from dealers in Italy, where prices are cheaper.

TD
While the  fine is large - double the previous record - it seems in line with the scale of the offence and the resources of the offender. VW is appealing against the verdict. But according to the commission, the group repeatedly bullied its Italian dealers into complying with its orders over 10 years, despite numerous complaints from consumers and two formal warnings from Brussels.

Motor companies are already in a privileged position with their special rights to exclusive dealerships. This block exemption from EU competition law was last renewed for seven years in 1995, despite protests from consumer groups which claim it distorts competition and boosts prices. The industry won the day, arguing that good after-sales service requires exclusive outlets. But companies are braced for defeat next time. The best they can expect is that the privileges will be phased out slowly. Companies which break the current rules - as VW has been found to have done - will only have themselves to blame if they get an even rougher ride in 2002 than they anticipate.

The advent of monetary union will raise the pressure for ending such impediments to cross-border trade. Consumers will easily compare prices. Not just motor groups, but also other companies will find it increasingly difficult to maintain cross-border price differences. A few industries might successfully delay price uniformity for a while - notably pharmaceuticals, where governments, the dominant buyers, themselves enforce different national price regimes. But even in drugs, there are moves to try to harmonise EU pricing.

Nevertheless it would be wrong to rely solely on the power of Emu to unify markets. As the VW case shows, there is no end to corporate ingenuity. Even with Emu, there will still be a big job for Mr Van Miert.

IN an act of calculated defiance against Germany, competition officials from Brussels will this week start price-fixing investigations against Mercedes and Opel.  Volkswagen has just been hit with a #70m  fine after a similar inquiry.

The move follows a decision by the  European Commission to call in a German television and telecoms merger for "deeper investigation", despite Chancellor Helmut Kohl's personal demand that it be approved.

TD
"There will be war between the Commission and Germany," Mr Kohl told the EU Commission president, Jacques Santer, in a phone call last month, the German news weekly Focus reports.

Mr Kohl has taken a personal interest in the blocked scheme by Deutsche Telekom and two German media giants, Bertelsmann and Kirch, to set up with Austria and Switzerland what they plan to be Europe's main digital pay-television network.

At almost every turn he finds himself running into the kind of trouble with Europe that used to be a British speciality. Even when Germany said it wanted sport excluded from the tough Brussels antitrust regime, the Belgian socialist commissioner Karel Van Miert insisted the rules must be followed.

There is worse to come. The Commission is planning action against Mercedes and Opel for reportedly discouraging non-German distributors from selling cars more cheaply to German customers who travel in search of bargains.

"What you are really seeing may be healthy in a way. It shows Germany becoming a normal country, using the Commission as a scapegoat just like other member states have done," suggests one Commission official. "Unification and the passing of the wartime generation means Germans feel less need always to be the nice guy of Europe."

As the man in charge of competition rules, Mr Van Miert has become the main target of German wrath. But his office has the figures to fend off German claims of bias. Year after year, they have blocked more state aid in France or Italy.

But to  Volkswagen, he and the Commission look vindictive. They forced the repayment of a #30m subsidy for a new VW plant from the former East German province of Saxony as an improper form of state aid. To the Commission, Germany looks like a problem, in part because of the special needs o f its struggling eastern regions.

But even in the west the German culture of subsidy is running up against a Commission which - agriculture aside - is dedicated to open competition in a single market.

EU studies of state aid show that between 1992 and 94, Germany was pumping nearly 3% of GDP - more than #1,200 a year for every German worker - into Europe's biggest subsidy machine. Estimates from Germany's own Kiel Institute of World Economics put the figure far higher. Including tax credits and special loans from state banks, they reckon the total subsidy cost could run as high as 10% of GDP.

Page 91 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But German unemployment is still stuck in double figures, which gives Mr Kohl's government little room to manoeuvre. Meanwhile, the dominant size of the German economy forces it to continue as the EU's main paymaster. British complaints about its 12% share of net payments to the EU budget look mean beside the 60% share paid by Germany.

And Mr Kohl is defying the polls and doubts of his central bankers to sink the mark into the gamble of the euro.

He complains the Commission is against him, making few concessions for the special case of a Germany grappling with unemployment and an eastern Germany which #500bn in subsidies has not yet hauled into parity with the west.

Not so, says the Commission. Germany was offered a waiver on the EU ban on state aid to shipyards because of the east's special case. Mr Kohl's government declined. But that was before unemployment hit 11%.

THE EUROPEAN Commission has fined Volkswagen Ecu101 million ($93 million) for breaking
European competition laws. This is the highest fine ever imposed by the EC against a single company.

The EC said  Volkswagen illegally prevented some of its Italian VW and Audi dealers from selling cars to people from outside Italy.

TD
The commission started investigating VW in 1995 after 36 Austrians complained that Italian dealers refused to sell them cars. The Austrians intended to buy the cars and import them to Austria, where the cars are more expensive. The practice is legal and explicitly protected by EU law.
"We have authorized our Italian dealers more than once to sell cars to consumers from any country," said
VW spokesman Hans-Peter Blechinger.

"They were also allowed to sell cars to regular  Volkswagen and Audi dealers," he said. "We only forbade them to sell to independent, free dealers."
In a statement VW said the  fine was "incomprehensible" and "out of proportion." Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the  fine reflected the fact that VW: Started its policy in 1987.

News for which space could not be found last week:
EP/Volkswagen:

TD
Werner Langen, Member of the European Parliament (EPP, Germany), declared that the

fine the European Commission has imposed on Volkswagen is justified and constitutes a
clear signal that other automobile manufacturers in Europe must apply a more transparent pricing policy. According to Mr Langen, the Commission has thus demonstrated that it wants to defend consumers' rights in the internal market more effectively.
EU/Kurds:
Human Rights Watch has expressed its concern about the Action Plan adopted by the
General Affairs Council of 26 January to stem the influx of Turkish immigrants.
According to the organisation, the plan contains a few positive elements, in particular as concerns improvements to humanitarian aid, but its main objective is to limit access to the territory of the EU, which could seriously affect the right of asylum.
Council of
Europe/Refugees: Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, criticised European countries' "restrictive interpretations of the concept of refugee" before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and affirmed that the "management of movements of mixed population groups, including refugees and economic migrants,
requires a multidisciplinary approach linking immigration and refugee issues to cooperation for development and political action".
EU/transparency: A survey of companies, trade
associations and consultancies conducted by the Society of European Affairs Practitioners (SEAP) has revealed, as SEAP President Rogier Chorus noted, that many European affairs professionals find the EU Council a "closed shop" where access to documents and people
is very difficult. SEAP, which carried out the survey in advance of discussions with the

European Commission, European Parliament and Council of Ministers concerning the

future of lobbying in the European institutions, also observes that the Council is lagging
behind the Commission and the Parliament in the use of the Internet, which could improve its communication with the public.
EBRD: Jacques de Larosiere, before leaving his
job as President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development without a successor having been named, noted that "this bank deserves a good President, and deserves one now". Speaking before journalists in London, he criticised the European Union for failing to appoint his replacement. The first Vice-President of the EBRD, American Charles Frank, will head the bank on an interim basis.
Financial crisis in
Asia: The Director-General of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, told "Le Nouvel Economiste" magazine that Chinese officials had "assured" him that they would not devalue their currency.
EP/Forza Italia:Forza Italia MEP Ernesto Caccavale
described the decision taken in Italy to suspend him from Silvio Berlusconi's movement for three months "illegitimate" and denied allegations that he had behaved in a way that was "critical and harmful to the image" of Forza Italia.
EP/Health: MEP Danilo
Poggiolini (EPP, Italy), author of a report on a Community action programme for people affected by Alzheimer's disease, accompanied by other Italian elected officials, met with Dr. Luigi La Bella. who has recently received a great deal of attention (and also excited controversy) in Italy for his method of cancer treatment. This method is also effective against Alzheimer's and other ailments of the nervous system, according to Mr Poggiolini, a former President of the Order of Physicians in Italy.
EU/Berlin: The Burgomaster
of Berlin, Mr Diepgen, recently discussed the problem of harbouring of refugees in the EU Member States and the fight against crime, a problem of concern to many Berliners, with European Commissioner Anita Gradin in Brussels. He also addressed the role of structural funds with Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, in the hope that Berlin will continue to benefit
from funding under Objectives 1 and 2. WHO: Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former
Prime Minister of Norway, will succeed Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan as Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO). A doctor by training and author of a report on sustainable development that served as the basis for discussions at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Mrs Brundtland was elected by 18 votes to 14.

Most of Europe's history in this tumultuous century, from the war that launched the Bolshevik coup d'etat in 1917 to Hitler's war and then the Cold War, has been the result of the inability of successive generations of European statesmen to find an answer to the German question.

The Cold War may have been the best, and it was certainly the most stable, attempt to deal with the possibility that a united Germany would always be powerful enough to threaten the domination of Europe, without ever quite being wise enough to pull it off. The Cold War division of Germany, along with the supervision of U.S. troops garrisoning one end of Europe and Russians the other, was a dreadful, if effective, solution.

TD
The German question is now being put again, in a far more civilized and democratic manner, in part because of the internal tensions stoked by unemployment running at 11 percent. But another factor is at work, because the German way of running the economy is increasingly clashing with the
free-market rules of the  European Commission in Brussels.

Last week,  Volkswagen was hit by a fine of $111 million for price fixing to stop German customers from buying their VW cars in Italy, where they are cheaper. Mercedes and Opel are now in the commission's sights.  Volkswagen last year was ordered to repay a $50 million subsidy from the provincial government of Saxony because the money to build a new plant was considered illegal state aid.

Now comes another row. The  European Commission has targeted yet another German television and telecoms merger for "deeper investigation," despite German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's personal demand that it be approved.

Kohl has taken a personal interest in the new scheme of Deutsche Telekom and the two German media giants, Bertelsmann and Kirch, to join Austria and Switzerland to create what they plan to be Europe's dominant digital pay-television network. It would serve all of Europe's 90 million German speakers. Kohl, whose concern for the German media is sharpened by the difficult election he faces this year, insisted that the deal go through. Now the commission has blocked it yet again.

At almost every turn, the German chancellor finds himself running into the kind of trouble with Europe that used to be a British specialty. Even when Germany said it wanted sport, and soccer in particular, excluded from the tough Brussels antitrust regime, the EU Commission last week insisted that sport too must follow the rules.

Kohl complains that this is no way to treat the most loyal EU member. Kohl is defying the opinion polls and the doubts of his central bankers to sink the reliable Deutsche mark into the big gamble of the single currency.

The dominant size of the German economy forces it to continue as the EU's main paymaster, forking out 30 percent of the EU budget while receiving less than 15 percent of EU spending.

Kohl insists this cannot go on, in part because of the $100 billion a year the country has been investing in the struggling regions of the old East Germany. The Kiel Institute of World Economics puts the total cost of Germany's subsidy culture, including tax credits and special loans from state banks, as high as 8 percent of GDP.

Until a few days ago there was an uneasy truce between the European car industry and the  European   Commission in Brussels.

But last week Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, shattered the calm by imposing a  fine of ECU 102m ( #68m) on  Volkswagen, Germany's biggest carmaker, and its upmarket subsidiary Audi. It was the stiffest penalty ever imposed by European Union competition authorities on an individual company.

TD
VW's crime was to order its Italian dealers not to sell models to Germans and Austrians - a move affecting only a clutch of determined bargain-hunters. But in doing so, VW violated the terms of a special agreement between the Commission and the car industry which exempts car manufacturers and importers from certain anti-trust rules.

The so-called block exemption allows carmakers to sign exclusive or restricted distribution arrangements with dealers, giving them strong control over prices.

When the system was renewed three years ago, a limited degree of competition was introduced, including the strict condition that car dealers had to be allowed to sell vehicles to customers from outside their territories, in keeping with the spirit of Europe's single market. Hence the severity of VW's  fines.

Not only will the company have to dig deep into its pockets, it may also find that its misdemeanours have tipped the balance in favour of scrapping the car industry's special status altogether. "If we find out that more car companies have been cheating the system in such a blatant fashion, then the car industry can kiss goodbye to its block exemption," said a competition official yesterday.

There is a strong possibility that Brussels will indeed uncover further abuses. A year ago Commission officials raided the offices of Mercedes-Benz and General Motors' Opel subsidiary in Germany, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands. If the evidence seized is conclusive, the companies can expect the same treatment as that meted out on VW.

All such incidents will be taken into account when the Commission begins a review of the car industry's special status next year, ahead of the 2002 expiry date for the block exemption.

The VW case has fuelled the indignation of consumer groups, who say the system serves only to protect the manufacturers. Last week, BEUC, the European consumers' organisation, urged the Commission to scrutinise the car industry's activities more closely.
"Price lists show that there are still enormous differences in the price of the same car sold in different EU
countries," the organisation said.

The car industry is likely to push for its special status to be extended. VW, which has appealed against the fines, is in no doubt that the system of exclusive dealerships should continue after 2002.

Mercedes-Benz also denies any wrongdoing. Dieter Zetsche, board member for sales and marketing, said that his company had a narrow price spread of around 10% in Europe and that "we are very sure that we have not acted in an illegal way" to discourage buyers shopping around.

The car industry argues that it is subject to the whim of exchange rate fluctuations and hugely different taxation regimes between the member-states. "From a technical point of view, a single market for cars exists. For example, technical standards have been harmonised," said Marc Greven, the legal adviser to ACEA, the European car manufacturers' association. "But if you look at other business and economic conditions such as currencies and taxation, there is no such thing."

Even if the industry does secure an extension of the regime, the introduction of the single European currency in most EU member states next year will put a heavy downwards pressure on price differentials.

Whatever the obstacles, there will be no stopping consumers from making straightforward price comparisons between models sold in one country from models sold anywhere else.

constitutional convention 1998
No business for a president

TD
The Constitutional Convention, in its opening days in Canberra, steered away from resolutions that might worry business. It quickly scotched a move by the Real Republic group that could have had far-reaching implications for business: that the convention should widen its ambit to discuss the incorporation of rights to decent living and working conditions, social justice and equality, indigenous rights and respect for the environment.

Real Republic representative Moira Rayner said a much higher proportion of people support a bill of rights than support a republic. That was well defeated, but provision was made for discussion on February 6 of expansion of the preamble, potentially to include indigenous rights. The more radical republicans also managed to keep alive - though only just - the possibility of a directly elected head of state which, according to pollsters, most people want. This goes further than the proposal by Malcolm Turnbull's Australian Republican Movement for a head of state appointed by Parliament, although with provision for nominations by the public.

The bother for business in a popular election is the risk of a mandate rivalling the Prime Minister's, and bringing corresponding uncertainty in policy. How to obviate that became a main theme of the early sessions.

By throwing out proposals to widen the head of state's powers, delegates narrowed the options to variations on the present range of powers held by the Governor-General.
Mission improbable

If some mission statements were not so damned earnest they would be laughable. Most of those curious lists of pseudo-religious values that companies take as gospel these days are either bleeding obvious or just stupid. Take this latest gem from the once Big Australian, BHP, which is seeking a senior taxation officer for its steel products and integrated steel divisions. The job, as can easily be pictured, is for someone to ensure that the division pays just the right amount of tax, not a cent more than is due, not a cent less.

However, someone at head office has decreed that all appointments shall have an inspirational goal. The tax officer's job description comes complete with a vision to be "the world's best supplier of quality corporate taxation services".

Someone in BHP has obviously taken the "world's best" part of the company's mission statement and seen how far it can be stretched.

As if that isn't bad enough, the new employee dispensing readings from various sections of the tax act must be "an enthusiastic professional with excellent interpersonal skills".

Building market share

Australia's biggest builders of homes are using their marketing and finance clout to boost market share. According to a survey by the Housing Industry Association, the top 100 residential builders took their share of housing starts to 35% in 1996-97 from 31% in the previous year. The top 10 went from a 10.9% share to
14.1%. The rankings are due for a shake-up next year. Builders such as Meriton and Multiplex rely heavily on projects for multi-unit dwellings, a category that will be affected by the events in Asia.

Week in review
Indicators
Australia records an $880-million deficit in the December trade balance, following the November surplus of
$509 million, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Imports of goods and services rose and the
Asian economic crisis affected exports. The ABS reports that total housing approvals grew by 0.8% in
December.

Run-up to the Games

Those mad Hash House Harriers are planning big things for 2000, the year of the much more sober Sydney Olympics. Tasmania and the New South Wales Central Coast are bidding against each other, and Durban in South Africa, to hold Interhash 2000, the biennial world gathering of hashers.

One of the organisers of the Tasmanian bid, John "Honkers" Ellsmore, says Tasmania's special attraction is that the entrants will be venturing out of Hobart towards wilderness areas in the state's south-west.
Hashing, which Ellsmore says is seriously social, involves "hares" setting trails for the "hounds" in
non-competitive events. There are penalties and false trails to bring the fit ones (front-running bastards, or
FRBs) back to the pack, most of whom jog, shuffle or walk.

Thousands of hashers take part, and up to 40 trails will spread the field. Afterwards, there's lots of partying. Ellsmore says hashers are often described as drinkers with a running problem.

The Hash House Harriers were formed in Kuala Lumpur in 1938, and this year's Interhash in KL in October is expected to attract 6000 entrants (http://www.hhh.asn.au)
Rather super, really

Recent visitors to Sydney's North Shore suburb of Killara have remarked on a saintly glow on the cheeks of the neighborhood's residents. We can reveal that the positive energy radiating from the genteel denizens relates to the district's top position in the recent national savings tables. While the Government berates the wider populace for spending money on beer and skittles, the frugal few households in the Killara postcode are putting an average of $70.66 into superannuation accounts each week. A Spendinfo survey by the National Economics group also reveals that Killara's two main rivals are in the ACT: Manuka, where households save a weekly average of $68.14, and Mawson, where they are not far behind, with $63.98.

Curiously, the eastern Sydney suburb of Vaucluse rates fourth on the list with $63.25, but did not rate in the top 10 suburbs for taxpayers, as published in last week's BRW. At the bottom of the ladder is
Adelaide's Ferryden Park, where households average only $4.16 in super a week - less than one-sixteenth the money put into super each week in Killara.
Lawyers on tap

The prospect of the Webb Dock stoush in Melbourne moving into the court room is keeping several lawyers busy. The Federal Government has retained Dunhill Madden Butler partner Steven Amendola (who acted for it in the recent Rio Tinto dispute); the National Farmers Federation has Minter Ellison partners Michael Tehan and Richard West; and the stevedoring company Patrick is using Freehill Hollingdale & Page partner Graham Smith. The Maritime Union has an in-house lawyer in its Sydney national office who usually briefs barristers directly rather than using law firms (BRW believes the barrister in this case is Steve Crawshaw).
Kosher cookies

The Australian Jewish News notes that the United States biscuit maker Nabisco has signed a contract with the Orthodox Union, the international kosher certification group, to make its top-selling Oreos and other biscuits under approved kosher methods.

The newspaper points out that Arnotts has not followed suit, so Tim Tams and Teddy Bears are still not on the kosher list.
Cold judgment
The European Commission has been busy lately. Not only has it finedVolkswagen the equivalent of
$168 million for trying to maintain retail prices, but it has also ruled that icecream makers will no longer be
able to have their own freezers filled with only their brands in shops. The decision was made after a
complaint by Mars against Unilever.
Appealing place

Although it is sometimes known as the Rainbow Region, Lotus Land, and the birthplace of Australia's alternative society, the far north coast of New South Wales is also a tough place to do business. According to the chairman of the Centre for Economic Development, Ian Wisken, the region is struggling to attract large-scale investment because of the tendency to end up in the Land and Environment Court. Wisken notes that development is sorely needed: the region has had a big population increase in recent years, but also has the country's highest unemployment rate. Byron Shire Council holds the dubious distinction of having the highest number of appeals before the Land and Environment Court at any one time.
Gravy train?

Queenslanders must realise by now that a state election is on the way. Why else would the Premier, Rob Borbidge, be talking about a $32-million grand train to run between Brisbane and Cairns from December? The Great South Pacific Express will be a partnership between the State Government and Venice Simplon, the company that runs the Orient Express.
Business Book Reading
The Over 50s Investor, by Desmond Connelly (Wrightbooks), $19.95
Reviewed by Maureen Murrill
It is a bit strange when you pick up a book written with the primary aim of telling the over-50s league how
to protect and stretch their money, then have to search for any reference to the age pension or other forms
of assistance that come from the Department of Social Security.

Desmond Connelly was an associate professor at Melbourne University before he retired, as well as being a successful investor, so he would not have had any real need to come to terms with the DSS.

Connelly's book is aimed at people the Government is trying to cultivate: those who have planned so well that they have no need of pension benefits. The 16 chapters cover a wide range of investment, classes that the target readership should have heard about or had some experience in, or are investments that should be in a typical portfolio. There are cash and fixed-interest investments, shares, property, friendly society bonds, managed investments and an insight into how negative gearing works.

The book offers advice on what to look for in buying shares, delves into how much managed investments cost and reinforces the importance of the right timing.

Quote: "Genius is not a prerequisite for success in the task [investing your money shrewdly]. Nor is heavy expenditure on financial journals, newsletters, computer software, planners or advisors. It is within the ability of the average investor to seize the opportunity and profit from it. Most Over 50s can do it themselves."
Patent of the week
Mothers of inventions

James Bond's egghead armorer Q would surely enjoy the latest issue of the Australian Patent Abstracts Supplement, which is packed with time-saving devices that even the most sceptical double agent would enjoy.

Included with the latest really useful inventions is the garment with a plurality of pockets, in which the wearers (provided they have the back muscles of an ox) can carry a multitude of accessories.

Then there is the apparatus for projecting an object - almost any object - forward towards targets that the inventor has failed to nominate.

Best of all is the weapon system comprising a firearm and a non-lethal means for selectively ejecting a stream of fluid. No doubt the men in dark glasses at Asio are busy looking for visible ink to fill out the requisition forms.
ROTTEN LUCK

Details of HSBC's trading in Crown shares suggest that the fund manager has taken quite a bath on its casino investment. HSBC fell below a 5% shareholding on January 7 but only filed a detailed notice of ceasing to be a substantial shareholder at the end of January, after a nudge from a writ filed by the Australian Securities Commission. The notice shows that HSBC sold 1.5 million shares on January 5 for about 65Â¢ each, and almost eight million shares the next day for about 61Â¢ each. HSBC first bought Crown shares in the February 1994 float, at $1.20. It filed a notice of substantial shareholding in August last year, when Crown shares were about $1.95.

The European Commission has fined Volkswagen AG $93 million, the highest  fine it has ever imposed against a single company, for illegally preventing dealers in Italy from selling cars to people from outside the country.

The EC began investigating VW in 1995 after 36 Austrians complained that Italian dealers refused to sell them cars. The Austrians intended to buy the cars and import them to Austria, where the cars were more expensive. Cross-border shopping is explicitly protected by EU law.

TD
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the size of the  fine reflected the fact that VW had conducted "a systematic, covert operation endorsed by management" to bully its Italian dealers into refusing to sell to nonresidents of Italy.
VW began the practice in 1987 and had refused several warnings from the EC to stop, the
Commission said.
In a statement, VW called the  fine "incomprehensible" and "out of proportion" to the offense.

"We have authorized our Italian dealers more than once to sell cars to consumers from any country," said a VW. "We only forbade them to sell to independent, free dealers."

Brief items for which space was lacking in earlier editions:

TD
EU/anti-dumping policy: EuroCommerce has strongly criticized the proposals the Commission made in its recent Memorandum on anti-dumping policy, saying that they risked rendering the EU's trade policy "more protectionist and disconnected from democratic control of EU governments". In particular, the organization rejects the setting up of an independent body responsible for this policy, and the reversal of the "Council voting procedures so that the Commission could 'de facto' impose anti-dumping duties unless a majority of governments oppose them". According to EuroCommerce, however, within DGI a Directorate should be created for assessing the "Community interest", and a "trade harassment clause" should be included in the anti-dumping regulation (so as to avoid complaints that have been rejected being reintroduced), as well as providing for a "more realistic" deadline before granting "qualified" market economy status on Russia and China.

EU/Asem: the first European Union/Asia Cultural Forum organized in the context of the Asem dialogue was held in Paris on 5 February, in the presence of organizers of cultural events in the EU, Asean, China, Japan and korea. The aim is to set up cultural exchange networks between the two regions.

EP/competition: German Christian-Democrat Thomas Mann MEP regarded the steep  fine the European    Commission recently imposed on Volkswagen to be wholly justified but, stressing the importance of the recent disputes between the EU and Germany over State aid and subsidy fraud, said that one had to discard the suspicion of a certain "Germanophobia" on the part of those responsible for competition policy
in the European Commission.

EP/elections: British Conservative Edward McMillan-Scott MEP has called on the Home Secretary Jack Straw to make a priority of the voting rights of Britons living abroad during Britain's EU Presidency. The Euro-MP points out that less than 30,000 Britons living abroad registered to vote in the general elections of May 1997, whereas there are 250,000 Britons living in Spain alone.

EP/WTO:German Christian-Democrat Peter Kittelmann, who recently met WTO Director General Ruggiero, said that the European Parliament should obtain greater visibility than in the past at the Organization's next ministerial conference in Geneva.
EP/Armenia: German Social-Democrat Karin Jons said that the toppling of Armenian President
Ter-Petrossian, replaced by Prime Minister Kotscharian (considered as in favour of a hard line in the
conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabach) has not to jeopardize the chances of peace in the
Caucasus. The deputy-chair of the EP delegation for relations with the Transcaucasus calls on all parties to
respect the decisions taken by the OSCE on this.

EP/women: German Social-Democrat Lissy Groener welcomed the decision of the Council of Europe "finally" to set up a committee on gender equality. And she recalls that, the EP had created an ad hoc committee on women's rights in 1979 already, which then became a permanent committee in 1984.

Environment: last week, Margareet de Boer, Dutch Environment Minister signed the first purchase of air from abroad, with Romania, as provided for in the December Kyoto Agreement on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (according to which a country may help another reduce its emissions).

Portugal: the Portuguese Government has voted in a law allowing abortions in the first ten weeks of pregnancy, at the mother's request, which need to be addressed to family social centres. Up to now,

Page 109 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
abortion was only allowed in cases rape, serious illness or if the mother's life was at risk. Socialist Prime
Minister Guterres, himself against abortion, stayed away from the debate.

Germany: Mr. Bohl, minister in the Federal Chancellory, regarded as "ridiculous" the declarations of the Minister-President of Lower-Saxony, the Social-Democrat Mr. Schroeder, who said that, were he Chancellor, he would be prepared to move to Berlin immediately after the September elections. That would not make much sense, as the Bundestag may only leave Bonn after September 1999, Mr. Bohl
commented.

The Netherlands: Prince Maurits of the Netherlands, fifth in line for the throne, will have to seek Parliament's approval to marry Marylene van den Broek, daughter of European Commissioner Hans van den Broek, as she is a catholic and a commoner.

Europeans throughout the world: The Governing Board of "Europeans Throughout the World", which brings together those organizations which, in the EU, deal with the problems of their compatriots abroad, has, under the chairmanship of Enrique Baron MEP and on as proposal by its Secretary General Simon-Pierre Nothomb, added two new actions to its programme: the Alliance" action intended to forge links between cultural institutes of EU countries abroad, and the Euro action aimed at raising awareness of the
introduction of the single currency for EU citizens living in other parts of the world.

Federalists/France: Martine Meheut has been elected President of the Union for a Federal Europe - UEF France, replacing Albert Giorani.

Competition law must be reformed, argues Emma Tucker.

Europe's trustbusters are having a mid-life crisis. The European Union's competition authority turned 40 last month and showed its might by slapping a huge  fine on Volkswagen for anti-competitive behaviour. But after four decades of sweeping changes in the continent's economies, the EU's anti-trust watchdog is under strain.

TD
Publicly the stock of Karel Van Miert, the present commissioner in charge of competition policy, is high. Cases are pouring into his office as the number of cross-border mergers in Europe accelerates. For many companies, the EU competition authorities have become at least as important as domestic cartel offices, if not more so. Any merged company with a worldwide turnover of more than ECU 5bn ( #3.3bn) comes Mr Van Miert's way. So do all cases of state aid, in which national governments subsidise local companies.

Agriculture apart, competition is the one bit of the  European Commission which has day-to-day power to influence business decisions in Europe. And not only in Europe. Mr Van Miert's fans are still applauding his performance last summer when he wrung concessions from the US's Boeing over its
merger with McDonnell Douglas. Behind the scenes, however, companies are restless. They complain of legal uncertainty and unacceptable delays. The set of rules and procedures drawn up in the 1950s, and since adapted in piecemeal fashion, can no longer handle the volume and complexity of cases needing regulatory clearance in Brussels.

"The Commission is putting resources into regulating cases that don't actually restrict competition, which means that the cases that do need to be looked at are not being resolved efficiently," says Alec Burnside, head of the Brussels office of Linklaters, the law firm.

British brewers, such as Bass and Whitbread, would agree. They waited more than 10 years for preliminary clearance of exclusive beer supply agreements with tied pubs. Similarly, when Stelios
Haji-Ioannou, founder of the cut-price airline Easyjet, brought a case against KLM of the Netherlands, he complained that Brussels had acted too slowly to prevent no-frills airlines from being sat on by bigger rivals. An investigation into a cement cartel took five years.

The most glaring problem for the Commission is the sheer number of cases. This reflects Europe's increasingly integrated economies and the erosion, by inflation, of the thresholds above which anti-trust cases must be notified to Brussels.

By November last year, officials at the competition authority had been swamped with 147 mergers, compared with only 60 in 1992. In October, the backlog of cases awaiting clearance under articles 85 and 86 of the EU treaty (restrictive agreements and abuses of a dominant position) was 1,297. At the same time, 468 state aid decisions were pending.

To speed things up, the Commission has resorted to so-called "comfort letters" sent to companies giving preliminary clearance to contractual agreements, but promising nothing should a legal challenge arise.

The letters have no legal force, are not made public and do not state the Commission's reasons for reaching a decision. In 1996, 365 cases sent to Brussels under articles 85 and 86 were settled informally through the use of comfort letters. Only 21 were cleared formally.

"This informal approach is no longer sufficient," says Peter Plompen, chairman of the working group on competition law at Unice, the European employers' federation. "Companies are getting more and more sophisticated about competition law and want legal certainty."

It is not just the number of cases that is causing difficulties. They are becoming more complex, more controversial, and more likely to involve overseas competition bodies. This year promises to be even more demanding than the last. Two intricate global accountancy mergers await clearance; desk officers must unravel the giant Bertelsmann-Kirch-Deutsche Telekom merger threatening to strangle the digital pay-television market of the EU's German-speaking countries; the aviation industry awaits verdicts on airline alliances; and the newly liberalised and rapidly developing telecoms and multimedia market requires special attention.

Senior officials in Brussels recognise the need for reform. "There is a danger that the system will become unmanageable if we don't think now about modernisation," says Alexander Schaub, director-general of the competition body. "We have to make sure that we are only dealing with the cases that need to be dealt with."

One solution would be to increase the resources but there is no appetite among the member states to expand the Brussels bureaucracy. Other directorates, even those that are underworked, will stand firm against any shift of resources. Besides, there are those who believe the competition authority should get its house in order before being granted extra resources.

If the competition authority cannot grow, its workload must shrink. This means shaking off the cases that do not require the attention of Brussels. "It is no longer necessary for the Commission to enforce competition law as it did in the past," says Mr Plompen. "The world has changed. Europe is a far more integrated and dynamic market than it once was."

There has been some reform in this direction. Last year, for example, EU industry ministers raised no objections to a Commission plan to exempt some types of state aid below a certain threshold from the requirement to notify Brussels. The Commission also raised the level, measured by market share, below which agreements are automatically assumed not to be infringing EU anti-trust rules.

Neither move is dramatic. And business wants more. It is impatiently awaiting the results of a massive Commission consultation on how to regulate potentially anti-competitive agreements. The (thrillingly entitled) "Green Paper on Vertical Restraints" considers several options for revamping a system that takes a fairly narrow view of what restricts competition.
Modernisers in the Commission, who believe the vast majority of such agreements are not
anti-competitive, favour the radical option of reducing the scope of article 85. That would exclude an
array of deals and restrictive agreements from the requirement to notify Brussels. Pressure from
traditionalists, however, means the outcome is likely to be less radical.

Mr Van Miert and Mr Schaub are also considering introducing legally binding deadlines. The plan is inspired by the success of the Commission's merger regulation which sets tight, legally binding cut-offs: one month for a preliminary investigation, and a further four months when there are serious competition concerns. The results have been widely lauded by industry, which appreciates the speed and legal certainty of the system. The danger is that, unless deadlines are introduced across the board, some sections of competition policy will languish even longer than now.

Mr Van Miert has other plans for state aid, which has become a growing headache for the Commission as the level of subsidies, in particular in the EU's richer countries such as Germany and France, reaches record proportions. He has already announced an overhaul of EU regional state aid policy, by lowering the amount of subsidies governments can pay. He also wants to depoliticise a process open to extreme pressure from governments by making investigations more transparent and inviting formal comments from interested third parties.

Another way of giving Brussels more breathing space would be to delegate cases to national competition authorities, although industry - keen to be treated even-handedly - is wary of this option. "Parties may be worried that a case dealt with by the Greek competition authority will have a different outcome from one heard in Germany," says a Commission official.

All such ideas are enormously controversial. Traditionalists fear that, by delegating so much business, the Commission could open the door to anti-competitive practices. Even the strongest advocates for change recognise that reform will be slow.

"It is a huge project," admits a senior competition official. "We have to persuade member states that the system has to change not because we want less work, but because it makes sense."

The guardian of the EU's competition rules, Karel van Miert, tells Chris Johnstone why he gets satisfaction from his job
KAREL van Miert can perhaps congratulate himself on being in the right place at the right time.

TD
If former  European Commission President Jacques Delors had been given the power to hire and alter his team

in 1989, the youthful-looking Flemish Socialist would not have been part of it. "He would have preferred Willy de Clercq to stay on," says Van Miert, referring to his predecessor as Belgium's European Commissioner. "When you do not know people, you prefer selecting the ones you know."

But the vagaries of politics in Belgium and the practice of rotating the honour between the main political parties meant that the Belgian nominee had to be a Socialist and there was nothing Delors could do as Van Miert directed himself towards the transport dossier and embarked on his mission to launch the liberalisation of European aviation.

In one of several ironies which have punctuated his career - which some might say include his present job - Van Miert turned into one of Delors' closest collaborators round the Commission table. They still talk to each other regularly.

Nine years after he arrived at the Commission and with five years under his belt as one of the institution's most public and, arguably, powerful figures, Van Miert is now among the few remaining survivors from the 1989 intake, alongside Sir Leon Brittan, Martin Bangemann and Manuel Marin.

Volkswagen, British Airways, Credit Lyonnais, Boeing and other companies which have recently been on the receiving end of Van Miert's highly personal mission to police corporate fair play have an unlikely source to thank for his extended stint as Competition Commissioner.
In sabotaging Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's bid for the Commission presidency, former
UK Prime Minister John Major guaranteed that Van Miert would stay on until the year 2000.

The Commissioner, who currently teaches for a few hours a week at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, has no plans to return to Belgian politics when he leaves his current post, and appears to be looking forward to a life outside the institution. "I will be 58 in January 2000. There are many other interesting things in life besides politics," he says. "I am really thinking in terms of teaching at the university and having more time to spend in the garden."

He is, however, still keeping his career options open. "If, perhaps, a new challenge occurs for which I am well motivated, I would certainly think about it. It is too early," he explains, adding: "Even with some university activities, I think I would be a happy man."

He openly admits that the Commission's 'big job' is 'not on the cards'. "Let's be realistic. If you want to be president, then you must behave otherwise than I have in this job," he comments.

Van Miert is not worried that the high-profile punishment of Europe's biggest carmaker  Volkswagen (it received a record 102-million-ecu  fine for preventing Germans from shopping across the Alps in Italy for cheaper cars), continued arguments with Paris about the latest subsidy conditions for Credit Lyonnais,

Page 114 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and a long-standing altercation over Italy's telecoms liberalisation are losing him too many political friends at the same time.

"It is a love-hate relationship. One week governments are enraged you have taken a decision against them, the next they say you have not done enough against someone else," he explains.

Although he does not retreat from a fight, the Commissioner protests that he does not relish them either. "Two years ago we warned  Volkswagen that they were in breach of the law. We tried to avoid a clash and do things in another way."

The same was true of Bertelsmann's cable television ambitions. "With Microsoft, we were happy that they agreed with us on what was necessary to stop an infringement," he adds.

The actual work involved, rather than threats and political difficulties, appears to have more of an effect on Van Miert's assessment of different cases. By this measure,  Volkswagen was a relatively easy example. "We got more evidence than we believed we would ever find," he explains.

However, the difficulties encountered and the heavy workload which faced the Commission at the time when it was trying to push ahead with its investigation of Dutch airline KLM's attempts to remove rival easyJet from the London-Amsterdam market were factors in the decision to abandon the case once easyJet dropped its complaint.

"You must decide on priorities. We could have tried to pursue the case, but it would have been difficult to establish," explains the Commissioner.

With a fast-growing case-load but a slower increase in staff, such choices are becoming more difficult - and the European Court of Justice still requires the same standard of proof in order to uphold penalties imposed by the Commission.

In an effort to give his staff more time to concentrate on the main cases, Van Miert says he will continue his campaign to tidy up EU competition rules over the next two years - adding that the widening of the Union to embrace countries in central and eastern Europe is one of the main catalysts for reform.

As part of the process, deadlines for decisions on state subsidy cases and a list of clear rights for companies when they make complaints will be issued soon.

Van Miert admits, however, that attempts to offload some of the competition case-load on to national courts did not relieve as much of the burden as was first hoped.

French car-buyers from Paris were encouraged to head for the national courts when they were refused the right to buy cheaper cars in Lyon. British competition authorities were urged to deal with the issues concerning 'tied' pubs. But both dossiers boomeranged back to Brussels.

The media and emerging information society are seen as a fruitful source of cases for the next few years. Van Miert's current tussles with the sports world over questions such as who should be allowed to own the primary and secondary broadcasting rights for competitions and under what conditions, also involve highly complex issues.

"We have received many complaints and the evolution of ownership is different from one country to another. Clearly you must treat the Olympic Games in one way and Formula One in another. We have been called to sort it all out," says Van Miert.

Turning his attention to Union enlargement, the Commissioner warns that despite the problems faced by candidate countries, the competition rules will not be waived for their benefit. "Competition rules should apply from day one. There may be some transition regimes for certain sectors, but the rules must
apply," he insists.

Van Miert also predicts that within the next ten years, the foundations for a world competition authority should have been laid, perhaps as an offshoot of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

He adds that the WTO's rebuttal of Kodak's claims that the Japanese market was closed to it has helped warm the US government to the idea that a separate body is needed to look at the actions of companies. Initially, such a body could be the forum for dealing with issues like export and world-wide cartels.

IF HE does call it a day in December 1999, Van Miert will have no complaints about his time at the Commission. "The last ten years have been extremely interesting. Many things have happened, such as the single market, telecoms liberalisation, and co-decision for the European Parliament, which I would not have believed possible at the start," he says.
Page 115 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nor does time appear to have dulled his enthusiasm for the Commission as an institution and an engine for further integration.

"Compared to national ministers, you have time to get things done. When I was Commissioner in charge of transport, I saw four or five different national ministers come and go from Germany, France and the UK. We were able to develop policy. As Commissioners, we are in a privileged position - it is a more stable mandate."

BRUSSELS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Europeans thinking about buying a new car could save themselves big money, if not time, by shopping around for the best bargain in the 15-nation bloc, a  European              Commission survey showed on Friday.
For example, a Briton interested in getting a VW Polo would pay up to a third less for the same car in
Portugal, according to a six-monthly report on car prices.

TD
Despite the EU's single market and planned economic and monetary union (EMU), differences in pre-tax prices between various EU countries continued to widen for most car models.

Britain, whose currency surged in 1997, was the most expensive market for 61 of the 72 best-selling models in the EU, according to the report, which compared car prices across the EU on November 1 last year.
In contrast, the Netherlands had the lowest prices for 35 models.

Price differences of more than 20 percent for the same car model had been found for all manufacturers in the EU, except for Audi, which is part of the  Volkswagen group.

"The difference between the lowest and the highest price for these models has increased in most cases," it said. For 16 of the 72 models, prices varied by more than 40 percent.

In a statement, the Commission also accused "some" manufacturers of putting obstacles in the way for so-called "parellel trade" in markets where consumers try to benefit from lower prices.

Under EU rules, car makers are allowed to operate selective distribution networks, but cannot prevent dealers from selling to individuals who want to take advantage of cheaper prices.

Determined to clamp down on any such practices, the Commission last month  fined Volkswagen a record 102 million Ecus ($110 million) for allegedly barring its Italian distributor from selling cars to people living in Germany and Austria.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), the lobby group of the European car industry, said the EU survey clearly showed that a narrowing of prices could not be achieved without currency stability and tax harmonisation.
High British prices were a result of the strength of the pound.

The Netherlands and Portugal, with the lowest pre-tax prices in the Commission's survey, also had some of the highest car taxes in the EU, ACEA said in a statement.

"The single market and the introduction of the euro are prerequisites for a real convergence in prices in the European Union," ACEA said.

ACEA director for legal affairs Marc Greven said a growing number of people went to another EU
country to buy their cars.

Page 117 of 126 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
For example, he said between five and 10 percent of the registered cars in France and Germany were bought in another country. "This number has been growing recently," he said.

The Commission said a properly working single market, in which goods are supposed to flow freely, should lead to price adjustments when currencies rise or fall.
The price of some models such as Nissan, Audi and Suzuki had also been cut in Britain, which the
Commission said was an "appropriate response" to the strength of the British currency.

"However, most manufacturers have either not adjusted their prices, or have, in fact raised them for some of their models, thus continuing to realise 'windfall' profits," it said.

The strength of sterling is continuing to drive up car prices in the UK compared with other European Union countries and is fuelling demands from British consumers to be able to buy right-hand-drive cars elsewhere in the EU, the  European Commission says.

The Commission's latest six-monthly survey of car prices across the EU, conducted in November, showed that, after converting prices into ecus, the UK was the most expensive place to buy 61 out of 72 models surveyed.

TD
Six months earlier, UK prices were highest for only 54 models and a year earlier for only 15 models.

As in previous surveys, the cheapest place to buy cars was the Netherlands, which had the lowest prices for 35 of the best-selling models, and Portugal, cheapest in 14 cases.

The EU's Brussels-based executive said yesterday it was receiving "continual complaints" from British consumers wanting to buy right-hand-drive cars in other, cheaper markets and warned manufacturers they had to make such cars available.

Under EU competition rules, the Commission said, carmakers were obliged to make such models available to dealers wishing to sell them and it would "not hesitate to take proceedings" against manufacturers failing to respect these rules.

Brussels is strengthening efforts to create a genuine single European market in cars. It imposed record fines of ECU 102m ( #68m) last month on  Volkswagen, Germany's largest car producer, after VW dealers in Italy were found to be refusing to sell cars to buyers from outside that country. Competition officials have also investigated the sales practices of Mercedes-Benz and General Motors' Opel subsidiary in some European markets.

The latest car price survey shows, however, that differentials have widened in the past six months, due mainly to currency movements. For 16 of the 72 models, prices varied by more than 40% across the EU.
Price differences of more than 20% were found for all manufacturers, except Germany's Audi.
The biggest differences between the highest and lowest EU prices were for the VW Polo, at 54.3%, the
Ford Escort/Orion, at 45.4%, and the Peugeot 306, at 44.2%.

Brussels claims its price reports underline the need for the single European currency, which it says is the only way to avoid currency fluctuations leading to price differences.

But it added that even without a common currency, in aproperly functioning single market currency movements should eventually be reflected in price adaptations. The latest report found evidence of this happening, with Nissan, Audi and Suzuki lowering prices in the UK.

BRITISH motorists are getting a raw deal from car makers despite the strength of sterling according to new survey which shows the UK is still the most expensive place in Europe to buy a car.

And although Europe is supposed to be a single market Britons still face overwhelming obstacles to shopping around for bargains on the continent. Dealers are either flouting their obligation to supply
right-hand drive models or are simply refusing to sell to foreigners, the  European Commission found.

TD
For 61 of the 72 best-selling models covered by the study prices in the UK were highest. The biggest difference was on a  Volkswagen Polo which costs around 30 per cent more than in most other EU countries and 54 per cent more than in Portugal.

The strength of sterling ought to have driven car prices down the commission said, yet it found that most car-makers have not only failed to cut prices in Britain in response to the rise in sterling but have raised them to cash in on windfall profits.

The cheapest cars according to he study are to be had in the Netherlands and Portugal, and the difference between prices in these countries and those at the other end of the scale is widening, said the commission - which carries out checks every six months.

British car prices are highest the study shows for luxury, medium and small cars alike. A top of the range BMW 316 i for example costs 22 per cent more in Britain than across the channel in Belgium or 30 per cent more than in Holland. The differential also applies for small cars: the gap in price between a Toyota Starlet in Belgium or Luxembourg and in Britain is over 40 per cent.

Brussels recently declared war on  Volkswagen which after a lengthy investigation was found to be illegally preventing German citizens from buying cheaper cars from Italian dealers. VW was hit with the biggest fine ever imposed on a company by the EU but the latest survey confirms suspicions that such practices as well as price-fixing are widespread in the industry.

The commission said it was receiving "continual complaints" from British consumers who want to buy abroad to save money but find it impossible to order right-hand drive models. Yesterday, it warned manufacturers that right-hand drives must be available throughout the EU to dealers who want to sell them and warned it would take legal enforcement action.

Ursula Pachl of the European Consumers' Organisation said  Volkswagen-style tactics were the main obstacle for British motorists hunting for cheaper cars on the continent. "Dealers will either tell you they cannot supply a right-hand drive model, or that the delivery time will be excessive or they will just refuse to sell you a car".

Under the EU's single market rules, consumers have a right to buy a car anywhere in the bloc and import it into their own country. But administrative and bureaucratic obstacles are still hampering what the commission calls "parallel trade".

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Germany's Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) will pay a 200 million Deustche mark (DEM) fine ordered earlier by the European Commission, VW's head of German sales told the German daily newspaper Handelsblatt.

The commission charged the German carmaker with restrictive sales practices in the Italian market, Peter Giffhorn told the newspaper.

But this decision didn't change VW's plans to appeal the commission's judgment before the European
Court of Justice, Giffhorn said in the interview - to be published Tuesday.

Sticking to its practice in the past, VW will continue to deliver new cars exclusively to authorized VW dealers, Handesblatt reported. Giffhorn denied earlier reports that the commission's  fine would cause VW to give up its selective sales practices, the daily said. Only decisions taken by national courts could prohibit such practices, the article said.

A VW spokesman, asked to comment on the interview Monday, said "The general practice of the company is not to comment on pre-released copies" of media reports.

FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

The European Commission has imposed a fine of ECU 102m ($112m) on  Volkswagen-the largest ever on a single company-for pressuring its Italian dealers not to sell cars to German and Austrian nationals in search of cheaper prices than those available at home.

Explaining the reasons for this draconian sanction, EU competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said: "It was a very elaborate system, under control of the management, and  Volkswagen was fully aware that it was committing a large number of infringements."

Following an "avalanche" of complaints by consumers, the Commission carried out dawn raids on various VW premises in October 1995, and discovered evidence that the company had threatened to terminate contracts with 50 dealers who were selling to non-Italian residents, and had actually done so in 12 cases.

The company had used the chassis numbers from German vehicle registrations to trace back vehicles to the dealer who sold them. The size of the  fine was intended to reflect the gravity and duration of the offence, which began in 1987 and escalated in 1993 despite repeated warnings.

Volkswagen said it would appeal the Commission's decision to the Court of First Instance, describing the penalty as "completely disproportionate". The company declared "there could be no question of systematic infringement" of the competition rules.

German car maker Volkswagen intends to go ahead with its Court challenge to the ECU 102m  fine imposed by the European Commission on January 28, but will meanwhile pay the  fine and take steps to end the practices condemned by the EU executive, a company spokesman indicated on February 17. The spokesman said that VW will transfer the full amount before the end of April, as required by Decision of the Commission, but will file a suit before the European Court of First Instance by March 28 contesting the fairness and proportionality of the penalty.

TD
The EU executive announced the  fine, equivalent to 10% of VW's annual net profit and the biggest ever imposed on an EU company by the competition watchdog, after finding the company to be in persistent breach of Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty in refusing to allow German and Austrian nationals to benefit from lower sales prices on VW models in Italy (for details see European Report Number 2287). Volkswagen management maintain they have always complied with the letter of Community legislation governing distribution agreements for motor vehicles, but that they will - "should it be necessary" - write to their VW and Audi franchise dealers in the 15 Member States warning them not to prevent sales to any customer on grounds of nationality. The company will work to ensure it does not infringe Community law "as we have consistently done in the past", said the spokesman.

VW's $170m dilemma --  Volkswagen has been in a spot of trouble with the  European Commission but it plans to appeal against the $170 million  fine imposed by the EC for alleged anti-competitive sales practices in Italy. The maker was accused of threatening to take franchises from Italian VW dealers for selling cars to non-Italians. Italy has some of Europe's lowest car prices because of its weak currency, and attracts German and Austrian buyers in particular.
A tyre for your thoughts

No such thing as a plain old invitation-in-an-envelope any more. To the launch by German-tyre manufacturer Continental of what it described as "a new global tyre initiative" that it says "will have significant impact on our domestic market" we get a bright yellow invitation big enough to choke a Mini and the whole darn tyre with it. A brand new one to boot. Except that it will probably only fit a Morris Minor. Pity, when you own a 4WD.
