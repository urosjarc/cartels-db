Intel Corp. on Wednesday rejected a European Commission (EC) ruling of imposing heavy  fines on
the world's largest computer chip maker for antitrust violations, saying the EC decision is "wrong" and the
company will appeal, Xinhua reported.   The European Commission Wednesday fined Intel 1.06 billion
euros (1.45 billion U.S. dollars) for violating European antitrust rules and also ordered Intel to cease the
illegal practices immediately.   In a statement issued after the ruling, Intel's chief executive officer (CEO)
Paul Otellini said the company "takes strong exception" to European Commission's decision.   "We
believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace --
characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices, " Otellini said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.

TD
Intel will appeal." he added.   The  European Commission said it has found that  Intel engaged in
specific forms of illegal practices such as giving rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they
bought all or almost all of their chips from  Intel.     Intel CEO Otellini defended the company's practices,
insisting that "Intel never sells products below cost."   He said  Intel has consistently invested in
innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology.   "The result is that we can
discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers
everywhere the efficiencies of being the world's leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors," Otellini
said.    The European Commission ruling was welcomed by Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD),
which had filed antitrust complaints against  Intel in Europe and in the United States.   "Today's ruling is
an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," Dirk Meyer, AMD's chief executive
officer, said in a statement.   "AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are
looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Meyer
noted.

In a landmark ruling, the  European Commission on Wednesday slammed chipmaker  Intel with a record $1.45 billion  fine for using illegal monopolistic practices.

The commission found  Intel guilty of manipulating rebates to unfairly restrict computers equipped with microprocessors by rival Advanced Micro Devices from reaching Europe.

TD
Intel CEO Paul Otellini said the company would appeal. He issued a statement saying  Intel "takes strong exception" to the ruling but declined to discuss the rebates.

In the culmination of an investigation that began in 2000, regulators found nothing wrong with  Intel offering rebates per se, Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds says. The sanction hinged on evidence that Intel threatened to, in effect, withhold rebates from certain PC makers and retailers if they declined to shun computers using AMD chips. "The illegal practice wasn't reflected in any contracts," Reynolds says. "It was happening behind closed doors."

Intel's fine surpassed the $613 million penalty the commission levied against Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive practices associated with distributing Windows Media Player and Windows Server. Microsoft was later hit with  fines of $424 million and $1.35 billion for failing to comply with the 2004 ruling. The software giant remains under investigation for allegations that it uses illegal practices to distribute its Internet Explorer Web browser in Europe.
In the Intel case, regulators ruled  Intel's sales dealings with Asian PC manufacturers were subject to
European law if the end result was fewer AMD products available in Europe. "The EU is telling  Intel,
'Make sure this doesn't happen anywhere else in the world,' " Reynolds says.

AMD, which brought the original allegations, celebrated. "Intel broke the law, and consumers were hurt," says Tom McCoy, executive vice president for legal affairs. "With this ruling, European consumers will enjoy greater choice."

Microsoft's dealings with European regulators suggest  Intel faces a drawn-out battle. Both cases derive from Europe's belief in "ordoliberalism" --  competition based on many firms competing to serve the market, says Luke Froeb, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of
Management.
"If you apply that vision to the chip industry, you're going to come up with a very aggressive
enforcement posture," says Froeb, a former Federal Trade Commission official. "They'd rather have two
chipmakers with higher costs than one that can realize economies of scale."

European Union regulators levied a record 1.06-billion-euro ($1.45-billion US)  fine against Intel Corp., the world's biggest computer-chip maker, and ordered the company to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors. Following an eight-year investigation, the  European Commission found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers that buy all or almost all of their chips from Intel. The penalty is the biggest  antitrust fine in the 27-nation EU's history, more than double the 497-million- euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004.

AMERICAN computer chip giant  Intel has slammed the European Commission after being served with a record £953m fine for breaching EU rules on fair competition.

TD
The fine — more than €1bn — is by far the biggest ever imposed by the EU’s  competition authority.

It comes after an inquiry in which the commission found  Intel guilty of deliberately keeping rivals out of the global market for computer chips.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared: “Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.
“Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU’s anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated.”

But Intel chief executive Paul Otellini denied the charge: “Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace — characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices,” he said.
“There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal.”

The commission says Intel gave major computer companies “wholly or partially hidden” rebates on condition that they bought almost all of their x86 central processing units — computer chips — from Intel.

According to the Commission,  Intel also gave one major computer retailer direct payments on condition that the retailer stocked only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs.
The Commission said Intel’s anti-competitive behaviour was mainly aimed at its smaller rival AMD. Between them the two companies make almost all the central processing chips which run the world’s
personal computers.

HD       European Commission Issues Record Fine for Computer  Chip-Maker Intel

Yesterday, European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes announced the European Commission's highest ever fine in an anti-trust case. The giant U.S. computer chip-maker Intel was fined 1.06 billion euro (US$1.44 billion) for unfair competitive practices. Kroes further criticised the
chip-maker for reducing the scope for innovation in the sector and damaging consumer welfare by stifling competition. At the heart of Kroes' complaint was the use of illegal rebates by  Intel. The fine hits the company hard; according to Euractiv, it equals 4.15% of its turnover in 2008. The vice-chairman of  Intel, Bruce Sewell, rejected the Commission's decision, particularly the size of the  fine. Intel now has until
July to file an appeal with the European Court of First Instance (CFI). However, reports indicate that the judgment was carefully structured to avoid a successful appeal.

TD
Given the evidence that financial incentives were applied as a retaliatory measure to prevent vendors from working with competitors, combined with  Intel's dominance of the market (taking around an 80% share), it seems unlikely that the appeal will be successful.Significance: The Commission is known for its tough stance on anti-competitive practices, as highlighted by the earlier case regarding Microsoft (see Europe: 28 February 2008: ). A 10-year investigation is thus slowly coming to an end; barring any unlikely developments,  Intel will have to pay the record  fine, although no money will be taken while the appeal process is played out. Kroes stressed that according to European Union (EU) regulations she could have fined Intel up to 10% of its global turnover for 2008, which would have been closer to 3 billion euro. With its first-quarter revenues down 26.1% year-on-year (y/y) to US$7.1 billion, and operating income down from US$2.0 billion to US$647 million, the  fine will have a significant impact as it is.  Intel faces further investigations in South Korea, Japan, and the United States, as well as private court appeals.

HD          E.U. Fines Intel for Antitrust Violations

The world's biggest semiconductor maker yesterday was  fined a record $1.45 billion by European regulators for allegedly using its dominance to edge out rivals, a decision that has cast a spotlight on similar investigations by U.S.  antitrust watchdogs.

After a five-year review of  Intel's sales tactics, the European Union's  competition commission said the company, with 70 percent share of the global chip market, gave hidden discounts to computer makers to use its chips and paid the firms not to use those made by competitor Advanced Micro Devices. It
also paid a major retailer to stock only computers outfitted with  Intel chips, the commission said.

TD
The decision comes just days after the Obama administration announced that it would step up enforcement against companies that violate rules on anti-competitive behavior. The United States has faced years of criticism that regulators have been slow to respond to complaints that  Intel used
anti-competitive business practices to shut out AMD. But last year, both the Federal Trade
Commission and New York attorney general launched separate investigations of  Intel.
AMD has filed a separate civil suit against  Intel in Delaware that is expected to go to court next year. Neelie Kroes, head of the European Commission's competition bureau, said yesterday's record  fine
reflected the conclusion that Intel's practices hurt consumers who were offered fewer technological
choices and that the company's actions "frustrated innovation." She ordered  Intel to stop its practices
immediately.

"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for over five years, the size of the  fine should come as no surprise," Kroes said.

Intel said in a statement that the commission's decision failed to acknowledge how such companies operate and said it would appeal.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace," said Paul Otellini,  Intel president and chief executive. "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers."

The findings follow similar actions in South Korea and Japan against  Intel, which antitrust experts have been watching closely for their potential impact on U.S. enforcement against anti-competitive behavior of big companies with majority market shares in their industries.

The FTC declined to comment on the E.U. decision, but some  antitrust experts said President Obama's pick of Jon Leibowitz to lead the agency may say much about how it might handle similar cases. Leibowitz is known for championing consumer protections, and as a FTC commissioner he pushed for greater enforcement of  antitrust violations.

"This is the beginning of the beginning," said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president of legal affairs.

The FTC's review of  Intel -- and its conclusion -- may be the first test of whether the administration lives up to its promise to be more aggressive on the enforcement of  competition.

"Now you have a third and very important international authority that has looked at the same things and have come to a clear and unanimous decision," said Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute. "It would be disappointing if the FTC verged from that point of view and the pressure would be on them to explain why they weren't judging in the same way."

Antitrust experts note that the FTC has worked closely with E.U. regulators. The  European                Commission said in a news release that its  competition bureau and the FTC have "kept each other regularly and closely informed on the state of play of their respective  Intel investigations."

By sharing documents and communicating insights, the FTC isn't expected to take as long as E.U. regulators to come to conclusions on their review, said Ed Black, president of the high-tech trade group Computer & Communications Industry Association. AMD is a member of the CCIA;  Intel is not.
"So there should not be the need for a such a long period of time to lapse before a conclusion by the
FTC," Black said.

SAN MATEO, Calif. -- The "triumvirate" running the Obama administration's communications and
high-tech policy signifies "a brand new day" that's "quite mind- blowing" after the "complete and total vast
wasteland" of the Bush administration, President Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge said on a Tech Policy
Summit panel. The three - - presidential adviser Susan Crawford and Jim Kohlenberger and Tom Kalil,
both of the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy -- are well-attuned to the important issues
and are especially important in the absence of a permanent FCC chairman, Sohn said on Tuesday. "All of
the principles" that the administration has posted online about universal and affordable broadband access
and open, nondiscriminatory networks are "spot on," but how policy will actually be different remains to be
seen, Sohn said: "The devil is always in the details," and turning the principles into reality "is not going to
be as easy as I wish it would be."

TD
Sohn credited mandatory network-sharing for Europeans' getting faster broadband for a better value than Americans get and called that "a much better mold for  competition than we have." But Paul Brigner, Verizon executive director of Internet and technology policy, advised being "very careful before we call for policies that emulate Europe," because "we have facilities-based  competition" lacking there. He said Verizon is "doing a lot of education" of Washington officials, taking advantage of "new opportunities" with the Obama administration's arrival to discuss "the competitive dynamics of the market" and Verizon's innovation, in its FiOS network and the coming LTE wireless system. New regulation would distort the market and create uncertainty, Brigner said.

Brett Glass, CEO of Lariat.net, said independent providers like his wireless ISP hope to supply "the needed competition to make regulation unnecessary," because rules "might extinguish  competition rather than promote it. ... The composition of the FCC is going to make a big difference to us because we're a wireless ISP." He said an inventory of spectrum and a rethinking of sales by auction are needed.

Glass said he's worried that an Obama appointee has advocated "nationalizing the Internet." He told us after the panel that he had meant Crawford. In a 2006 blog post, Crawford wrote: "We haven't nationalized an industry in a while. It's not clear that our government would even be particularly good at making fast Internet access into a true public priority and resource. But ... it makes less and less sense to treat access to this crucial informational resource like candy-bar sales -- particularly when the market for access isn't itself competitive."
Glass agreed with Brigner and Sohn that ISPs shouldn't be "copyright cops," as under
graduated-response -- so-called three strikes -- systems requiring providers to cut off a user on a third
infringement complaint. France enacted the system Tuesday, in the face of the  European Commission's
rejection of a broad revamp of communications regulation over the question. Brigner said Verizon
appreciates "the problems of the content industry" and does support infringement notice pass-through by
ISPs. "In most cases, this is very effective," he said. -- Louis Trager
Tech Policy Summit Notebook ...

Individual companies, especially Google, seem to have more clout in Washington now than high-tech associations, said David Kralick, the Internet strategy director for Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future. TechNet, having lost its CEO, seems "rudderless," he said. TechAmerica, formed in a merger of the ITAA, AEA and two smaller groups, has "emerged as a tech power" in the District, said
Doug Farry, managing director of the government-affairs practice at the McKenna, Long & Aldridge law firm. In recent years, technology associations were seen as "wholly owned subsidiaries" of a particular company each, "without great effect" on federal policy, he said. Even as companies like Google and Microsoft have plunged into lobbying, they have taken mainly defensive postures, seeking to prevent
Page 13 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
government actions that they consider dangerous to their businesses, said John Battista of the Orrick law firm. "We lack ... forward-thinking tech policy to set forward- thinking agendas," such as on broadband development, he said. The Obama administration is "plotting an all-out assault on the technology business," Kralick said. "They're quietly making decisions, but nobody has declared all-out war." He said the administration has found that "a wink and a nod and a smile go a long way" toward friendly relations. The industry's priorities "consistently fall to the bottom of the plate" with both parties, Farry said. Google and its CEO, Eric Schmidt have "played an extremely active role" in the Obama administration -- and for their trouble have gotten critical questions about Schmidt's board seat at Apple, a proposal to disallow tax credits for overseas earnings and suggestions of  antitrust action against the company, he said. "It doesn't really seem like a very effective engagement so far." -- LT

The Consumer Electronics Association will announce in mid-June its Innovation Movement to rally bipartisan support for government policies that it thinks will promote technology advances, such as free trade and "attracting the best and the brightest" talent from elsewhere to the U.S., President Gary Shapiro said. The effort will activate "CEA members, technology professionals and other Americans" to lobby Congress in line with six criteria that it wants bills judged by, the association's Web site says: creating U.S. jobs, spurring new technology, allowing "highly qualified immigrants" into the U.S. without restrictions on employment or education opportunities, rewarding investment and business innovation, promoting exports and fostering productivity and energy efficiency. Shapiro offered a broad and sharp critique of Obama administration policy, including the stimulus package, to an audience that sounded largely unsympathetic. New antitrust policy offers the prospect of "cracking down on some of our best companies" when "we should be supporting our best ... especially when other countries are attacking them," he said, referring to the European Union's announcement Wednesday of a $1.45 billion  fine against Intel. -- LT

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The European decision to slap a record fine on U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. could give justification for U.S.  competition authorities who are mulling more aggressive antitrust enforcement and  Intel could face more troubles ahead, analysts said.

California-based Intel was fined a record 1.06 billion euros (1.44 billion U.S. dollars) on Wednesday by the European Commission for alleged anti-competitive behavior.

RECORD  FINE

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU), charged  Intel with selling chips below cost and paying PC makers rebates to slacken their usage of chips made by AMD,  Intel's market rival. The commission said  Intel had paid German PC retailer Mexia Markt to stock only
Intel-based PCs.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said Wednesday  Intel's actions harmed "millions and millions" of European consumers by denying them greater choice in PC processor supplies.
The commission said Intel must pay the  fine within three months of being notified of the decision.

Intel immediately denied the EU claim. In a statement issued minutes after the ruling, Intel's chief executive officer Paul Otellini said the company "takes strong exception" to the European Commission's decision.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace -- characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices," Otellini said.
TEMPLATE FOR U.S. COMMISSION

Some analysts said the EU ruling may form a template for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is probing Intel in the United States.
It is the second time in five years that the EU has delivered a major  antitrust blow to a U.S. IT giant. In
2004, Microsoft was declared an abusive monopolist and  fined more than 650 million dollars.

However, the European  antitrust ruling did not cross the Atlantic under the Bush administration. Not one antitrust case was pursued under the two Bush administrations.
U.S. Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney, new chief of the  antitrust division of the Justice
Department, has called for an end to this inertia.

In a speech Monday, she said the Obama administration would vigorously enforce antimonopoly laws and work more like the European Commission in tackling monopoly abuse. She also warned courts and parties to lawsuits against invoking the antitrust policies of the Bush administration.

The European decision may form a template for the FTC to follow in its own scrutiny of the chip maker's practices, said Albert Foer, president of the American  Antitrust Institute.

The Associated Press quoted Bob Enderle, a technology industry analyst, as saying: "If there was ever a time not to appear to be a large firm behaving badly, this would be it, as the financial collapse has the U.S. and EU competing for which government is most proactively protecting consumer rights."

The possibility that the FTC will take action against  Intel is "much more likely today than it was two weeks ago, said Joshua Wright, an assistant law professor at George Mason University who once worked for the FTC.

Intel senior vice president Bruce Swell said he had read the comments by Varney "with great interest" and vowed to work closely "with all agencies."

Intel is still facing several  antitrust suits. A civil suit filed by AMD in Delaware District Court is slated for trial next March. New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office is also probing  Intel's
alleged anti-competitive operations. DECISIVE MOMENT
Whether  Intel could face punishment in the United States remains to be seen and the legal battle in Europe could go on for years on the company's appeal. But the 1.06 billion  fine is still believed to be a decisive moment as governments gear up their  antitrust regulations in the IT sector.

Several IT giants have been on the  competition authorities' radar. Currently, the EU is also investigating licensing practices of mobile phone chip maker Qualcomm and taking a close look at Google.

Before being nominated for her  antitrust job, Varney said Google's growing power in Internet computing could be the next frontier in the tech industry's  antitrust regulations. She also drew parallels between Microsoft's dominance of PC operating systems and Google's influence in the technology for computing conducted over the Internet.

HD         Intel is fined €1 billion by the E.U. over sales tactics

BRUSSELS-- The  European Commission fined Intel a record €1.06 billion on Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market to exclude its only serious rival, Advanced Micro Devices.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the penalty against  Intel, the equivalent of $1.44 billion, was justified because the company had skewed  competition and denied consumers a choice for chips.

TD
Ms. Kroes said  Intel had ''used illegal anti-competitive practices to exclude its only competitor and reduce consumers' choice - and the whole story is about consumers.'' She said  Intel's practices had
''undermined innovation.''
The previous record fine for similar abuses in the European Union was €497 million, imposed on
Microsoft in March 2004 for blocking  competition in markets for server computers and media software.

The Intel fine also is the largest ever imposed for any breach of  competition law in the European Union, beating by a significant margin previous record amounts of hundreds of millions of euros levied on chemical and cement companies over the past decade.
Paul S. Otellini, chief executive of  Intel, said the company would appeal.

''We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,'' Mr. Otellini said. ''There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.''

Giuliano Meroni, president of A.M.D.'s operations in Europe, said the decision would ''shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers.''

Analysts said the decision would have little impact on the global chip market. Martin Reynolds, an analyst in San Jose, California, at the research firm Gartner, said the current breakdown of market share - 80 percent for  Intel and 20 percent for A.M.D. - is more a reflection of the different manufacturing capacities of each company and not of any artificial barrier to sales.
''The European decision is not going to be a real coarse adjustment for the market,'' Mr. Reynolds said.
''It's much more of a  fine tuning.''

Ms. Kroes said  Intel had pursued a strategy aimed mainly at excluding A.M.D. by paying computer makers and retailers to postpone, cancel or avoid A.M.D. products entirely.

The European Commission, which is the E.U.'s executive arm, also found that  Intel ''went to great lengths to cover up its anti-competitive actions,'' Ms. Kroes added.

She ordered the company to stop offering rebates that were conditioned on buying less of a rival's product, or not buying them at all.
Page 17 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Under the order,  Intel must change its business practices immediately pending its appeal, although it can ask for an injunction to delay the changes until the full case is judged. Officials with  Intel said Wednesday that the company had not yet decided whether to ask for an injunction.

The company must write a bank guarantee for the  fine immediately, though that guarantee is held in an account until appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.

The commission can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales.  Intel's sales were $37.6 billion in 2008; thus, the company could have faced a maximum penalty of close to $4 billion.

The decision to impose a severe  fine on Intel is another reminder of the emergence of European regulators as some of the world's most activist enforcers of  antitrust law, and it is an additional sign that the authorities worldwide are raising the stakes for the biggest technology companies.

Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel, acknowledged at a news conference in Brussels that  antitrust agencies around the world had been examining his company's business practices, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which opened a formal investigation last year.

He said antitrust agencies in Europe, Japan and South Korea had not yet established a consensus about what forms of rebates were permissible.

''The law is now in flux,'' Mr. Sewell said. ''I think what you see here are agencies beginning to test the boundaries of the law,'' he said, referring to the flurry of investigations concerning  Intel.

Dirk Meyer: AMD chief says decision will move chip market closer to true  competition.
Paul Otellini:  Intel CEO says practices caused 'zero harm to consumers.'

TD
Yves Logghe ASSOCIATED PRESS

Neelie Kroes of the European Commission holds a circuit board Wednesday in Brussels as she discusses the regulator's record $1.5 billion fine against Intel Corp. for antitrust violations. The European Commission said that  Intel engaged in two forms of illegal practices from 2002 to 2007.

Intel Corp. can easily pay the $1.5 billion  fine levied against it Wednesday by the  European                     Commission. But analysts say the chip giant might be forced to make substantial long-term changes in
its operations to remedy claims by regulators that it used special deals with computer makers and retailers to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
Industry analysts said the short-range effect of the record  antitrust fine is likely to be minimal.  Intel has
90 days to post a bond for the penalty and intends to appeal the ruling.

But in the long term, the ruling might rein in  Intel, which has ruled the chip market for years, some analysts said.
"It may take a few years before we see the full impact of this ruling, but it clearly is going to slow  Intel
down," said analyst Rob Enderle with the Enderle Group consulting firm in San Jose, Calif.

"If they want to keep doing business in Europe, they are going to have to change," said analyst Roger Kay with Endpoint Technologies Associates. "It may make  Intel a less aggressive discounter."

Intel uses discounts to keep orders flowing and its factories filled, Kay said.

"If it can't do that, then it will have to allocate its fixed costs over a smaller number of units. That translates either to lower profit margins or higher prices or a little bit of both."

The ruling is the biggest victory so far in AMD's years-long, worldwide campaign to portray  Intel as a company that abuses its market dominance and uses unfair tactics to squelch competitors.
AMD filed a complaint with European regulators in 2000 and has pursued cases in other regions as well. Some small countries have issued  fines, but Europe accounts for almost a third of the world's processor
sales, so the ruling there carries considerable weight.

Between them, AMD and  Intel control virtually 100 percent of the world's computer processor sales. But even with recent gains, AMD has only about 22.3 percent of the market, versus 77.3 percent for  Intel.

AMD chief executive Dirk Meyer called the decision "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market. We are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled to one which is ruled by customers."

Page 19 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel CEO Paul Otellini denied that  Intel has engaged in illegal acts to hinder AMD and added, "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers" from its behavior.
He said the company does not use "exclusionary payments" to customers to keep them from buying AMD
chips.

The European Commission said that  Intel engaged in two forms of illegal practices during the five-year period from 2002 to 2007.

First,  Intel gave wholly or partially secret rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their personal computer processors from  Intel.

The company also directed payments to MediaMarkt , a German retail chain, on condition that it sold only computers with  Intel chips inside, the commission report said.
The commission claimed that five computer makers were affected by  Intel's anti-competitive acts: Acer
Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett- Packard Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp.

The commission claimed that  Intel gave rebates to one unnamed computer maker from December 2002 to December 2005 conditioned on that company's exclusive purchase of  Intel processors.

It gave discounts to another computer maker that depended on that company using  Intel processors for at least 80 percent of its desktop and notebook computers.
Otellini called the allegations "absurd."

"This is a very competitive business," he said. "Our customers are, in most cases, larger than  Intel; they have incredible buying power, and they are excellent negotiators."

Several analysts said the  fine itself won't hurt  Intel much - the company has more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments - and that the ruling might not materially alter the competitive playing field between it and AMD.

"It does not change the landscape for AMD dramatically," said analyst Cody Acree with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. in Dallas. "AMD still has to get out better products at an equivalent price and convince customers to make purchases based on products."

But AMD general counsel Harry Wolin said Wednesday's ruling will have a positive impact on his company: "The ruling basically stops loyalty payments (by  Intel) and it stops delay payments, which are payments used to delay (AMD) products or launches. That is how  Intel has tried to control this market for years.

"This will make a very significant difference in how our market operates, and it will let us get to market sooner without delays."

Both companies are substantial employers in Austin.  Intel has more than 900 workers in Austin, where its low-power Atom processors are designed. AMD has 2,100 workers in Austin, and many of its senior executives are based here.

The wheels of justice turn slowly indeed. Almost a full decade after Advanced Micro Devices first complained about its larger competitor,  Intel, the European Commission yesterday handed down its largest ever fine for abuse of a dominant market position, ordering Intel to pay €1.1bn. The decision follows a 2005 ruling in Japan, and another in Korea last year, that found  abuse by Intel. But do the opinions of bureaucrats matter?

Shareholders don't think so. The share price of  Intel, which had sales last year of $38bn, not to mention a market capitalisation of $85bn and $10bn of cash, barely moved on the news. The company disputes the finding and will appeal, further lengthening the process. European attempts at intervention with Microsoft, including then-record fines, trundle along, with little effect on the company's behaviour. Investors are far more interested in Intel's attempts to cut costs, improve margins and control inventories, the main subject of its analyst day on Tuesday.

TD
The ruling may give some help to AMD, whose shares added 5 per cent yesterday. Favourable precedent could help the company's civil suit against  Intel set for trial in Delaware next March. Separate investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney-general's office are ongoing, and any form of settlement would help relieve AMD's debt load.

In terms of the market for microprocessors, however, little will change. The practice in question is allegedly restrictions attached to volume rebates, not the principle of rebates themselves. With about 70 per cent of the market for microprocessors - the central engine of every computer -  Intel benefits from a self-reinforcing scale advantage that allows it to outspend AMD on research and development by more than four to one. In technology, trends in market share are rarely reversed. Plodding regulators can do little to change that fact.

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, has been  fined a record €1.06bn ($1.44bn) by Europe's competition authorities for abusing its dominant market position and using illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its microprocessor chips.

The fine, which follows a -decade-long investigation by the  European Commission, is the largest single penalty to be imposed on a company for  antitrust breaches in Europe.

The commission also ordered  Intel to "cease illegal practices immediately". It is to monitor future conduct.

But Intel pledged to appeal against the decision, denying its practices had violated European law. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace," said Paul Otellini,  Intel's chief executive.

Lawyers said the scale of the penalty, coupled with the more aggressive stance on  antitrust issues outlined by the Obama administration in the US, was bound to increase anxieties at other companies.

"There are, no doubt, some nervous large technology companies out there at the moment - and that won't be helped by recent pronouncements [by] the new head of the US  antitrust watchdog that suggest the US will be joining the EU's crusade," said Mark Tricker at Norton Rose.

The commission said the illegal practices, between 2002 and 2007, involved conditional rebates to computer makers such as Acer and Dell and had the effect of pushing out competitors. They included illegal payments to the German retailer MediaMarkt on condition it exclusively sold  Intel-based personal computers.

The size of the  fine reflects the scale of  Intel's sales in Europe during that period and the length of time the abuse continued.

Neelie Kroes, European Union competition commissioner, said: " . . .  Intel has harmed millions of consumers . . . the size of the fine should come as no surprise."
AMD said yesterday the decision was important to establish a truly competitive market.

But observers said that any impact in market terms might take time to work. "These remedial measures take a long time to filter through," said Michael Reynolds, partner at Allen & Overy.

While the  European commission may be successful in fining  Intel, it is unlikely to make any real difference to the computer market or to the company that prompted the case: AMD. It could even result in higher prices. The problem is that  Intel, which invented the microprocessor, has almost 80% of the world market, leaving AMD with about 20%.

In the computer industry, higher volumes generally lead to lower production costs, and  Intel's long-term investment in multibillion-dollar chip factories gives it an overwhelming advantage.

TD
The fact is that AMD is simply incapable of supplying the market, so any changes in the competitive landscape will have only marginal effects. As the EC recognises in its statement: "Because computer manufacturers are dependent on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies, only a limited part of a computer manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements is open to  competition at any given time."

And when the cost of that competitive CPU is bundled in with the hard drive, memory chips, operating system, monitor and keyboard, it may not make any difference to consumers. Insofar as the ruling discourages Intel from offering deals to large PC manufacturers, it could mean consumers pay higher prices. This would probably benefit AMD, by enabling it to increase its own unprofitable prices.

Last year, AMD lost $3.1bn (pounds 2bn) on revenues of $5.8bn, and in 2007 it lost $3.4bn on revenues of $5.9bn. This suggests it has deeper problems than the EC can address with  fines. However, AMD has had a significant impact over the past decade - thanks partly to Microsoft. For example, AMD took a lead on moving the PC industry from 32-bit to 64-bit computing, by extending Intel's x86 architecture.

Intel had hoped to move the industry to a new architecture for the 21st century, using Itanium chips developed with PC and Hewlett-Packard. This strategy failed partly because the market's acceptance of AMD's extensions to x86 - also called AMD64 - and Microsoft's support for them, forced  Intel to follow suit.

The Brussels ruling claims that  Intel's marketing deals restricted "innovation". The much more important story is that AMD and the PC market rejected  Intel's more innovative approach in favour of conserving the past. Both  Intel and AMD are limited in what they can do by the tens of millions of programs written for the x86 architecture. It's good if these can run more efficiently, but the future is somewhere else.

HD          Competition law: Intel to fight euros 1bn EU fine for 'illegal' deals: US computer chipmaker hit by record penalty Chief exec says consumers have suffered  'zero harm'

Intel has vowed to fight a record euros 1.03bn (pounds 950m)  fine imposed by the European              commission as criticism grows in the US that the chipmaker is being unfairly singled out for anticompetitive behaviour.

The commission levied the  fine, which is payable at once despite the appeal, for what it called "illegal anticompetitive practices", citing rebates offered to the computer manufacturers Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Acer, Lenovo and NEC. The deals were struck on the condition that the central processing unit (CPU), the computer's "brain", should come from  Intel - effectively locking out its bitter but much smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).  Intel holds 77% of the world market for CPUs.

TD
But the  fine drew a sceptical reaction in the US, where critics of the EU questioned whether consumers had truly suffered from  Intel's business practices. Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, said chip prices had dropped by 60% over a decade and processing power that once cost $1 could now be purchased for just a cent.

"The EU should not rejoice at this seeming triumph over American big business," said Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market thinktank. "Instead, it should ponder if its policies make Europe hospitable for innovation."

Nevertheless, the EU decision could also presage an investigation by the US authorities into  Intel's business practices there. The department of justice confirmed in June last year that it had a formal antitrust probe under way, and in January 2008 the New York state attorney general also opened an inquiry into Intel's methods.

The European Union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the penalty was justified because the company had skewed competition and denied consumers choice.

Kroes said Intel had "used illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude its only competitor and reduce consumers' choice and the whole story is about consumers." She said  Intel's practices had "undermined innovation".

Paul Otellini, the chief executive of  Intel, retorted that "there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers", and hit back angrily at the decision. "We do not believe our practices violated European law," he said. "The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not."

Giuliano Meroni, president of AMD's operations in Europe, said the decision would "shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer-makers, retailers and above all PC consumers".

The matter will now go to appeal, but Intel - which has warned of falling revenues and the need for job cuts - will still have to pay the  fine. If Intel wins, it will be repaid the money; otherwise it will be used to defray the costs of the commission.

Until the latest ruling, the biggest  fine exacted by the commission was against another US technology company, Microsoft, which in 2004 was  fined euros 497m for bundling its media player software with the Windows operating system, and withholding information from other software-makers. In February
2008, the commission  finedMicrosoft a further euros 899m for "defying" those sanctions.

Company says the record penaltywon't affect its Irish operations

The decision by the  European Commission to slap a record €1.06bn  fine on chipmaking giant Intel for anti-competitive practices will not affect the company's commitment to either its Irish or European operations, the US giant said yesterday.

TD
Intel will appeal the  fine which dwarfs a €497m penalty levied on Microsoft in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position.

The EU Commission found that, between 2002 and 2007,  Intel paid computer manufacturers and a retailer to favour its chips over those of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- the chip giant's smaller but main competitor.

Intel chief executive Paul Otellini said yesterday: "Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace."
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he said.

Yesterday, the company's general counsel Bruce Sewell said that the ruling and  fine would have no impact on Intel's commitment to the European market or its Irish manufacturing base.

Intel's European headquarters is in Leixlip, Co Kildare,where it employs close to 5,000 full-time and contract staff.

Mr Sewell said in a conference call that  Intel had made a substantial investment in Ireland and other countries, and had no dispute with European consumers, who remained very important to them.
"We are committed and we will stay committed," he said.
The European, Middle East and African markets account for about 30pc of  Intel's revenues. Last year, the Government introduced budgetary changes to research and development (R&D)
incentives designed to encourage  Intel to remain in Ireland.
The Irish operation is a potential candidate for up to €1bn of investment from the company. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that the sanctions against  Intel would be
imposed immediately even if  Intel appealed.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained

The European Commission has slapped a record €1.06bn (£951m)  fine on the computer giant  Intel
for illegal anti-competitive practices over a five-year period.

TD
The Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said yesterday: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."

Brussels said Intel in effect paid manufacturers not to use rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) technology. The severity of the  fine "takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement", it said.

Intel's chief executive Paul Otellini hit back: "Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace." The group will appeal.

Thomas Vinje, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance, said: "Had  Intel been more conciliatory, this need not have happened. They chose to play hard ball and are now paying the price," adding: "Assuming the commission has solid facts to back up the decision, any appeal by  Intel looks unlikely to succeed."

The censure refers to a particular x86 central processing unit (CPU), which makes up the main hardware component of a computer. The market for the chips is worth €22bn a year.

The investigation followed three complaints by AMD,  Intel's only competitor. "Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," said Dirk Meyer, AMD's chief executive.
The regulator said it had "ordered  Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately". Between October
2002 and December 2007,  Intel held at least 70 per cent of the worldwide x86 CPU market. The
commission said Intel had given rebates to manufacturers as long as they bought most of their x86
chips from Intel. The computer giant also paid computer manufacturers to delay or halt production of
computers with x86 CPUs produced by AMD, the commission added in its report.

Business | Outlook

The Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, seem to agree on one thing at least. They both think the economic contraction is slowing and that activity will rebound, possibly quite sharply, towards the end of this year, early next year.

TD
But on what happens after the bounce there seems to be little unity of view. In presenting the Bank of England's quarterly Inflation Report yesterday, Mr King gave a number of reasons for thinking that a return to decent levels of sustainable growth may take a good deal longer this time around than previous post-war recessions.

The difference matters because the Chancellor's forecasts for the public finances are based on the resumption of above-trend growth to 3.25 per cent per annum from 2011 onwards. If this doesn't happen, then the Government's books are going to be in even worse shape than they are already. The fiscal consolidation would have to be that much more painful, and the amount borrowed to bridge the difference between spending and tax receipts even larger.

Not that the Governor wanted in any way to criticise the Government's forecasts. Absolutely not. Here was a God-given chance to dump on a self evidently dying Government, but whatever his true views about the fiscal position, the Governor was determined to resist it. In fact, he leant over backwards to be kind. He congratulated the Treasury on its "honesty" in owning up to the scale of the fiscal challenge
and even went so far as to say that the deficit may not in the end be as bad as forecast in the Budget red book.

Nor, on examination, does the Bank of England's own central projection for growth look significantly different from that of the Treasury. On this measure, the Bank of England thinks the recession may be a little deeper than the Chancellor assumes and the level of sustainable growth after the recovery a little bit lower, but the broad trajectory is much the same. So how to reconcile these relatively optimistic projections with the Governor's more downbeat comments on the outlook for growth?

One answer that Mr King likes to give when referring to all his forecasts is that the Bank's central projection is only that - a central projection which is no more likely to be true than more outlying projections, one of which has the UK economy still contracting at an annual rate of 1 per cent even as far out as two years hence. Taking all the projections together, the weight of risk is charted to be very much on the downside. In other words, the outcome is more likely to be below the central projection than above it.

This might sound a bit like hedging your bets, and in some respects it is. Mr King is the first to admit that he cannot know the future. None the less, policy has to be set according to the balance of probability if it is not to end up stumbling around in the darkness of guesswork, and the Governor's more gloomy prognosis certainly seems more plausible than the Government's.

Mr King gave three reasons for believing growth would rebound in the short run. First, the degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus has been without precedent. A further boost has been provided by the depreciation of sterling and the drop in the oil price. Third, the inventory adjustment which has dragged down output should soon turn and work in the opposite direction.

But there are equally compelling reasons for supposing that a sustained recovery will take considerably longer than past recessions. Necessary fiscal consolidation might dampen the pace of recovery in household and corporate spending. Households also need to repair their own balance sheets and the savings ratio has to be allowed to recover. What's more, it is likely that the supply of credit will remain restricted as risk averse banks continue to deleverage and raise their capital ratios.

Is the Governor right to be downbeat? There were lots of contradictory messages in yesterday's presentation. In part these result from the Governor's slightly self-justifying analysis of the causes of the crisis and his refusal to admit that there were mistakes in monetary policy. It wasn't inflation targeting or the manner in which it was pursued that was at fault, the Governor insists, but rather that policymakers didn't have the tools with which to address the credit bubble.

Two-thirds of the growth in credit, he says, was nothing to do with excessive consumer spending, mortgage lending, or business investment, but was within the financial system itself, a giant ponzi scheme if you like of one layer of credit derivative on top of another.

That may be true, but it is also the case that much of this credit derivative and shadow banking activity was specifically designed to drive credit growth in the real economy. It certainly succeeded. In Britain, the self-certified and buy-to-let parts of the mortgage market didn't really exist 10 years ago. By the end they were at least 20 per cent of a mortgage market whose traditional elements had also grown substantially with the rise in house prices.

There was also dramatic growth in credit card lending and other forms of unsecured or poorly secured lending. Much of today's bad debt experience has little to do with credit derivatives, but rather is driven by individuals and businesses who were simply allowed to take on too much debt.

That said, the overhang of credit derivatives was indeed one of the main reasons why credit to the real economy first became restricted. Banks with exotic assets of unknown value are bound to worry about how much capital they have available for ordinary lending. So when confidence in these instruments collapsed, there was a knock on effect. But today, the bad debt experience is a much more conventional one. The Bank of England cannot altogether escape blame for an unsustainable boom in credit.

In any case, the Governor seems to acknowledge that whether it was the fault of loose monetary policy or not, households did indeed overborrow and that the necessary process of rebuilding household balance sheets will crimp growth into the future. According to Mr King, there is an equally daunting task of balance sheet repair still to come in the banking sector, not withstanding the recapitalisations that have already taken place.

Recapitalisations to date may have stabilised the banking system, but they are not enough to return lending growth to former levels. The Governor says there is no scientific way of knowing what these capital requirements might be, as a bank's propensity to lend is dictated by market confidence and appetite for risk, but they might be big.

Regrettably, it won't be market sentiment that determines these things in future, but regulatory diktat. Here's another reason for believing that future growth might be subdued. In attempting to make the banking system "safe", regulators may permanently damage its propensity to lend by insisting on bigger capital buffers than strictly necessary.

Policymakers want both growth and safety, but they may be just trading one for the other. The level of banking capital needed to restore past levels of lending growth may be "unknowable", but most policy markets already think they have a fair idea and, like Mr King, want to make it "big". Other mechanisms for supplying risk capital will eventually be found, but the evolution of such conduits is bound to take time.

So lots of mixed messages in the Governor's presentation yesterday, and necessarily so, for we live in uncertain times. The economy will eventually heal, Mr King observes, but the process may be slow. Quite so.

Intel gets it in the neck from Kroes

You can get almost any merger past the European Union these days. The recession has also caused the rules governing state aid to be virtually scrapped. Yet at least one area of European  competition policy remains reassuringly intact. Ploughing an ever more lonely furrow, Neelie Kroes, the European
Page 38 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Competition Commissioner, has slapped a record-breaking  fine on Intel. And there we all were thinking the one-time scourge of big business was going soft.

Leaving aside the issue of how she arrived at the curiously precise number of €1.06bn, this was actually a remarkably good decision. There is no excuse for unfair trading practice, particularly in a recession where the need to preserve a level playing field is more important than ever.  Intel naturally denies abuse, but the evidence looks detailed and damning.

There are only two mainstream competitors in computer chips, and it is essential that the bigger of them is prevented from knobbling the other before he even gets out of the starting blocks. Well done Ms Kroes. Maybe the  European Commission still has a purpose afterall.

HD        Intel fined €1.06 billion over abuse in chip market

BRUSSELS-- The  European Commission fined Intel a record €1.06 billion on Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market to exclude its only serious rival, Advanced Micro Devices.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the penalty against  Intel, the equivalent of $1.45 billion, was justified because the company had skewed  competition and denied consumers a choice for chips.

TD
Ms. Kroes said  Intel had ''used illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude its only competitor and reduce consumers' choice - and the whole story is about consumers. '' She said  Intel's practices had
''undermined innovation.''
The previous record fine for similar abuses in the European Union was €497 million imposed on
Microsoft in March 2004 for blocking  competition in markets for server computers and media software.

The fine also is the largest ever imposed for any breach of  competition law in the European Union, beating by a significant margin previous record amounts of hundreds of millions of euros levied on chemical and cement companies over the past decade.
Paul Otellini, chief executive of  Intel, said the company would appeal.

''We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,'' Mr. Otellini said. ''There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.''

Giuliano Meroni, president of A.M.D.'s operations in Europe, said the decision would ''shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers.''

Ms. Kroes said  Intel had pursued a strategy aimed mainly at excluding A.M.D. by paying computer makers and retailers to postpone, cancel or avoid A.M.D. products entirely.

The European Commission, which is the E.U.'s executive arm, also found that  Intel ''went to great lengths to cover up its anticompetitive actions,'' Ms. Kroes added.

She ordered the company to stop offering rebates to computer makers that had helped it maintain a share of about 80 percent of the market for microchip sales. She said that had blocked A.M.D. from increasing its share of that market beyond about 20 percent.
Under the order,  Intel must change its business practices immediately pending its appeal, although it
can ask for an injunction. The company must pay the  fine right away, though the money will be held in a
bank account until appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.



Page 40 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales.  Intel's sales
were $37.6 billion in 2008; thus, the company could have faced a maximum penalty of close to $4 billion.
Money collected in antitrust cases is added to the trade bloc's annual budget of around €130 billion.
''Now they are the sponsors of the European taxpayers,'' Ms. Kroes said.

On Tuesday, speaking to investors gathered for an annual meeting at the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, California, Mr. Otellini had vowed that Intel would continue spending vast sums of money toward advancing its manufacturing lead over rivals. Intel has long embraced a strategy of keeping its research and development investments high during downturns as a means of applying more pressure on competitors when better times return.

The decision to impose a severe  fine on Intel is another reminder of the emergence of European regulators as some of the world's most activist enforcers of  antitrust law, and it is an additional sign that the authorities worldwide are raising the stakes for the biggest technology companies.

Last year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission stepped up its inquiries into  Intel, opening a formal investigation.

This week, the head of the  antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department, Christine A. Varney, made clear that regulators would return to an aggressive enforcement policy against companies that abused their market dominance, after more relaxed policies under President George W. Bush. While Mr. Bush was in office, many small companies chose to take their complaints to regulators in Europe and Asia.

HD      RECORD FINE AGAINST INTEL E.U. antitrust regulators flex their muscles  over technology competition

BRUSSELS-- The  European Commission fined Intel a record €1.06 billion Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market, the strongest sign yet that  antitrust authorities worldwide were serious about opening the technology sector to  competition.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said that the penalty against  Intel, the equivalent of $1.44 billion, was justified because the company had skewed  competition to exclude its only serious rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and denied consumers a choice for chips that run personal computers.

TD
Intel ''went to great lengths to cover up its anti-competitive actions'' and ''harmed millions of European consumers'' to maintain its dominance of the global market for the chips, which is worth about €22 billion annually, she said. Sales in Europe represent about a third of that amount.

D.Bruce Sewell,  Intel's chief lawyer, took ''great exception'' to the decision and pledged to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance, the second-highest tribunal in the E.U. after the Court of Justice.

The fine was the largest ever imposed for any breach of  competition law in the European Union, beating by a significant margin the previous records, levied mostly on companies involved in cartels.

The ruling was also another reminder of the emergence of European regulators as some of the world's most activist enforcers of  antitrust law, and an additional sign that the authorities worldwide are challenging the business and growth strategies of technology titans like Microsoft, International Business Machines and Google.

Michael Reynolds, an  antitrust partner with the law firm Allen & Overy in Brussels, said Europe was continuing to burnish its reputation for activism. The  Intel decision showed the commission, the E.U.'s executive arm, ''wanted to send a clear signal that it is taking a leadership role in enforcing  competition rules against dominant companies in the technology markets,'' he said.

Ms. Kroes ordered  Intel to stop offering any rebates that were conditioned on buying less of a rival's product, or not buying them at all, which she said had helped  Intel maintain a share of at least 70 percent of the market for chip sales from October 2002 to December 2007. She said  Intel had granted rebates to major computer makers, including Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC, on the condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies from  Intel. She also said  Intel made payments to some manufacturers in exchange for postponing, canceling or putting restrictions on the introduction or distribution of A.M.D.-based products.

She said Intel also had made payments to Media-Saturn Holding, the owner of the Media Markt chain of superstores, for only selling  Intel-based computers in Germany, Belgium and other countries where the retailer operates.

Page 42 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ms. Kroes said her office had proof of  Intel's activities in the form of e-mail messages collected during surprise raids and formal responses to its inquiry from companies concerned.

Under the order,  Intel must change its business practices immediately pending its appeal, although it can ask for an injunction halting that requirement. The company must write a bank guarantee for the  fine
right away, though that guarantee is held in a bank account until appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.
The commission can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales.  Intel's sales
were $37.6 billion in 2008; thus, the company could have faced a maximum penalty of close to $4 billion.
Money collected in antitrust cases is added to the E.U.'s annual budget of around €130 billion.
''Now they are the sponsors of the European taxpayers,'' Ms. Kroes said, referring to  Intel.

The previous record fine for similar abuses in the European Union was €497 million imposed on Microsoft in March 2004 for blocking  competition in markets for server computers and media software. The previous record for a  fine by the commission was €896 million on a French company, Saint-Gobain, imposed last year for fixing prices in the auto-glass market.

The European Union began stepping up its pursuit of possible violations, and particularly cases in the technology sector, early this decade, when the administration of President George W. Bush backed away from pursuing tough penalties against Microsoft, deciding to settle a case focused on the company's browser software instead.

Last year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission stepped up its inquiries into  Intel, opening a formal investigation.

This week, the head of the  antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department, Christine A. Varney, made clear that regulators would return to an aggressive enforcement policy against companies that abused their market dominance, after more relaxed policies under President Bush.

Lawyers in Brussels say that Ms. Kroes, before her term ends this year, is eager to reach conclusions in inquiries into other U.S. companies, including Rambus, which holds patents on memory chips, and Qualcomm, which develops wireless technology for phones. E.U. regulators are also questioning Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of networking equipment, about whether it restricts  competition for network maintenance services.

I.B.M., which settled a long-running  antitrust case with the commission in the 1980s, faces a new antitrust complaint. And Google, the industry's newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny, in particular for its domination of advertising over the Internet.

Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone maker, has filed a complaint with the commission against a German company, IPCom, over its patenting policy, according to news reports. That would make Nokia one of the few major European technology companies to bring a case in Brussels.

Mr. Sewell,  Intel's lawyer, did not see ''an inherent anti-U.S. bias in the commission's enforcement practices'' in its decision to impose its highest ever  fine on Intel. He said the commission had been willing to investigate and  fine European companies in other sectors and said American companies appeared to dominate the commission's caseload in Europe because of their strength in the important computer sector.

But he insisted that  antitrust agencies in Europe, Japan and Korea had not yet established a consensus about what forms of rebates were permissible.

Referring to the flurry of investigations into  Intel's business practices in recent years, he added ''I think what you see here are agencies beginning to test the boundaries of the law.''

Mr. Sewell's strongest objection to the decision Wednesday was to the finding that Intel had effectively coerced computer makers and retailers with inducements, and he insisted had Intel had never paid to prevent A.M.D. products from reaching the market in Europe. ''At no point has there ever been any kind of naked payment by  Intel,'' he said. ''The issue is whether the rebates we offered were conditional, and our position very definitely is that they were not.''

The Intel decision is likely to be closely scrutinized for its effectiveness, in particular for signs that orders to cease rebate practices will make the microchip market more competitive. Those orders could have a far greater effect on  Intel than the  fine, which analysts said the company could easily afford.

Martin Reynolds, an analyst in San Jose, California, at the research firm Gartner, said most of the rebate offers found illegal in Europe were made verbally by  Intel sales representatives rather than put into writing in sales agreements. Even so, the decision to sanction such agreements could be an impediment to its dealings with big computer makers in China and Taiwan that ship to the E.U.
''Intel is going to have to be very careful now about how it controls its sales force,'' Mr. Reynolds said. He said he expected the global market shares between  Intel and A.M.D. to remain unchanged unless
A.M.D. developed a new chip feature which gave the company's microprocessors a technological
advantage over Intel.

But Nick Hyslop, a technology analyst in London at RBC Capital Markets, said the commission's ruling would lead Intel to change its way of doing business in Europe and that it could embolden A.M.D. and others to take a greater share of the chip market, especially in markets for chips where  Intel's dominance has not yet been established.

''I think it's an open question whether  Intel will be able to transfer its dominance from desktops and laptops to netbooks,'' Mr. Hyslop said.

HD               European Regulators Fine Intel $1.4 Bil For Violations

LP
After the  European Commission Wednesday hit  Intel with a record $1.4 billion  antitrust fine, analysts and investors assessed the impact and found ... no big deal.

Intel (INTC) shares stayed mostly flat on the day and ended down a fraction in average volume.

TD
Standard & Poor's issued a statement saying the  fine wouldn't affect its rating or outlook on the world's No. 1 chipmaker.

"It's probably not going to impact  Intel," said FBR's Craig Berger, who says  Intel generates more than $1.4 billion in cash every quarter. "It's not very meaningful," said the analyst, who maintained a market perform, or neutral, rating.

Still, analysts said the ruling could help  Intel's smaller archrival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in the marketplace. And AMD said it would help in its pending U.S.  antitrust suit against  Intel. AMD shares rose a fraction Wednesday.

AMD sued Intel in June 2005, claiming the chip giant was using illegal tactics to block computer makers such as Dell (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) from buying AMD chips. That suit is set to go to court in Delaware in March.

Wedbush Securities analyst Patrick Wang says the EC  fine gives AMD a possibly useful bargaining chip in any settlement talks it might have with  Intel before the U.S. case goes to court.

"The ruling gives AMD a little more ammunition," said Wang, who rates  Intel a buy and AMD a hold.
The EC has been investigating  Intel's business practices at the behest of AMD for as far back as
2000. The EC, which arbitrates trade disputes for the European Union, ruled Wednesday that Intel
violated antitrust rules that prohibit the  abuse of a dominant market position. Besides the fine, it
ordered that Intel cease such activities.
In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission and state of New York continue to investigate  Intel over
antitrust.

Intel has nearly 80% of the market for microprocessors, the central chip that runs personal computers. AMD has nearly 20%, while a few small players have slivers.

The EC found that Intel engaged in practices meant to exclude AMD and all rivals from the market. The commission said Intel gave what it termed "hidden rebates" to computer makers on condition that they buy all or nearly all their microprocessors from  Intel.
It also said  Intel paid computer makers to halt or delay the launch of products they made using
AMD chips.

Intel says it will appeal. It doesn't have to pay the  fine during the appeal, but it does have to set aside a cash reserve. That will show up in  Intel's financial results this quarter as a non-cash transaction.

In a conference call with reporters after the EC action,  Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said the company indeed does give rebates to PC makers, but he said that it's all aboveboard.

"We do not have those kinds (illegal) of rebates in our contracts," he said.  Intel's rebates are a standard, "the more you buy, the less you pay" type, he said.
Otellini said he couldn't comment in detail until he and company lawyers had closely reviewed the
500-plus page EC ruling. He says  Intel will comply with any rules set by the EC.

Intel Chairman Craig Barrett, in an interview, said the market should decide who wins and loses. Observers have pointed out that the cost of computer chips has steadily declined.

"It's strange the European Union is coming after a market that is behaving as it should," said Barrett, who preceded Otellini as  Intel's CEO. "Good technology wins. But there seems to be a feeling in the EU that you should not have dominant players."
Barrett says  Intel hasn't been able to present all of its evidence before the EC.

"In (European appeals) court we will be able to present all the evidence," he said. "When you're dealing with regulators (such as the EC), they have kind of a very closed operating environment and don't necessarily peruse all the evidence. And you never really get to tell your side of the story."
AMD General Counsel Harry Wolin told IBD the ruling should help AMD with its U.S. suit.

"Where we get potential remedies and monetary damages is in our U.S. litigation," Wolin said. "I think anybody who is looking into this will be interested to know that the EU as well as Japan and Korea's FTC have taken action against  Intel."

The Japanese Fair Trade Commission in March 2005 sanctioned  Intel for misconduct in competition with AMD.  Intel didn't admit guilt or contest the charges. It avoided a  fine but was ordered to change its business practices.

Last June, South Korea's FTC  fined Intel $25 million for illegal rebate practices, the same reason for the EC's ruling Wednesday.
"I would love for a (U.S.) jury to see the facts," Wolin added.

HD          Intel fined €1.06 billion over illegal practices. BY         JAMIE SMYTH in Brussels

THE EUROPEAN Commission has fined Intel a record €1.06 billion for harming millions of European consumers by acting illegally to keep rivals out of the computer chip market.

It has also ordered the US firm, which employs 5,000 people in Ireland, to immediately stop illegal activities such as paying retailers not to stock computers with rival chips.

TD
“Such a serious and sustained violation of EU’s  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated,” said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, who added that  Intel knew exactly what it was doing and made deliberate attempts to cover up its anti-competitive behaviour.
The penalty is the biggest ever anti-trust  fine handed down by the EU executive. It is almost double the
€497 million fine levied against Microsoft in 2004 and is almost certain to lead to a similarly lengthy and
expensive legal battle between  Intel and the commission.

Intel immediately said it would appeal the decision to the European Court of First Instance. “The basic allegation against  Intel is that it used lower prices, in the form of rebates, to prevent customers from buying or supporting AMD, or to punish customers that did. Such claims are false,” said  Intel’s general counsel Bruce Sewell in Brussels.

He moved to reassure European consumers and staff at  Intel in Europe. “We are committed to maintaining a very strong presence in Europe. We have made significant investment in Ireland and outside Ireland,” said Mr Sewell. “We will stay.”

The commission’s eight-year investigation into  Intel’s sales practices was sparked by a complaint from its main competitor, the rival chipmaker AMD. The commission said it had uncovered evidence that Intel engaged in two specific types of illegal activity. Between 2002 and 2007  Intel, which had 70 per cent market share at the time, gave hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 computer chips.  Intel also made direct payments to major retailer,
Germany’s Media Saturn Holding, on condition it only stocked products using x86 chips. These rebates and payments prevented customers – and consumers – from choosing rival products, the commission said.

Secondly, the commission alleges that  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing rival chips. On one occasion a payment resulted in a
six-month delay to a rival’s product, said Ms Kroes, adding that the illegal activities went beyond the scope of normal price competition. She said the computer manufacturers and the retailer that accepted the rebates with conditions attached were victims in the case and were not involved in the illegal
activity.

The commission had already sent relevant information to other anti-trust authorities in Japan, South Korea and the US. The commission would monitor closely  Intel’s compliance with the decision, which Ms Kroes insisted did not limit firms’ ability to provide customers with discounts, but rather targeted the conditions attached to rebates. She said the commission decision was legally water-tight and was based on existing case law, including one case in 1997 involving Irish Sugar, and rigorous analysis of the facts.

Mr Sewell said he was “mystified” by some of Ms Kroes’s comments, and questioned the “weak evidence” the commission had gathered.  Intel would attempt to comply, but was not sure exactly what was required.

AMD chief executive Dirk Meyer said the ruling was an important step towards establishing a truly competitive market. “We are looking forward to the move, from a world in which  Intel ruled to one which is ruled by customers.”

The world is returning to the 1970s on most economic policies, so why not  antitrust too? Judging by events this week,  antitrust enforcement in the U.S. and Europe is in for a major comeback, whether or not consumers benefit.

Yesterday in Brussels, the  European Commission imposed a record antitrust fine of $1.45 billion on Intel for the heinous crime of discounting computer chips in its fierce and long-running  competition with AMD. Meanwhile on Monday, President Obama's new  antitrust chief, Christine Varney, issued a radical revision of the Department of Justice's own  antitrust enforcement standards. Ms. Varney's ambition seems to be nothing less than bringing Europe's corporatist approach to  competition policy to the U.S. To succeed, she will have to flout or overturn decades of Supreme Court precedent on the limits of U.S. antitrust law.

TD
But Ms. Varney can be sure of a friendly ear in Brussels, which has never let go of the idea that competition is best when there isn't much of it. The Commission's attitude is on full display in the fining of Intel for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the market for computer processors. For years, Intel and AMD have been essentially the only game in town for computer CPUs. The Commission's complaint amounts to little more than a whinge that  Intel won more of this business than the Commission would prefer.

This is couched in dark-sounding talk about  Intel paying computer makers not to buy AMD chips. But remember there is only so much demand and there are only two major market players. So any order won by Intel by offering a discount or a rebate is, by definition, an order lost by AMD. And yet the Commission bizarrely claims that "millions of Europeans" have been harmed by this price war.

Intel has been able to sell enough chips cheaply enough to maintain an overall market share that has hovered between 75% and 80% for years. And those lower prices help drive down the price of a computer, which is good for consumers. A less competitive market for chips, or one in which  Intel is barred from offering discounts to its biggest customers, would mean higher consumer prices. The Commission also suggests that  Intel may have sold some chips below its cost, but  Intel denies this and claims it can prove it if the Commission would deign to consider its evidence.

The Commission is, as ever, more focused on preserving competitor welfare above consumer welfare, and Ms. Varney at Justice seems to be promoting a similar approach. The American left likes to advertise itself as pro-consumer. But the curious reality about the left's view of antitrust in both Europe and America is that it is often used to assist big business by dampening competition. This corporatist notion seems to be that companies should compete, so long as no one really loses. Ms. Varney paid lip service to the dangers of protecting competitors when she criticized the National Industrial Recovery
Act, ushered in by FDR during the Great Depression. That odious piece of industrial policy blessed price collusion between big firms in exchange for a commitment to keep people employed and share some of the collusive profits with labor.

But in her speech, Ms. Varney tries to cast this anticompetitive act as a form of deregulation. In fact, the NIRA was regulation of the worst sort, protecting competitors from competitive harm in the name of some greater good. True deregulation aims at greater  competition, while European (and Rooseveltian) corporatism dampens it. This historical obfuscation allows Ms. Varney to argue that it would be good for
Page 49 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
competition to adopt something like Europe's "abuse of dominant position" standard in place of the consumer-harm test that currently prevails in the U.S.

Europe's  Intel case makes the importance of these different tests very clear. By any reasonable application of a consumer-harm test, the  antitrust claim that  Intel is driving down prices -- and so making computers less expensive -- would be laughed out of U.S. court. The only harm here is to a competitor that can't match  Intel's prices. And even at that, AMD isn't exactly going out of business. At
times its market share for consumer desktop CPUs has been as high as 50%, and at its most successful the upper bound has been determined as much by AMD's own manufacturing capacity as by  Intel's behavior.

When she announced the judgment against  Intel Wednesday, European  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes praised Ms. Varney's new approach to  antitrust. And no wonder. Regulators love company, and European regulators in particular love it when their American counterparts help them hamstring the most efficient U.S. companies. Why President Obama should want to punish U.S. multinationals is harder to figure since his political success hangs on economic recovery and a revival in business profits and hiring. But perhaps we should conclude that this is merely one more example of the ways in which this Administration is seeking to remake American capitalism in the image of Continental Europe.

May 14 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in the New York Times business pages on
Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* In its first detailed effort to overhaul financial regulations, the Obama administration on Wednesday sought new authority over the complex financial instruments, known as derivatives, that were a major cause of the financial crisis and have gone largely unregulated for decades.

TD
* Two months after a program from the Obama administration began to help millions of Americans avoid foreclosure, about 55,000 homeowners are enrolled.

* A class-action lawsuit over the strategies that Merck & Co used to market its painkiller Vioxx in Australia is earning the American drug maker some bad publicity.

* Craigslist, the Web's largest classified advertising site, said on Wednesday that it would close its erotic services category, which critics have said is a forum that fosters prostitution and other illegal activities.

* On Wednesday, the government reported that retail sales fell again as consumers spent less on gasoline, appliances and groceries, signaling that they are not likely to begin spending in droves anytime soon.

* Edward Liddy, the chairman of the American International Group Inc , said on Wednesday that the company would probably need three to five years to carry out its restructuring plan and fully repay the taxpayer bailout money.

* Britain's recovery will probably be "slow and protracted," the Bank of England warned Wednesday, tempering positive sentiment from recent economic reports suggesting that the end of the recession might be in sight.

* Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday that the administration would provide a new round of capital assistance for smaller banks and would increase the amount that they can borrow from the program.

* Despite complaints that banks and credit card companies are gouging customers by charging outrageous interest rates, the Senate on Wednesday turned back an effort to cap interest rates at 15 percent.

* Verizon Communications Inc on Wednesday took another step away from its century-old heritage as a company that provides telephone service over copper wires. It agreed to sell divisions that offer service to
4.8 million phone lines in 14 states to Frontier Communications Corp for $3.3 billion in cash and $5.2 billion in Frontier stock.

* A French court on Wednesday rejected a claim from the cosmetics company L'Oreal that the online auctioneer eBay Inc was profiting from sales of counterfeit perfumes. The court said that eBay was making a reasonable effort to keep fake goods off its site.

* Taiwan's economy has been bullish as the island prepares to allow Chinese investments again after 60 years.

* The casino operator MGM Mirage took a significant step to stave off bankruptcy on Wednesday when it announced that it would issue $2.5 billion in stock and bonds as part of a broad effort to reduce its $14 billion in debt.

* Industrial production in China rose less than expected in April, the latest reminder that while the country's economy is on a relatively firm footing, the pace of growth is unlikely to bounce back to the levels seen in the last few years.

* The European Commission finedIntel Corp a record 1.06 billion euros Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market, the strongest sign yet that regulators worldwide are serious about opening the technology sector to  competition.

A COMPUTER chip giant was hit with a record £953million (€1.06billion)  fine yesterday for breaking EU
rules on fair competition.

Intel was found guilty of paying computer makers and a retailer to use its chips rather than those of
Advanced Micro Devices.

TD
The two companies make almost all the central processing chips which run the world's personal computers.

'Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years,' said  competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. 'Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated.' The  fine dwarfs the previous EU record of £680million levied on Microsoft last year for charging its rivals unreasonable fees to access its Windows software.
Although huge, the  fine represents about four per cent of  Intel's turnover in 2008. The maximum penalty the EU can impose is ten per cent of annual turnover.

Intel's chief executive Paul Otellini criticised the decision and accused the  European Commission of being unrealistic.

'We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,' he said.

'There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers,' he said, adding that his company planned to appeal..

THE EU  fined Intel a record €1.06billion yesterday, saying the world's biggest computer chip maker used illegal sales tactics to shut out a smaller rival.

Intel, based in California, has about 80 per cent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market - and faces just one real rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

TD
The European Commission says Intel broke EU competition law by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to keep AMD out of the market that limited customer choice.

It said Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for buying all or almost all their x86 computer processing units, or CPUs, from  Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

Regulators said the company also paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer, Media Saturn Holding from 2002 to 2007 to only stock  Intel-based computers.

'Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years,' said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. 'Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated.'

Intel president and CEO Paul Otellini said the company would appeal to the EU courts because 'the decision is wrong'.

CORRECTION APPENDED

Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a  fine against Intel by antitrust regulators in Europe erroneously included one company on a list of technology companies under investigation by those authorities. Google is not the subject of an inquiry by the  European Commission.
CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue May 19 2009

LP
BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market, the strongest sign yet that regulators worldwide are serious about opening the technology sector to  competition.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the penalty against  Intel, the equivalent of $1.45 billion, was justified because the company had skewed  competition and denied consumers a choice for chips.

TD
Intel ''went to great lengths to cover up its anti-competitive actions'' and ''harmed millions of European consumers'' to maintain its dominance of the global market for the chips, which is worth about 22 billion euros a year, Ms. Kroes said. Sales in Europe represent about a third of that amount.

D. Bruce Sewell,  Intel's chief lawyer, took ''great exception'' with the decision and pledged to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance, the second-highest tribunal in Europe.

The fine was the largest ever for any breach of  competition law in the European Union, previous records were levied mostly on companies involved in cartels.

The ruling was also a reminder of the emergence of European regulators as some of the most activist enforcers of  antitrust law, and an additional sign that the authorities worldwide are challenging the business and growth strategies of technology titans like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Google.

Michael Reynolds, an  antitrust partner with the law firm Allen & Overy in Brussels, said Europe was continuing to burnish its reputation for activism.

The Intel decision showed the commission ''wanted to send a clear signal that it is taking a leadership role in enforcing  competition rules against dominant companies in the technology markets,'' Mr. Reynolds said.

Ms. Kroes ordered  Intel to stop offering rebates that were conditioned on buying less of a rival's product, or not buying them at all, which she said had helped  Intel maintain a share of at least 70 percent of chip sales market from October 2002 to December 2007.



Page 57 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
She said Intel had granted rebates to major computer, including Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC, on the condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies from  Intel.

She also said Intel made payments to some manufacturers in exchange of postponing, canceling or putting restrictions on the introduction or distribution of AMD-based products.

She said Intel also had made payments to Media Saturn Holding, the owner of the MediaMarkt chain of superstores for only selling  Intel-based computers in Germany, Belgium and other countries.

Ms. Kroes said her officials had proof of  Intel's activities in the form of e-mail messages collected during surprise raids and formal responses to its inquiry from companies concerned.

Under the order,  Intel must change its practices immediately pending its appeal, although it can ask for an injunction.

The company must write a bank guarantee for the  fine right away, though that guarantee is held in a bank account until appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.

The commission can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global sales.  Intel's sales were $37.6 billion in 2008; thus, the company could have faced a penalty of close to $4 billion. Money collected in antitrust cases is added to the trade bloc's annual budget of around 130 billion euros.

The previous record fine for similar abuses in the European Union was 497 million euros imposed on Microsoft in March 2004 for blocking competition in markets for server computers and media software. The previous record for a fine by the commission was 896 million euros on a French company, Saint-Gobain, imposed last year for fixing prices in the auto-glass market.

The European Union began stepping up its pursuit of possible violations, and particularly cases in the technology sector, early this decade, when the Bush administration backed away from pursuing tough penalties against Microsoft, deciding to settle a case focused on the company's browser software instead.

Last year, the Federal Trade Commission in Washington stepped up its inquiries into  Intel, opening a formal investigation.

This week, the head of the  antitrust division of the Justice Department, Christine A. Varney, made clear that regulators would return to an aggressive enforcement policy against companies that abused their market dominance.

Lawyers in Brussels say that Ms. Kroes, before her term ends this year, is eager to reach conclusions in inquiries into other companies, including Rambus, which holds patents on memory chips, and Qualcomm, which develops wireless technology for phones.

Regulators are also questioning Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of networking equipment, about the market for network maintenance services.

I.B.M., which settled a long-running  antitrust case with the commission in the 1980s, faces a new complaint. And Google, the industry's newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny, in particular for its domination of advertising over the Internet.

Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone giant, has filed a complaint with the commission against a German company, IPCom, over its patenting policy, according to news reports. That would make Nokia one of the few major European technology companies to bring a case in Brussels.

Mr. Sewell,  Intel's lawyer, did not see ''an inherent anti-U.S. bias in the commission's enforcement practices'' in its decision to impose its highest ever  fine on Intel.

He said the commission had been willing to investigate and levy  fines against European companies in other sectors and said American companies appeared to dominate the commission's caseload in Europe because of their strength in the important computer sector.

But he insisted that  antitrust agencies in Europe, Japan and South Korea had not yet established a consensus about what forms of rebates were permissible.

''The law is in now flux,'' Mr. Sewell said. Referring to the flurry of investigations into  Intel's business practices in recent years, he added ''I think what you see here are agencies beginning to test the boundaries of the law.''

Mr. Sewell's strongest objection to the decision Wednesday was to the finding that  Intel had effectively coerced computer makers and retailers with inducements, and he insisted had  Intel had never paid to prevent AMD products from reaching the market in Europe.

''At no point has there ever been any kind of naked payment by  Intel,'' said Mr. Sewell. ''The issue is whether the rebates we offered were conditional, and our position very definitely is that they were not.''

The Intel decision is likely to be closely scrutinized for its effectiveness, in particular for signs that orders to cease rebate practices will make the microchip market more competitive. Those orders could have a far greater effect on  Intel than the  fine, which analysts said the company could easily afford.

Martin Reynolds, an analyst in San Jose, Calif., at the research firm Gartner, said most of the rebate offers found illegal in Europe were made verbally by  Intel sales representatives rather than put into writing in sales agreements.

Even so, the decision to sanction such agreements could be an impediment to its dealings with big computer makers in China and Taiwan that ship to the European Union.
''Intel is going to have to be very careful now about how it controls its sales force,'' Mr. Reynolds said. He said he expected the global market shares between  Intel and AMD to remain unchanged unless
AMD developed a new chip feature which gave the company's microprocessors a technological
advantage over Intel.

But Nick Hyslop, a technology analyst in London at RBC Capital Markets, said the commission's ruling would force  Intel to change its way of doing business in Europe and that it could embolden AMD and others to take a greater share of the chip market, especially in markets for chips where Intel's dominance has not yet been established.

''I think it's an open question whether  Intel will be able to transfer its dominance from desktops and laptops to netbooks,'' Mr. Hyslop said.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market to exclude its only serious rival, Advanced Micro Devices.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the penalty against  Intel was justified because the company had skewed  competition and denied consumers a choice for chips.

TD
Ms. Kroes said  Intel had ''used illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude its only competitor and reduce consumers' choice -- and the whole story is about consumers.'' She said  Intel's practices had
''undermined innovation.''

The previous record fine for similar abuses in the European Union was 497 million euros imposed on Microsoft in March 2004 for blocking  competition in markets for server computers and media software.

D. Bruce Sewell, Intel's general counsel, acknowledged during a news conference in Brussels that numerous antitrust agencies had been examining his company's business practices, including the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, which opened an investigation last year.

''The law is now in flux,'' Mr. Sewell said. ''I think what you see here are agencies beginning to test the boundaries of the law.''

The South Korea authorities imposed a penalty on  Intel of $25 million last year, while authorities in Japan reached a settlement with the company because they found it had not actually been using the practices that most concerned them, he said. He also insisted that  antitrust agencies in Europe, Japan and Korea had not yet established a consensus about what forms of rebates were permissible.
The chief executive of  Intel, Paul S. Otellini, said Wednesday that the company would appeal.

''We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,'' Mr. Otellini said. ''There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.''

Giuliano Meroni, president of A.M.D.'s operations in Europe, said the decision would ''shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers.''

Ms. Kroes ordered  Intel to stop offering rebates that were conditioned on buying less of a rival's products, or not buying them at all -- practices that the commission said had helped  Intel maintain a share of at least 70 percent of the market for microchip sales from October 2002 to December 2007.

Under the order,  Intel must change its business practices immediately pending its appeal, although it can ask for an injunction. The company must write a bank guarantee for the  fine right away.

European regulators first began investigating  Intel in 2001, after A.M.D. filed a complaint.

In 2007 and 2008, the commission accused  Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers, by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost.
The commission also charged the company with paying retailers not to sell personal computers using
A.M.D. chips.

Intel has repeatedly said it did nothing wrong and that its rebates and discounts were legal and a commonly used way of rewarding companies for purchasing very high volumes of its products.

The Intel decision is likely to be closely scrutinized for its effectiveness. The orders also are a strong signal to other technology companies under investigation, including Rambus, Qualcomm and Google, that additional decisions are probably on the way.

HD            A Ruling Against  Intel, Unlikely  to Drag It Down

LP
European regulators have spent close to nine years investigating whether  Intel, the world's largest chip maker, illegally hampered competitors in its dealings with computer makers and retailers. And on Wednesday, they finally reached a conclusion, punishing  Intel with a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) for abusing its dominant position in the computer chip market.

The European Commission accused Intel of offering computer makers better deals if they would agree to sell products that relied solely on Intel's processors or delay products that used chips made by Intel's rival, Advanced Micro Devices. In addition, regulators said  Intel paid a retailer to keep only Intel chips in stock.

TD
While the commission does not want to eliminate volume discounts, which are common in the PC
industry, it ordered  Intel to stop placing onerous conditions on the recipients.
But while A.M.D. cheered the ruling as encouraging challengers to  Intel's dominance, the history of
antitrust cases against Intel and other big technology companies suggests that little will change.

As the world's largest chip maker and the co-creator of the PC industry,  Intel brings vast technological and business resources to a game whose rules change at Internet speed. A few minutes in the penalty box, while perhaps costly, will hardly have any impact on  Intel's position.

''There is nothing in this ruling that reverses Moore's Law,'' said Paul S. Otellini,  Intel's chief executive, during a conference call to discuss the ruling in Europe. He was referring to the observation made famous by  Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore, that the computing muscle of chips tends to double about every two years, even as prices fall.

Intel and A.M.D. have squabbled in courtrooms for decades, arguing over issues like  Intel's control over the underlying architecture of PC chips and the company's sales tactics. A.M.D. has achieved a number of victories in these cases and is the main alternative to  Intel as the supplier of the powerful microprocessors that function as the brains of PCs and computer servers.

However, A.M.D.'s overall position in the chip market has remained relatively constant.  Intel tends to claim about 80 percent of total PC and server chip sales, while A.M.D. takes close to 20 percent.

''That really has never shifted much, whether there are  antitrust rulings or not,'' said Dan Hutcheson, the chief executive of VLSI Research, a chip research firm.

A.M.D. argues that the commission's decision will have a big impact. ''With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation,'' said Thomas M. McCoy, A.M.D.'s executive vice president for legal affairs.

Through complaints in Europe, Asia and the United States, A.M.D. has spent vast amounts of time and money raising concerns about  Intel's interactions with the companies that produce and sell PCs
Page 62 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and servers, such as Dell and Acer. A.M.D. has accused  Intel of essentially paying companies to not use A.M.D.'s chips in their products and to delay the release of products based on A.M.D.'s chips.

Last year, Korean regulators fined Intel for harming A.M.D.'s business. And now the European Commission has followed suit. The competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said Intel had skewed competition and denied consumers a choice for chips, with practices that ''undermined innovation.''

Intel plans to appeal the European ruling and has denied including any exclusionary measures in its contracts with customers or retailers.

Many analysts charge that A.M.D.'s intense focus on trying to alter  Intel's interactions with customers will have little impact on its overall business.

''When you get down to it, whatever  Intel is doing that A.M.D. is complaining about probably isn't making that much of a difference,'' said Linley Gwennap, a chip analyst at the Linley Group. ''The Intel discounts or whatever are just noise.''

A.M.D.'s most impressive and profitable moments have come when it has read the technology tea leaves and developed superior products. At times, A.M.D. has beaten  Intel on overall PC chip speeds. In 2003, it introduced a server chip called Opteron that shook up the market and for the first time made the company a serious player in the data centers of large businesses.

In fact, A.M.D.'s successes during the last few years, achieved while European regulators conducted their investigation, have altered the chip landscape. A.M.D.'s chips now appear in both the PCs and the servers of most major manufacturers.

''Europe's case is really predicated on the idea that there will be future harm to A.M.D.,'' said Geoffrey Manne, who has practiced  antitrust law and taught at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore. ''It is really hard to find evidence of that now.''

One of A.M.D.'s major problems has been its inability to produce top-notch products regularly. After a series of ground-breaking chips, it often ends up shipping products late or has to rework them to eliminate troublesome bugs.  Intel, meanwhile, uses its vast resources to catch up and then surpass A.M.D.

''A.M.D. is basically operating on a shoestring,'' Mr. Gwennap said. ''If you have a slip-up, that can kill your revenue for the next couple of years. But  Intel has projects and back-up projects and back-ups to the back-ups.''

A.M.D. insists that  Intel has just as many problems getting new chips out, but can use its heft to outflank competitors.

''When you are one of the biggest and richest monopolies of the century, it is pretty easy to hide your sins,'' said Mr. McCoy of A.M.D. ''They shoot us in the knee and then tell everyone, 'Hey, look, they don't run fast.' ''

The industry is paying more attention these days to  Intel's dealings in markets other than PCs.  Intel is gunning for Nvidia in the graphics-chip market and for Freescale Semiconductor, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments in cellphone chips.
Ultimately, the  European Commission's ruling appears to address yesterday's problems.

''There is a recognition in the U.S. that this is a problem, but no court has tried to confront it or change its approach based on this fear that things change too quickly for a remedy to have any impact,'' said Keith N. Hylton, a Boston University law professor.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union finedIntel Corp. a record euro1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) yesterday and ordered the world's biggest maker of computer chips to stop illegal sales tactics that shut out Silicon Valley rival AMD.

The fine, which exceeded a euro899 million  monopoly abuse penalty imposed on Microsoft Corp. last year, was denounced by  Intel, which plans to appeal to an EU court within 60 days.

TD
"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for over five years, the size of the  fine should come as no surprise," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"Intel did not compete fairly, frustrating innovation and reducing consumer welfare in the process." The European Commission also told Intel to immediately cease some sales practices in Europe,
though it refused to say what those were.

Intel said it was "mystified" about what it was supposed to change but would comply with the
"extremely ambiguous" EU order.

"This is really just a matter of competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious," said Intel's CEO, Paul Otellini.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has about 80 percent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market and faces just one real rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has its headquarters just 3 miles from  Intel in Sunnyvale, Calif.

The two companies have been fighting for years over what AMD claims is  Intel's intimidation of computer makers into striking exclusive deals for the chips they use in their new machines.

AMD claims the rebates and financial incentives that  Intel offers to those companies for buying more Intel chips are designed to prevent AMD from gaining market share.

AMD argues that  Intel's volume discounts are sometimes so steep that AMD can't cut its own prices enough to compete without losing money on the sales.
In siding with AMD to wrap up an eight-year probe, the  European Commission said Intel broke EU
competition law by exploiting its dominant position, thereby limiting customer choice.
The EU said  Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturers Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp. for buying all or most of their chips from  Intel and paid them
to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.


Page 67 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission said price discounts were linked to promises from computer manufacturers to restrict AMD purchases.

It said such discounts were left off  Intel's official contracts because the company "went to great lengths to cover up many of its anticompetitive actions."

Officials said they learned of them through e-mails and statements from businesses, some seized during surprise raids.

Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel, said the case was based on weak evidence and unfair inferences from a small number of documents.
Mr. Otellini said "there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers."

But AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer said the decision was "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market."

"AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Mr. Meyer said in a
statement.
Tom McCoy, AMD's executive vice president for legal affairs, said the ruling would bring consumers
"greater choice, value and innovation."
Regulators said Intel also paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer, Media Saturn Holding, from
2002 to 2007 to stock only  Intel-based computers at its MediaMarkt superstores, even in Dresden,
Germany, where many AMD chips are made.

The decision does not affect  Intel's pricing strategy outside Europe but could have an important effect in the United States and Asia.

This week, one of the top U.S.  antitrust officials, Christine Varney, signaled a return to trustbusting as the Obama administration dropped a strict interpretation of  antitrust rules that saw regulators shun major action against alleged monopolies during the Bush years.

EU regulators said they calculated  Intel's fine -- 4 percent of last year's $37.6 billion in worldwide sales -- on the value of its European chip sales over the five years and three months that it broke the law.
Europeans buy some 30 percent of all computer chips sold every year. The EU could have gone even higher.
EU antitrust rules allow for a fine of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global revenue for each year of bad behavior.
The EU said the  fine must be paid within three months.

The money eventually goes into the EU budget, reducing the funding it seeks from European taxpayers.

HD          Intel to Get EU Antitrust Fine

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Wednesday will  fine the world's biggest computer-chip maker, Intel Corp., for breaking European antitrust rules, people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, will also tell  Intel to make changes to the way it provides rebates to computer makers, the people said.

TD
Commission officials spent most of Friday discussing the  Intel fine with national  competition authorities, which according to EU procedure also have a say on the matter, the people familiar with the case said.

They added that once all the stakeholders have had their say on the  fine, the final document will be presented to the college of commissioners Wednesday, which is then likely to adopt it.

An Intel spokesman declined to comment, except to say that word of the pending decision amounts to rumors and speculation. A commission spokesman declined to comment.

Intel's trouble with the commission dates from 2000, when chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., filed a complaint saying Intel was blocking its access to the market. In 2007, the EU sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging Intel kept AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer makers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down and by selling chips below cost to thwart AMD from swooping on key accounts. Last year, the EU added more charges, alleging  Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

The commission's decision set for Wednesday is said to be extremely complex and lengthy, in order to safeguard the antitrust enforcer against any possible legal challenges from  Intel, which is likely facing one of the highest fines in Europe's  antitrust history, according to Brussels-based lawyers.
EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes can, under commission's rules,  fine Intel as much as 10%
of its annual revenue, which in 2008 was almost $38 billion. Last year, the commission issued a record
$1.16 billion fine against Microsoft Corp. for noncompliance in the EU's long-running  antitrust fight with
the software giant.

NEW YORK, May 15 -- Selected editorial excerpts from the U.S. press:
JUSTICE DEPT.'S  ANTITRUST ENFORCER (Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles)

TD
One of President Obama's top  antitrust enforcers, Assistant Atty. Gen. Christine Varney, pledged this week to hold big businesses to a tougher standard than the previous administration imposed. Two days later, as if on cue, the  European Commission gave U.S. companies a preview of how such a standard might be applied. The commission levied a record-setting $1.45-billion fine on Intel Corp. for trying to exclude competing manufacturers from the market for computer chips. Intel maintains its innocence and says it never sold chips at less than what it cost to make them. That sort of argument might have persuaded antitrust officials in the Bush administration not to sue a company. But judging from her remarks, it's not likely to sway Varney.

At issue is how aggressively companies can compete after they gain a dominant share of a market (that is, once they've captured about two-thirds of the sales). The Bush Justice Department brought relatively few cases against such firms. In fact, in a report issued last year, it outlined numerous reasons why seemingly anti-competitive actions might actually benefit consumers by making the market more efficient. Varney, the new head of the Justice Department's  antitrust division, rejected that approach in her first public speech Monday. Her message was nuanced but still clear: Her team would be far less hesitant to bring cases against dominant firms that try to exclude competitors from their markets.

Varney won't be taking on  Intel; the Federal Trade Commission is already investigating the company, as is the state of New York. Nor did she point to any potential targets in her speech, which should be
viewed more as a warning shot to big business in general. Nevertheless, the  European Commission's case against Intel illustrates the type of allegations likely to get Varney's attention. The commission found that the company offered computer makers discounts on the condition that they used its chips in
80 percent to 100 percent of their laptops and/or desktops.  Intel denies having done this, but if the commission is correct, that's the sort of behavior that shouldn't be excused by noting how fast prices have dropped or how innovative the market has been.

We share Varney's skepticism that consumers benefit in the long run when companies can take advantage of their dominant market position to grind down competitors or muscle their way into new product lines.

HD            For Intel's Otellini,  it's time to get paranoid; Dominance  safe even as antitrust headaches intensify

LP
SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- One of Paul Otellini's predecessors as CEO of  Intel, the legendary Andy Grove, famously declared that, in the high-pressure world of technology, "only the paranoid survive."

Four years after taking over  Intel's chief executive slot, Otellini certainly has his own reasons to be a bit paranoid.

TD
The chip giant (INTC, US) is besieged on several fronts by allegations that it bullies and coerces customers, and doesn't play fair in competing with its smaller rival in the PC-processor space, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, US).

Earlier this week,  Intel was slapped with a $1.45 billion  fine by the European Commission over what regulators allege were illegal practices designed to help the company maintain its market dominance. Intel has vowed to appeal the ruling and the  fine -- the largest ever imposed by the E.U. regulator. (RELATED ARTICLE:  Intel fined a record $1.45 bln by E.U. regulator)

Although the European  fine will not likely affect  Intel's position as the world's No. 1 maker of computer chips, it could become the first in a series of legal blows that would threaten to emerge as an expensive distraction for Otellini and his team.

Otellini himself expressed his frustration when asked in a call with reporters how big a burden the E.U. has become for his team.

"Well, it's expensive," Otellini said. "I haven't found a low-priced lawyer yet that's any good. You want to have the best, and they cost quite a bit. And the whole process, beyond the cost, is
time-consuming."

Otellini would know.  Intel's legal issues have been hanging over his head since he took over as CEO in 2005. Within weeks Otellini moved into  Intel's corner office, AMD filed a civil case that contained many of the key allegations raised in later complaints in Europe, Asia and the United States.

"It's been in the background for his entire term as CEO," said  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. "He took over as CEO in May 2005, and this case was filed in June. It's been part of the fabric."

Otellini has said he is "baffled" by the European Union's allegations that the company essentially bribed and coerced customers to shut out AMD. His argument is straightforward: that  Intel never -- ever -- played the tricks the E.U. alleged, and there is no shred of evidence to prove that it did.

Because many of the detailed charges are still confidential, analysts say it's hard to evaluate the evidence against  Intel, which has vowed to appeal the ruling and defend itself in court related to other complaints and investigations, including one by the Federal Trade Commission.

Page 78 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Lessons from Grove
But there's some speculation over how  Intel ended up in a multifront, and embarrassing, legal mess. "Just from the outside, you have to scratch your head and ask, 'How did it come to this?' " said
veteran Silicon Valley lawyer Gary Reback, author of the newly published  antitrust-issues-related
book "Free the Market."

"You would wonder, when the complaints started coming, why somebody didn't shut the door down instead of letting this mushroom into this  fine," he added.

Analyst Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group said  Intel's legal dilemma is striking for another reason: The company, especially under Grove, has always been known for its keen focus on legal matters.
Grove "recognized that with dominance was going to come a series of challenges and he realized a
lot of them was going to be legal," Enderle said. "Intel really put in place a legal defensive weapon. ...
Andy Grove built this organization and made sure Intel never blatantly crossed the line."

Analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research echoed this point, saying that, in a way, Grove's mantra about paranoia applied both to going after rivals and making sure  Intel never got into legal hot water.

"What I could see was Andy's caution being, 'As we get bigger, we need to be more careful,' " he said. "That goes back to the paranoid mindset."

But Enderle argued that something changed when Craig Barrett, who succeeded Grove as CEO, took over.
Barrett's tenure

Barrett was CEO from 1998 to 2005, a time of explosive growth for  Intel -- and of its enshrinement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA, US), in November 1999 -- as well as of intensified competition from AMD. The complaints mentioned in the E.U. ruling and other complaints also roughly coincided with Barrett's tenure, which has triggered speculation that  Intel's problems started on his watch.

During the call with reporters, Otellini was pressed as to whether his argument that  Intel never engaged in anticompetitive behavior applied only to his term.

"Well, the period of time that the decision referred to was 2000 to 2007," he answered. "So I was CEO for two of those years, and Craig was CEO for the others. And my comment was speaking for the company spanning the entire period."

But Enderle argued that there's always been a perception that, under Barrett, "Intel was crossing the line in order to contain market-share losses."
"Poor Paul came in to clean up the mess," Enderle also said. "He's the guy the wave broke on."

Intel spokesman Mulloy, who has worked with Grove, Barrett and Otellini, rejected that view, stressing that  Intel's commitment to operating within the law has never wavered.

"I've been in meetings with all three of them on the subject," he said. "They understand the risks. They understand the law. They listen to legal advice. There hasn't been any change."
This view was endorsed by other  Intel observers.

Analyst Craig Berger of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. said  Intel "pushes forward [at] a manic pace" but added that it's also been known as careful about pushing too hard. He cited his own experience working for Intel when he said one of the company's mantra was, "We play hard, but primary goal is, 'Keep Intel legal.' "

"I never saw  Intel act with anything but the highest ethical integrity when I was employed there," he added.
Otellini's challenge

McCarron of Mercury Research echoed this point, saying this of Barrett: "In the entire time I've known him, I never saw him as someone you could describe as reckless. Aggressive, yes. Reckless, no."



Page 79 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Friedman, Billings & Ramsey's Berger argued that  Intel "is not being treated fairly in light of their amazing and relentless progress down the semiconductor-process-node roadmap, and that the firm has invested and continues to invest more than any other chip firm in the world in order to drive these technological feats."

In any case, it is now up to Otellini to navigate through the most intense legal battles in the company's history, even as he keeps an eye on maintaining the titan's position in the tech industry.

"He will need to get  Intel rallied quickly to compete in different ways," analyst Crawford Del Prete of International Data Corp. said. "What's important to customers has moved from gigahertz to other features like power consumption for PCs and new kinds of devices. This will require leadership that can craft a vision that speaks to these changes. He's right for this."

McCarron of Mercury Research said Otellini "clearly was handed  Intel in a state of transition. It's going to be a challenge, but all the ingredients that led to  Intel's success -- those have not changed."

Still, he said, the  antitrust battles will likely continue to loom over Otellini's tenure: "We'll be seeing him battle with this stuff going forward."

RF            One of Paul Otellini’s predecessors as CEO of Intel, the legendary Andy Grove, famously declared that, in the high-pressure world of technology, “only the paranoid survive.” Otellini is now keenly aware of why.

Setting the tone for more vigorous  antitrust enforcement in the Obama administration, especially with respect to unilateral conduct of market-leading firms, on May 11, 2009, Christine Varney delivered her first public remarks as the new Assistant Attorney General for  Antitrust ("Varney" or "AAG Varney"). Most significantly, Ms. Varney took quick and decisive action and formally withdrew and repudiated Sherman
Act Section 2 enforcement policy articulated in a 215-page report issued by the Antitrust Division under the Bush administration in September 2008. AAG Varney declared that the Antitrust Division will aggressively enforce antitrust laws against predatory or unjustified exclusionary acts by dominant firms. Varney cautioned that businesses, lawyers and courts should not rely on the 2008 report as either a current reflection of  Antitrust Division enforcement policy or an appropriate interpretation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

General Enforcement Policy AAG Varney touched upon a number of points that provide insights into the direction of  antitrust policy anticipated under the new administration. She affirmed that active  antitrust enforcement would be a part of the federal government's response to the distressed economy, indicating that relaxation of  antitrust enforcement was inappropriate, even in a recession. AAG Varney also: expressed concern about the potential for collusive activities, such as bid rigging, among participants in distressed industries, particularly those receiving government funds; suggested that the  Antitrust Division would explore new theories of enforcement in merger and non-merger cases, including examining new theories of vertical restraints, and would be particularly watchful of high-tech and Internet-based markets; explained that the Division would seek to "find the right balance to ensure that when intellectual property is at issue, competition is not thwarted through its misuse or illegal extension"; suggested the need to "recalibrate" economic analysis and bring to bear a comprehensive knowledge of the economic and regulatory environments in various industries; and noted that the Division will contribute its experience and expertise to the Obama administration's efforts to reform industries such as banking, healthcare, energy, telecommunications and transportation. Market Leaders Beware The clearest shift in enforcement policy signaled by AAG Varney is in the area of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits monopolization, attempted monopolization and conspiracies to monopolize. Unlike Section 1 violations requiring concerted action among two or more persons in restraint of trade, a firm can violate Section 2 through its own unilateral conduct. Under the Bush administration, the Antitrust Division issued an extensive report regarding single-firm conduct, titled  Competition and Monopoly: Single-Firm Conduct Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Based on the view that vague or overbroad prohibitions against single-firm conduct are likely to undermine economic growth and harm consumers, the report was intended to reflect the  Antitrust Division's enforcement policy and provide objective standards for analyzing single-firm conduct under Section 2. Among the practices on which the report offered guidance were predatory pricing, tying,
bundled and loyalty discounts, unilateral and unconditional refusals to deal with rivals, and exclusive dealing. The  Antitrust Division sought in the 2008 report to define clear lines, or "safe harbors," that leading firms could observe to avoid violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and voiced a preference for standards under which conduct should not be deemed to violate Section 2 unless its anticompetitive effects disproportionately outweighed potential procompetitive benefits. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had conducted joint hearings on Section 2 with the  Antitrust Division in 2006 and 2007, but the
FTC declined to join in the  Antitrust Division's report. Indeed, three of the four FTC commissioners issued a statement that criticized the report as a "blueprint for radically weakened enforcement of Section 2 of the Sherman Act." During her confirmation hearing AAG Varney had expressed disagreement with the conclusions of the Section 2 report. In her May 11 speech, Varney expressly withdrew the report and declared that it "no longer represents the policy of the Department of Justice with regard to  antitrust

enforcement under Section 2 of the Sherman Act." AAG Varney further advised that it "should not be used as guidance by courts,  antitrust practitioners, and the business community." She took particular exception to what she characterized as "an excessive concern with the risks of over-deterrence and a resulting preference for an overly lenient approach to enforcement." Rejection of the report is likely to bring the Antitrust Division back in line with the FTC on enforcement policy under Section 2. In addition, AAG Varney withdrew the report in the same week during which the  European Commission is expected to announce a very significant  fine against Intel for conduct directed against its smaller competitor AMD. Although the details of current Section 2 enforcement policy have not yet been articulated, renouncing the report likely brings the  Antitrust Division closer to the enforcement policy of the  European Commission with respect to single-firm conduct. AAG Varney did explain, however, that "[r]einvigorated Section 2 enforcement will . . . require the Division to go 'back to the basics' and evaluate single-firm conduct
against" the "tried and true standards" set forth in earlier Supreme Court cases. Specifically, she
discussed Lorain Journal v. United States,1 in which the Court enjoined a monopolist newspaper publisher
from refusing to accept advertising from any entity that also advertised on a new radio station; and Aspen
Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.,2 in which the Court found a Section 2 violation when the
operator of three of four ski facilities refused to continue participating in a joint ticketing program with the
operator of the fourth competing ski facility. AAG Varney also cited United States v. Microsoft3 (tying,
exclusive dealing and threats), United States v. Dentsply International, Inc.4 (dominant firm exclusive
distribution arrangements) and Conwood Co. v. United States Tobacco Co.5 (removal of rival's displays,
misleading information to retailers and leading firm exclusive dealing) as models of Section 2 enforcement
that the Antitrust Division was likely to follow. Many commentators have suggested that two recent
Supreme Court antitrust decisions—Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko,
LLP6 and Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc.7—limited the scope of Aspen
Skiing. AAG Varney countered that Aspen Skiing means "dominant firms can be expected to deal with
their rivals where 'cooperation is indispensible to effective  competition.'" She disagreed that enforcement
policy should avoid "false positives" by only pursuing conduct when likely anticompetitive effects
disproportionately outweigh potential procompetitive benefits, rejecting that "disproportionality test" either
for enforcement discretion or as a rule of law to be applied by the courts. The Supreme Court has ruled in
favor of antitrust defendants in most cases in the last 15 years, typically in opinions issued by a wide
majority. Many of those decisions push in the opposite direction of the policies suggested by AAG Varney.
However, almost all of those cases were civil  antitrust lawsuits brought by private parties, not government
enforcement actions; and in several of them, the federal government concurred in amicus briefs with the
positions of corporate defendants. With the government as plaintiff, and a new solicitor general, that trend
may change. The simple message from AAG Varney is that leading firms can no longer look to the 2008
report to find safe harbors immunizing unilateral business practices from federal  antitrust enforcement.
Whether a leading firm's conduct exposes it to liability under Section 2 will depend upon intent, actual
monopoly power (or the probability of obtaining it), and the impact in the marketplace of practices such as
loyalty discounts, bundling, exclusive distribution arrangements, and refusals to deal. Businesses with a
leading market share should be mindful of the more aggressive level of  antitrust enforcement signaled by
the Antitrust Division. While it remains to be seen whether courts will be receptive to this more activist
Section 2 enforcement approach, the costs of complying with an  Antitrust Division investigation or
defending an enforcement action are significant, even if challenged conduct is ultimately found to be legal.
And, of course, increased civil litigation by private plaintiffs is likely to follow in the wake of accelerated
enforcement by the  Antitrust Division. If you would like more information regarding the impact of this
development or regarding other  antitrust matters, please contact Antitrust and Competition Practice

(CIA, May 12) Non-voice services accounted for more than 15% of mobile operators' total revenues in
2008. Operators' global revenues from data services totalled USD 188 bln (CZK 3.2 tln) last year, up 24%
y/y. This is according to a report by Informa Telecoms & Media.Most revenues from non-voice services
are still generated by SMS sending. As of the end of last year, USD 75.1 bln, or 40% of the total data
revenues, came from other data services. The expansion of new technologies (such as HSDPA) and
growing demand for various devices, such as Apple's iPhone, helps to raise expenditures into other data
services (other than SMS).

(Pravo-18, May 14) Telecommunications group Telefonica O2 posted net profit of EUR 1.69 bln (CZK 45 bln) for Q1 2009, up 10% y/y. Total revenues dropped by 1.4% to EUR 13.7 bln.

HD               For Intel CEO Otellini,  It's Time To Get Paranoid
BY                By Benjamin Pimentel
WC               1,293 words

LP
One of Paul Otellini's predecessors as CEO of  Intel Corp. (INTC), the legendary Andy Grove, famously declared that, in the high-pressure world of technology, "only the paranoid survive."

Four years after taking over  Intel's chief executive slot, Otellini certainly has his own reasons to be a bit paranoid.

TD
The chip giant is besieged on several fronts by allegations that it bullies and coerces customers, and doesn't play fair in competing with its smaller rival in the PC-processor space, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

Earlier this week,  Intel was slapped with a $1.45 billion  fine by the European Commission over what regulators allege were illegal practices designed to help the company maintain its market dominance. Intel has vowed to appeal the ruling and the  fine - the largest ever imposed by the E.U. regulator.

Although the European  fine will not likely affect  Intel's position as the world's No. 1 maker of computer chips, it could become the first in a series of legal blows that would threaten to emerge as an expensive distraction for Otellini and his team.
Otellini himself expressed his frustration when asked in a call with reporters how big a burden the
E.U. has become for his team.

"Well, it's expensive," Otellini said. "I haven't found a low-priced lawyer yet that's any good. You want to have the best, and they cost quite a bit. And the whole process, beyond the cost, is
time-consuming."

Otellini would know.  Intel's legal issues have been hanging over his head since he took over as CEO in 2005. Within weeks Otellini moved into  Intel's corner office, AMD filed a civil case that contained many of the key allegations raised in later complaints in Europe, Asia and the U.S.

"It's been in the background for his entire term as CEO," said  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. "He took over as CEO in May 2005, and this case was filed in June. It's been part of the fabric."

Otellini has said he is "baffled" by the European Union's allegations that the company essentially bribed and coerced customers to shut out AMD. His argument is straightforward: that  Intel never - ever - played the tricks the E.U. alleged, and there is no shred of evidence to prove that it did.

Because many of the detailed charges are still confidential, analysts say it's hard to evaluate the evidence against  Intel, which has vowed to appeal the ruling and defend itself in court related to other complaints and investigations, including one by the Federal Trade Commission.
Lessons From Grove

But there's some speculation over how  Intel ended up in a multifront, and embarrassing, legal mess.

Page 86 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Just from the outside, you have to scratch your head and ask, 'How did it come to this?'" said veteran Silicon Valley lawyer Gary Reback, author of the newly published  antitrust-issues-related book "Free the Market."

"You would wonder, when the complaints started coming, why somebody didn't shut the door down instead of letting this mushroom into this  fine," he added.

Analyst Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group said  Intel's legal dilemma is striking for another reason: The company, especially under Grove, has always been known for its keen focus on legal matters.

Grove "recognized that with dominance was going to come a series of challenges and he realized a lot of them was going to be legal," Enderle said. "Intel really put in place a legal defensive weapon.
...Andy Grove built this organization and made sure Intel never blatantly crossed the line."

Analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research echoed this point, saying that, in a way, Grove's mantra about paranoia applied both to going after rivals and making sure  Intel never got into legal hot water.

"What I could see was Andy's caution being, 'As we get bigger, we need to be more careful,'" he said. "That goes back to the paranoid mindset."

But Enderle argued that something changed when Craig Barrett, who succeeded Grove as CEO, took over.
Barrett's Tenure

Barrett was CEO from 1998 to 2005, a time of explosive growth for  Intel - and of its enshrinement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), in November 1999 - as well as of intensified competition from AMD. The complaints mentioned in the E.U. ruling and other complaints also roughly coincided with Barrett's tenure, which has triggered speculation that  Intel's problems started on his watch.

During the call with reporters, Otellini was pressed as to whether his argument that  Intel never engaged in anticompetitive behavior applied only to his term.

"Well, the period of time that the decision referred to was 2000 to 2007," he answered. "So I was CEO for two of those years, and Craig was CEO for the others. And my comment was speaking for the company spanning the entire period."

But Enderle argued that there's always been a perception that, under Barrett, "Intel was crossing the line in order to contain market-share losses."
"Poor Paul came in to clean up the mess," Enderle also said. "He's the guy the wave broke on."

Intel spokesman Mulloy, who has worked with Grove, Barrett and Otellini, rejected that view, stressing that  Intel's commitment to operating within the law has never wavered.

"I've been in meetings with all three of them on the subject," he said. "They understand the risks. They understand the law. They listen to legal advice. There hasn't been any change."
This view was endorsed by other  Intel observers.

Analyst Craig Berger of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. said  Intel "pushes forward [at] a manic pace" but added that it's also been known as careful about pushing too hard. He cited his own experience working for Intel when he said one of the company's mantra was, "We play hard, but primary goal is, 'Keep Intel legal.'"

"I never saw  Intel act with anything but the highest ethical integrity when I was employed there," he added.
Otellini's Challenge

McCarron of Mercury Research echoed this point, saying this of Barrett: "In the entire time I've known him, I never saw him as someone you could describe as reckless. Aggressive, yes. Reckless, no."

Friedman, Billings & Ramsey's Berger argued that  Intel "is not being treated fairly in light of their amazing and relentless progress down the semiconductor-process-node roadmap, and that the firm


Page 87 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
has invested and continues to invest more than any other chip firm in the world in order to drive these technological feats."

In any case, it is now up to Otellini to navigate through the most intense legal battles in the company's history, even as he keeps an eye on maintaining the titan's position in the tech industry.

"He will need to get  Intel rallied quickly to compete in different ways," analyst Crawford Del Prete of International Data Corp. said. "What's important to customers has moved from gigahertz to other features like power consumption for PCs and new kinds of devices. This will require leadership that can craft a vision that speaks to these changes. He's right for this."

McCarron of Mercury Research said Otellini "clearly was handed  Intel in a state of transition. It's going to be a challenge, but all the ingredients that led to  Intel's success - those have not changed."

Still, he said, the  antitrust battles will likely continue to loom over Otellini's tenure: "We'll be seeing him battle with this stuff going forward."

Washington under pressure over  Intel

Now that Europe, South Korea and Japan have moved against chip giant  Intel Corp for breaking antitrust laws, the question is: Is the United States feeling pressure to take action, too? The European Commission fined Intel {euro}1.06 billion (HK$11.2 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance. Intel is under investigation by both the US Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney-general's office. Full report B10

Even as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and its lawyers at O'Melveny & Myers celebrated the $1.45 billion fine handed down by the  European Commission Wednesday against rival  Intel Corp., they were rolling up their sleeves for impending fights between the chipmakers in the United States.

"We believe the types of conduct that appear to have been found unlawful by the  European Commission would also be unlawful under U.S.  antitrust laws," said David Beddow, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers' Washington, D.C., office.

TD
Intel is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission on similar complaints that its contracts with computer makers unfairly quashed  competition. The chip giant, which controls 80 percent of the microprocessor market, is accused of offering discounts to manufacturers who agreed not to do business with AMD, its only  competition. The Silicon Valley rivals have been fighting with each other over the issue for years.
The FTC and  European Commission are in "close coordination" on the issue, Beddow said.

Intel said Wednesday it will appeal. It contends its business practices have resulted in lower prices and better technology for consumers.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace — characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers," said a statement by  Intel CEO Paul Otellini.
Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, which represents  Intel, declined to comment.

Intel also faces scrutiny by multiple attorneys general, class actions filed in Delaware, as well as private litigation filed by AMD in Delaware, which is slated to go to trial early next year.

Last year, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission slammed Intel with a $25 million fine for similar practices. In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission ruled Intel had violated its anti-monopoly laws.

Ricardo Celli, who led the O'Melveny team from Brussels, said the New York AG is investigating the same business practices that the  European Commission ruled were illegal.
"This is a worldwide market, so the computer manufacturers are global companies. I believe the  Intel
practices are similar everywhere in the world," Celli said.

The European decision does not bode well for  Intel, given signs from Washington that it will step up enforcement, said  antitrust expert Gary Reback, author of a new book "Free the Market!" and of counsel at the Silicon Valley office of Carr & Ferrell.

"That doesn't spell good news for  Intel in its U.S. cases, not by any stretch of the imagination," Reback said. "The point of all this is: Is the government going to look harder at the way products are sold by dominant companies? You bet."

Just Monday, the new  antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney, said enforcement over the last decade was too relaxed. She vowed to investigate corporations that unfairly dominate markets.

Reback said other high-tech companies could face tough scrutiny as well, because they often rely on an economic phenomenon called "network effect," where a product — like the telephone — becomes more valuable to each consumer the more other people own it, too.

"Its effect is going to be particularly pronounced in Silicon Valley," Reback said. "Because of those network effects, the markets become easier to manipulate by dominant companies. If someone gets the lead in a market like that, it's easier for them to manipulate that market than if they were operating in a market without network effects."

Intel's discounts appear to be what the  antitrust world calls bundling discounts or loyalty discounts, Reback said. Many companies have them, but until now, only the biggest have come under scrutiny for them, he said.
"It's going to be a big issue, because they are prevalent," he said.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said Varney's words gave her hope that the EU's current "close cooperation" and information exchanges with the Federal Trade Commission "could go in a very positive way" in the future. The FTC upgraded a probe into  Intel last year.

"The more  competition authorities are joining us in our philosophy, the better it is, for it is a global world," she said. "The more who are doing the job ... and with the same approach, then the better it is."

Intel general counsel Bruce Sewell said the concept that rebates could damage  competition was an area "where the law is now in flux" and regulators were testing the boundaries. "There is a line of thought developing, primarily out of the European  antitrust authorities but also perhaps being picked up by the Japanese and the Koreans, that suggests that rebates can be anti-competitive," he said.

Intel has said it will fight a record EUR1.06 billion ($1.9 billion)  fine that the  European                   Commission imposed on the chip maker in a ruling that could have serious repercussions for Microsoft and other large technology companies.

But the punishment, meted out in Europe late on Wednesday, received a warm welcome from Intel rival AMD, which had complained to European regulators that  Intel was engaging in anticompetitive business practices.

TD
"[The] ruling is an important step towards establishing a truly competitive market," AMD chief executive Dirk Meyer said. "We are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers."

Intel, however, rejected the commission's findings and accused investigators of ignoring evidence that "refuted what was claimed here", its chief executive, Paul Otellini, said.

Intel was accused of offering rebates to computer manufacturers who used its chips in an effort to shut out competition from rival products.

"Intel strongly disagrees with this decision," Mr Otellini told journalists and analysts. "There is a preponderance of evidence that we think will be exculpatory, including statements from customers that what was alleged was not true."
Mr Otellini said  Intel would appeal against the  fine and he criticised European Union  competition
commissioner Neelie Kroes over her handling of the announcement.

In an apparent reference to an  Intel advertising campaign that describes the company as the "sponsor of tomorrow", Ms Kroes said while handing down the penalty, "well, now they are the sponsors of European taxpayers, I would say".

Ms Kroes also said the commission would immediately impose the sanctions on  Intel, and Mr Otellini said the company would abide by the decision while it appealed to Europe's Court of First Instance.

The penalty sets the scene for the commission potentially to apply a heavy penalty on Microsoft in the coming months. In 2007 European courts ruled that the company stifled  competition through the bundling of its media player with Windows.
Microsoft has already picked up one EU  competition fine, a EUR497 million penalty issued in
2004.

Dominant companies are also due to face increasing scrutiny in the US following the Obama administration's withdrawal this week of a controversial Bush administration policy that advocated a hands-off approach to  antitrust issues.

IT'S not getting any better for Oleg Deripaska. He's already lost the bulk of his fortune now the government of Montenegro is seeking to nationalise his giant aluminium plant KAP because his workers haven't been paid since February. They are owed around £5 million, the plant is £150 million in debt, and has been forced to reduce output from 120,000 tonnes of aluminium in 2008 to 60,000 this year because of higher environmental costs and the reduced price of the metal. And the contretemps with the Montenegrin government could scupper his involvement in the giant marina on the country's Mediterranean coast ‹ already given Prince Andrew's seal of approval ‹ where he so loves cruising in his yacht with boating chums Nat Rothschild and Peter Mandelson.

AFTER MP Elliot Morley was suspended, having pocketed £16,000 in fantasy mortgage expenses, can he have much of a future as chairman of the Commons Energy Select Committee, which prides itself on baiting profit-gouging power and gas supply companies?

GOOD news for landlords in Westminster: experts reckon that because of the clampdown on the taxpayer funding MPs' mortgage payments, they will be forced to rent accommodation near the Commons instead
of buying. Property website Smartlandlord.co.uk forecasts that MPs could drive up rents by 5%.
WHY MEDIA LIKE GREEN SHOOTS

AT a seminar this week organised by Hays, CBI chief Richard Lambert was on  fine form. He said that he had been chatting to a quality newspaper editor, who said that one Friday recently he only had a piece of bad economic news to splash on for Saturday. The result was a dramatic fall in sales and a deluge of angry emails from readers saying 'if you ruin my weekend like that another time I will never buy the paper again.' The implication from Lambert being that this is why the papers have been so full of green shoots recently...

Richard Lambert also said he was at a Goldman Sachs conference for hedge fund managers last week. Apparently they were saying to him: 'What are you doing here? You should be with your stockbroker buying every share you can get you hands on.' He went on: 'The mood was so optimistic, they all thought we are now on the right hand side of a V-shaped recession. The sense was overwhelming that 2008 was a blip. It was a surreal experience.'

WALL Street Journal editor Robert Thomson is laying down the law to his staff about the perils of using social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The key rules are: 'Don't recruit friends or family to promote or defend your work; Don't detail how an article was reported, written or edited; Don't discuss articles that haven't been published, meetings you've attended or plan to attend with staff or sources, or interviews that you've conducted; Don't disparage the work of colleagues or competitors or aggressively promote your coverage.' City Spy feels sorry for the poor staff of the Journal. They will only disparage each other's work inside the office...

Click. The line goes dead.

FIDELITY'S legendary stock-picker Anthony Bolton was guest of honour at the Sammons Associates Annual Heads of Equity Research Awards, held at the London Capital Club. The winners were chosen from a poll of over 1500 City fund managers and analysts. Bolton presented the top prize, Best Head of Research in a Large Cap, to Jose Linares of JPMorgan while the award for Small/Mid Cap went to Joe Brent of Citi Investment Research. Bolton has been bullish of late, and host for the evening Jonathan Evans, boss of recruitment firm Sammons and a self-confessed pessimist, said even he is also
'cautiously optimistic'.

THERE is no love lost between brokers Brewin Dolphin and Charles Stanley so there was tension in the air when they met for a cricket match the other day. Brewin's wicket-keeper lost a tooth, but it is being insisted this was after taking a ball in the face from his own bowler, not from one of Charles Stanley's batters losing their temper. The CS lot slogged their way to 159 from 20 overs. Brewin were all out for
100. So, I am told enigmatically, the bounce of the ball was like the markets: 'extremely volatile'.

JOHN Cresswell, chief operating officer of ITV and hot favourite to take over from Michael Grade as its chief executive, was interrupted by a loud feminine sneeze when he was telling City Spy about the tough TV advertising market. Said Cresswell: 'That's not so much swine flu as wine flu. She had a late night last night.'

MINDSHARE executive Graham Bednash, reports Campaign, was at home and left his laptop on as he answered a call of nature. His young son posted on the Twitter site under his name: 'Bednash did a poo.'

MORE bank belt-tightening, this time from JPMorgan: the car service can only be used if leaving the office after 10pm ‹ previously it was 9pm; any damaged BlackBerrys or laptops have to be replaced; and no tips for meals and taxis over 15%.

HOW must  Intel be feeling about its choice of public affairs advisers, after yesterday's record  fine of almost £1 billion imposed by the  European Commission for 'abusing its dominant position' and engaging in 'persistent and illegal anti-competitive practices' in the microprocessor market?  Intel decided to appoint consultancies APCO and Hill & Knowlton to handle their UK and European lobbying, in preference to FIPRA, the European public affairs practice that specialises in such  competition cases. FIPRA, part of
the Finsbury PR group, went on to work instead for AMD, which brought the complaint against  Intel and won hands-down. Ouch.

May 15, 2009 (WENN via COMTEX) -- Bosses at U.S. computer chip company Intel are to appeal against a fine of nearly $2 billion (GBP1.3 billion) imposed by the European Commission for
anti-competitive behaviour. The Commission report claimed  Intel paid computer makers to delay or cancel new products which used chips made by rival AMD and offered illegal rebates to computer makers who agreed to use  Intel computer chips. Bruce Sewell, a corporate lawyer acting for  Intel, says the company rejects the allegations. "We take great exception to the conclusions reflected in this final decision. We are dismayed that at a time of such acute economic turmoil, the  competition authorities have seen fit to intervene in what is by all objective measures an innovative, competitive and dynamic market."

LP
The world is returning to the 1970s on most economic policies, so why not  antitrust too? Judging by events this week,  antitrust enforcement in the U.S. and Europe is in for a major comeback, whether or not consumers benefit.

Yesterday in Brussels, the  European Commission imposed a record antitrust fine of $1.45 billion on Intel for the heinous crime of discounting computer chips in its fierce and long-running  competition with AMD. Meanwhile on Monday, President Obama's new  antitrust chief, Christine Varney, issued a radical revision of the Department of Justice's own  antitrust enforcement standards. Ms. Varney's ambition seems to be nothing less than bringing Europe's corporatist approach to  competition policy to the U.S. To succeed, she will have to flout or overturn decades of Supreme Court precedent on the limits of U.S. antitrust law.

TD
But Ms. Varney can be sure of a friendly ear in Brussels, which has never let go of the idea that competition is best when there isn't much of it. The Commission's attitude is on full display in the fining of Intel for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the market for computer processors. For years, Intel and AMD have been essentially the only game in town for computer CPUs. The Commission's complaint amounts to little more than a whinge that  Intel won more of this business than the Commission would prefer.

This is couched in dark-sounding talk about  Intel paying computer makers not to buy AMD chips. But remember there is only so much demand and there are only two major market players. So any order won by Intel by offering a discount or a rebate is, by definition, an order lost by AMD. And yet the Commission bizarrely claims that "millions of Europeans" have been harmed by this price war.

Intel has been able to sell enough chips cheaply enough to maintain an overall market share that has hovered between 75% and 80% for years. And those lower prices help drive down the price of a computer, which is good for consumers. A less competitive market for chips, or one in which  Intel is barred from offering discounts to its biggest customers, would mean higher consumer prices. The Commission also suggests that  Intel may have sold some chips below its cost, but  Intel denies this and claims it can prove it if the Commission would deign to consider its evidence.

The Commission is, as ever, more focused on preserving competitor welfare above consumer welfare, and Ms. Varney at Justice seems to be promoting a similar approach. The American left likes to advertise itself as pro-consumer. But the curious reality about the left's view of antitrust in both Europe and America is that it is often used to assist big business by dampening competition. This corporatist notion seems to be that companies should compete, so long as no one really loses. Ms. Varney paid lip
service to the dangers of protecting competitors when she criticized the National Industrial Recovery Act, ushered in by FDR during the Great Depression. That odious piece of industrial policy blessed price collusion between big firms in exchange for a commitment to keep people employed and share some of the collusive profits with labor.

But in her speech, Ms. Varney tries to cast this anticompetitive act as a form of deregulation. In fact, the NIRA was regulation of the worst sort, protecting competitors from competitive harm in the name of some greater good. True deregulation aims at greater  competition, while European (and Rooseveltian) corporatism dampens it. This historical obfuscation allows Ms. Varney to argue that it would be good for
Page 97 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
competition to adopt something like Europe's "abuse of dominant position" standard in place of the consumer-harm test that currently prevails in the U.S.

Europe's  Intel case makes the importance of these different tests very clear. By any reasonable application of a consumer-harm test, the  antitrust claim that  Intel is driving down prices -- and so making computers less expensive -- would be laughed out of U.S. court. The only harm here is to a competitor that can't match  Intel's prices. And even at that, AMD isn't exactly going out of business. At
times its market share for consumer desktop CPUs has been as high as 50%, and at its most successful the upper bound has been determined as much by AMD's own manufacturing capacity as by  Intel's behavior.

When she announced the judgment against  Intel Wednesday, European  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes praised Ms. Varney's new approach to  antitrust. And no wonder. Regulators love company, and European regulators in particular love it when their American counterparts help them hamstring the most efficient U.S. companies. Why President Obama should want to punish U.S. multinationals is harder to figure since his political success hangs on economic recovery and a revival in business profits and hiring. But perhaps we should conclude that this is merely one more example of the ways in which this Administration is seeking to remake American capitalism in the image of Continental Europe.

HD           AMD comments on European Commission ruling  that Intel violated  EU law and harmed consumers

The European Commission today found  Intel guilty of abusing its dominant position in the global x86 microprocessor market, saying that “Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.

Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules cannot be tolerated.” The Commission also stated that “there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.”

TD
The EC decision requires  Intel to change its business practices immediately and  fines Intel a record
EUR1.06bn ($1.45bn).

<blockquote>“Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market. AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers.” </blockquote>
said Dirk Meyer, AMD president and CEO.

“After an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion -  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt,” said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president for legal affairs. “With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation.”
<h3>The EC decision stated specifically that:</h3>

- “Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel”.

- “Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.“

- Intel “interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.  Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products.”

Intel has so far failed to convince any  antitrust enforcement agency that its business practices are lawful and pro-consumer.
In 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) issued a 26 billion won  fine (approximately
$25.4m) saying that  Intel's abuse of its dominant position included coercing and paying customers
millions of dollars on the condition that they use only  Intel chips, delay launches of AMD products,
and/or not develop any new products with AMD chips.
The KFTC also found that, “South Korean consumers had to buy PCs at higher prices as domestic PC
makers were forced to buy  Intel's pricier CPU.” In addition to a  fine, the KFTC ordered  Intel to stop
the practice of offering payments to PC makers conditioned upon them not doing business with AMD.
Intel is in the process of appealing the ruling.
Page 99 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) ruled that  Intel had violated the country's
anti-monopoly laws by illegally forcing full or partial exclusivity with five Japanese PC makers.  Intel
did not appeal the ruling.

In the United States, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and New York Attorney General's office are investigating  Intel for abuse of its monopoly position.

In 2005, AMD filed private litigation in the US District Court of Delaware, which is scheduled for trial in spring 2010.

US Retail Sales Sunk Wall Street

US indices started the Wednesday session in negative territory, continuing their downward movement
from the last days, after US Retail sales data came out worse than expected, dampening investors’ hopes
for a quick recovery of the economy. The indicator fell by 0.4% in April, while analysts forecasted no
change or even small increase. The news had a negative effect on the big retailer chains and among the
main laggards were Wall-Mart and Macy’s Inc, with their shares down by 1.7% to $50.03 and 6.7% to
$11.52. The big manufacturers were also affected with 3M Co down by 4.4% to $56.94 and United
Technologies Corp off 3.5% to $50.61. On the opposite side, shares of the drug makers rose for a second
straight day as investors pulled cash out of the financial and technology sectors searching more security in
the defensive stocks. Merck & Co Inc and Pfizer Inc climbed 2.8% to $25.67 and 2.3% to $15.27
respectively.Intel was on the focus during the day, after it stated that the second quarter is going better
than it had expected, which initially offset news that the  European Commission has fined the company
for $1.45 billion for breaking European  antitrust laws. Shares of the chipmaker closed down by 0.5% to
$15.13.Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 2.2% to 8284.89, S&P500 declined by 2.7% to 883.92 and
Nasdaq Composite was down by 3.0% to 1664.19.Trading volume on NYSE was 1.8 billion shares, with
ratio decliners/advancers 9 to 1, and volume on Nasdaq was 2.2 billion shares, with a ratio
decliners/advancers 11 to 2.
TECHNICAL OVERVIEW S&P 500 - USA
The wide index remained above the psychological order of 900, but in the coming days we may witness break below that level. Oscillators still show overbought levels, which confirm the upper statement. In downside direction break below 880, which is 23.6% retracement of the 1576-666 drop, will move the target on 830 and 800. On the opposite side first resistance is expected around 940, where we see the
200 SMA coincides with 2009 high. Break above that level will move the focus on 985 and 1013, which is
32.8% retracement of the mentioned drop.
S&P 500 - USA (chart, table) DAX 30 - Germany
The short term picture turned negative as the resistance at 930 pushed S&P500 lower. We will probably witness new declines in the next days and on the downside, support is seen at 880, which is 23.6% retracement of the 1576- 666 drop, followed by 830 and the psychological 800. On the upside, if 930 is broken successfully next target will be 950, which coincides with the 200-days SMA, followed by 1010, which is 38.2% retracement of the mentioned drop. A convincing break of 200-days SMA will give a signal that the longterm upward trend is resumed.

In the end all that seemed to matter was the size of the  fine. When it was announced on May 13 it turned out to be the largest ever of its type: euro 1.06 billion ($1.44 billion). This is what  Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, will have to pay if the  European Commission prevails in its view that the firm, which sells about 80% of the microprocessors for PCs, has abused its dominance.

Yet the case against  Intel is not chiefly about money that might one day "sponsor the European taxpayer", in the words of Neelie Kroes, Europe's  competition commissioner (the fine will sit in a blocked bank account until the case is decided). The main question is: under what conditions can a quasi-monopoly such as Intel give discounts and rebates to computer-makers and retailers?

TD
The commission does not think that such practices are illegal per se. But it claims that  Intel's discounts and rebates were often conditional on the exclusion of its rival, AMD. The commission says that in one case Intel paid Media-Saturn Holding, Germany's largest electronics retailer, to sell only computers with Intel chips inside, and in another case a computer-maker had to agree to buy at least
95% of the chips in its business PCs from  Intel to qualify for rebates.

Computer-makers have to play along, the commission argues, because they depend on  Intel for a majority of their chips—a result of the fact that AMD's production capacity is limited. If a firm decided to buy as many AMD chips as possible, it could end up worse off since it might then have to pay more for the chips purchased from  Intel. To overcome this handicap, AMD would have to price its processors below cost, and perhaps even pay its customers. In one case, according to the commission, AMD offered a computer-maker 1m free chips, but it ended up taking only 160,000 of them.

Intel says the claims against it are false. It does not deny making extensive use of discounts and rebates, but insists that it has never required customers to agree not to buy from AMD in order to obtain a discount, and has never raised prices when customers bought from AMD. What is more, says Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel, no harm seems to have been done: AMD is alive, chip prices
are falling and innovation is rampant.

Intel says it will appeal to the European Court of First Instance. In the meantime, both sides will argue over the evidence in this week's 524-page decision. In the end, whether  Intel is found guilty may be less important than whether the case establishes clear rules about what dominant firms are allowed to do.

THE NEWS The Obama administration sought broad authority from Congress to oversee the often-complex but largely unregulated financial instruments known as derivatives.

BEHIND THE NEWS One kind in particular, credit-default swaps, played a major role in the financial crisis, especially at the giant insurer American International Group, which was spared from collapse last fall by a $170 billion government bailout. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, above, wants to require that swaps and other derivatives be traded publicly on regulated exchanges and, like bank loans, be backed by capital reserves.

TD
THE NEWSPresident Obama pressed Congress to enact new limits on credit card companies' practices, decrying unfair late fees, misleading marketing and ''anytime, any reason rate hikes.''

BEHIND THE NEWS The president said he wanted a bill to sign by Memorial Day. The House has already passed one, and the Senate is expected to pass its version this week. The credit card industry wields great influence on Capitol Hill -- it got Congress to make it much harder for consumers to get relief from credit card debts in bankruptcy -- and it persuaded the Senate to reject a proposed 15 percent cap on credit card rates, angering consumer advocates.

THE NEWS The  European Commission fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market; in the United States, meanwhile, the Obama administration promised vigorous enforcement of  antitrust laws.

BEHIND THE NEWS A top European Union official said  Intel ''used illegal anticompetitive practices'' to exclude Advanced Micro Devices and reduce consumer choice.  Intel said it would appeal. Separately, the Justice Department said it would go after corporations that use their market dominance to hold down or squeeze out competitors. No new  antitrust case was brought under President Bush.

THE NEWSCraigslist, the largest classified advertising site on the Internet, said it would close down its unsupervised ''erotic services'' category and replace it with a new ''adult services'' section that its employees would monitor.

BEHIND THE NEWS Craigslist has come under intense pressure because of the ads. Violent crimes involving people who made contact through the ads have made headlines; prosecutors in several states have called the site a forum for prostitution. Some prosecutors said that, as with Craigslist's agreement last year to start charging for erotic ads (most of its classifieds are free), the new policy still does too little to prevent lawbreaking.

THE NEWS The Obama administration's new chief of drug control policy, Gil Kerlikowske, said he wanted to scrap the idea of ''a war on drugs,'' saying that such bellicose terminology gets in the way of dealing effectively with the nation's drug problems.

BEHIND THE NEWS ''Regardless of how you try to explain to people it's a 'war on drugs' or a 'war on a product,' people see a war as a war on them,'' Mr. Kerlikowske told The Wall Street Journal. Drug

use will be viewed more as a public health problem, he said, rather than just a policing problem, and federal agents will no longer raid medical-marijuana dispensaries in the 13 states where voters have approved them.

NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive officer of graphics chip maker Nvidia , called Intel's chip pricing unfair but said his company will not seek  antitrust action against the world's largest chip maker for now.

Nvidia makes graphics chips that pair with  Intel's low-powered Atom in lower-priced netbook computers. He said Intel sells an Atom chip by itself for $45, but sells a three-chip set for $25 to lure business away.

"That seems pretty unfair," he told the Reuters Global Technology Summit. "We ought to be able to compete and serve that market."

Last week, the  European Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros and ordered it to change its business practices for competing illegally against Advanced Micro Devices .

Intel brushed off Huang's suggestion.

"We compete fairly. We do not force bundles on any computer makers and customers can purchase Atom individually or as part of the bundle," said Bill Calder, a spokesman for  Intel. "If you want to purchase the chip set, obviously there is better pricing."
For now, Huang plans no legal action.

"I hope it doesn't come down to that," he said, adding: "We have to do whatever we have to do when the time comes. We really hope this company (Intel) will compete on a fair basis." (For summit blog: http://blogs.reuters.com/summits/) (For more on Reuters Global Technology Summit, see

* Spot shortage for some Nvidia products
* Windows 7 release expected to support chip sales

TD
(Adds comments on demand)
By Gabriel Madway and David Lawsky

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said the downturn in chip demand appears to have bottomed out and is now "growing nicely."
Huang said the graphics chip maker expects to ride strong sales when Microsoft Corp releases its
next-generation operating system, Windows 7. The new operating system is expected to hit the market
later this year.

"Demand appears to be growing again -- obviously from a lower base, but we're seeing demand growing nicely," Huang told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York on Monday via videoconference. "We're actually seeing that there are spot shortages in the channel for several of our products."
Shares of Nvidia rose 6 percent to $9.27 on the Nasdaq on Monday.
Huang also called Intel Corp's chip pricing strategies unfair, but said his company will not seek
antitrust action against the world's largest chip maker for now.

Last week, the  European Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros and ordered it to change its business practices for competing illegally against Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Nvidia makes graphics chips that run alongside  Intel's microprocessors, used in about 80 percent of personal computers. The two companies have sued each other over an assertion by  Intel that a licensing agreement between them does not cover  Intel's next-generation products.

Huang on Monday also took issue with  Intel's practice of bundling chips together. He said  Intel sells its Atom microprocessor by itself for $45, but it will sell Atom for $25 if it is purchased in combination with other Intel chips that compete with Nvidia products.
"That seems pretty unfair," he said. "We ought to be able to compete and serve that market."
For now, Huang said Nvidia has no plans to complain to regulators about  Intel's sales practices.

"I hope it doesn't come down to that," he said, adding: "We have to do whatever we have to do when the time comes. We really hope this company (Intel) will compete on a fair basis."

Intel brushed off Huang's comments.

"We compete fairly. We do not force bundles on any computer makers and customers can purchase Atom individually or as part of the bundle," said Bill Calder, a spokesman for  Intel. "If you want to purchase the chip set, obviously there is better pricing."

DIFFERENT TAKES ON DEMAND

Chipmakers such as Nvidia,  Intel and AMD, which owns Nvidia's chief rival ATI, have been hurt this year by the steep drop in PC sales brought on by the global economic slowdown.

Nvidia, saying Windows 7 will support the nascent use of graphics processors for the main tasks of computing, hopes that PC makers will realize that users increasingly want and need graphics-intensive, multimedia applications.

More broadly, Huang said industry inventory levels were near historical lows after cutbacks in production over past quarters.

Huang said netbooks -- which are decreasing in size while gobbling up market share -- were an ideal fit for Nvidia's chips because consumers used the mini-computers primarily for graphics-heavy applications.

Intel is the world's biggest computer chipmaker by far, but Advanced Micro Devices has been its main rival for some time. Following an  antitrust complaint filed by the latter, European Union regulators have charged Intel with using illegal rebates to thwart competitors and fined it $1.45 billion. This is the
largest ever fine of its type and it signals a gathering tide of antitrust challenges rising up against the technology industry on both sides of the Atlantic.

TD
Bill Gates, however often he proved prescient, got it quite wrong when he said—around a decade ago—that "this antirust thing will blow over". Maybe that was just wishful thinking in the face of the European Commission's aggressive probe into Microsoft dominance. Not to mention the US justice department's probe into whether the company had abused  monopoly power by bundling its Internet Explorer software with its Windows operating system, thus unfairly restricting the market for competing browsers. While this case was relatively amicably settled—with the US domestic environment being averse to government intrusion in industry, the European regulators concluded the company was guilty of freezing out rivals in server software and other products, and  fined it $690 million.

The Commission's  Intel judgment is similar in spirit: the accused has abused its market dominance. First,  Intel offered rebates and payments that effectively prevented customers from choosing alternative products. Second, it made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' chips, undermining  competition. Both practices, in the end, have been hurtful to consumers' interests.

Critics of the decision say that discovering  antitrust is like discovering pornography: it's subjective. After all, discounts and rebates are common across various business communities.

CEO Paul Otellini remains unapologetic about offering bigger discounts to bigger buyers: "Nothing new there!"  Intel, which will appeal the Commission's decision, also argues that the industry hasn't been showing any signs of stagnation, as it continues to innovate, as chip prices continue to fall and as rival AMD seems to be keeping good health. It is indeed true case that in the first quarter of this year,  Intel's share of all microprocessor units shipped went down by 4.7% to 77.3%. While AMD gained 4.6% to reach 22.3% of the market.

The more populist American argument, echoed by  Intel chairman Craig Barrett in a recent conversation with a CNBC correspondent, of course goes as follows: "At a time when the world is at great competition for its economic future, at a time when we brought 3 billion new capitalists in India, China, Russia, into the free economic system, to have government regulators say, You shouldn't compete? What are they thinking?"

But this argument worked better during the Bush era, which saw the theory of markets being self-correcting on the ascendant and which was wary of taking on big companies unless they "disproportionately" harmed consumers. In a new world where Americans are more comfortable with a government hand at the wheel, the standards are shifting. Christine Varney, who is the new head of the Justice Department's  antitrust division and who had earlier worked for Netscape in its antirust battle against Microsoft, has indicated she will be leading a more aggressive charge against  antitrust violations than her predecessors. In short, there is a perfect storm brewing for the technology industry, with the US government and the  European Commission—which has set the benchmark for tough standards—set to march in tandem.

But antitrust battles of the future will go beyond archetypical David-Goliath ones. Witness the Microsoft investment in T3, a small vendor of mainframe-like computers, which is charging IBM with refusing to license mainframe software to its customers. The Microsoft lobby has also helped nix a Google ad deal with Yahoo. Google, in turn, has complained that the searching tool built into Vista stymies its own search programme. Therefore, a prediction:  Intel's $1.45 billion  fine will soon seem like a pittance in the face of new ones.

LP
This antitrust thing will blow over." Thus Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, a decade ago as regulators launched an action against his company. The chiefs at other big technology firms, even if they were not quite so outspoken, doubtless held similar views when their companies were targeted by trustbusters. It was wishful thinking then, and remains so today, as long-running  antitrust actions flare up again and regulators ponder new moves against the industry's giants.

TD
Perhaps soon the  European Commission will issue its long-awaited decision in the case against  Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker. It is expected to impose a whopping  fine of at least Euro 1 billion ($1.3 billion). In early June, Microsoft will defend itself in a hearing in Brussels against accusations that it illegally bundled its Web browser with its Windows operating system—the very practice that got the software company into trouble in the late 1990s. IBM, the target of trustbusters since the 1950s, faces a new antitrust complaint. And Google, the industry's newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny.

On April 29, it emerged that America's Justice Department is examining whether Google's settlement with authors and publishers over its book-search service violates  antitrust laws; and on May 5 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe to see whether Google's sharing of two board members with Apple reduces  competition between the two firms.

The computer industry makes more  antitrust headlines than others, and seems unlikely to shake off these problems, for three reasons. The first is that technology heavyweights are often dominant in their respective markets. Ask any of the bosses of these firms why they are so dominant and they will probably respond that it is a result of billions spent on research and development.

But they also operate in markets that allow a winner to take all (or most). Mainframes and operating systems benefit from strong network effects: the more applications run on them, for instance, the more users they attract, which encourages programmers to write more applications for them. With microprocessors, ever-increasing capital requirements mean only the biggest firms can afford to build their own factories. The markets for search and online advertising exhibit similar effects: the bigger a firm's market share, the greater its ability to attract advertisers, thus bringing in the money to build ever bigger data centres. In each case it is difficult for an upstart to break in.

But it is not impossible. A second characteristic of the industry is that dominant positions can be undermined by technological progress: mainframes, for example, were dethroned in the 1980s by smaller machines. Because they cannot afford to rest on their laurels, high-tech heavyweights often foster aggressive corporate cultures that draw the attention of  antitrust regulators. It is no accident that Andy Grove, a former boss of  Intel, entitled one of his books 'Only the Paranoid Survive'.

Aware of the risk that the spirit of  competition could become abusive,  Intel has long made sure that its employees undergo compliance training. But this did not keep the firm from crossing the line, at least in the opinion of the  European Commission. It alleges that  Intel, using a system of discounts and rebates, encouraged computer-makers and retailers to sell only a limited number of machines powered by chips made by AMD,  Intel's only remaining serious rival in microprocessors for PCs. In one case, Intel is said to have paid a retailer to forgo AMD chips altogether.

Fear of being supplanted was also behind Microsoft's decision in the late 1990s to bundle its Web browser, Internet Explorer, into Windows. The  European Commission's current investigation looks

Page 113 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
forwards rather than backwards, however, with the aim of ensuring that there is  competition in the future. As more and more computing moves online (into the 'cloud'), the browser is replacing the operating system as the central computing platform.

Thirdly, problems with  antitrust will continue to dog the industry for the simple reason that companies are increasingly using it as a competitive weapon, alongside other instruments such as patent lawsuits and battles over standards. As it lost market share to  Intel, for example, AMD launched a global campaign to get regulators to examine its rival's behaviour. It went to the European Commission and to its regulatory counterparts in South Korea and Japan, both of which have ruled against Intel. In America, AMD has filed a private antitrust lawsuit which is due to go to trial next February. The FTC opened an antitrust investigation of Intel last June.

Similarly,  antitrust lobbying is part of a broader 'platform war' for IBM, which hopes thereby to keep Microsoft at bay. Among other things, IBM is a sponsor of the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), which has many of Microsoft's other competitors as its members and is one of the prime movers behind the new browser case. It started in late 2007 with a complaint by Opera, a Norwegian browser-maker and ECIS member.

Not to be outdone, Microsoft has entered the  antitrust game, too. It recently made an investment in T3, a small vendor of mainframe-like computers, which in January lodged a complaint with the  European   Commission, alleging that IBM kept it from competing by refusing to license mainframe software to
T3's customers. Microsoft has also lobbied American  antitrust regulators to tackle Google,
encouraging them to look into an online-advertising deal between the search giant and its rival, Yahoo!,
which was eventually abandoned.

That is not to say that the  antitrust cases that are now under way are without merit, and have merely been stirred up by rival firms. But it means that regulators must make a 'sound judgment' and consider whether the aggressive behaviour of industry giants actually hurts consumers, and not just rivals, argues Steven Salop, a professor at Georgetown University Law Centre in Washington, DC.
Ill-conceived remedies can make things worse, says Lars-Hendrik Roller, president of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin and a former senior economist at the  European         Commission.

The commission's case against Microsoft looks the most robust. In September 2007, the European Court of First Instance ruled that the firm had stifled  competition by tying its media player to Windows. The same reasoning should also apply to browsers, even though the browser market has become somewhat more competitive in recent years, thanks to the rise of Firefox, an open-source browser. The commission will probably ask Microsoft to include the most popular rival browsers with Windows, asking users to choose one when they boot up for the first time.

The case against  Intel is trickier. Offering discounts and rebates is common in many industries, so the case hinges on whether  Intel attached conditions to such rebates that constituted an  abuse of its market position. It is unclear whether any harm has been done: prices for chips continue to fall, innovation has not slowed down and AMD has increased its market share slightly in recent months. And certain remedies could actually limit competition. Limiting discounts, for instance, might in effect create a price floor for AMD, given that it is Intel's only competitor. IBM, for its part, would appear to
have little to fear. It is hard to argue, with so many different computer systems around, that mainframes still constitute a separate market—a necessary condition if IBM's behaviour is to be judged anticompetitive.

That leaves Google. If history is any guide, it can expect a run-in with trustbusters before long. But the firm is aware of this, and has trodden carefully as a result. The crunch is likely to come when a serious competitor emerges in search or advertising— Google, after all, toppled AltaVista, the previous leader in Web search. For the industry as a whole, meanwhile, it seems unlikely that the  antitrust thing will blow over any time soon.

EU DEVELOPMENTS Intel Fined €1.06 Billion For Abusive Practices After an investigation on-going for nearly a decade, the European Commission (the "Commission), has imposed a  fine of €1.06 billion (approx.

TD
£948m) on Intel Corporation ("Intel") for abusing its dominant position in the market for x86 Computer Processing Units ("CPU"). According to the Commission, that market is worth €22 billion worldwide per year.  This is by far the largest  fine imposed on a single company by the Commission for anti-competitive conduct.  The previous record single  fine - €896 million - was imposed on France's Saint-Gobain for its role in the car glass cartel last year. In addition,  Intel has been ordered to terminate any current illegal conduct and to refrain from such conduct in future. The Commission has noted that it will monitor  Intel's compliance with that order closely.    Intel has stated that it takes "strong exception" to the Commission's decision and announced its intention to appeal to the Court of First Instance. The US Chamber of Commerce has also raised concerns regarding the trend of imposing very large penalty  fines and lack of transparency in the Commission's fining process. See Community Week Alert of 13 May 2009 for further
information on the decision. Commission Gathers Intelligence On Food Retail Sector The  European         Commission ("the Commission") has turned its attention to how foodstuffs are priced and how the food supply chain works in Europe. The move follows on from a report produced last December by the Commission on 'Food Prices in Europe' which expressed concern over the effect of food prices on inflation and the need to target practices that were harming the market. The report noted that the sector may not
be functioning effectively, potentially leading to unjustifiably high food prices for consumers. It also cautioned that the negative economic conditions in the industry could create a heightened risk of
anti-competitive practices. In the report the Commission recommended greater regulatory scrutiny (at both Commission and national level) of the competitive environment throughout the food industry in the EU. In the longer term, it also proposed that the European Council revisit the matter in December 2009. In the recent weeks, it is understood that the Commission has been holding meetings with stakeholders and associations in order to gain intelligence on the food retail sector generally and on how the food supply chain works (including the use of exclusive supply agreements, buying alliances and single branding obligations).  At this stage the move appears to be more of a general fact finding exercise as opposed to action focussed on any specific  competition concerns. The move will however better inform the Commission so that it is better placed to act should it seek to take any action in the future. At a national level the Dutch  competition authority has also focussed on the sector - recently launching a fact finding study into food prices in order to improve its understanding of pricing throughout the food supply chain. A research group is to conduct the study which will look at prices in the Netherlands as well as other EU countries.  The results of that study are due by the end of June 2009. UK DEVELOPMENTS OFT Proposes Revisions To Market Studies Guidance The OFT is consulting on revised market studies guidance.  Market studies are considered by the OFT as a powerful and effective tool for investigating market wide problems, linking both the OFT's  competition and consumer work. Market studies focus on whether there are problems that are causing detriment to consumers and, if there are, how those
problems might be addressed. The existing OFT market studies guidance was published in November
2004 and will continue to form the backbone of the proposed revised guidance. The proposed guidance
will pick up on new policies and procedures, in particular reflecting the OFT's prioritisation principles and
aims to provide greater clarity around when and how such studies are undertaken. In order to reflect the
OFT's prioritisation principles, before commencing a study, the OFT states that it will consider whether the
benefits of such a study will outweigh the costs and disruption to businesses which could result in
increased costs to the consumer. Another proposed new feature is that there is no longer to be a

distinction drawn between short studies (taking 3 - 6 months) and full studies (taking around a year) with the OFT to be able to make a decision on the length and detail of an investigation based on the complexity of the particular market - subject to project management principles. The consultation period is open until 4
August 2009. GERMAN DEVELOPMENTS Following Fuel Sector Enquiry, German Federal Cartel Office Prohibits Total From Acquiring 59 OMV Petrol Stations The German Federal Cartel Office ("BKartA") has taken first measures following its fuel sector enquiry, launched in May 2008 and has prohibited Total Deutschland GmbH, Berlin ("Total") from taking over the East German petrol station network of OMV Deutschland GmbH, Burghausen ("OMV"). The BKartA stated in its case summary, which was published on 14 May 2009, that such concentration is expected to strengthen the dominant positions held by Total together with Shell, Aral/BP, ConocoPhillips/Jet and ExxonMobil/Esso in the sale of diesel and Otto fuel in the relevant regional petrol station markets. Total's takeover of the OMV network would increase the market share of the dominant oligopoly from 80 to 85%, as well as eliminate one of its strongest competitors. An interim result of the fuel sector enquiry confirmed that the prevailing high vertical and horizontal concentration in the fuel sector have a significant restraining effect on  competition. The high supply side concentration together with high transparency on the market have led to the companies monitoring the prices of competitors and developing patterns within a uniform pricing strategy without the need for collusion or coordination. The members of the oligopoly are interlinked through collective refineries, pipelines and tank farms and are interdependent by ways of fuel exchange. External competitors, which consist mainly of the fragmented medium-sized mineral oil sector, are in turn dependent on the oligopoly members for its upstream supplies. Apart from this merger which has been prohibited, the BKartA is currently examining the acquisition of the petrol stations of medium-sized Lomo and Honsel by Shell Deutschland Oil GmbH, Hamburg. The second phase of these merger proceedings have commenced. The time limit for both decisions expires on 9 June 2009. FRENCH DEVELOPMENTS French Minister Of The Economy Finds 'Control' Despite Low Shareholding On 27 April 2009, the French Minister of the Economy (the "Minister") issued a decision clearing the acquisition by the Bertrand Distribution group ("Bertrand Distribution") of subsidiaries of the company Anheuser-Busch Inbev
("Inbev"), a world leader in the beer industry. Through this operation, Bertrand Distribution, active in the wholesale market for beverages and particularly the sale of beers to coffee shops, hotels and restaurants, acquired the Inbev subsidiaries which manage the beer retailing activities in France. Prima facie, the operation should be analysed as the acquisition of sole control of the subsidiaries by Bertrand
Distribution.  However the operation has been defined by the Minister as the acquisition of joint control of the target companies by Bertrand Distribution and Inbev. The key-element leading to this conclusion was, as part of the divesture of shares, the signing of a commercial agreement between Bertrand Distribution and Inbev giving Inbev decisive influence over the target companies. According to this long-term agreement of 10-15 years, Inbev retains a decisive influence over the commercial policy and the
day-to-day management of the divested subsidiaries. This decisive influence is due to the fact that Inbev will be the (almost) exclusive supplier to the divested subsidiaries, the existence of a quota clause and the holding by Inbev of a veto power which allows it to protect the agreement from any change of control of
the target companies. This is the first time that the Minister has considered that the retention of such a low shareholding in a company (in this case one share) can give rise to decisive influence allowing the
exercise of a sole or joint control. SPANISH DEVELOPMENTS SCA Seeks Further Liberalisation Of The Services Sector The Spanish  Competition Authority ("SCA") has recently published a report appraising the Government's draft bill on free access and exercise of service activities (the "Draft Bill"). This report was made using the powers of consultation granted to the SCA under the Law for the Defence of Competition 15/2007 ("Law 15/2007") in terms of which the Spanish government consults the SCA in relation to draft legislation which may affect  competition.  The Draft Bill represents the Spanish
Government's implementation of the EU Services Directive 123/2006, which is required to be implemented by 28 December 2009. The Draft Bill serves as an "umbrella law", a first step towards the later implementation of around 46 Spanish national laws and 7000 regional acts. In its report, the SCA
applauds the ambitious approach of the Draft Bill. However, the SCA also advocates the abolition of almost all existing exclusions from and exceptions to the liberalisation of the service sector. Further, the SCA points out that any authorisation that are required for and exceptions to the free exercise of a service activity in Spain should respect the principles of non-discrimination, necessity, proportionality and free competition. The SCA urges that the ambitious objectives of the Draft Bill should be reflected in the further implementation of sectoral legislation at a national and regional level. The SCA also warns that, should the need arise during the implementation period of such legislation it will employ its new power under Law 15/2007 to bring actions before the Courts against administrative acts and regulations which obstruct effective  competition. In addition, the SCA expresses particular concern regarding the implementation of the EU Services Directive in two specific sectors: the law governing professional associations and Spanish Commerce Law. Although the SCA supported the freedom to join professional associations, the Draft Bill endorses compulsory membership. Although this does not go as far as it had wanted, the SCA still considers this development to be an advance to the current state of affairs given
that, for the first time, compulsory membership will be established by law; previously professional associations were free to set the their membership requirements at their own discretion. As regards the SCA's primary criticisms of Spanish Commerce Law, these are levelled against: (i) the prior authorisation required from regional government authorities to establish malls or large shopping centres; (ii) government
Page 116 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
regulation of sales periods; and (iii) the prohibition against the sale of non-financial goods in financial establishments. ITALIAN DEVELOPMENTS ICA Opens Five Investigations Into Possible Abuses In Relation To Gas And Electricity Distribution The Italian  Competition Authority ("ICA") has recently launched five distinct investigations against suspected abuses of individual dominant positions held in the local markets of distribution of gas and electricity to domestic clients and small companies. At its meeting on 7 May, the ICA launched two investigations into the local subsidiaries of the groups Iride and Hera, whereas, at its meeting on 29 April, the ICA launched three investigations into the local subsidiaries of Italgas, Acea Distribuzione and A2A Reti Gas/A2A Reti Elettriche and into their respective parent companies Eni, Acea and A2A. All the above investigations have been launched on the basis of complaints filed by Sorgenia, a new entrant which denounced similar illicit conducts, aimed at preventing its entry into the above liberalized local markets. According to the complainant, the incumbents unreasonably delayed and obstructed the technical procedural steps required to allow the switching of clients to the new competitor, thus eventually harming the clients' right of choice among different suppliers and among more competitive prices. The premises of the local subsidiaries under investigation have been raided at the same time. All the relevant proceedings are to be closed by 30 June 2010, although this is subject to possible extensions. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Mr SJ Berwin's EU

European regulators have spent close to nine years investigating whether  Intel, the world's largest chip maker, illegally hampered competitors in its dealings with computer makers and retailers. And last Wednesday, they finally reached a conclusion, punishing  Intel with a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($A1.9 billion) for abusing its dominant position in the computer chip market. The  European                     Commission accused Intel of offering computer makers better deals if they would agree to sell products that relied solely on Intel's processors or delay products that used chips made by  Intel's rival, Advanced Micro Devices. In addition, regulators said  Intel paid a retailer to keep only  Intel chips in stock. While the commission does not want to eliminate volume discounts, which are common in the PC industry, it ordered Intel to stop placing onerous conditions on the recipients.

TD
But while AMD cheered the ruling as encouraging challengers to  Intel's dominance, the history of antitrust cases against Intel and other big technology companies suggests that little will change. As the world's largest chip maker and the co-creator of the PC industry,  Intel brings vast technological and business resources to a game whose rules change at internet speed.

''There is nothing in this ruling that reverses Moore's Law,''  Intel's chief executive, Paul Otellini, said. He was referring to the observation made famous by  Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore, that the computing muscle of chips tends to double about every two years, even as prices fall.  Intel and AMD have squabbled in courtrooms for decades, arguing over issues like  Intel's control over the underlying architecture of PC chips and the company's sales tactics. AMD has achieved a number of victories in these cases and is the main alternative to  Intel as the supplier of the powerful microprocessors that function as the brains of PCs and computer servers. However, AMD's overall position in the chip market has remained relatively constant.  Intel tends to claim about 80 per cent of total PC and server chip sales, while AMD takes close to 20 per cent. ''That really has never shifted much, whether there are  antitrust

rulings or not,'' the chief executive of chip research firm VLSI Research, Dan Hutcheson, said. AMD's executive vice-president for legal affairs, Thomas McCoy, argues the commission's decision will have a big impact. ''With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation,'' McCoy said. Through complaints
in Europe, Asia and the United States, AMD has spent vast amounts of time and money raising concerns about Intel's interactions with the companies that produce and sell PCs and servers, such as Dell and Acer. AMD has accused  Intel of essentially paying companies to not use AMD's chips in their products and to delay the release of products based on AMD's chips. Last year, Korean regulators  fined Intel for harming AMD's business. And now the  European Commission

has followed suit. The  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said  Intel had skewed competition and denied consumers a choice for chips, with practices that ''undermined innovation''.  Intel plans to appeal the European ruling and has denied including any exclusionary measures in its contracts with customers or retailers.

Many analysts charge that AMD's intense focus on trying to alter  Intel's interactions with customers will have little impact on its overall business, including Linley Gwennap, a chip analyst at the Linley Group.
''When you get down to it, whatever  Intel is doing that AMD is complaining about probably isn't making that much of a difference,'' Gwennap said. ''The  Intel discounts or whatever are just noise.'' AMD's most

Page 118 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
impressive and profitable moments have come when it has read the technology tea leaves and developed superior products. At times, AMD has beaten  Intel on

overall PC chip speeds. In 2003, it introduced a server chip called Opteron that shook up the market and for the first time made the company a serious player in the data centers of large businesses. In fact, AMD's successes during the past few years, achieved while European regulators conducted their investigation, have altered the chip landscape. AMD's chips now appear in both the PCs and the servers of most major manufacturers. Geoffrey Manne, who has practiced  antitrust law and taught at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, said Europe's case was really predicated on the idea that there will be future harm to AMD. ''It is really hard to find evidence of that now,'' Manne said. One of AMD's major problems has been its inability to produce top- notch products regularly. After a series of
ground-breaking chips, it often ends up shipping products late or has to rework them to eliminate troublesome bugs.  Intel, meanwhile,

uses its vast resources to catch up and then surpass AMD. ''AMD is basically operating on a shoestring,'' Gwennap said. ''If you have a slip-up, that can kill your revenue for the next couple of years. But  Intel has projects and back-up projects and back-ups to the back-ups.'' AMD insists that  Intel has just as many problems getting new chips out, but can use its heft to outflank competitors. ''When you are one of the biggest and richest monopolies of the century, it is pretty easy to hide your sins,'' McCoy of AMD said.
The industry is paying more attention these days to  Intel's dealings in markets other than PCs.  Intel is gunning for Nvidia in the graphics- chip market and for Freescale Semiconductor, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments in mobile phone chips. Ultimately, the  European Commission's ruling appears to address yesterday's problems. New York Times

HD      Intel Set to Appeal EC's $1.44B Antitrust Fine

LP
Intel Corp. said it plans to appeal last week's  European Commission decision to fine the company $1.44 billion for violating  antitrust laws.

The EC found  Intel guilty of paying rebates to computer manufacturers and to Europe's largest IT retailer, Media Markt , in order to keep systems based on chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. off of store shelves. Although the rebates did result in lower retail prices for PCs, EC  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes contended that they left consumers without a choice of technologies.

TD
Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research , noted that the substantial  fine "amounts to about $23 for every CPU [Intel] sold in Europe last year."

During a hastily arranged press conference, Intel CEO Paul Otellini argued that the EC "ignored or disregarded" evidence "refuting" the antitrust charges. "There were a number of documents from OEMs or between Intel and OEMs that refute what was claimed here," he said.

Otellini disputed a key EC allegation: that  Intel paid "conditional" rebates to PC makers to prevent them from purchasing chips from competitors. The EC "alleged exclusive deals but couldn't find them, so it said we must have hidden [the evidence]," he said, adding that the EC "got all of the documents that they wanted . . . so I'm really baffled."

Michael Cooper, an  antitrust attorney at Bryan Cave LLC , criticized the EC's decision. "It is hardly clear that the EU's action will benefit consumers. The consumer rarely benefits when enforcers take actions to protect less-efficient firms from the rigors of  competition."

Kroes said the  antitrust action will protect consumers. "Intel has harmed millions of EU consumers," so the large fine -- the largest  antitrust penalty the EC has ever levied against a single company -- should "come as no surprise," she said.

If Intel fails in its appeal, McCarron said the company's pricing structure could become "less complicated," with no more rebates.

The European Commission has slapped Intel with a record $1.45 billion  fine, the highest ever imposed on an individual company, for violating antitrust rules and indulging in practices that hinder fair competition.From October 2002 till December 2007,  Intel used its dominant market position to offer wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their x86 CPUs from the company. They also made direct payments to a "major retailer" for stocking only computers with  Intel CPUs.

The Commission added that it "does not object to the rebates in themselves but to the conditions that  Intel attached to those rebates." Additionally,  Intel paid manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific AMD products and the sales channels made available to them."Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated,"

HD      Intel set to appeal EC's $1.44B antitrust fine

Intel Corp. said it plans to appeal last week's  European Commission decision to fine the company for violating antitrust laws.

The EC found  Intel guilty of paying rebates to computer manufacturers and to Europe's largest IT retailer, Media Markt, in order to keep systems based on chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. off of store shelves. Although the rebates did result in lower retail prices for PCs, EC  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes contended that they left consumers without a choice of technologies.

TD
Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research, noted that the substantial  fine "amounts to about $23 for every CPU sold in Europe last year."

During a hastily arranged press conference, Intel CEO Paul Otellini argued that the EC "ignored or disregarded" evidence "refuting" the antitrust charges. "There were a number of documents from OEMs or between Intel and OEMs that refute what was claimed here," he said.

Otellini disputed a key EC allegation: that  Intel paid "conditional" rebates to PC makers to prevent them from purchasing chips from competitors. The EC "alleged exclusive deals but couldn't find them, so it said we must have hidden ," he said, adding that the EC "got all of the documents that they wanted . . . so I'm really baffled."

Michael Cooper, an  antitrust attorney at Bryan Cave LLC, criticized the EC's decision. "It is hardly clear that the EU's action will benefit consumers. The consumer rarely benefits when enforcers take actions to protect less-efficient firms from the rigors of  competition."

Kroes said the  antitrust action will protect consumers. "Intel has harmed millions of EU consumers," so the large fine -- the largest  antitrust penalty the EC has ever levied against a single company -- should "come as no surprise," she said.

If Intel fails in its appeal, McCarron said the company's pricing structure could become "less complicated," with no more rebates.

HD      Intel hit with record $1.45B EC antitrust fine; Intel took strong  exception to the decision and maintained that its business practices are not anticompetitive.

Intel Corphttp://www.intel.com is facing a record $1.45 billion (1.06 billion Euro) fine after the EC (European Commission) this morning ruled that the chip maker has been violating antitrust rules and abusing its dominant x86 CPU market position.

According to the Commission, Santa Clara, Calif-based  Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice. First,  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their x86 CPUs from  Intel, the EC said, adding that  Intel also made
direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs. Second,  Intel
made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products
containing competitors’ x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products, according to
the EC.

TD
The Commission claimed that these practices constituted abuses of  Intel’s dominant position in the x86
CPU market and that by undermining its competitors’ ability to compete on the merits of their products,
"Intel’s actions undermined  competition and innovation."

The EC said that the PC makers concerned by  Intel's conduct in the decision include Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," EC  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement. "Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."

The fine, the largest the EC has ever imposed on a single company, comes after an eight-year investigation into  Intel's business practices. The Commission said it obtained proof of the  antitrust activity even though the practices were not stated explicitly in  Intel’s contracts. The EC's proof is based on contemporaneous evidence, such as e-mails obtained during unannounced on-site inspections. The EC said that there is also evidence that  Intel tried to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.

The EC came to the $1.45 billion  fine amount based on the duration of the infringement established in its decision (five years and three months) and based on  Intel's total sales in the European Union during the period.

Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini immediately issued objection to the EC decision, stating that  Intel
never sells products below cost.

"Intel takes strong exception to this decision," he said in an  Intel statement. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace – characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal."

Unsurprisingly, AMD praised the decision. “Today’s ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market,” said Dirk Meyer, AMD president and CEO, in a company statement. “AMD has

Page 125 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers.”

The EC is not alone in questioning  Intel's business practices. In June 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission found that  Intel violated the country’s  antitrust laws http://www.edn.com/article/CA6567637.html by offering discounts on microprocessors to two PC makers and levied an approximate $25.4 million  fine against the chip maker. In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission found that  Intel used illegal tactics  http://www.edn.com/article/CA509320.html to deter competitors' growth. And in two separate probes in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission http://www.edn.com/article/CA6567974.html andNew York Attorney General’s office http://www.edn.com/article/CA6521683.html are investigating  Intel for possible abuse of monopoly position.

Complaints from AMD spurred all of the actions.  Intel has consistently maintained that its business practices are within the law.

Intel also currently faces private litigation AMD filed in the US District Court of Delaware, which is scheduled for trial in spring 2010. The two companies are also facing off after AMD's GlobalFoundries spin out, each claiming breach of a 2001 patent cross-license agreement http://www.edn.com/article/CA6644499.html.

European regulators don't seem to understand the purpose of antitrust law: to benefit consumers. The latest example is the  European Commission's staggering fine on California-based microchip maker Intel Corp.

The EC ruled last week that the computer chip giant "has harmed millions of European customers" by engaging in "illegal" business practices to muscle rival Advanced Micro Devices out of the market.

TD
Intel's crime? Offering rebates and discounts to computer manufacturers who used its chips and to European retailers who sold computers with "Intel inside." Such practices, said EC "competition commissioner" Neelie Kroes, are "a serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules" and "cannot be tolerated."

Intel was socked with a $1.45 billion  fine, more than double the then-record  fine levied against Microsoft in 2004 for its alleged market abuses. The company is going to appeal, but  Intel's prospects are likely dim because what European bureaucrats know about how markets work could fit inside an iPod case.

That's not to say the Continent's market micromanagers, who have little actual experience in the technology industry, lack faith in their ability to discover what may "harm" consumers. It would help, though, if they actually asked consumers -- or paid close attention to a global technology market that provides ever-better performance at ever-lower prices.

The market commissars could simply watch the BBC, which reported just before the ruling, "the price of personal computers and the computer chips that go into them have fallen enormously" since AMD filed its complaint eight years ago.

Those poor, suffering consumers. Paying less and getting more for eight long years. Certainly that must be remedied by bureaucratic fiat -- which frees AMD from market pressures to improve its chips and lower its prices to compete for business.

A free market can be cruel to poorly run, unimaginative companies, but not to consumers. The global technology industry is among the most vibrant and competitive in history, and it does not need to be corrected by ignorant bureaucratic minders with an antiquated view of what is a "fair" market strategy.

One of the more curious aspects of this case is that AMD, despite running to the referees to cry foul, has proven a nimble and worthy competitor to  Intel. Just before AMD launched its revolutionary Athlon 64-bit processors in September 2003, the company had a 15.6% share of the market. By the fourth quarter of 2006, AMD had 25.3% of the market.

In fact, just two days before the EC dropped the hammer on  Intel, the Farmington, Mass.-based industry research group IDC announced that AMD's share of the global chip market rose 4.6% in the first quarter of 2009 while  Intel's fell by 4.7%.

Page 127 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Obviously Intel was not muscling AMD out of the market. Besides, AMD and Samsung are far ahead of Intel in the fast-growing mobile phone processor market, as Competitive Enterprise Institute information policy analyst Ryan Radia notes. Maybe  Intel ought to countersue. Sure beats innovating.

Sure, Intel currently holds a 77% share of the chip market, but sheer size is not determinative in the technology sector. Just look at the ongoing PC/Apple war -- with PCs holding an even greater market share over Apple as  Intel does over AMD.
Apple promotes its Macs as better for average computer users than a Microsoft Windows-based
PC, most famously in their "I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC" commercials.

So what does Microsoft do? It comes out with its own "I'm PC" ads that poke fun at Apple. The two firms are taking to the airwaves almost monthly with new ads mocking each other.

Apple started this war, and is slowly biting into Microsoft's dominant market share without the help of a panel of bureaucrats putting their thumbs on the scale. Apple is doing it the hard way, by spending intellectual and hard capital on innovation and marketing -- the way in which consumers always come out the winners.

There is no reason to distort the market by punishing  Intel because its rivals can't or won't do the same.

HD       Commission Fries Dominant  Chips Maker

The European Commission recently imposed a record  fine of €1.06 billion on  Intel Corporation for breaching EU competition law. Following an eight year investigation, the Commission found that  Intel had abused its dominant position in the market for computer chips (specifically x86 central processing units) between October 2002 and December 2007.

Intel is widely regarded as the biggest computer chip maker in the world and over the period in question held at least 70% of the worldwide market. Whilst holding such a dominant position is not in itself prohibited, the Commission found that  Intel had taken unfair advantage of their market power by:

TD
giving substantial loyalty rebates to computer manufacturers which obtained all or the vast majority of their requirements from  Intel;
making direct payments to a major retailer on the condition that it only stocked products with the relevant
Intel components; and

paying computer manufacturers to delay or cancel the launch of specific products which contained competing components.

This conduct, both individually and collectively, aimed to exclude  Intel's main rival (AMD) from the market by undermining its ability to compete on the merits of its products. In effect,  Intel was exploiting its entrenched market strength to influence customer choice and restrict the availability of competing products.

In addition to this record  fine, the Commission has also ordered  Intel to cease the practices in question (to the extent that it has not already done so) and it will actively monitor  Intel's compliance with the decision. Intel may also find itself subject to damages claims from third parties who have suffered loss
as a result of Intel's abusive conduct and will have to endure the bad publicity which will inevitably follow today's decision.

This case emphasises that companies which hold a dominant position in a market have a special responsibility not to  abuse that position. A dominant company may still compete aggressively in the market provided that it competes on the merits of its products. The company may not, however, take unfair advantage of its dominance to preserve or increase its market position by undermining its competitors and their products.

It should also be noted that  abuse of dominance is not just a concern for large corporations such as Intel or Microsoft. Indeed any entity which holds a market share of 50% or more could well be considered to be dominant in that particular market. In such a case, that entity would be well advised to consider its business practices to ensure that it is not engaging in conduct which may constitute an abuse of market power.

Intel came out fighting in response to the  European Commission's decision to  fine it €1bn for anti-competitive practices.

The key allegation made against  Intel, as outlined by EC  competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, is that: "Intel excluded its competitor in two ways: through illegal loyalty rebates, by paying manufacturers and retailers to restrict the commercialisation of competitors' products."

Kroes added that rebates are not necessarily illegal. "Not all rebates are a competition problem, but the
Intel rebates in this case were a problem because of the conditions that Intel attached to its rebates."
The crucial response of  Intel to this allegation is that there were no conditions attached to the rebates. "We have never conditioned a rebate on an agreement not to buy from AMD," said Bruce Sewell,  Intel's
general counsel.
Another allegation against  Intel is that it paid manufacturers to delay AMD product launches. Asked if
Intel had done this, Sewell responded: "I can absolutely and categorically deny it, and I do deny it."
<i>EW</i> put to Sewell Kroes' statement: "The Commission has specific, documented examples of  Intel
paying other manufacturers to, for example, delay the launch of an AMD-based PC by six months."
Sewell replied: "I am not aware of any such document."

As for Kroes' statement that: "The Commission had ordered  Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately." Sewell said: "I cannot say what it is that we are being told not to do." ●

NVidia is on the offensive against  Intel, just a week after the  European Commission fined the chip giant €1bn - oh, and the rumours about Apple's new iPhone are heating up

&bull;  Intel may still be reeling from the €1bn it was  fined by the European Commission last week, but the chip giant's troubles may not be over yet. The chief executive of NVidia has accused its rival of unfair pricing, according to Reuters. Why? Because an Intel Atom chip actually costs $45 - but the company sells a set of three chips for just $25 to block the competition.

TD
&bull; With Apple's WWDC just a few weeks away, we're starting to hear stronger rumours about the next iPhone model. Rob at Apple iPhone Apps has a compelling - but anonymous - report that the new model will be released on July 17 and include an FM radio, up to 32GB of memory, a built-in compass and double the processing power. Take such rumours with a pinch of salt, as always, but the company will certainly be hoping to steal Palm's thunder.

&bull; I don't need too many words to explain this one: an automated washing machine for dogs. There's nothing like a great gadget, and this is nothing like a... .

NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - A new U.S. administration is shaking up policies running from the environment to taxes, drawing kudos from major companies like Verizon and Corning but worrying smaller ones like Symantec and Sybase .

TD
Industry chieftains at the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York debated this week the impact of the Obama administration's tax policies, bailout, and government regulation and policing of business.

Some railed against attempts to chip away at the deficit by cracking down on offshore tax havens. Others say a heavy government hand will hurt competitiveness at a time hardware and software firms are slugging it out for a slice of a stagnant pie.

"The policies today are starting to make very little sense as it comes to business friendliness," said John Chen, chief executive of database software company Sybase . "The government is getting so deep into operational details of the financial institutions."

Chen blasted potential legislation that may raise taxes on foreign earnings. The administration also seeks to crack down on offshore practices by treating certain U.S. companies in tax havens abroad as domestic corporations, taxed on their income -- a measure that will likely raise costs. [ID:nN03499206]
"The increase in tax rate ..., worldwide tax, that actually weakens the U.S. That's a huge concern." Enrique Salem, chief executive of software security company Symantec, echoed that concern.
"I don't believe taxing foreign profits is the right way to go," Salem said of the plan, which would hit his bottom line. "It doesn't help the competitiveness of the United States."
HELP US
Others, however, welcomed government interference, calling it essential to galvanizing growth as the
United States grapples with its worst recession in decades.

IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said he was making no predictions but declared that $3 trillion of stimulus around the world has to make a difference.
"I would think that would start to ... return us to a more stable environment," he told Reuters.

Others pointed to policies that would benefit the segment in which they operate. Verizon Chief Financial Officer John Killian said his company's cash flows will benefit from an extension into 2009 of a special tax depreciation allowance: a tax break that flows to its bottom line.
"That ... (incentivizes) businesses to continue to invest in their networks," he said.

Corning got really specific. As the car market tanked, so did the market for the catalytic converters that tamp down noxious exhaust fumes. Corning, which makes the guts of these devices, saw its order book shrivel.

Corning Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws was encouraged by new regulations requiring catalytic converters for the diesel engines of off-road vehicles like tractors and construction vehicles, starting in
2011.

"Emission laws have been very favorable to us and created a great business, and continue to do so," he said. "Regulation helps us."

The government is also taking a tougher stance on  antitrust actions, versus the more hands-off approach of the last administration.

This month, Justice Department  antitrust chief Christine Varney said authorities were ready to ramp up enforcement. Her comments came days before the  European Commission hit Intel with a record 1.06 billion euro fine for competing unfairly against Advanced Micro Devices .

AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer said he expected no "light switch" effect on his business. But Nvidia lashed out at  Intel, which makes 80 percent of the world's processors.

CEO Jen-Hsun Huang lashed out at  Intel's pricing policies. Nvidia pairs  Intel's Atom chip with one of its graphics chips, but Huang said  Intel charges him $45 for an individual Atom, but only $25 for a
three-chip Atom set. [ID:nN18372175]

"That seems pretty unfair," he said. "We ought to be able to compete and serve that market." (For summit blog:  http://blogs.reuters.com/summits/) (For more on Reuters Global Technology Summit, see [ID:nLI040240] (Reporting by David Lawsky; Editing by Edwin Chan) (eddie.chan@thomsonreuters.com;

HD      Intel to appeal billion-euro antitrust fine

THE European Commission has finedIntel Corporation E1,060,000,000 for violating European
Community Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position.

The Commission said the company had engaged in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units (CPUs).

TD
The Commission has ordered  Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing.
The fine represents just over n12,800 for each of staff worldwide.

Intel, which employs 5,000 people in Leixlip, has objected to the decision and said it will appeal.

Its CEO, Paul Otellini said that the company takes strong exception to this decision. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace – characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal."

Intel said it did not believe its practices violated European law  Intel never sold products below cost.

It said the Directorate General for  Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision.

Intel Ireland spokesperson, Brendan Cannon, said the company will continue to pursue its operations in
Ireland.

Mr. Otellini said despite our strongly held views, as we go through the appeals process we plan to work with the Commission to ensure we're in compliance with their decision.
Town Council chairman, Colm Purcell, said it would continue to support the company.

The Commission said that between October 2002-December 2007,  Intel had a dominant position in the worldwide x86 CPU market, at least 70% market share.
It found that  Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice.

First, it gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from Intel. The company also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs. It said such rebates and payments effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products.

Second,  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products.
The Commission found that these practices constituted abuses of  Intel's dominant position on the x86
CPU market that harmed consumers throughout the European Economic Area. By undermining its
competitors' ability to compete on the merits of their products,  Intel's actions undermined  competition
and innovation.
The Commission said it will actively monitor  Intel's compliance with this decision.

HD    Rebates: What Can Companies  Learn from the Intel Decision? BY     Mr Kiran Desai

Originally published May 19, 2009
Keywords:  Intel, antitrust, dominant market position, anitcompetitive, Tomra.

TD
As has already been widely reported, on 13 May 2009 the  European Commission (the "Commission") announced that it had finedIntel Corporation €1.06 billion ($1.441 billion) for violating EC Treaty  antitrust rules (Article 82 EC Treaty) on abuse of a dominant market position by engaging in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for Central Processing Unit computer chips (CPUs).

The Commission's more than 500 page decision is not currently available, and will not be for some time, but a few elements relevant to a company's consideration of its rebates scheme can be discerned from the information that is currently available. For a company that might be deemed to hold a dominant market position, determining whether or not a rebate it offers is anticompetitive is particularly challenging and complicated, despite the recent guidance published by the Commission.

Is the Benchmark Set? The  Intel decision is important because it is the first case since the Commission's publication of the principles and concepts of analysis of exploitative  abuse contained in the Commission's
2008 Guidance on this subject.1 The Guidance was long in gestation, having formally commenced as a Staff Discussion paper, published in 2005. Since 2005 there has been much comment, often critical, of a number of elements of the Staff Discussion paper, including rebates. The Commission reached a decision in 2006 in Prokent/Tomra2 in which Tomra, a supplier of reverse vending machines, was  fined Euro 24 million for exploitative  abuse of a dominant position, including its rebates scheme. However, there is not enough substantive description in the Tomra Decision to allow us to recognise it as being a case in which the analysis in the Guidance was fully pre-figured. Some elements of the Tomra decision will serve as a reference, in particular the calculation of the "effective price." The open question, until the  Intel decision is published, is whether or not it will be used as a practical example of the application of the Guidance and
as the key precedent from here on. However, even if this is the case, the  Intel precedent might not be solid, at least for the moment, given that  Intel has already announced that it intends to appeal the Decision.3 More Dominant, More Effects Dominance is clearly a pre-condition for a breach of Article 82
EC Treaty. Many who submitted comments on the Staff Discussion paper urged the Commission to provide companies with a safe harbour. The Commission declined to do so in the Guidance, but did state that "The Commission's experience suggests that dominance is not likely if the undertaking's market share is below 40% in the relevant market." Nonetheless, the Commission in the next sentence also stated that "However, there may be specific cases below that threshold where competitors are not in a position to constrain effectively the conduct of a dominant undertaking, for example where they face serious capacity limitations. Such cases may also deserve attention on the part of the Commission." Some cases are perhaps obvious that there is a dominant position, or at least create a rebuttable presumption that dominance exists on the basis of the market share alone. Leading examples of such cases include Tetra Pak — 91.8 percent for aseptic carton filling machines; BPB Industries plc — 96 percent plasterboard; Microsoft — 60 percent for work group server operating systems; and Tomra — 80/90 percent for reverse vending machines. But there are also non-obvious cases. Leading examples include United Brands —
40/45 percent for the supply of bananas; and British Airways —39.7 percent for air travel agency services. What the Guidance brings out, and this is also emphasized on the effects analysis it introduces, is that, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, there is no black-or-white causal effect that flows from a preliminary determination that there is or might be a dominant position. There are shades of dominance, and the stronger the position of dominance, the more likely there will be effects. The market share held by
Page 138 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel was determined to be at least 70 percent. That is a market position enjoyed by few corporations, and such a share ensured that anticompetitive foreclosure from its rebates scheme was, as a starting presumption, likely to have a real and material effect on the relevant market. Companies with a
percentage market share in the low 40s could have the same level and type of rebate and legitimately conclude that there is no anticompetitive foreclosure. Consequently, a conclusion that a company should never have a rebate scheme like  Intel's could be erroneous, because the degree of dominance held by the company might be different and, therefore, lead to different levels of effects on  competition. Not Just a Rebate Intel's rebates could only be taken advantage of by customers if they also met forms of exclusive or partially-exclusive purchasing obligations. Of the four customers concerned, one had to buy
100 percent of its requirements for the relevant products from  Intel; for the second customer it was 95 percent of its requirements for its business desktop computers; for the third it was 80 percent of its needs for its desktop and notebook computers; and for the fourth it was all of its requirements for its notebook computers. A conclusion from the  Intel decision is that companies should take care before basing their rebates on the condition of exclusivity or partial exclusivity. It is also clear from the  Intel decision that while such conditions might not be explicit, the Commission has the ability to determine the true position through "dawn-raids," or from evidence provided by third parties — including, of course, the supplier's customers! As regards non-explicit (partial) exclusivity, the level of the "non-contestable share" — as is discussed below — should be included in the analysis. It's Not a Contest A crucial element for the proper analysis of
a company's rebate schemes is the determination of the "contestable share" and "non-contestable share." As the Commission expresses it, "a conditional rebate granted by a dominant undertaking may enable it to use the 'non contestable' portion of the demand of each customer (that is to say, the amount that would be purchased by the customer from the dominant undertaking in any event) as leverage to decrease the price to be paid for the 'contestable' portion of demand (that is to say, the amount for which the customer may prefer and be able to find substitutes)."4 In the Guidance, the Commission offers the argument that, "competitors may not be able to compete for an individual customer's entire demand because the
dominant undertaking is an unavoidable trading partner at least for part of the demand on the market, for instance because its brand is a 'must stock item' preferred by many final consumers or because the capacity constraints on the other suppliers are such that a part of demand can only be provided for by the dominant supplier."5 In the  Intel case, the relevant product, CPUs and the  Intel x86 generation in particular, is an essential input for all kinds of computers. The x86 architecture is ubiquitous among desktop and notebook computers and has a growing majority share among servers and workstations.
Given this market environment, and the Commission's statement in its press release on the  Intel case that AMD was essentially  Intel's only competitor in the market, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the Commission determined for  Intel's customers that the "non-contestable share" was very high, and the "contestable share" was very low. There may be only a few companies that, even though dominant, operate in an environment like  Intel's. Consequently, a conclusion that a company should never have a rebate scheme like Intel's could be unfounded, because the levels of contestable and non-contestable share for a company could be quite different to those faced by  Intel's customers; this difference can lead
to different (and arguably lesser) effects on competition on the relevant product market. What Next? As mentioned above, the Commission's decision in the Intel case may not be publicly available for quite some time. Indeed, if  Intel lodges an appeal before the European Court in Luxembourg, the Commission
decision will not become final at least for a couple of years. However, this decision sent a strong message about the Commission's determination to enhance its enforcement in dominance cases. Considering that in the last ten years there have been only a few cases on rebates besides  Intel, and that the Commission
has recently adopted its Guidance on this subject following a lengthy consultation period, there will be little room for dominant or presumably dominant companies to argue that the law is not clear on rebates and try to avoid higher fines for illegal conduct. Therefore, these companies need to consider their options and proactively seek to ensure that their rebate schemes and generally their conduct is compatible with the Guidance provided by the Commission.

As American regulators slept through the past eight years, several authorities overseas decided that
the Intel Corporation has been abusing its near  monopoly position in the microchip market to squeeze
out its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, constraining consumers' choice.

It is now the United States' turn. The Federal Trade Commission, which opened a formal investigation into Intel's business a year ago, should decide without delay whether to pursue the company in court. The issue is not just whether  Intel's tactics against A.M.D. amount to illicit behavior. The larger question is whether Washington is willing to pursue monopolies vigorously for predatory practices and foster an environment where  competition and innovation can thrive.

TD
Since 2005, regulators in Japan and South Korea have ruled against Intel. This month the  European Commission slapped the company with a $1.44 billion  fine. It found that Intel has been giving hidden rebates to computer makers that bought all or virtually all of their chips from Intel and paying some to delay or hinder the introduction of products that had A.M.D. microprocessors.

Intel denies those accusations, arguing that the volume rebates it offers never carried the alleged quid pro quos. The company appealed the Korean  fine and said it would appeal the European decision.

For much of the Bush administration, regulators declined to look formally into the charges against  Intel. That reluctance was the product of an extremely narrow reading of antitrust law, validated by a conservative Supreme Court that has become increasingly hostile to antitrust enforcement.

In the Bush administration's view, to get in trouble a monopolist must do worse than use unfair methods to undermine a competitor. Regulators must usually prove that consumers were directly hurt, typically through high prices. When the wrongdoing is to offer a client conditional rebates -- meaning lower prices -- that can be especially hard to prove.

That view of consumer harm is too restrictive. It often seems to ignore the fact that a dominant firm that uses unfair tactics to marginalize its rivals deprives consumers of choice, another form of harm.
Without competitors there is no  competition. Without  competition there is no incentive for innovation, or to reduce prices.

The Obama administration has a different view. The Justice Department's antitrust division has rescinded Bush administration guidelines intended to shield monopolies from antitrust accusations. The F.T.C. is also likely to be more active under its new chairman, Jon Leibowitz. He is already considering pursuing future antitrust cases with a little-used provision of  antitrust law that directly outlaws unfair methods of competition. The American economy cannot thrive without  antitrust laws. It is time to start enforcing them.

Will the computer industry ever escape its  antitrust problems?

TD
Illustration by David Simonds

"THIS  antitrust thing will blow over." Thus Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, a decade ago as regulators launched an action against his company. The chiefs at other big technology firms, even if they were not quite so outspoken, doubtless held similar views when their companies were targeted by trustbusters. It was wishful thinking then, and remains so today, as long-running  antitrust actions flare up again and regulators ponder new moves against the industry’s giants.

Perhaps as soon as next week the  European Commission will issue its long-awaited decision in the case against Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. It is expected to impose a whopping  fine of at least €1 billion ($1.3 billion). In early June Microsoft will defend itself in a hearing in Brussels against accusations that it illegally bundled its web browser with its Windows operating system—the very practice that got the software company into trouble in the late 1990s. IBM, the target of trustbusters since the 1950s, faces a new antitrust complaint. And Google, the industry’s newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny.
On April 29th it emerged that America’s Justice Department is examining whether Google’s settlement with authors and publishers over its book-search service violates  antitrust laws; and on May 5th the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe to see whether Google’s sharing of two board members with Apple reduces  competition between the two firms.

The computer industry makes more  antitrust headlines than others, and seems unlikely to shake off these problems, for three reasons. The first is that technology heavyweights are often dominant in their
respective markets. Ask any of the bosses of these firms why they are so dominant and they will probably respond that it is a result of billions spent on research and development. But they also operate in markets that allow a winner to take all (or most). Mainframes and operating systems benefit from strong network effects: the more applications run on them, for instance, the more users they attract, which encourages programmers to write more applications for them. With microprocessors, ever-increasing capital requirements mean only the biggest firms can afford to build their own factories. The markets for search and online advertising exhibit similar effects: the bigger a firm’s market share, the greater its ability to attract advertisers, thus bringing in the money to build ever bigger data centres. In each case it is difficult for an upstart to break in.

But it is not impossible. A second characteristic of the industry is that dominant positions can be undermined by technological progress: mainframes, for example, were dethroned in the 1980s by smaller machines. Because they cannot afford to rest on their laurels, high-tech heavyweights often foster aggressive corporate cultures that draw the attention of  antitrust regulators. It is no accident that Andy Grove, a former boss of  Intel, entitled one of his books "Only the Paranoid Survive".

Aware of the risk that the spirit of  competition could become abusive,  Intel has long made sure that its employees undergo compliance training. But this did not keep the firm from crossing the line, at least in the opinion of the  European Commission. It alleges that  Intel, using a system of discounts and rebates, encouraged computer-makers and retailers to sell only a limited number of machines powered by chips made by AMD,  Intel’s only remaining serious rival in microprocessors for PCs. In one case  Intel is said to have paid a retailer to forgo AMD chips altogether.

Fear of being supplanted was also behind Microsoft’s decision in the late 1990s to bundle its web browser, Internet Explorer, into Windows. The  European Commission’s current investigation looks forwards rather than backwards, however, with the aim of ensuring that there is  competition in the future. As more and more computing moves online (into the "cloud"), the browser is replacing the operating system as the central computing platform.

Thirdly, problems with  antitrust will continue to dog the industry for the simple reason that companies are increasingly using it as a competitive weapon, alongside other instruments such as patent lawsuits and battles over standards. As it lost market share to  Intel, for example, AMD launched a global campaign to get regulators to examine its rival’s behaviour. It went to the European Commission and to its regulatory counterparts in South Korea and Japan, both of which have ruled against Intel. In America AMD has filed a private antitrust lawsuit which is due to go to trial next February. The FTC opened an  antitrust investigation of Intel last June.

Similarly,  antitrust lobbying is part of a broader "platform war" for IBM, which hopes thereby to keep Microsoft at bay. Among other things, IBM is a sponsor of the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), which has many of Microsoft’s other competitors as its members and is one of the prime movers behind the new browser case. It started in late 2007 with a complaint by Opera, a Norwegian browser-maker and ECIS member.

Not to be outdone, Microsoft has entered the  antitrust game, too. It recently made an investment in T3, a small vendor of mainframe-like computers, which in January lodged a complaint with the  European          Commission, alleging that IBM kept it from competing by refusing to license mainframe software to T3’s customers. Microsoft has also lobbied American  antitrust regulators to tackle Google, encouraging them
to look into an online-advertising deal between the search giant and its rival, Yahoo!, which was eventually abandoned.

That is not to say that the  antitrust cases that are now under way are without merit, and have merely been stirred up by rival firms. But it means that regulators must make a "sound judgment" and consider whether the aggressive behaviour of industry giants actually hurts consumers, and not just rivals, argues Steven Salop, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC. Ill-conceived remedies can make things worse, says Lars-Hendrik Röller, president of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin and a former senior economist at the  European Commission.

The commission’s case against Microsoft looks the most robust. In September 2007 the European Court of First Instance ruled that the firm had stifled  competition by tying its media player to Windows. The same reasoning should also apply to browsers, even though the browser market has become somewhat more competitive in recent years, thanks to the rise of Firefox, an open-source browser. The commission will probably ask Microsoft to include the most popular rival browsers with Windows, asking users to choose one when they boot up for the first time.

The case against  Intel is trickier. Offering discounts and rebates is common in many industries, so the case hinges on whether  Intel attached conditions to such rebates that constituted an  abuse of its market position. It is unclear whether any harm has been done: prices for chips continue to fall, innovation has not slowed down and AMD has increased its market share slightly in recent months. And certain remedies could actually limit competition. Limiting discounts, for instance, might in effect create a price floor for AMD, given that it is Intel’s only competitor.

IBM, for its part, would appear to have little to fear. It is hard to argue, with so many different computer systems around, that mainframes still constitute a separate market—a necessary condition if IBM’s behaviour is to be judged anticompetitive.

That leaves Google. If history is any guide, it can expect a run-in with trustbusters before long. But the firm is aware of this, and has trodden carefully as a result. The crunch is likely to come when a serious competitor emerges in search or advertising—Google, after all, toppled AltaVista, the previous leader in web search. For the industry as a whole, meanwhile, it seems unlikely that the  antitrust thing will blow
over any time soon.

Has the financial and economic crisis pushed aside the fundamental elements of EU  competition policy to the benefit of industrial and social concerns? The issue is under debate, but one thing is certain: the European Commission does not intend to give in on the basis of Community law. In this special dossier, Europolitics provides insight into the debate underway, as well as the actions undertaken by the EU executive, particularly in terms of state aid.

The Commission did not lose its touch in terms of  competition between European businesses across all areas: the control of state aid as well as of mergers with a European dimension, the fight against cartels
as well as abuse of dominant position. This was proven by the record  fine of €1.06 billion imposed on the world's leading semiconductor producer,  Intel, on 13 May, for  abuse of dominant position. Or the unprecedented combined  fine of €1.38 million on four car glass manufacturers, in November 2008, found guilty of forging a cartel.

TD
The fact remains that the subprime mortgage crisis, which was born in the United States and subsequently had a violent impact on European banks, led to an overhaul. If only because, in the case of state aid, the EU executive had to speed up its decision making in the second half of 2008, in order to give the green light to the rescue plans for banks which were then plummeting. This necessitated additional work, "including the weekends," insisted Neelie Kroes, the  competition commissioner, on
several occasions. But the return to protectionism was flatly refused: "Some observers have declared that competition rules are an obstacle to resolving the crisis. This is not true: they are, on the contrary, essential," maintained the Dutch commissioner.

At the height of the crisis, in the second half of 2008, member states in fact criticised the Commission for not having reacted quickly enough. In response, the College provided Neelie Kroes with the means to take decisions more quickly in order to authorise emergency aid. This did not prevent her - in a second period anticipated by the authorisation of aid - from putting pressure on the major banks rescued at national level. For example, on 12 May, the large German regional bank, WestLB, assisted by North Rhine-Westphalia (west) and the local savings banks, was urged to make a clean sweep of its assets in order to get rid of the riskiest ones. "And who says that the Commission is not active," said the commissioner. "Since the start of the financial crisis, state aid has been part of the solution and not the problem," she commented.

Such were the emergency reactions to the national rescue plans. On the other hand, therefore, there was no change in sight for the fight against  abuse of dominant position and cartels (illicit arrangements between businesses on prices or even market share). More than ever, the Commission has them in its
line of sight. All that remains is company mergers.
FLEXIBILITY ON MERGERS?

In the area of mergers/acquisitions of companies with a European dimension, several lawyers agree that the crisis does not lead to substantial modifications in the basic aspects of the law. Kroes is, however, "locked inside a tight straitjacket," commented Jacques Buhart, a lawyer and partner at the Herbert Smith practice in Paris. The Commission's objective being, in fact, to obtain a decision that has the least risk of being contested before the EU Court of Justice.



Page 146 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Will the Commission consent to sacrificing the long-term advantages of a  competition system and opt for short-term solutions to the damage that  competition may pose, in certain cases, if it is too fierce? I doubt it," added Dominique Brault, a lawyer at the court, who specialises in Community and French competition law and is also a partner at the Herbert Smith practice.

And yet, "will the Commission's action not become much more complicated," asks Maître Brault. And not really for quantitative reasons - because the EU executive could have fewer merger dossiers to deal with than in the past - but for qualitative reasons. "Here we can expect a strong development, because there will be far fewer operations that do not pose many problems, such as acquisition of equity by the investment funds. On the other hand, there will be more sensitive intrasector operations, which pose competition problems, and which do not go via simplified procedures. Average lead times for handling cases could therefore increase," he said.

Finally, sums up Maître Brault, "if the basics are not required to move, at least in the discussions and texts," the way in which they will be applied, "will evolve".
This is what Europolitics is striving to analyse in this dossier n.

FROM THE ECONOMIST
Will the computer industry ever escape its  antitrust problems?

Illustration by David Simonds

"THIS  antitrust thing will blow over." Thus Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, a decade ago as regulators launched an action against his company. The chiefs at other big technology firms, even if they were not quite so outspoken, doubtless held similar views when their companies were targeted by trustbusters. It was wishful thinking then, and remains so today, as long-running  antitrust actions flare up again and regulators ponder new moves against the industry’s giants.

Perhaps as soon as next week the  European Commission will issue its long-awaited decision in the case against Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.

LP
BERLIN -- Microsoft and the  European Commission have canceled the only hearing planned in an antitrust investigation into the company's Internet browser because of a dispute over the attendance of European regulators serving as advisers.

As a result, the commission, which began its inquiry after a complaint by Opera, a small browser maker in Norway, will reach its decision and levy a  fine based on written statements from Microsoft and its adversaries. Microsoft decided not to give oral evidence in the case after it was unable to persuade the commission to move the meeting, scheduled for June 3 through 5, so that it did not conflict with a global  antitrust conference in Zurich that draws European  antitrust regulators.

TD
Dave Heiner, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, said the conflict would have prevented some regulators from attending the hearings as observers and advisers.
''It appears many of the most influential commission and national  competition officials with the
greatest interest in our case will be in Zurich and so unable to attend our hearing,'' Mr. Heiner wrote on
his blog on the Microsoft Web site.

The regulators' attendance was important, Microsoft said, because they may have been more sympathetic to the company's argument that the bundling of Internet Explorer in Windows did not represent a breach of European law. The commission typically consults with the national regulators before issuing sanctions and  fines in the case.

The commission ruled in 2004 that Microsoft had unfairly used Windows, which powers more than 90 percent of the world's computers, to benefit its own media player and computer server software. The company ended up paying more than $1 billion in  fines and penalties fighting the inquiry over nine years.

Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman, said the panel was puzzled by Microsoft's request. He said the hearing would have been attended by Neelie Kroes, the  competition commissioner for the European Union and ranking executive. Usually, the hearings are conducted only by a staff hearing officer.
''The commission would have been represented at the highest level by Mrs. Kroes,'' Mr. Todd said. Thomas Vinje, a lawyer representing Opera and other Microsoft adversaries, said he suspected
Microsoft was trying to win some sort of delay.

''I have never seen E.U. national  competition officials, who are observers, play a significant role in such cases,'' Mr. Vinje said.

The development comes little more than a week after the commission  fined the computer chip maker Intel a record 1.06 billion euros, or $1.45 billion, for offering rebates to computer makers and retailers in exchange for exclusive sales and distribution agreements.  Intel is appealing the decision.

Any delay in the Microsoft case could have extended the outcome beyond the reach of Ms. Kroes, whose future as the Europe's top  competition official will depend on the outcome of June 7 European elections.

Mrs. Kroes has said she wants to issue a decision in the Microsoft case before her current term, which could last through the end of the year, expires.
But that will depend on the June elections, and whether the current commission president, Jose
Manuel Barroso of Portugal, is re-elected and whether he reappoints Ms. Kroes, a Dutch lawyer.

Regulators to act over browser wars

TD
Clash of diary dates blamed for move

Microsoft's troubled relations with the  European Commission have suffered another dent following an unusual public spat over its decision on Thursday to call off a key set of hearings that had been scheduled for early next month.

The software company's explanation for why it called off the hearings, over accusations that it has abused its Windows  monopoly to win a dominant position in the browser market, was questioned by a Commission official and the company's rivals.

However, Microsoft did not give ground yesterday, continuing to maintain that a clash of diary dates would have prevented senior European officials from attending the hearings. It has also said that it
would consider attending the hearings if they were rescheduled, although legal experts said that seemed unlikely.

The termination of the hearings, meanwhile, has cleared the way for European regulators to move ahead more quickly with their expected sanctions against the company, which are expected later this summer.

Coming in the wake of a big  fine and new restrictions on chipmaker  Intel, the decision would cement Brussels' position at the forefront of regulating the tech industry, although the US Department of Justice has indicated its own interest in stepping up  antitrust enforcement.
Microsoft said it had called off the browser hearings because they clashed with the annual meeting of
the International  Competition Network, which is usually attended by the heads of  antitrust enforcement
from leading nations, together with other senior officials.
"It's pretty unheard of for a company to cancel its own hearings in Brussels," said one  antitrust lawyer. Rivals claimed the explanation was a smokescreen, since senior officials do not generally attend the
type of hearings that had been scheduled in Brussels. An EC official also challenged Microsoft's
explanation, though he indicated that Neelie Kroes, the EC's  competition commissioner, had in fact
been planning to attend.

Microsoft's decision seemed mainly designed to save the company from having to face accusations from rivals at the private hearings, said the lawyer. Browser makers Opera, Mozilla and Google, along with security software firms Symantec and MacAfee were expected to attend.

Other lawyers suggested the saga was a sign of the weak position that companies such as Microsoft find themselves in when facing such hearings.
"There have been efforts to make oral hearings more relevant in  antitrust cases but many companies
still decline them because of a perception that they serve little purpose," said Stephen Kinsella, a partner

"The fact that they are often scheduled without much consideration for the wishes of the defendants does tend to reinforce that impression."

Microsoft requested the hearings late last month, when filing its formal response to the Commission's browser accusations.

HD         Microsoft withdraws E.U. hearing request

Berlin-- Microsoft and the  European Commission have canceled the only hearing planned in an antitrust investigation into Microsoft's Internet browser following a dispute over the attendance of European regulators serving as advisers in the case.

As a result, the commission, which began its inquiry following a complaint by Opera, a small browser maker in Norway, will reach its decision and possibly levy a  fine based on written statements from Microsoft and its adversaries.

TD
Microsoft withdrew its request for a hearing after it was unable to persuade the commission, which is
the executive arm of the European Union, to reschedule the meeting, set for June 3 to June 5, so that it
did not conflict with a global  antitrust conference in Zurich that attracts European national  antitrust
regulators.

David A. Heiner, a Microsoft vice president and a deputy general counsel, said the conflict would have prevented some E.U. regulators from attending the hearings as observers and advisers.

''It appears many of the most influential commission and national  competition officials with the greatest interest in our case will be in Zurich and so unable to attend our hearing,'' Mr. Heiner wrote on his blog on the Microsoft Web site.

Microsoft was hoping that the national  competition officials would be more sympathetic to the company's defense of charges that it had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system by including its Internet Explorer browser, freezing out competitors like Opera.

The commission ruled in 2004 that Microsoft had unfairly used Windows, which powers more than 90 percent of the world's computers, to benefit its own media player and computer server software. The company ended up paying more than $1 billion in  fines and penalties fighting the inquiry over nine years.

Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman on  antitrust issues, said the panel was puzzled by Microsoft's request. He said the hearing would have been attended by Neelie Kroes, the E.U. competition commissioner and ranking executive. Usually, the hearings are conducted only by a staff hearing officer.
''The commission would have been represented at the highest level by Mrs. Kroes,'' Mr. Todd said. Thomas Vinje, an attorney representing Opera and other Microsoft adversaries, said he suspected that
Microsoft was trying to win some sort of delay in the case.

''I have never seen E.U. national  competition officials, who are observers, play a significant role in such cases,'' Mr. Vinje said.

The development comes little more than a week after the commission  fined the U.S. computer chip maker Intel a record €1.06 billion, or $1.48 billion, for offering rebates to computer makers and retailers in exchange for exclusive sales and distribution agreements.  Intel is appealing the decision.

Any delay in the Microsoft case could have extended the outcome beyond the reach of Mrs. Kroes, whose future as the E.U.'s top  competition official will depend on the outcome of June 7 European elections.

Mrs. Kroes has said she wants to issue a decision in the Microsoft case before the expiration of her current term, which could last through the end of the year.
But that will depend on the June elections, and whether the current commission president, José Manuel
Barroso of Portugal, is re-elected and whether he reappoints Mrs. Kroes, a Dutch lawyer.

Gwyn Morgan is the retired founding CEO of EnCana Corp.

President Barack Obama's first 100 days are history, the worst of the U.S.-led banking crisis seems to be passing, and stock markets are grasping at every bit of positive news.

TD
Will the resilient culture of free enterprise, innovation and renewal overcome America's seemingly intractable problems and turn those “green shoots” into fields of prosperity?

A recent visit to Washington made it clear that, unfortunately, Mr. Obama's misguided populist actions are like a deadly herbicide to those fragile seedlings of hope.
Here are some of the ways that the U.S. government has declared war on Corporate America:

• 1. In a lawful bankruptcy proceeding, secured bondholders rank ahead of unsecured creditors and unions. Ignoring investor rights, the White House struck a deal giving unions the majority of Chrysler's stock.

Under huge pressure and fearing the prospect of being blacklisted from government business, some fund managers capitulated. Mr. Obama then labelled the remaining holdouts “greedy hedge funds.”

This bullying rhetoric deliberately ignores the fiduciary responsibility of fund managers to salvage whatever they can for the individual investors who have helped keep Chrysler alive. So much for that fragile green shoot called investor confidence.

• 2. An economic crisis would seem to be a poor time to attack your strongest enterprises, but clearly the Obama administration thinks otherwise. The U.S. Justice Department's top  antitrust official recently announced a reversal of previous guidelines to “stop abuses … while avoiding … interference with the rough and tumble of beneficial  competition.”
Ironically, that announcement came on the same day the European Commission levied a €1-billion
($1.58-billion)  antitrust fine against computer chip giant Intel.

The commission's previous victim was Microsoft, leading the Bush White House to accuse the EU of taking the action as a protectionist measure against American companies that were simply more innovative and capable than their European counterparts.

The U.S. Justice Department is infamous for its win-at-all-costs trophy-hunting lawyers, so now, being big and successful will be as hazardous at home as abroad. That should ensure those green shoots get whacked down if they grow too tall.

• 3. The huge stable of American-headquartered international corporations is the country's No. 1 competitive advantage. Contrary to popular impression, the principal wealth-generation component of global production chains is not in manufacturing the products but rather in creation of the technology,

Page 157 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
branding and control of the value chain from design to component acquisition to assembly to customer.

A Dell computer ordered by a student in Toronto is made of components supplied by manufacturers from around the globe and sent to factories in Asia for final assembly. The manufacturers might make
2 per cent on their part of the supply chain, while the margin for Dell is 20 to 40 per cent of the final sales price.

Global companies operate through subsidiaries in each of the countries where they do business, but the best jobs are almost always in the country where the head office is located.

So what is Mr. Obama proposing to do? Besides higher corporate and personal tax rates at home, he has announced plans to disallow the deduction of taxes paid to host countries of foreign subsidiaries. This double taxation plan isn't so much killing the green shoots as toppling the strongest oaks in the forest.

• 4. Mr. Obama's “I love this country,” as he departed from a rock-star-like whirlwind visit to Canada, gave us hope that he was genuinely committed to living up to his anti-protectionism assurances. Fast forward three months and Canadians might be recalling the Black Eyed Peas' 2003 hit Where is the Love?

The image on the lead page of this newspaper's May 11 Report on Business shows the proprietor of Toronto-based pipe supplier Ipex standing beside a rack of his brand new “Made in Canada”-stamped pipes that were ripped out of the ground and replaced with “Made in U.S.A.” pipes at an American military base.

While Mr. Obama warns the G20 against “giving in to protectionism,” Canadian goods and services are being surreptitiously rejected where it counts, at the actual project level. Given the de facto shutout of Canadian steel products in American stimulus projects, it's only right that Industry Minister Tony Clement is pressing U.S. Steel to live up to commitments made at the time of the Stelco takeover, rather than shutting Canadian plants in favour of their U.S.-based ones.

So, what should Canada do when our closest neighbour and most important trading partner takes action against its own investors and business enterprises, while failing to address actions that violate cross-border trade agreements?
First, we should push as hard as possible for those trade undertakings to be honoured.

Then, we should let global value chain enterprises know that they are welcome to move their head offices from a country with one of world's highest tax and ideologically anti-business regimes to one that is lowering taxes and welcomes enterprise and investment.
And to where the love really is.

HD     The European Commission Fines Intel €1 Billion For Abuses Of Dominance
BY     Mr Ianis Girgenson

On May 13, 2009, the  European Commission ("EC") announced in a press release that it had imposed a fine of €1.06 billion (approx. $1.45 billion) on US-based chipmaker  Intel Corporation for violating EU antitrust rules. This is the highest individual  fine ever imposed by the EC. The EC has not yet published its decision.

Intel is the world's largest producer of x86 central processing units ("CPUs"), the main hardware component of a computer. According to the EC,  Intel abused its dominant position by offering loyalty rebates and direct payments to computer manufacturers and to a major retailer in order to exclude  Intel's main rival, Advanced Micro Devices ("AMD"), from the market.  Intel has announced it would appeal the decision.

TD
The Intel investigation and the resulting record  fine is the latest example of the EC's focus on enforcement of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abuses of dominance. That trend was also signaled by the release of the EC's Guidance on the application of Article 82 to exclusionary conduct. New inquiries into Microsoft's practices and other high-profile  abuse of dominance investigations currently underway further demonstrate an increased level of enforcement vigor by the EC. Rebate practices, such as the ones involved in  Intel, are but one of many types of commercial behavior that could potentially raise concerns. Given this environment, it is essential for leading market players to consider carefully the
manner in which they deal with their suppliers, distributors, customers, and competitors.

The fine is the result of a nine-year long investigation Beginning in 2000, AMD submitted several complaints to the EC regarding  Intel's business strategies. The EC investigated these complaints and conducted unannounced inspections ("dawn raids") at  Intel's Munich offices and at the offices of several retailers. In 2007 and 2008, the EC issued statements of objections to  Intel. In November 2008, Intel applied to the EU Court of First Instance ("CFI") for interim measures to suspend the investigation. Intel complained that it was not given sufficient time to respond to the EC's statement of objections and was not provided with access to certain key evidence. However, the CFI's President dismissed  Intel's request. The EC found that  Intel had abused its dominant position The EC decided that  Intel had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abuses of dominant position.  Intel accounts for around 70% of the global market for x86 CPUs and the EC found that  Intel held a dominant position in that market. According to the EC, Intel had abused its dominance by engaging in the following illegal practices: Loyalty rebates:  Intel offered rebates to five computer manufacturers (Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and NEC) on condition that they purchased all, or almost all, of their requirements for x86 CPUs from  Intel; Direct payments to a retailer:  Intel made direct payments to Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain, on condition that MediaMarkt stores stock only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs; "Pay for delay":
Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to delay the launch of certain products incorporating AMD's CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products.  Intel's illegal conduct took place between 2002 and 2007. The rebates and direct payments were generally secret and were not disclosed in  Intel's supply agreements. The EC concluded that  Intel used its existing entrenched position in the market for x86 CPUs in order to exclude AMD from that market. The EC distinguished between valid discounts and illegal loyalty rebates In its press release, the EC emphasized that it did not object to the rebates themselves but to the conditions  Intel attached to its rebates. The EC considers rebates to be abusive if offered by a dominant company and made conditional on buying less (or none) of
a rival's products, unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify such rebates. The EC stated that computer manufacturers depended on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies. Only a limited part of each manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements was open to  competition. However, a
Page 161 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
manufacturer that satisfied its residual requirements by buying AMD's products could no longer qualify for a significant rebate on its very high volumes of  Intel purchases. Therefore, Intel's rebates eliminated competition in the residual market for x86 CPUs. This is the highest individual fine ever imposed by the EC The EC fined Intel €1.06 billion (approx. $1.45 billion). This record-breaking fine exceeds each of the three fines imposed by the EC on Microsoft in 2004-2008 for abuses of dominance and for failure to comply with the EC's orders (although the total of the  fines imposed on Microsoft amounts to €1.68 billion). It also exceeds the record cartel  fine of €896 million imposed by the EC in 2008 on the French group Saint-Gobain. In order to calculate the  fine, the EC has considered the value of  Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area and the duration of the infringement (five years and three months). The fine represents 4.15% of  Intel's 2008 worldwide revenues. The EC can impose  fines of up to 10% of the company's worldwide annual revenues. The EC has also ordered  Intel to cease illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing. The EC has announced that it would monitor  Intel's compliance with the decision.  Intel's business practices have also been challenged outside of the EU In the past,  Intel's rebates have been subject to antitrust scrutiny outside of the EU. In 2005, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued an injunction against Intel after finding that  Intel's rebates illegally prevented five major Japanese computer manufacturers from purchasing competing CPUs. In 2008, the Korean Fair Trade Commission fined Intel $25 million for offering rebates to computer manufacturers in return for boycotting AMD's products (Intel has appealed this fine). In June 2008, the US Federal Trade Commission opened a formal investigation into Intel's sales strategies and issued a subpoena to  Intel. The New York Attorney General's Office has also issued a subpoena to  Intel in connection with an investigation into  Intel's pricing practices and possible attempts to exclude competitors through its market dominance. Moreover, AMD has filed private litigation against  Intel in the US District Court for the District of Delaware and trial is scheduled for Spring 2010. The crackdown on abuses of dominance is likely to continue We anticipate that following the Intel decision the EC will continue to aggressively prosecute
abuses of dominance and that the level of fines will remain extremely high: The EC has been emboldened by several recent court victories, including the CFI's ruling confirming the EC's Microsoft decision. EU courts strongly support the EC's approach to abuses of dominance. The EC has recently issued detailed guidelines on exclusionary abuses. It considers that the guidelines set forth clear rules that should be followed by dominant firms in order to comply with EU law. The EC is currently conducting other
high-profile investigations into alleged abuses of dominance (including new inquiries into Microsoft's practices). It is expected that  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes will endeavor to close some of these cases before her term ends this year. The  Intel fine is more than double the €495 million  fine imposed on Microsoft in 2004 and is the first EU penalty to cross the €1 billion threshold. While each  fine is calculated based on the specific circumstances of the case, we believe that the EC will continue to impose substantial  fines in abuse of dominance cases. In the US, the Obama administration also intends to pursue a more aggressive enforcement approach with respect to monopolization cases. In a speech delivered two days before the EC  fined Intel, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney announced the US Department of Justice's departure from certain policies adopted by the prior administration which it believed raised "many hurdles to Government  antitrust enforcement." Ms. Varney made clear that the Department of Justice would actively investigate and pursue enforcement in this area.

HD     European Commission's Record-Setting Fine on Intel: What It Means For Business

Executive Summary

The European Commission imposed today on Intel the highest  fine ever levied (€1.06 billion or approximately $1.45 billion) for a violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abusive conduct by dominant firms. The Commission's 542-page decision (which has yet to be released) is likely to be important for several reasons:

TD
(1) The decision implicates controversial issues regarding the permissible use of rebates, discounts, and promotional payments by firms with leading market positions, including the conditions under which such conduct may be deemed an "exclusive dealing arrangement," and in which above-cost pricing conduct may be considered anticompetitive;

(2) Depending on the precise conclusions of the EC's decision, the outcome of  Intel's expected appeal, and ongoing U.S. litigation, there is a real prospect of continued and heightened divergence between U.S. and EU law in this area; and

(3) The decision further solidifies the EC's reputation as (a) an attractive venue for complainants seeking redress for dominant firm conduct and (b) an enforcement agency willing to assert jurisdiction against companies and conduct outside its borders.
Background

The Commission's decision follows a lengthy investigation of  Intel stemming from complaints first made approximately nine years ago by  Intel's primary competitor, AMD. AMD has also initiated private litigation against Intel in the U.S., and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General are continuing to investigate  Intel's pricing practices.

Intel has also been scrutinized by national  competition authorities in Asia. In March 2005,  Intel agreed to abide by a JFTC recommendation to modify certain practices, although it did not agree to the JFTC's factual findings or legal conclusions.1 In June 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission  fined Intel approximately $25 million for allegedly providing rebates to local OEMs, including Samsung Electronics and Sambo Computer, that were allegedly contingent upon their not purchasing CPUs from AMD.2  Intel has appealed that decision.
The Commission's Announcement

Alleged Anticompetitive Conduct. According to today's announcement, the Commission has determined that Intel engaged in two forms of conduct that violated the prohibition on  abuse of a dominant position under EU competition law. 3

Conditional Rebates and Payments.  Intel allegedly made "wholly or partially hidden" rebates to computer manufacturers, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and NEC, on condition that they would buy all, or almost all, of their microprocessors from  Intel -- at least in certain defined segments. Furthermore,  Intel also allegedly made payments to a major European consumer electronics chain (Media Markt) on the condition that it would exclusively sell  Intel-based PCs.

According to the Commission,  Intel's rebates impaired the ability of rival manufacturers, such as AMD, to compete and innovate, and this led to reduced choice for consumers. The Commission emphasized that its "case is about the conditions associated with  Intel's rebates and payments, not the rebates and payments themselves." The Commission also claims that  Intel attempted to conceal these conditions.

The Commission further asserts that  Intel's pricing policy was unlawful, at least in part, because "for the part of the computer manufacturers' supplies that was up for grabs, a competitor that was just as efficient as Intel would have had to offer a price for its CPUs lower than its costs of producing those CPUs, even if the average price of its CPUs was lower than that of  Intel." To illustrate this point, the Commission claims rival chip manufacturer AMD offered one million free CPUs to a computer manufacturer; however, the customer only took 160,000 CPUs because it would have lost the rebate on millions of CPUs purchased from Intel if it had accepted this offer.

Payments to Prevent Sales of Rival Products. The Commission also stated that  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to "halt or delay the launch of" products containing competing microprocessors or put restrictions on the distribution of such products (e.g., sales of AMD - models were restricted to direct channels or to small/medium business customers).

Fine and Remedy. The €1.06 billion  fine is the highest  fine ever levied on a company for  abuse of a dominant position; it is also more than double the second highest  fine (€497 million), which was imposed on Microsoft in 2004. In setting the amount, the Commission cited the gravity and duration (five years and three months) of the alleged infringing conduct. It also noted that the  fine represents 4.15% of  Intel's turnover in 2008, which is less than half the allowable maximum  fine, i.e., 10% of annual turnover.

The Commission also announced that it will require  Intel to terminate these practices and avoid engaging in "equivalent" practices in the future. The precise contours of the Commission's ordered remedy, however, remain unclear, as the full decision has not yet been released.

Intel's Reaction  Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini issued a statement announcing that the company will appeal the Commission's decision.4 The statement also noted that  Intel believes "the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace," and that "[t]here has been absolutely zero harm to consumers."  Intel has also publicly asserted that the Commission has
ignored certain exculpatory evidence. Key Implications of Decision The key implications of the decision will become more apparent once the Commission's full decision is published and the specific factual and legal conclusions are revealed. Nevertheless, the Commission's announcement indicates that the decision is likely to raise several important and controversial questions for business. Effects-based or Formalistic Approach? While the Commission indicated that it did not apply its 2008 Article 82 Guidance Paper in this case because proceedings were initiated before it was issued, the Commission did note that the decision
is "in line with the orientations set out" in the paper, and "includes a rigorous, effects-based analysis." The materials released to date, however, offer little insight or detail on the broader economic impact of  Intel's alleged conduct on either rivals or customers. For instance, while the announcement provides several examples of conditional rebates with major computer manufacturers and some general statements about how AMD was deprived of sales opportunities, and customers were deprived of the opportunity to choose AMD products in those situations, there is no discussion of the proportion of the relevant markets from which AMD was purportedly foreclosed, how these arrangements increased AMD's costs, or how they resulted in higher prices for customers or prevented AMD from competing effectively for new sales opportunities. Unless the full decision provides a more comprehensive economic assessment of the actual impact on rivals' ability to compete in the market, it may give the impression that it relies on a formalistic approach, in which a violation of EC law requires nothing more than demonstrating that an equally efficient rival has been impaired from certain opportunities. "Conditional" Nature of Rebates and De Facto Exclusivity? The Commission's press release notes that it "obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the  antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in  Intel's contracts." The Commission purports to have found this proof in evidence it collected during its investigation, including e-mails, responses to its requests for information, and statements made by the other companies.  Intel has denied in U.S. court filings that it entered into any "exclusive dealing" arrangements. It contends that such a condition cannot be inferred since it has not (i) entered into any
long-term exclusivity provisions in its contracts or (ii) coerced exclusivity by refusing to deal with customers that purchase from AMD. It claims to have simply won the competitive battle to persuade customers to buy more of its products by offering ordinary discounts based on the volume of orders. It remains to be seen what specific evidence the Commission relied on to determine that  Intel's rebates were "conditioned" on customers' buying fewer of AMD's products, or not buying them at all. Businesses will need to take note of what conduct may give rise to an inference of a de facto exclusive dealing arrangement. Exclusionary Foreclosure from Above-cost Pricing? Interestingly, the Commission appears to have abandoned the claim made in its initial Statement of Objections in July 2007 that  Intel engaged in below-cost pricing to strategic customers in the server segment of the market. Instead, the Commission has concluded that  Intel's pricing practices would have required an equally efficient competitor to sell below its costs. This conclusion also may have important implications for compliance with EU law. It suggests that the Commission has found
Page 164 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel's prices to be predatorily low or exclusionary by attributing the monetary value of the discounts  Intel offered for the "uncontestable" or "must carry" portion of demand for its products to the "contestable" portion, and then asking whether  Intel's prices for the contestable portion are below cost or likely to limit a competitor's ability to compete effectively at a minimum level of scale. This theory of harm is discussed in the Guidance Paper, as well as a 2005 Staff Discussion Paper. Notably, although this approach is similar to that adopted by the Peacehealth decision, and endorsed as a safe harbor by the Section 2 Report issued by the U.S.  Antitrust Division under the Bush administration, for evaluating bundled rebates where multiple products are involved, its use to evaluate single-product loyalty discounts has been criticized by some commentators and in the Section 2 report. (The  Antitrust Division under the Obama administration has recently withdrawn this report). The primary complaint has been that it may be difficult for firms to follow such a rule and for courts and  antitrust agencies to enforce it consistently, as it requires making
complex decisions and judgments about what portion of demand is contestable and what minimum level of scale competing firms need to compete effectively. Thus, to the extent the Commission's decision embraces this economic theory of harm, firms with leading market positions seeking to avoid future liability under EU competition law may need to undertake a complex legal and economic analysis before implementing a rebate or discount program to ensure that they are not running afoul of the law. Convergence or Divergence of EU and U.S. Law? The resolution of these issues will also reveal whether Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Section 2 of the Sherman Act are applied in a consistent manner. Whether there is convergence or divergence will also depend on (a) the outcome of  Intel's appeal of the Commission's decision; (b) the outcome of pending U.S. litigation and agency investigations regarding Intel's practices; and (c) whether the U.S.  antitrust agencies under the Obama administration are successful in their stated efforts to enforce Section 2 of the Sherman Act more aggressively than their predecessors. Prior U.S. courts that have examined the use of single-product loyalty discounts have generally rejected attempts to find above-cost pricing conduct anticompetitive in the absence of express or de facto exclusive dealing arrangements. At the same time, exclusive dealing arrangements that foreclose competitors have been found to violate both EU and U.S. law. It remains to be seen whether U.S. courts and enforcement agencies will agree with the Commission's assessment of  Intel's conduct.| Extraterritorial Reach of EU  Competition Law? The Commission's announcement indicated that the decision will oblige Intel "not to engage in any abusive practices that have an effect within the European Economic Area (EEA)." A significant percentage of  Intel's production and direct sales of microprocessors likely takes
place entirely outside the EU. The Commission's announcement did not provide details on whether it seeks to modify  Intel's contracts and course of dealing with OEMs and other customers that are executed and implemented entirely outside of the EEA. Notably, the Korean and Japan enforcement actions
involving Intel were focused on altering the conditions under which  Intel does business with OEMs located in those countries. Moreover, AMD's damage claims against  Intel that related to non-U.S. sales of microprocessors were dismissed in the ongoing U.S. litigation. Depending on the breadth of the EC's remedy in this case, there may be some concern among the international  antitrust community that the EU is attempting to unilaterally assert its legal standards and jurisdiction over conduct that only has indirect or spill-over effects on trade within the European Community (i.e.,on downstream sales by OEMs of PCs that incorporate Intel products).

The European Commission ruled that U.S.-based computer chip maker  Intel violated European competition law by providing discounts to computer manufacturers on the condition that they buy all or almost all their needs from  Intel. The Department of Justice withdrew a controversial report on monopolization issued toward the end of the previous administration, signaling a shift in policy and enforcement priorities.

Other recent  antitrust developments of note included a decision by a district court applying the Supreme Court's ruling that resale price maintenance arrangements must be judged under the rule of reason and new legislation in Maryland providing that resale price maintenance is unlawful per se under the state's  antitrust law.

TD
Abuse of Dominance

The European Commission (EC) imposed a fine of €1.06 billion (around $1.45 billion) on  Intel Corporation, the world's leading producer of microprocessor chips used in personal computers, for using its dominant market position to exclude its main competitor from the market in violation of Article
82 of the European Treaty.

The EC stated that  Intel, which held about 70 percent of the relevant market, abused its dominant position by offering rebates to major computer manufacturers on the condition that they purchase all or close to all of their chips from  Intel. For example, the commission reported that  Intel gave rebates to a particular computer manufacturer conditioned on the purchase of no less than 95 percent of that manufacturer's needs for business desktop computer chips from  Intel.

The commission added that  Intel's dominant position in the market, whereby only a small portion of a given manufacturer's needs is open to  competition, made the use of such loyalty rebates unlawful.

The EC also noted that  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to postpone or cancel the launch of computers incorporating its principal rival's chips and concluded that  Intel deliberately acted to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips for more than five years.
The commission asserted that it does not seek to protect competitors instead of consumers and that
Intel's loyalty discounts harmed  competition by stifling innovation and limiting consumer choice.

Commission imposes fine of 1.06 bn on  Intel for abuse of dominant position; orders  Intel to cease illegal practices, IP/09/745 (May 13, 2009), available at ec.europa. eu/competition/
Comment: Of the handful of U.S. courts that have examined the issue, most concluded that
single-product loyalty discounts did not violate §2 of the Sherman Act as long as the discounts did not
bring the total price on all units sold below the dominant firm's costs. In contrast, the EC's analysis in
the decision reported immediately above focused on whether an equally efficient rival would have to sell
below its own costs to meet the dominant firm's discounts.

Monopolization

The Department of Justice announced the withdrawal of a report on monopoly law issued by the prior administration in September 2008 under the title "Competition and Monopoly: Single-Firm Conduct Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act." The Federal Trade Commission did not sign on to that report despite its participation in the hearings that led to its publication and several commissioners criticized the report at the time. The department stated that the withdrawal indicates a shift in philosophy and that the department will aggressively now pursue monopolization cases.

Justice Department Withdraws Report on  Antitrust Monopoly Law (May 11, 2009) available at www.usdoj.gov/atr

Comment: The withdrawal of the  monopoly law report may indicate the end of an era. But the report itself need not be discarded even if it is no longer representative of official policy, as it contains a thorough and expansive review of judicial and scholarly analysis of single-product loyalty discounts at issue in the EC's  Intel decision, including discussion of the possibility that, in some cases, abovecost loyalty discounts may lead to anticompetitive effects.
Resale Price Maintenance

On remand from the Supreme Court's 2007 decision PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc, which abandoned per se condemnation of minimum resale price maintenance in favor of rule of reason analysis of such vertical price-fixing agreements, a district court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failing to allege a tenable definition of the relevant product market. The court rejected the plaintiff's first proposed product market—the retail market for the defendant's brand of women's accessories—because, absent exceptional circumstances, one brand in a market of competing brands could not constitute a relevant product market.

The plaintiff's alternate market definition—the wholesale sale of brand-name women's accessories to independent retailers—was also rejected for failing to allege facts addressing the interchangeability of "brand name" accessories with other accessories or the relevance to consumer substitution of whether the sale of such accessories occurs through independent or national retailers. The court also stated that the term "women's accessories" improperly groups together products that are not interchangeable with each other, such as handbags, shoes and jewelry.
PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc., 2009-1 CCH Trade Cases ¶76,592 (E.D. Tex.) The state of Maryland recently passed a law in reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in Leegin.
Effective Oct. 1, 2009, Maryland's amended  Antitrust Act provides that an agreement establishing a
minimum resale price for retailers, wholesalers or distributors is an unreasonable restraint of trade. By
so defining such agreements, the law is intended to preclude arguments that certain resale price
maintenance arrangements are reasonable or not per se unlawful.

Conspiracy Pleadings

Manufacturers of chocolate candy bars and other chocolate confectionary sought to dismiss a complaint alleging that they conspired to fix prices in violation of federal and state  antitrust laws. A district court denied the motion and rejected the defendants' argument that the pleadings merely alleged parallel conduct that was insufficient to state a claim under the Supreme Court's 2007 decision Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544 (2007)). The court stated that allegations of three coordinated price increases between 2002 and 2007 in a market where input costs were stable while demand declined, along with alleged anticompetitive conduct in Canada, rendered the pleadings of concerted action plausible.

The court certified an interlocutory appeal of the order denying the motion to dismiss because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had not yet applied Twombly in an  antitrust context and issues involving the interpretation of Twombly's pleading standard could effectively pass beyond the reach of appellate review.

The Department of Justice announced the settlement of charges that a Columbia, S.C., real estate multiple listing service (MLS) unreasonably restrained trade by requiring applicants for membership to forgo innovative low-price business models. According to the department's complaint, the MLS reserved the power to deny membership to real estate brokers who seem to be planning to compete too aggressively. The proposed consent decree provides that any licensed broker may become a member
of the MLS and that members may provide less than a full set of brokerage services at a lower price.

Retailer Termination

The owner of antique and faux antique furniture stores in Water Mill and Bridgehampton, N.Y., claimed that a furniture manufacturer stopped supplying the stores at the behest of a larger retailer in violation of
§1 of the Sherman Act. A district court dismissed the complaint for failing to plead an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market. The court stated that the fact that consumers will no longer be able to buy the manufacturer's faux antique furniture from the plaintiff or even other small retailers does not amount to an injury to  competition as a whole.
Habitat, Ltd. v. The Art of the Muse, Inc., 2009-1 CCH Trade Cases 76,573 (E.D.N.Y.) Joint Venture
The Attorney General of Arizona sought a restraining order to prevent the closing of one of Tucson's two daily newspapers on  antitrust grounds because the newspaper's owner also held a financial interest in the other local paper through its participation in a joint operating agreement (JOA). Under the JOA, news and editorial departments were operated separately but all other aspects, including advertising, circulation and printing were run by a jointly owned firm.

The district court rejected the state's motion because it did not demonstrate a likelihood of success. The court noted that under the Newspaper Preservation Act, a newspaper that is party to a joint operating agreement can be closed lawfully if one of the newspapers, run independently, would be a failing company and there are no buyers for that newspaper. The court stated that the closed newspaper
would satisfy the failing company test.

The court added that the newspaper did not cease publication until after the Department of Justice closed a lengthy investigation of the newspaper's anticipated closure.
Arizona v. Gannett Co., No. 4:09-CV-0281-TVC-RCC (D. Ariz. May 18, 2009) Information Exchanges
The Israeli  Antitrust Authority ruled that the country's five largest banks violated the Restrictive Trade Practices Law by exchanging information regarding present and future bank fees charged to customers. The authority stated that the exchanges facilitated the coordination of prices and hindered the competitive process.

The authority also noted that its decision can be used as evidence of the existence of a restrictive arrangement in civil suits for the recovery of damages.

Antitrust Injury

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided that a plaintiff alleging anticompetitive conduct in the animal testing services industry lacked standing to bring  antitrust claims. The Court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment and stated that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence demonstrating that it was either an actual competitor in the market or had the requisite "intent and preparedness" to enter the market. The Court noted that the plaintiff did not conduct appropriate tests of its products, obtain financing or enter into contracts, as would be expected from a business that is ready to enter the marketplace.

HD      The European Commission strikes  again

LP
On May 13, 2009, the  European Commission fined Intel just over 1bn Euros for its supposed  abuse of its dominant market position in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty. That decision marks yet another effort by Commissioner Neelie Kroes to ratchet up the enforcement of EC  competition policy, all in the name of preventing consumer harm. Yet the devil lies in this one detail. The aggrieved "consumer" of Intel is its long-time junior rival, AMD, which filed three separate complaints against  Intel between 2000 and 2006.

TD
It is not just happenstance that one American company decided to pursue another American company in Europe. During those years, the Bush administration kept - wisely in my view - a tight lid on monopolisation cases brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the parallel provision to Article 82. Yet recently, that commendable restraint has gone by the boards, as the new US Assistant Attorney General for  Antitrust, Christine Varney, unceremoniously dumped the Bush 2008 Report on Single Firm
Conduct in a speech given two days before the  Intel decision came down, which I have already criticised elsewhere.

We now face the grim possibility that disappointed competitors will be able to wage routinely a two-front war against any dominant firm. But for what purpose? Defining consumer harm in Article 92 cases is always elusive. In this instance, the EC wisely refrains from asserting that offering low prices themselves constitute an illegal competitive practice. Indeed, these low prices count as an immediate and unambiguous consumer benefit, which at the very least has to be set off against any alleged harm by Intel. Indeed it would be catastrophic if a dominant firm could avoid legal sanctions only by ceding market share to its rivals.

So, if the dominant firm may compete on price, what additional ingredient is needed to make its unilateral conduct illegal? One suspect practice is to keep its rebates secret. But secrecy has its economic virtues. Large chip manufacturers, like large drug companies, face a daunting challenge in bringing new products to market. A new chip design costs billions. Any effort therefore to charge only the marginal cost for each unit has to fail, because it would not allow any firm, dominant or otherwise, to recoup its initial costs over the life of the new product.

Each producer, therefore, has to figure out how to price its goods to various customers in ways that will allow it, bit by bit, to recover those high fixed costs before the chip is obsolete. Making public the price to any individual customer will spur its rivals to clamour for the same deal, so that in the end  Intel, or any other firm, will be reluctant to make a concessions on one account if it knows it has to give the same break to everyone else. Secrecy allows a firm to cut different deals with different firms in different market niches. Prices therefore trend lower. The absence of parity across the deals simply reflects the relative bargaining position of the various firms. It does not indicate an  abuse of market power.

If secrecy doesn't do it, then what about exclusivity? Here the EC denounced  Intel for conditioning its sales on the willingness of buyers to purchase anywhere from 80 to 100 percent of its products from  Intel. The EC makes the odd observation that this practice will inhibit new firms from coming into the market. Trouble is, no matter what pricing policies  Intel adopts, for the foreseeable future its only rival is AMD.

What really matters therefore is how these exclusives operate in a duopoly. In this context, one immediate consumer benefit is that  Intel will have to pay its customers to gain an exclusive, which again translates into lower short-term prices. In addition,  Intel is likely to experience some real pushback from

Page 171 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
key customers, precisely because they want to play off  Intel against AMD. Indeed some customers might give AMD an exclusive to stay out of  Intel's clutches. After all, AMD as the nondominant firm is free to offer whatever deal it likes.

The overall mix of gains and losses therefore is highly complex. Yet the EC has offered no global analysis of the  Intel / AMD dispute that explains why it should initiate costly proceedings that don't produce any clear social gain. From this vantage point, it looks as though its latest regulatory caper has a negative expected return. Let's just hope that Ms Varney does not try to outdo Ms Kroes in her misguided crusade. On  competition policy, populist outcries are usually harmful to consumer welfare, on both sides of the Atlantic.

By Georgina Prodhan

LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) -  Intel , the world's biggest chipmaker, expects second-half demand to be lower than it was a year earlier, despite a forecast return to normal demand patterns that should see an improvement from the first half.

"For sure," Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters on Thursday when asked whether levels would be below those of last year. "We've seen a lot of demand destruction as a result of this downturn."

The second half of the year is typically stronger for chipmakers and the electronics companies they supply, due to the back-to-school season in August and September and the Christmas holiday in December.

Smith said in an interview that utilisation of  Intel's factory capacity, which fell to a historic low of 40 percent on average in the first quarter, should return to "healthy" levels of a little below 80 percent in the second half.

"Eighty to 85 percent is the optimum, but if you assume that at a little less than that you're getting into the healthy range, I think we'll be back in that healthy range by the time we get to the second half of this year," he said.

Smith said depressed company valuations could spur  Intel to make more acquisitions than before, but that the company's strategy of the last decade of buying small firms attractive for their intellectual property would not change.

He added that  Intel was still talking to the European Commission about how and when it would pay the record 1.06 billion euro ($1.47 billion) fine the body imposed for  antitrust violations, but would probably take the charge this quarter.
"Everything that I've seen so far would say we'll take the charge in the second quarter," he said. "We're going through the discussion with (the Commission) about the implications, we're reading
through the document, and from that we'll figure out what business practices, if any, we have to
change and how we go about changing them," he added.

Smith said he was happy with the amount of cash  Intel had, even though it might be seen as conservative. The company had a cash balance of a little over $10 billion in the first quarter.

"In the kind of uncertain economic climate that we're in it's reasonable to carry a bit of cash, and I'm at a level that I'm not uncomfortable with," he said.

FOUNDRY PLANS

Asked about possible interest in a partnership or buying a stake in SMIC , China's biggest contract chip maker, Smith said: "In terms of buying SMIC or something like that? We don't talk about future potential acquisitions or partnerships."

"That being said, I don't have ambitions to be a broad foundry player. I don't think that necessarily is a business model that is in my short-term plans."
Chinese media have reported that loss-making SMIC has talked with  Intel and Singapore's Charted
Semiconductor about stake sales.

Smith said  Intel might however be interested in expanding a kind of quasi-custom manufacturing it currently does through an alliance with top contact chipmaker TSMC .

The deal involves TSMC's building chips based on  Intel core processors with technology from other TSMC customers surrounding the core. "I think we'll see over the next year or two how that plays out," Smith said.

"It's also possible that over time we can use our manufacturing capacity to do these kinds of semi-custom devices for people, where it's a combination of their intellectual property and our intellectual property." (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Erica Billingham)

EC SLAMS  INTEL WITH €1 BILLION  FINE

The European Commission ("EC") imposed a €1.06 billion  fine on US-based chipmaker  Intel for abuses of dominant position. This is the highest individual  fine ever imposed by the EC.  Intel said it would appeal the decision.

TD
Intel Fined For Abuses Of Dominance

Intel is the world's largest producer of x86 central processing units ("CPUs"), the main hardware component of a computer. From 2000 onwards, Intel's main rival Advanced Micro Devices ("AMD") has submitted several complaints to the EC regarding Intel's business strategies. AMD argued that  Intel engaged in illegal practices aimed at excluding AMD from the market for x86 CPUs.

Following a nine-year long investigation, the EC concluded that  Intel has abused its dominant position in the market for x86 CPUs. The EC found that  Intel had offered loyalty rebates to computer manufacturers, i.e. rebates that were conditional on the manufacturers purchasing all, or almost all, of their CPU requirements from  Intel. Intel had also made payments to retailer MediaMarkt on condition that MediaMarkt stores stocked only computers containing  Intel x86 CPUs. Finally,  Intel had made payments
to computer manufacturers to delay the launch of certain products that incorporated AMD's CPUs ("pay for delay").

The EC emphasised that it did not object to the rebates per se, but to the conditions  Intel attached to its rebates. According to the EC , rebates are abusive if offered by a dominant firm and made conditional on buying less (or none) of a rival's products, unless specific reasons justify such rebates.

The Highest Fine Ever Imposed By The EC The EC fined Intel €1.06 billion (approx. $1.45 billion). This record-breaking fine exceeds each of the three fines imposed by the EC on Microsoft from 2004 to 2008 for abuses of dominance and for failure to comply with the EC 's orders (although the total of the  fines imposed on Microsoft amounts to €1.68 billion). It also exceeds the record cartel  fine of €896 million imposed by the EC in 2008 on the French group Saint-Gobain. The  fine represents 4.15% of  Intel's 2008 worldwide revenues. The EC can impose  fines of up to 10% of the company's worldwide annual revenues. The EC has also ordered  Intel to cease all ongoing illegal practices immediately. Intel had previously been ordered by the Japanese regulator to discontinue its loyalty rebates and was fined $25 million by the Korean regulator for similar practices. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General's Office have recently opened investigations into  Intel's pricing strategies. Moreover, AMD is suing  Intel before U.S. federal courts. The Crackdown On Abuses Of Dominance Will Continue The  Intel investigation and the resulting record  fine is the latest example of the EC 's focus on the enforcement of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abuses of dominance. The EC has been emboldened by several recent cases in which EU courts have confirmed its interpretation of Article 82 (cf. France Telecom ruling summarised in See You in Court). It has issued detailed guidelines on the
application of Article 82 and is currently conducting other high-profile investigations into alleged abuses of dominance (including new inquiries into Microsoft's practices, described in EU Developments). Rebate practices, such as the ones involved in the  Intel case, are but one of many types of commercial behaviour that could potentially raise concerns. Given this environment, it is essential for leading market players to carefully consider the manner in which they deal with their suppliers, distributors, customers, and competitors. EU DEVELOPMENTS Regulators To Review Pharmaceutical Mergers U.S. pharmaceutical

group Pfizer has recently agreed to buy its rival Wyeth for $68 billion, while drug manufacturer Merck has announced a $41 billion merger with Schering-Plough. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC ") is reviewing both transactions and has issued a second request to Pfizer. Both transactions are also subject to approval by the EC and by several other  antitrust authorities. The EC has extensive experience in reviewing pharmaceutical mergers and is expected to work in close cooperation with the FTC . The deals are scheduled to close by the end of the year. * Fried Frank provides on-going advice to Merck in relation
to its merger with Schering-Plough. EC Challenges Microsoft's Tying Practices The EC sent a statement of objections to Microsoft relating to the tying of Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer to the Windows
PC operating system. Microsoft is dominant in the supply of PC operating systems, with a global market share of over 90%. The EC argues that by tying Internet Explorer to Windows, Microsoft provides its web browser with an unfair advantage over competitors. If these preliminary findings are confirmed, the EC
may order Microsoft to offer customers a choice of browsers (Microsoft already allows Windows 7 users to remove Internet Explorer and to use other browsers). It may also impose a significant  fine on Microsoft. The EC is also currently investigating Microsoft's alleged failure to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of software products, including its Office suite and the .NET Network. Several competitors, including Google and Mozilla, have reportedly joined the investigations and testified against Microsoft. The EC has previously  finedMicrosoft a total of €1.68 billion for the tying of Windows Media Player to Windows, restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft work group servers, and failing to comply with the EC 's injunctions. In 2007, the EU Court of First Instance rejected Microsoft's appeal against the EC 's decision. Mastercard Reduces Its Multilateral Interchange Fees The interchange fee is charged by the consumer's bank to the retailer's bank whenever a consumer pays a retailer using a credit or debit card. The interchange fee is usually passed on by the retailer's bank to the retailer. In December 2007, the EC found that MasterCard's cross-border multilateral interchange fees were anti-competitive because they inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers without leading to proven efficiencies. The EC ordered MasterCard to phase out these fees. In April 2009, following intense negotiations, MasterCard accepted to reduce its interchange fees and to enhance the transparency of its payment card schemes. According to the EC , MasterCard's new fees will be the lowest in the world for credit and debit card transactions. These undertakings will apply while MasterCard's appeal against the
EC 's 2007 decision is pending before the Court of First Instance. The EC is currently investigating Visa's multilateral interchange fees and recently issued a statement of objections in which it argues that Visa's fees are also anti-competitive. EC Investigates Airline Alliances The EC is investigating two airline alliances: Star Alliance (Lufthansa, United, Continental, Air Canada) and Oneworld (British Airways, American Airlines, Iberia). The investigations focus on the cooperation between airlines on transatlantic routes. The EC is concerned by the parties' plans to jointly manage sales, schedules, capacity and pricing, and to share revenues on these routes. British Airways and American Airlines had previously abandoned alliance plans in 1997 and 2001 after regulators required them to divest a large number of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, in order to limit the parties' combined market power. The parties argue that this time divestments should not be required, given, in particular, the "open skies" agreement that has liberalised transatlantic flights. RWE To Divest Gas Transmission Network The EC has accepted RWE 's commitment to divest its west German gas transmission network, and has closed its investigation into
RWE 's alleged abuses of dominance. The EC 's investigation was launched in 2006 as a follow-up to its energy sector inquiry. The EC was concerned that RWE , the second-largest energy group in Germany behind E.ON, had denied rivals access to its infrastructure and imposed unfair transmission tariffs. Last year the EC closed an investigation into E.ON's conduct in the German electricity market after E.ON agreed to divest its extra-high-voltage transmission system and some of its generation capacity. The EC is also investigating the activities of several other European energy groups. It has issued statements of objections to French EDF relating to EDF 's electricity supply agreements, and to Italian ENI regarding the operation of ENI's gas transmission network.  COMPETITION COMMISSION ORDERS BAA TO SELL THREE AIRPORTS The UK's Competition Commission ("CC") found that BAA's common ownership of
seven British airports impeded competition. The CC ordered BAA to divest Gatwick, Stansted, and one of its airports in Scotland (either Edinburgh or Glasgow). The remedies are particularly severe given that BAA was not found guilty of any specific  antitrust violation. CC criticises BAA's common ownership of airports BAA Limited is the successor of the State-operated British Airports Authority, which was privatised in
1987. BA owns and operates four airports which account for 90% of airport passengers in southeast England (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton). It also owns and operates three airports which account for 84% of airport passengers in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen). In July 2006, a consortium led by the Spanish building group Ferrovial acquired BA for £10.1 billion. In June 2006, the Office of Fair Trading ("OFT ") launched a market study of UK airports. The study was triggered by complaints made both by airlines and by passenger groups. In March 2007, after finding that the lack of competition between BAA 's airport could lead to higher charges and higher costs, the OFT made a market investigation reference to the CC under the Enterprise Act 2002. The CC 's remit in the context of a market investigation is very broad: the CC may impose remedies, including divestitures, if it considers that certain market features prevent, restrict or distort  competition in the UK . The CC 's inquiry focuses on
the structure of the market rather than on specific anti-competitive practices, such as cartels or abuses of dominance. Following a two-year long investigation, the CC published its final report in March 2009. The CC found that BAA 's common ownership prevented  competition between Glasgow and Edinburgh
Page 176 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
airports: both airports had spare capacity but did not compete against each other for airline businesses. The CC further considered that BAA had no effective longterm infrastructure strategy and did not seek to develop new runway capacity in the London area. While acknowledging that Government policies (e.g., delays in approving a third runway at Heathrow) have contributed to existing capacity constraints, the CC argued that primary responsibility lay with BAA . In particular, the CC argued that if London airports were owned by separate owners, competitors would have taken advantage of capacity constraints at Heathrow in order to divert business from Heathrow and gain market shares. Capacity constraints and lack of competition between airports hurt both airlines and passengers. ...and orders the break-up of BAA The CC ordered BAA to sell both Gatwick and Stansted, as well as either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports. BAA must sell all three airports within two years, beginning with Gatwick, then Stansted, and finally one of the
Scottish airports. While  antitrust regulators frequently impose divestments in merger cases, this is the first time that the CC has ordered a break-up of a company outside of the merger control context. The CC also imposed certain behavioural undertakings on BAA with respect to Aberdeen Airport. It has recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority strengthens its consultation processes in relation to Heathrow, the UK 's only hub airport. Finally, in order to promote effective  competition between airports, the CC is advocating
a reform of airport regulation. BAA initiated the sale of Gatwick in September 2008, prior to the release of the CC 's final report. However, BAA has also appealed the CC 's report before the  Competition Appeal Tribunal. BA argues that the CC failed to take into account the adverse financial impact of its report, in particular by requiring BAA to sell three airports in the current financial and economic circumstances. It also complains that one of the members of the CC 's panel has links to an organisation interested in acquiring the airports. SEE YOU IN COURT Landmark ruling on predatory pricing In 2003, the EC imposed a fine of €10.4 million on Wanadoo Interactive, then a subsidiary of France Telecom, for predatory pricing. The EC found that Wanadoo set prices below costs, deliberately sacrificing profitability in order to drive competitors out of the ADSL market. In 2007, the Court of First Instance ("CFI ") upheld this decision and France Telecom appealed this ruling before the European Court of Justice ("EC J"). France Telecom argued that Wanadoo had charged low prices in response to aggressive pricing by other ADSL service providers and could not recoup the losses suffered as a result of this price war. In April
2009, the EC J rejected France Telecom's appeal. The EC J ruled that predatory pricing was abusive even if the dominant firm was not likely to recoup the losses resulting from pricing below costs. The EC J also reiterated that a dominant firm does not have an absolute right to align its prices to those of its
competitors. This ruling is at odds with the approach adopted in the U.S., where the recoupment test is used to distinguish abusive predatory pricing from healthy price  competition. CFI reduces Nintendo's parallel trade fine by €30 million In 2002, the EC  fined Nintendo €149 million for hindering parallel imports of its game cartridges and computer consoles. The EC also  fined seven of Nintendo's distributors a total
of €18.8 million. Nintendo and two of its distributors appealed the EC 's decision before the CFI . In April
2009, the CFI reduced Nintendo's  fine by €30 million. The Court found that both Nintendo and one of its
distributors (John Menzies plc) had cooperated in the investigation (e.g. by providing incriminating
documents to the EC ). In exchange for this cooperation, the EC had reduced the fines imposed on
Nintendo and John Menzies. However, while the EC had reduced the distributor's fine by 40%, Nintendo's
fine had been reduced by only 25%. The Court ruled that the EC had therefore violated the principle of
equal treatment and that Nintendo's  fine should be reduced by a further €30 million to match the reduction
offered to John Menzies. Advocate General supports the EC's appeal in the Schneider case In 2001, the
EC prohibited the acquisition of the French industrial group Legrand by its rival Schneider Electric. This
decision was later annulled by the CFI but the EC reopened the investigation. As a result, Schneider
abandoned the deal and sold Legrand to the consortium formed by Wendel and KKR at a reduced price.
Schneider then sued the EC before the CFI claiming damages of €1.7 billion. In 2007, the CFI ruled that
the EC should compensate Schneider for the loss suffered as a result of selling Legrand. The EC
appealed the CFI ruling before the EC J. The Court's Advocate General Ruiz- Jarabo has recently issued
an advisory opinion in which he argues that the CFI 's ruling should be set aside. The Advocate General
argues that Schneider itself was ultimately responsible for the loss it incurred when it sold Legrand.
According to the Advocate General, Schneider could have avoided this loss, e.g., by exercising its option
to terminate the sales agreement with Wendel/KKR . British Airways fights of a "class action" The
Chancellor of the UK 's High Court dismissed a claim brought against British Airways ("BA ") on behalf of a
broad group of air-freight customers. The claimants, two flower importers, sued BA for damages resulting
from BA 's alleged involvement in an illegal agreement to fix prices for air-freight services. The claim was
brought on behalf of the claimants and of all other direct and indirect customers that have purchased
air-freight services at inflated prices. The Chancellor allowed the claimants to sue BA on their own behalf
but ruled that the representative element of the claim should be struck out, because it was impossible to
identify the members of the class unless and until the action was successful. The Chancellor also noted
that conflicts would inevitably arise between the claims of different members of the class, e.g. between
those that had absorbed higher air freight prices and those that had passed on the inflated prices to their
own customers. This judgment illustrates the difficulty of bringing an opt-out "class action" before UK
courts. An  antitrust class action is a lawsuit brought on behalf of the victims of an  antitrust violation
without the express consent of each of the victims (defendants can "opt out" of the class action). Both UK
and EU authorities are debating legislative proposals aimed at facilitating  antitrust class actions. German
Supreme Court allows a claim against cement manufacturers to proceed The German Supreme Court
Page 177 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ruled that a suit brought by Cartel Damage Claims ("CDC "), claiming antitrust damages against six cement companies was admissible. In 2003, the defendants had been fined a total of €660 million by the German Federal Cartel Office for operating a price-fixing cartel. CDC , a Brussels-based company specialised in antitrust litigation, purchased damages claims from 36 alleged victims of the cement cartel, and sued cartel members on its own behalf (according to CDC 's press release, the claim is for €170 million). The Supreme Court confirmed that CDC could use this procedural device as a substitute for a class action, which is not permitted under German law. The case will now proceed before the Düsseldorf district court. CDC has also recently purchased damages claims from 32 alleged victims of a price-fixing cartel between hydrogen peroxide manufacturers (CDC believes that the combined claim represents around €430 million plus interest). High Court allows extradition of a UK citizen to the U.S. The UK 's High Court dismissed an appeal by Ian Norris against a ruling of a District Judge and an order of the Secretary of State that Mr Norris should be extradited to the U.S.. Mr Norris is the former chief executive of Morgan Crucible, a UK manufacturer of carbon and ceramic products. The U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition in connection with two charges: Mr Norris is accused of having participated in a conspiracy to
fix carbon prices and of having obstructed the investigation into the alleged cartel. Last year, the House of Lords ruled that Mr Norris could not be extradited for price-fixing because cartels did not constitute a criminal offence in the UK at the time of the alleged misconduct (before 2003). However, the High Court has now ruled that Mr Norris should be extradited to face the obstruction of justice charges. Mr Norris can still halt the extradition process by bringing an action before the European Court of Human Rights. GERMAN MERGER CONTROL: HIGHER THRESHOLDS BUT TOUGHER GUN-JUMPING PENALTIES Two recent developments have reshaped the German merger control regime. First, the legislator has introduced an additional notification threshold, which is expected to reduce the number of merger filings by one third. Second, the German Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") has imposed significant  fines on two companies that tried to circumvent German merger control rules. New notification threshold should lead to fewer filings In March 2009, Germany amended its jurisdictional thresholds for merger filings. Previously, companies were required to notify a deal to the FCO if the parties' combined worldwide sales exceeded
€500 million and if one of the parties had German sales in excess of €25 million. As a result, a transaction could be reportable in Germany merely because the buyer was a large global corporation with German sales of more than €25 million (even if the target had negligible domestic activities). The 2009 amendment maintained the €500 million and the €25 million thresholds, but added the requirement that one other party to the transaction must have sales in Germany in excess of €5 million. Consequently, a transaction which consists of an acquisition by a large international company with a substantial presence in Germany of a business with German sales of less than €5 million would no longer be reportable to the FCO. The amendment brings Germany's rules in line with the approach advocated by the OECD and other international advisory bodies. The new legislation is expected to reduce the number of merger filings in Germany by approximately one third (more than 2,300 merger filings submitted in Germany in 2007). The change is also likely to render less relevant the "domestic effect" doctrine, which in the past provided an exemption from the filing obligation when the target company was not active in Germany. Two record
fines for violation of merger control rules In December 2008, the FCO imposed a record-breaking €4.5 million fine on U.S.-based Mars for closing the acquisition of U.S. animal feed producer Nutro Products before obtaining German clearance. Mars had made merger control filings with the U.S., German, and Austrian  competition authorities. The U.S. agency let the waiting period expire but the FCO opened an indepth investigation (the Austrian investigation was also ongoing). Mars then decided to close the transaction and integrate Nutro, with the exception of Nutro's German and Austrian businesses. However, the FCO found that the carve-out of Nutro's German activities was not sufficient, and that the transfer of Nutro's foreign production facilities and global trademarks violated the stand-still obligation (i.e., the duty not to close the transaction before obtaining German clearance). The FCO noted that the  fine would have been even higher if Mars had not actively cooperated in divesting Nutro's German business. Two months later, the FCO  fined German publisher Druck und Verlagshaus ("DuV") €4.13 million for failing to notify DuV's acquisition of the rival publishing house Frankfurter Stadtanzeiger. The acquisition took place in
2001 but the FCO became aware of it only in 2009 while reviewing another transaction. The FCO found that DuV had deliberately concealed the transaction by way of a trustee arrangement. Moreover, DuV had significant sales and market shares in the affected markets. These cases illustrate the FCO 's willingness
to impose heavy penalties on companies that disregard German merger control rules. The Mars precedent would also make it more difficult for the merging parties to implement carve-out arrangements. Note: Part one is a shortened version of the article by Fried Frank attorney T. Caspary, "The German Parliament Introduces Second Domestic Turnover Threshold for Mergers", e-Competitions, 25 March 2009, n°25683. German merger control in a nutshell: Reportable transactions: a filing is required if the transaction meets the notification thresholds (see below) and the buyer acquires (i) control over the target, (ii) a stake of 25% or more or 50% or more in the target, or (iii) competitively significant influence over the target. Notification thresholds: the parties' combined worldwide revenues exceed €500m, German revenues of at least one party exceed €25m, and German revenues of another party exceed €5m. Deadlines: Phase 1 review is
one month; Phase 2 review is three additional months. Stand-still obligation: if the transaction is reportable in Germany, the parties must not close it before obtaining the FCO 's clearance. NATIONAL UPDATE UK : Competition Commission Blocks Video-On-Demand JV The CC has blocked a video-on-demand joint venture between UK TV operators BBC Worldwide, Channel Four and ITV . The joint venture, referred to
Page 178 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
as "Project Kangaroo", would have combined the parties' catalogues to create a website of UK TV content accessible on demand. The CC found that the parties controlled the vast majority of the programmes produced and first aired in the UK . Post-transaction the parties could have charged higher prices to both wholesale customers and end-users. France: steel traders  fined €575 million The French  Competition Council has imposed fines of €575 million on 11 steel traders for operating a price-fixing cartel between
1999 and 2004. This is the largest cartel  fine ever imposed by the French regulator. Three subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal were  fined a total of €301 million. Other cartel participants included German group Kloeckner and French trader Descours & Cabaud. The investigation began in 2004 after several customers complained about suspiciously similar bids received from different traders. Descours & Cabaud applied for leniency while two other parties acknowledged their involvement in the cartel in exchange for a reduction
in fines. France: Orange Ordered To Give Up iPhone Exclusivity In 2007, Apple agreed that France Telecom's subsidiary Orange would act as the iPhone exclusive wholesaler and network operator in France. Following a complaint filed by Bouygues Telecom, the French  Competition Council issued an interim decision finding that the arrangement was anti-competitive. In February 2009, the Paris Court of Appeals confirmed the Council's decision. The Court agreed that the agreement's duration (five years) and scope (it covered the existing product and all future models) were excessive. Germany : FCO Vetoes Acquisition Of Petrol Stations By Total The German Federal Cartel Office prohibited Total from acquiring OMV's petrol station network in East Germany. Post-transaction, Total, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil would have jointly controlled up to 85% of the regional diesel and motor gasoline retail market. The FCO found that the transaction would have reinforced the suppliers' collective dominant position. The decision takes into account the interim findings of the FCO 's inquiry into the functioning of the German
fuel sector. Germany  Fines Liquefied Gas Suppliers The FCO has  fined two liquefied natural gas suppliers, Westfalen and Propan Rheingas, €41 million for running a customer-allocation and price-fixing cartel for at least eight years. The FCO previously  fined nine other cartel members a total of €209 million. The case was decided under the old fining guidelines and the FCO has calculated the  fines based on the cartel's profits. It is expected that the application of the new guidelines, which take into account the parties' revenues, will result in higher  fines. Westfalen has appealed the FCO 's decision. Germany : FCO
Accepts Remedies Almost Four Years After Clearance In 2005, the FCO cleared the acquisition of asphalt mixer NMW by its rival Werhahn. The transaction raised concerns in several regional markets for mastic asphalt (used for the construction of roads and bridges) but the FCO found that these markets were de minimis. One of the parties' competitors appealed the clearance decision. While the appeal was pending, the German Supreme Court changed its approach to de minimis markets: under the Court's new approach the regional markets concerned by the Werhahn/NMW deal could no longer be considered as de minimis. In light of this new case law, Werhahn offered to divest part of its mastic asphalt business, and the FCO accepted the divestiture. It is highly unusual for a merger control authority to amend a clearance decision that is under appeal. It remains to be seen whether or not the Court of Appeals will accept the arrangement. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

BRUSSELS -- Frustrated with past efforts to change Microsoft Corp.'s behavior, European Union regulators are pursuing a new round of sanctions against the software giant that go well beyond fines.

The regulatory push is focused on a longstanding complaint against Microsoft: that it improperly bundles its Web browser with its Windows software. Rather than forcing Microsoft to strip its Internet Explorer from Windows, people close to the case say, the EU is now ready to try the opposite measure: Forcing a bunch of browsers into Windows, thus diluting Microsoft's advantage.

TD
The sanctions would come from an EU investigation that began last year. In a sign of how rapidly the case is progressing, these people say, the possible penalty has emerged as a key focus in discussions between the parties.

The potential action would be a sharp parting blow by Europe's  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, as she enters the waning months of a term marked by aggressive enforcement. This month, Mrs. Kroes hit semiconductor maker  Intel Corp. with a record  antitrust fine of $1.48 billion.

The EU hasn't made a final ruling on Microsoft, and likely won't for at least several weeks. An EU spokesman says any sanction against Microsoft "would be based on the fundamental principle of unbiased choice."
A spokesman for Microsoft says it is committed to "full compliance" with EU law.

The EU has stacked up more than $2 billion in  fines against Microsoft since 2004. Mrs. Kroes has taken a hard line -- calling out Microsoft as not compliant and more than doubling the original penalties.
Still, all of the  fines have outwardly changed little about how the software giant does business. The EU's bid in 2004 to separate Microsoft's Media Player multimedia software from Windows is
widely viewed as a timid solution that failed. Now, emboldened by a 2007 court ruling that upheld the
2004 case and confirmed the EU's wide discretion, regulators are inclined to go further.

People close to the case say EU regulators are inclined to demand a so-called ballot screen that would present a new computer user with a choice of browsers to install, and the option to designate one of them as a default. Regulators have also signaled that they may require Microsoft to ensure contractually that computer manufacturers keep the ballot screen on machines they ship.

In discussions with regulators and in confidential filings made to the EU this week, competing browser makers are also urging a requirement that Microsoft offer alternative browsers to millions of existing Windows users via an automatic download, these people say.

"To be effective, a remedy must present users with a real choice in browsers, and make it easy for them to execute that choice," says Julia Holtz, senior  competition counsel in Europe for Google Inc., which makes the Chrome browser.

The EU sent preliminary charges to Microsoft in January. In a securities filing that month, the company said the EU might "obligate users to choose a particular browser when setting up a new PC" and require manufacturers to "distribute multiple browsers on new Windows-based PCs."

The EU is wrapping up the collection of written submissions from Microsoft, from Opera Software ASA, a small Norwegian browser maker whose complaint sparked the case, and from a constellation of third parties, which were due this week.

A ruling could arrive in the coming months, before Mrs. Kroes, who has long made plain her distaste for Microsoft's conduct, leaves office and a new set of European commissioners are seated. Any ruling would almost certainly face years of appeals in EU courts.

In its legal filings to the EU, Microsoft questioned whether the EU can legally require it to offer other makers' browsers, people familiar with the matter say. It has also argued that PC users are capable of downloading other browsers like the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox and Google's Chrome, these people say, and noted that alternate browsers have recently been gaining users while Internet Explorer's market share is falling.

Internet Explorer's share among Web surfers in Europe, which was above 80% a few years ago, has fallen to about 48% as of April, according to StatCounter, which tracks Web traffic. Firefox was No. 2 with 39% of the market with the balance going to Apple Inc.'s Safari, Opera and Chrome. The gulf between Internet Explorer and other browsers is wider in the U.S.

Action by the EU against Microsoft would go beyond what counterparts in the U.S. have done. The U.S. Department of Justice brought browser-bundling allegations against Microsoft in the 1990s and at one time sought to break up the company, but wound up settling the case without forcing big changes in Microsoft's practices.

European law has long held that a company dominating the market for one product generally can't "tie" another product to its sales. In a key 1991 case, the  European Commission -- the bloc's executive arm -- ruled that Tetra Pak, the dominant maker of machines that package milk into cartons, couldn't require that customers buy their cartons from it alone; a 1987 ruling similarly went against a maker of nail guns and nails. European courts upheld the commission in both cases.

The Media Player dispute extended the jurisprudence of nail guns and milk cartons into the world of software. Despite protests by Microsoft that the low cost of downloading lets consumers easily
choose another piece of software to watch videos, the commission found in its 2004 ruling that Media Player was illegally tied to Windows. An appellate court agreed and Microsoft later dropped its legal challenge.

The EU's remedy was out of the milk-carton playbook: It ordered Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without Media Player. Microsoft did, but at the same price as the full version. Not surprisingly, it barely registered any sales.

In a sense, the Web browser ballot screen is the biggest legal leap the EU is taking: A requirement to carry a competitor's product is a step usually taken in cases where the competitor has limited or no access to a distribution network -- for instance, operators of electric grids who also sell electricity might be required to let other producers sell power on the grid.

Still, the EU is likely to argue that it has broad powers to fashion an effective remedy. "There's nothing in EU law that requires the remedy to be a mirror image of the infringement," says Thomas Vinje, a lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP who represents Opera Software.

It isn't clear which browsers would be listed on the ballot screen, nor how the browsers would be installed. Competitors are arguing that the EU should insist that Microsoft "preload" Windows with other browsers so users don't have to download the software. The competitors say many users who attempt to download a new browser quit midway through.

Also unclear is how, or whether, the EU could insist that computer manufacturers preserve the ballot screen on Windows before shipping the machine. That concept has raised hackles with some smaller computer manufacturers.

"What you are imposing on them -- against their will -- is a customer-support and technical-support burden," says Lars Liebeler, a lawyer for CompTIA, a trade association that represents some PC maker and has filed papers on Microsoft's side with the EU. (Microsoft is a paying member of CompTIA.)

"This is a remarkable step by the commission, to now take over the process and mandate what can be put on a computer," Mr. Liebeler adds.

HD     DoJ, EU Actions Suggest Tougher Antitrust Enforcement

Recent actions on both sides of the Atlantic suggest that companies should expect tougher  antitrust
oversight of competitive behavior and proposed transactions than they have faced in recent years.

The first such sign was the announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice's  Antitrust Division that it was withdrawing a September 2008 report on evaluating whether single-firm conduct - such as
product-tying, predatory pricing, and refusal to deal with rivals - violates section 2 of the Sherman Act.

TD
The Bush era report, titled  Competition and Monopoly, favored "caution" and "hesitancy" when it came to government  antitrust enforcement actions against potential abuses by  monopoly firms and will no longer be department policy, Assistant Attorney General-antitrust Christine Varney said. "Withdrawing the section 2 report is a shift in philosophy and the clearest way to let everyone know that the  Antitrust Division will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle  competition and harm consumers," she said.

The Justice Department did not cite any specific industries in announcing the change of policy. Competitors have had poor luck in recent years pursuing section 2  antitrust claims against incumbent network operators, with the Supreme Court restricting  antitrust litigation related to interconnection disputes in 2004 (TR, Jan. 15, 2004), dismissing claims that the Bells violated  antitrust laws by excluding competitors from their respective incumbent service areas in 2007 (TR, June 1, 2007), and rejecting
price-squeeze claims against AT&T, Inc., earlier this year (TR, March 15).

The September 2008 report was the outcome of a series of joint Justice Department-Federal Trade Commission hearings on the  antitrust treatment of single-firm conduct. Justice pointed out in announcing its change of course that the FTC did not sign on to the report. The FTC had also declined to join the Justice Department in 2008 in urging the Supreme Court to accept AT&T's appeal in the price squeeze case (TR, June 15, 2008).
EU's Intel Order Raises Concerns

Meanwhile, technology industry groups and free-market advocates are raising concerns about the possible implications of the  European Commission's finding that  Intel Corp. had violated  antitrust standards, worrying that the commission's aggressive action could extend into other technology areas and potentially stymie innovation.

The European Commission has imposed a fine of 1.06 billion euros (U.S. $1.44 billion) on  Intel for violating EC Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position. The commission found that Intel, from October 2002 to December 2007, had engaged in illegal practices in the market for x86 central processing units (CPUs), including giving "wholly or partially hidden rebates" to retailers if they stocked only computers with  Intel's CPUs and making direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' CPUs.

The European Commission's "efforts to manipulate  competition in the technology industry without identifying actual consumer harm are worrying," said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology (ACT), which represents small and midsized technology companies. "Innovation and competition are thriving throughout the industry, and even the most successful firms must continue innovating and competing on price or risk being toppled."

Mr. Zuck predicted that an  antitrust case against Intel would be tougher in the United States, even with the Obama administration's Department of Justice expected to take a more aggressive stance than the Bush administration had in recent years. The difference between the U.S. and the EU is that "U.S. competition agencies will demand proof of actual consumer harm," he said.

As U.S. policy-makers review the EC decision, they should "think carefully before adopting a  competition policy that handicaps the very companies that are the key to sustaining this country's long-term economic health," said Progress & Freedom Foundation President Kenneth Ferree. "Decisions like this do nothing to illuminate the path to a vibrant and growing economy, but rather obscure it."

HD      Intel’s antitrust ruling: A billion-euro question

Are the chipmaker’s pricing policies anticompetitive?

TD
IN THE end all that seemed to matter was the size of the  fine. When it was announced on May 13th it turned out to be the largest ever of its type: €1.06 billion ($1.44 billion). This is what  Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, will have to pay if the  European Commission prevails in its view that the firm, which sells about 80% of the microprocessors for PCs, has abused its dominance.

Yet the case against  Intel is not chiefly about money that might one day "sponsor the European taxpayer", in the words of Neelie Kroes, Europe’s  competition commissioner (the fine will sit in a blocked bank account until the case is decided). The main question is: under what conditions can a quasi-monopoly such as Intel give discounts and rebates to computer-makers and retailers?

The commission does not think that such practices are illegal per se. But it claims that  Intel’s discounts and rebates were often conditional on the exclusion of its rival, AMD. The commission says that in one case Intel paid Media-Saturn Holding, Germany’s largest electronics retailer, to sell only computers with Intel chips inside, and in another case a computer-maker had to agree to buy at least 95% of the chips in its business PCs from  Intel to qualify for rebates.
Computer-makers have to play along, the commission argues, because they depend on  Intel for a
majority of their chips--a result of the fact that AMD’s production capacity is limited. If a firm decided to buy
as many AMD chips as possible, it could end up worse off since it might then have to pay more for the
chips purchased from Intel. To overcome this handicap, AMD would have to price its processors below
cost, and perhaps even pay its customers. In one case, according to the commission, AMD offered a
computer-maker 1m free chips, but it ended up taking only 160,000 of them.

Intel says the claims against it are false. It does not deny making extensive use of discounts and rebates, but insists that it has never required customers to agree not to buy from AMD in order to obtain a discount, and has never raised prices when customers bought from AMD. What is more, says Bruce Sewell,  Intel’s general counsel, no harm seems to have been done: AMD is alive, chip prices are falling and innovation is rampant.

Intel says it will appeal to the European Court of First Instance. In the meantime, both sides will argue over the evidence in this week’s 524-page decision. In the end, whether  Intel is found guilty may be less important than whether the case establishes clear rules about what dominant firms are allowed to do.

What is more, says Bruce Sewell,  Intel’s general counsel, no harm seems to have been done: AMD is alive, chip prices are falling and innovation is rampant.

Intel says it will appeal to the European Court of First Instance. In the meantime, both sides will argue over the evidence in this week’s 524-page decision. In the end, whether  Intel is found guilty may be less important than whether the case establishes clear rules about what dominant firms are allowed to do.

Europe's tough-minded  competition tsar is a hard act to follow, and Australia could learn from her example

JUST as the US Government is vowing to match the  European Commission's stellar anti-trust reputation, there may be a change of guard in Europe, with Neelie Kroes' term due to finish by year's end.

TD
The recent record $1.8 billion penalty handed down against  Intel for effectively bribing customers to use its computer chips underlined Kroes' reputation as a tough regulator.

Intel is appealing against the decision, which came after a decade-long investigation.

Kroes is also well known in Australia for her potentially fatal intervention in the proposed BHP Billiton bid for Rio Tinto.
The EC didn't need to make a final decision, because BHP pulled its bid.

While the official reason for the failed bid was the economic crisis, one assumes that not knowing where the EC stood also played a role, because there were few companies around the world that could buy the assets BHP needed to sell to satisfy anti-trust concerns.

Just how much this affects BHP's looming decision on whether to obstruct the Rio-Chinalco deal remains to be seen.

In its statement last year, the EC emphasised its concerns with coal and iron ore, saying it was worried this would affect price negotiations and inhibit other production.

These two commodities just happen to offer the greatest synergies for BHP if it does decide to make a new offer for Rio.

While having a fearsome reputation, Kroes has only rejected two proposed mergers, with the rest either dropped or substantially changed to satisfy her concerns.

Kroes' five-year term as European Commissioner for  Competition officially ends later this year. This week's European parliamentary elections paves the way for a new Commission.

The 68-year-old former corporate director, who served on the Brambles board, wants to serve another term.

This is not unprecedented, but depends on the Dutch Government nominating her for another term, and the new commission president supporting her nomination.

A change of guard at the commission would not necessarily signal a change in policy, but it would mean the loss of an extraordinary reformer.

She has proved dominant -- the scourge of many US companies, including Microsoft -- partly because the US under eight years of George Bush effectively downgraded anti-trust enforcement.

The EC is considering forcing Microsoft to include a range of web browsers in its operating software, to dilute the dominance of its Internet Explorer browser.
This follows long-term complaints about Microsoft bundling a browser in its software.
Last year, the EC finedMicrosoft $US1.3 billion and French based multinational Saint Gobain
$US1.3billion for abuse of market power.
It can impose  fines of up to 10 per cent of annual revenues.

The Intel fine was only 4.2 per cent of annual turnover. Even if Kroes doesn't get a second term, she is determined to get one more reform through -- giving consumers the right to pursue damages claims against perpetrators without first proving they breached the  competition laws.

At present, in damages claims, Europeans need to effectively re-run the case against the company in question -- unlike Australia.
This new law would add one more deterrent.

When you consider Intel has 70 per cent market share of the $US30 billion-a-year X86 computer processing unit market, there are plenty of people who could claim to have been hurt by its actions.

New US Federal Trade Commission boss Jon Leibowitz and Assistant Attorney Christine Varney have vowed to take up the fight. They reportedly said the Bush administration, by ``standing aside'', had cost consumers billions of dollars and arguably helped push the economy into a recession.

This is a big claim but it is clear Varney plans to match Kroes' role as the effective global anti-trust boss.

Kroes and her departmental head Phillip Lowe run a department of some 750 people focused on mergers and anti-trust work, with a separate agency handling consumer protection.

Unlike in Australia, the EC places strong emphasis on economists. Some 20 PhDs report to a chief economist, who reports directly to Lowe.

Kroes came to power vowing to combat cartels. OECD work showed that where cartels operated unchecked, prices were on average 10-20 per cent higher than under free  competition.

Using this definition, Kroes claims she saved EC consumers E8 billion on an annual budget of E100 million.

Working on the basis that each cartel case prevents another one starting, the deterrent effect of these actions saved another E5 billion ($8.6 billion), according to Lowe.

He acknowledges the figures are a touch rubbery, but they serve a useful purpose in generating political support for their work.

The ACCC in Australia would benefit from the same effort to come up with a way to measure its effectiveness.

After the blockbuster case against Visy in cardboard boxes, the regulators have been busy in the cartel space, including a continuing action again global airlines in the freight case.
Many of its actions are low profile and sporadic, so the good work may be under-appreciated. At the International  Competition Network conference in Zurich this week, a range of global
competition agencies boasted about their effectiveness, but the ACCC was notable for its absence.

A report is due out later this year from the OECD, which tends to base such work on material supplied by the organisation being ``measured''.

Highly regarded Brussels-based lawyer Michael Reynolds from Allen & Overy is full of praise for Kroes, noting in an interview that while her toughness has sent a clear message, she has also been flexible where necessary.

The most notable example is in the so-called article 82 cases against state subsidies, where government bailouts of banks have been given a six-month moratorium because of the financial crisis.

That time limit is nearly over for some German banks, which will again put the spotlight on the subsidies.

Kroes has prided herself on not letting a plethora of anti-competitive state subsidies through late last year, in the middle of the crisis.

With the US now vowing to take a stronger stance on anti-competitive behaviour, global companies truly will have no where to hide.
Watchdogs on the prowl

THE eighth annual International Competitive Network meeting in Zurich this week includes papers from ACCC chief Graeme Samuel and his offsider, Tim Grimwade.
Samuel will talk about the road to criminal sanctions, which of course is not quite complete, while
Grimwade will talk about notification procedures.

The ICN is an annual talkfest comprised of the world's anti-trust regulators and lawyers, with this year's Australian delegation including former ACCC boss Alan Fels.
The aforementioned Christine Varney from the US will also be present, along with the EC's Lowe. The idea of the conference is simply to share war stories with the aim of becoming more effective.

LP
Intel rolled out a major consumer-targeted marketing campaign right at a time when its image is sagging.

The European Commission last month hit  Intel with a record $1.45 billion  fine, saying the chip leader uses unfair tactics.

TD
Intel (INTC) says it's done nothing wrong and will appeal.

It's likely no coincidence  Intel is rolling out a multimillion-dollar ad campaign aimed at consumers, says Will Strauss, president of research firm Forward Concepts.
"It's called damage control," Strauss said.

Intel denies any such timing.
Certainly its new "Sponsors of Tomorrow" campaign -- the name refers to chips enabling
cutting-edge products -- has been in the works longer than a month. On the other hand, the EC's
action had been expected for months.

Like the firm's well-known "Intel Inside" ads, the new campaign wants to prod consumers at electronics stores to seek out machines that have  Intel chips.

This time,  Intel isn't just after PC buyers, but also buyers of many types of gadgets.  Intel says the campaign will run three to five years.

The move comes as Intel makes another run at the consumer electronics market, hoping to put more of its chips inside cell phones, HDTVs and digital music players. But it's failed here before.

Intel aspires to evolve into a broad consumer brand. Strauss says it has no choice.

"They have to branch out from the PC market. It's a nice and lucrative market for them, but everyone has a PC," Strauss said. "Other markets are growing faster than the PC market."

Intel sells about 80% of all the processors that run PCs and servers. But the PC market is saturated in developed countries. And emerging countries prefer low-cost PCs with low-profit margins.

Aiming at low-cost notebooks, or netbooks, and consumer electronics, last year  Intel rolled out a powerful, tiny chip it calls Atom.
LG Electronics in February said it would use Atom in some of its cell phones.

Intel also is creating a family of system-on-a-chip devices -- all the circuitry is on a single chip -- to run digital music players, global positioning devices and portable DVD players.
While Intel has market clout, it faces an uphill battle in consumer electronics, says BMO Capital
Markets analyst Brian Piccioni.
Page 195 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The issue is: Will there be any compelling products brought to market by their customers?" he said.

He cites high-definition TV. If an HDTV maker uses  Intel's Atom, but the TV is pretty much the same as every other TV out there, why would the TV maker switch from its current chipmaker?

He says U.K. chip designer ARM (ARMH) , which is in most cell phones and a lot of portable consumer devices, is a tough rival.
ARM designs low-cost devices that use little power. "They get the job done," Piccioni said.

Intel does have advantages. Far more software exists for its x86 chip design than for any other processor. And many consumers know the brand.
But being a well-known brand can be a problem when you're getting fined by Europe for  antitrust
violations. And the EC isn't the first government entity to rule against Intel.

In June 2008, Korea  fined Intel $25 million for allegedly giving kickbacks to customers for not buying chips from archrival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) . And in December 2005, Japan told Intel to stop giving questionable rebates.  Intel, while not admitting it had done anything wrong, said it would comply.

A bigger shoe might yet drop. After at least a couple of years of informally looking at  Intel's practices, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last June launched a formal investigation. The results are expected next year.
Piccioni, for one, downplays the effect of the regulatory actions.

Outside of a small group of techies and some analysts, "I don't think anyone gives a tinker's damn about antitrust," he said.

Others aren't so sure. The EC homed in on  Intel's practice of giving rebates to its PC-maker customers. It says  Intel gave the rebates in return for the PC makers not buying chips from AMD and others, and, said Commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed millions of European consumers."

In a conference call after the EC announced the  fine, Intel CEO Paul Otellini said  Intel did give rebates, but that they were standard and perfectly legal. Intel bases its rebates on the common industry practice of "the more you buy, the less you pay," he said.

In any case,  Intel's business practices in the broader consumer electronics field, where it faces more big rivals, will be scrutinized.
Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco developed the "Sponsors of Tomorrow" theme for
Intel's new campaign.

"We wanted to get to the hearts and minds of consumers," Cristina Torres,  Intel's global media manager, told IBD. "The way we're doing that is the future-looking campaign."

Besides running ads on the Web, on TV, on billboards and in magazines,  Intel has rented empty storefronts in some big cities nationwide and installed electronic billboards.

The video screens run a message inviting passersby to text a message to  Intel with their hopes and aspirations.  Intel shows some of these messages on a scrolling billboard in New York's Times Square that it's rented.
"No one has ever done this before," Torres said.

HD      ANTI-TRUST POLICY : INTEL CALLS RECORD EU FINE "WRONG DECISION" WC     922 words
PD      8 June 2009
SN      Europolitics Information Society

LP
Reacting to the arguments put forward by EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes for imposing a record fine on Intel - the company "harmed millions of European consumers" - the American microchip giant immediately hit back, saying "there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers". It will appeal against what it considers to be "a wrong decision".
The European Commission decided, on 13 May, in line with the EU's anti-trust rules, to impose a  fine of
€1.06 billion on Intel Corporation for  abuse of its dominant position (Article 82) and illegal
anti-competitive behaviour, during the period from October 2002 to December 2007, aiming to exclude
competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units' (CPUs). The
Commission also ordered Intel to immediately put an end to its illegal practices in so far as they still exist.
It also intends to "actively" monitor that its decision is respected by  Intel.

TD
Neelie Kroes stressed that "such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated". This explains why the  fine is the highest ever that the EU has imposed on a company. The fine is not a goal in itself, she added, but rather a warning to the market that the Commission intends "to remain very vigilant with regards to the  competition rules and consumer protection". In this regard, she
welcomed "the interest and support" of BEUC and UFC Que Choisir (the European and French consumer associations), which intervened on the Commission's side in this case.
APPEAL

Intel said it would appeal the Commission's decision. "Intel takes strong exception to this decision," Paul Otellini, president and CEO of the Californian company, said in a statement. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices." "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

Intel has already been convicted in Japan and South Korea, and investigations are underway in the
United States.
SATISFACTION

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said Giuliano Meroni, regional head of AMD, the company that first filed the complaint against  Intel.

The BEUC "welcomed today's record decision of the  European Commission" and recalled in a statement that it had "intervened in the proceedings as an interested third party as consumers have been paying too much for their computers because of  Intel's anti-competitive practices". Monique Goyens, BEUC director-general, stressed that "consumer choice is the heartbeat of a competitive economy.  Intel have been shown to have denied effective consumer choice and as a result kept prices artificially high
and slowed the pace of innovation. Such a large  fine should deter companies that might think they will get away with such anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices".

In BEUC's opinion,  Intel should be forced to repay the victims of its anti-competitive behaviour. This would only be possible via a group action and BEUC is urging the  European Commission to propose

Page 198 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
legislation as quickly as possible that would allow a collective legal action for the victims of anti-competitive practices. Kroes confirmed that the Commission was working on it.
ARGUMENTS

According to the Commission,  Intel had a dominant position in the global market for x86 CPUs, an essential component of computer equipment, with at least a 70% share of the market. The Commission considered Intel to be carrying out two specific types of illegal behaviour:

- Awarding partly or entirely hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all or almost all of the x86 CPUs they needed from  Intel and direct payments to major retailers on condition that they only sell computers fitted with x86 CPUs. The rebates and payments effectively prevented clients - and, ultimately, consumers - from choosing alternative products.

- Direct payments to computer manufacturers with the aim of stopping or delaying the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels used for these products. By reducing competitors' ability to compete on the merits of their products,  Intel's actions hindered competition and innovation.

The computer manufacturers affected by  Intel's actions referred to in the Commission's decision are: Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarket chain.

The Commission said that it obtained proof of the existence of several of the conditions found to be illegal in the decision with regards to agreements, even if they were not spelt out explicitly in the  Intel contracts. It is based on a whole range of evidence, such as e-mails obtained during on-site inspections, replies to requests for information and official statements made by the companies affected.

The Commission's investigation followed complaints filed by AMD in 2000, 2003 and 2006. A statement of objections was sent in July 2007 and then in July 2008.
Background

Intel's global sales in 2007 totalled 27.972 billion euro (US$38.834 billion). In this case, the Commission added, the  fine (4.15% of its annual sales, EU rules allowing it to go up to 10%) takes into account the duration and seriousness of the infringement and was calculated based on the value of x86 CPU sales by Intel in Europe. The duration of the infringement in the decision is five years and three months.

HD        AMD CEO: Too Early To Say PC Market Has Hit Bottom
BY         By Se Young Lee
CR        Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
WC       1,007 words

LP
SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) expects demand for personal computers to pick up sometime in the fourth quarter this year and may report sales growth in that period, but it's too early to say the market has hit bottom, its chief executive said.

The information-technology supply chain has stabilized after a massive inventory correction in the fourth quarter of 2008, Dirk Meyer told Dow Jones Newswires in a recent interview.

TD
"The inventory situation seems to be healthy, which leaves us with the question of end-user demand," said the executive. "It's still too early to definitely say we've hit bottom; you can only point to he bottom once you're past it, and I can't say we're past it."

AMD reported a first-quarter net loss of US$416 million on revenue of US$1.2 billion, hurt by the persisting global economic downturn during the period.
"Hope would be that back half of this year we see a return to normal seasonal growth," Meyer said. He said PC shipments over the course of 2009 will likely decline on average around a single-digit
percentage from a year earlier, in line with market researchers' forecasts.
IDC said in April that worldwide PC shipments fell 7.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier. Typically the second half of the year is a strong selling season for chip makers spanning the
back-to-school and holiday shopping season.

Meyer added that the company's baseline scenario is for PC shipments to turn positive in year-on-year terms by the year end and that 2010 will be a growth year for the industry.



Thin-and-Light Notebooks, Netbooks Growth Opportunities

Meyer said growth in so-called "thin-and-light" notebooks, which come with thinner and lighter designs, and netbooks - low-cost PCs primarily focused on mobility and web-browsing - will likely outpace growth from the traditional notebook segments, partly due to the fact that they are new products with low
volume comparison bases. AMD hopes to benefit from these emerging trends in the PC space.

"We really found a good, unserved segment of the market that is the segment for thin and light notebooks," he said. "We found an opportunity in the market and  Intel's clearly trying to play catch-up there."

Earlier this year, the chip company introduced a platform for the thin-and-light category called the Yukon, which Hewlett-Packard Co. has employed in a laptop that has hit the shelves. Rival  Intel Corp. (INTC) is expected to roll out products based on its own platform for the category called CULV.



Page 200 of 212 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Meyer said the company will continue to introduce new products in this product category as well as others, as the company aims to adjust to a market that he says is starting to emphasize different functions as opposed to simple computing power.

"We have to deliver good value and offer differentiated platforms, particularly around graphics and media," he said.

He said the company's broad portfolio and its decision to go fabless by spinning off its manufacturing facilities into a joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co. - an entity owned by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi - will help the company compete better with  Intel.

Meyer also said he is encouraged by a recent  European Commission's antitrust ruling against Intel that fined the chip maker a record EUR1.06 billion for anticompetitive behavior. He said he hopes such decisions by governments will improve the market's openness.

The commission ruled in May that  Intel provided rebates and direct payments to computer manufacturers and a major retailer to pressure them to buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than AMD.

Intel said last month it will appeal the  European Commission's decision, finding it baseless.



AMD's Stake In
Globalfoundries To Shrink

Meyer said the company's stake in Globalfoundries, currently at about 34%, will gradually be diluted over time. He said the foundry is expected to generate cash on its own, but it will ask its shareholders for capital injections.

In October 2008, AMD announced a joint venture with ATIC, an Abu Dhabi investment company, where AMD spun off its semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The joint venture, called Globalfoundries, will compete with contract chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC). "I suspect...we'll find uses of our cash in the form of product investment instead of capital investment," he said, though noting that AMD will retain the right to participate in such cash calls.

Globalfoundries will receive US$3.6 billion to US$6 billion in funding over the next five years, according to its web site.

AMD will remain Globalfoundries' biggest customer and have board representation in the company "for years," Meyer said, adding that the foundry will be a key strategic partner.

Meyer said TSMC and Globalfoundries appear to have the leading-edge technology capabilities and strong financials to remain viable in the long term.

"Given that each of the other players has difficulties in one dimension or the other, consolidation is a way to address some of those issues," he said.

The executive said Globalfoundries will look to extend its manufacturing bases with the aim to have a global reach. It currently has a manufacturing base in Dresden, Germany, with commitments to build a facility in New York state.

HD       Microsoft faces EU threat of prompts for rivals

Personal computer users would be presented with automatic prompts asking them if they want to set their machines to use alternatives to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser under a regulation being looked at by the  European Commission in its latest  antitrust action against the software company.

The unusual remedy, which would mark the most direct intervention yet by European regulators to promote consumer choice in technology markets, is likely to be part of an effort to deal with the dominant position of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, according to people familiar with the case.

TD
The EU is expected to push ahead with its action this summer, along with a  fine that legal observers say could approach the record €1.06bn ($1.49bn) recently levied on  Intel.

Europe's attempt to quell Microsoft's dominant position in browsers stems from a case brought early last year by Opera, the Norwegian browser company. Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, which has already made notable inroads against IE in Europe, and Google, a more recent competitor with Chrome, have since lent their support to the case.

The Commission first indicated early this year that it was considering prompting PC users to make a browser choice, Microsoft revealed at the time.

In recent weeks regulators have asked interested parties for suggestions on how to implement this plan, according to people close to its thinking. With the Commission closing its formal submission process on the issue on Thursday, the way has been cleared for a final ruling that is expected after the August break. The regulators are studying ways to put a "ballot screen" in front of the users of new
Windows-based PCs asking them to select a browser from a short list of options.

Some browser makers have also agitated for the same options to be presented to users of all existing machines, forcing Microsoft's online software updating service to present prompts to PC users on multiple occasions offering them alternative browsers.

While the so-called "must-carry" provision for rival browsers would apply to new consumer PCs, the regulators are struggling for a way to apply it to the corporate PC market.

HD        Microsoft bids to pre-empt EU browser  action

The fight between Microsoft and the European Union over how to bring greater  competition to the internet browser market erupted afresh late on Thursday as the software company sought to pre-empt stringent anti-trust action being planned by Brussels.

Microsoft issued a unilateral statement saying that its Windows 7 operating system, due to be launched in October, would be made available in Europe without the Internet Explorer browser included. The move was designed to reduce the legal uncertainties around the launch of Windows 7 in Europe and "the risk of large  fines", Microsoft said.

TD
The move drew a cool response from the European Commission, which has been preparing more stringent action against the software company to bring greater competition to the browser market. While the commission said it noted Microsoft's move "with interest", one official said that for consumers, "rather than more choice, Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less".

Thomas Vinje, a lawyer representing ECIS, a grouping of technology companies opposed to Microsoft, said: "This is a step in the right direction, but it is far from enough."

Microsoft's move comes as the European regulators have been preparing action against Microsoft that would include a requirement for it to give personal computer users a choice of which browser they use on their PCs. The unusual remedy would mark the most direct intervention yet by European regulators to promote consumer choice in technology markets.

The EU has been expected to push ahead with its action later this summer, along with a penalty that some legal observers say could approach the record €1.06bn ($1.49bn)  fine recently levied on Intel.

Rather than wait for the expected sanctions, however, Microsoft said on Thursday that Windows 7 would be released in Europe without a browser, and that PC makers and consumers would be free to install
one themselves.

The move echoes an earlier European action against Microsoft, when regulators forced the company to sell a version of Windows without a media player "bundled" into the software.

HD          Rambus shares jump on report of near EU settlement
WC         307 words

SAN FRANCISCO, June 11 (Reuters) - Shares of Rambus Inc rose about 3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the chip designer is close to a settlement of its European Union  antitrust case that would not require a  fine.

Rambus spokeswoman Linda Ashmore said there was nothing official from the  European                     Commission, so the company could not comment.

TD
European regulators accused Rambus in 2007 of participating in JEDEC, an industry standards setting organization, without disclosing that it owned patents the organization decided to implement.

Rambus will offer lower royalty rates on its chip technology but require more customers to pay, according to the Journal's online report, which cited a person familiar with the matter.
The results of the proceedings could be public as soon as Friday, the Journal said.

"If there was truth to the story it will have removed the last of the governmental agencies examining Rambus and its behavior while it was participating in JEDEC," said Capstone Investments analyst Jeff Schreiner.

"The concern on the investors' part was, if you look at the recent  fines on Microsoft and  Intel , that we would see Rambus facing a  fine ... and that maybe their patents would be unenforceable in Europe."
"It looks like Rambus has skated away -- if reports are true -- without a  fine," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court in February declined to hear a similar case brought by the Federal Trade
Commission, which dismissed the case in May.
Rambus is involved in multiple court cases around the world.

Shares of the Los Altos, California-based company closed at $15.09 on Nasdaq but jumped 2.7 percent to $15.50 in after-hours trading. (Reporting by Clare Baldwin in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)

Microsoft yesterday confirmed that it would release a version of its next Windows operating system without its browser included, in an apparent attempt to pre-empt European action.
