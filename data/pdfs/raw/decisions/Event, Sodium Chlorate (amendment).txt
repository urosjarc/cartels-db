BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators levied a reduced  fine of 4.23 million euros ($5.6 million) against Aragonesas Industrias y Energia and  Uralita for taking part in a  cartel after the Spanish companies won a court challenge against the penalty last year.

The European Commission had in June 2008 penalised the two companies to the tune of 9.9 million euro for fixing  prices of sodium chlorate used in the paper and pulp industry together with three other groups.

Aragonesas Industrias y Energia and  Uralita took their case to the Luxembourg-based General Court which scrapped the fine in a 2011 ruling, saying the EU watchdog only had evidence of the companies' wrongdoing for one year and not for three years.
The Commission said the new  fine took into account the court verdict.

Its 2008 fining decision also named EKA Chemicals, Akzo Nobel, Finnish Chemicals, Erikem Luxembourg, Arkema France, Elf Aquitaine - now part of Total SA - as members of the  cartel which allocated markets between themselves from late 1994 to 2000.

Akzo Nobel and its Swedish subsidiary EKA Chemicals were not  fined as they had alerted the regulators to the existence of the  cartel. Penalties for the other companies were unchanged.

Brussels, 28/03/2012 (Agence Europe) - €73,401,000: that is the total of the  fines imposed by the European Commission on four groups of companies on Wednesday 28 March for allocating sales volumes and fixing  prices for sodium chlorate, an oxidising agent used mainly for bleaching paper, in breach on the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices in the EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement. The companies concerned are EKA Chemicals, Akzo Nobel, Finnish Chemicals, Erikem Luxembourg, Arkema France, Elf Aquitaine, Aragonesas Industrias y Energia and  Uralita. Between the end of 1994 and
2000, these companies fixed prices and allocated markets through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts. Akzo Noble and its subsidiary EKA Chemicals were granted total immunity from  fines under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Programme, as they were the first to provide information about the  cartel.

TD
The fine imposed on Finnish Chemicals was reduced by 50% as a result of its cooperation during investigations to €10,150,000. Arkema France and Elf Aquitaine were  fined €59,020,000. Arkema France's  fine was increased by 90% as it is a repeat offender (having been found guilty of participation in
three previous cartels). Aragonesas Industrias y Energia and  Uralita were fined €4,231,000. (OL/transl.rt)

The European Commission condemned four groups of manufacturers, on 28 March, for their agreements to allocate share volumes and fix prices for sodium chlorate, an oxidising agent used mainly to whiten paper. Ruling that they violated the prohibition on restrictive commercial practices laid down by the EC Treaty (Article 81), the executive  fined them a total of €73.4 million, but reduced the  fines on certain firms that cooperated with its investigation under the leniency notice.
The Commission's investigation was triggered by a request for immunity submitted by EKA Chemicals in
March 2003. Finnish Chemicals also filed a request under the 2002 leniency notice.

TD
The fines, ordered on the basis of the 2006 guidelines, are as follows in euro (% reduction under the
2002 leniency notice):
- EKA Chemicals (Sweden)/Akzo Nobel (Netherlands): exemption (100%)
- Finnish Chemicals (Finland)/Erikem (Luxembourg): 10,150,000 (50%)
- Arkema France and Elf Aquitaine (France): 59,020,000
- Aragonesas/Uralita (Spain): 4,231,000

This is the first time under the 2006  fine guidelines that the Commission has increased the  fine imposed on a company due to its previous involvement in three cartels.

From late 1994 to 2000, these companies fixed prices and allocated markets. They met periodically to discuss prices and volumes, exchange sensitive commercial information and monitor the implementation of their illegal agreements. The Commission notes that the practices brought to light by its investigations constitute very serious infringements of EC Treaty anti-trust rules.

In setting the amount of the  fines, the Commission took into account the value of sales by each participant as well as the combined market share, geographical scope of the market and actual implementation of the  cartel agreements.

Akzo Nobel and its subsidiary EKA Chemicals received full immunity from  fines because they were the first to provide information on the illegal practices. The  fine on Finnish Chemicals was reduced by 50% due to its cooperation with the investigation. Arkema France saw its  fine increased by 90% because it is a repeat offender (the company has already been condemned in three previous  cartel cases).
