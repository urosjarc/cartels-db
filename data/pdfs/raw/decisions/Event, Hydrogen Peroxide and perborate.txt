Dutch chemical group  Akzo Nobel NV has been granted a 40-pct discount on a fine by the European Commission (EC) for a competition law infringement in the hydrogen peroxide  market, the company said on May 3, 2006.

Akzo Nobel will pay, however, a fine of 25.2 mln euro ($31.8 mln) for taking part in the hydrogen      
peroxide  cartel between 1994 and 2000.

TD
The discount was granted for the company's cooperation in the EC investigation. German Degussa fully escaped a fine of 129.9 mln ($164 mln) because it informed on the  cartel.
Besides Akzo Nobel, the EC  fined also the chemical companies Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia,
Solvay and Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema. The total  fine adds up to 388.1 mln euro ($490 mln).
French Air Liquide was not  fined because it left the market in 1998.

The European  Commission on Wednesday slapped  fines totalling ?388m ($491m) on seven companies involved in a chemicals  cartel, one of the highest financial penalties imposed by the regulator.

Solvay of Belgium bore the brunt of the punishment, and was ordered to pay ?167m. It will also have to pay the ?58m penalty imposed on Edison-Ausimont, an Italian company it acquired in 2002.

TD
France's Total was  fined ?79m and Finland's Kemira ?33m, while Dutch group  Akzo Nobel and Spain's
FMC were ordered to pay ?25m each, and Snia of Italy ?1m.

Degussa, the German chemicals group and another member of the  cartel, escaped what would have been a ?130m fine, in exchange for its role as whistleblower,

Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said: "These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

The chemicals industry has repeatedly been the subject of  cartel investigations, and already accounted for some of the most spectacular  fines. Wednesday's ?388m was the third-highest imposed by the Commission; at least one company, Edison-Ausimont, received the maximum penalty, equivalent to 10 per cent of global annual turn-over.

The Brussels regulator said the companies had conspired to allocate market share and fix prices in the market for hydrogen peroxide  and perborates - bleaching chemicals used in textiles production, disinfection and in synthetic detergents.
The combined market was worth about ?470m in 2000, the  Commission said.

The Commission found evidence of several meetings to discuss the workings of the  cartel, including one in a Brussels restaurant in November 1997 at which the companies discussed price increases.

Solvay said it had set aside sufficient reserves to cover the fines, and it expected no impact on its
first-quarter results. It was considering an appeal, arguing Solvay's co-operation had not been properly
taken into account.

Hans Wijers,  Akzo Nobel chief executive, said: "We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again."
Kemira said it would look into the decision and then decide on any further action.

HD        Brussels to issue fines over cartel.

European Union  cartel-busters are today expected to impose painful fines on up to 18 companies in the chemical sector, as a punishment for running a  cartel in the market for hydrogen peroxide  and similar substances.

It was not clear how many companies would be  fined or how high the penalties would be. However, the companies are likely to include Total of France, Degussa of Germany,  Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, Solvay of Belgium and Kemira of Finland - all of which were formally charged by the European Commission in connection with the  cartel in February last year.

TD
The Brussels-based regulator has the power to impose  fines of up to 10 per cent of a company's global annual turnover, and  fines tend to increase dramatically for repeat offenders.  Akzo Nobel is among the companies that has already been  fined for a cartel abuse.

In 2001, the chemical industry was the subject of the biggest  cartel fine ever imposed by the regulator, when it ordered eight vitamin producers to pay  fines totalling Euros 855.2m (Dollars 1bn).

Alois Michielsen,  Solvay chief executive, last week told the FT: "We recognise that our behaviour in regards to antitrust matters was not correct. We collaborated with the authorities in Europe, as well as in the US. We expect that we will have to pay a  fine."

The United States will fund the spraying of DDT in Africa's sub-Saharan region, officials said yesterday.

Michael Miller, the deputy assistant administrator of the Bureau of Global Health for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that the federal government is "really pretty aggressive" about supporting DDT use against mosquitoes that spread malaria in Africa.

TD
Richard Green, director of the Office of Health, Infectious Diseases and Nutrition in USAID's global health bureau, added that "we think DDT is an excellent insecticide and that ... it has some advantages over some other insecticides that are available."

DDT is an organochlorine that concentrates in biological systems and is a toxin across a certain range of species of animal. As a pesticide, it is used to defoliate trees and other plants. It has been found to bioaccumulate up the food chain, reaching its greatest concentrations in higher animals such as humans. The United States banned the use of DDT in 1972. It is effective against malaria because it destroys the habitats in which mosquitoes carry the disease breed.
The pesticide is also one of the "dirty dozen" chemicals banned by the Stockholm Convention on
Persistent Organic Pollutants (Greenwire, May 1).

Still, Green said "we think DDT is safe when used correctly and are not aware of any human health risks" (Joyce Howard Price, Washington Times, May 3).

Uganda announced last month that it will soon begin the controlled spraying of DDT indoors to fight malaria (Greenwire, April 28).
European chemical cartels  fined

The European  Commission fined seven companies €388 million today for running a  cartel in the market for bleaching chemicals.

Among the companies accused of breaking European Union cartel rules by the European competitions regulator are:  Solvay of Belgium, which received the biggest fine of 167 million euros; Italian firm Edison, fined 84 million euros for a joint venture agreement with Solvay and other infractions; Arkema of France, fined 79 million euros; Kemira of Finland,  fined 33 million euros; Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands and FMC Foret of the United States, both  fined 25 million euros each; and Snia of Italy,  fined €1 million.

The Commission found all of the companies guilty of breaking  cartel laws in the 470-million-euro market for hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  between 1994 and 2000.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behavior that deprive customers of the benefits of the single market," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
There is no news yet on whether the companies plan to appeal the  fines (Agence France-Presse, May 3). TCC found in crops -- report
Triclocarban, a disinfectant chemical widely used in soaps to provide them with antibacterial qualities, survives sewage treatment and is being spread onto farmland and released into the nation's drinking water supply with unknown effects, according to a study set to be published in the June issue of Environmental Science & Technology.

Page 7 of 73 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Lead study author Richard Halden said his research suggests that TCC contaminates 60 percent of the
U.S. water supply.

"There is very little data on the role of triclocarban," he said. "The irony is we have used it for a half century and we are only beginning to learn what happens to this chemical after we are done with it" (Maggie Fox, Reuters, May 2). -- RJD

BRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission slapped fines totalling 388 million euros
($491 million) on Wednesday on seven companies for operating cartels in the chemicals sector between
1994 and 2000, the EU executive said in a statement.

The companies exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers, whilea also fixing target prices of  hydrogen peroxide  and perborate,  it said. The firms  fined were Dutch chemical group  Akzo Nobel , Italian utility Edison , Belgium's Solvay , Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema , Finnish chemicals group Kemira , Snia and FMC/Foret.

TD
Two other companies were involved but were not  fined.

German chemicals group Degussa , a repeat offender, would have been  fined but received full immunity for providing information about the  cartel, the Commission said.

Air Liquide , and its subsidiary Chemoxal, could not be  fined since the Commission's right to impose financial penalties had expired as the company left the market in 1998.

(Adds Edison comment para 14)

BRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission slapped fines totalling 388 million euros ($491 million) on seven chemical companies on Wednesday for fixing prices in what it said was a "very serious infringement" of competition rules.

TD
The fines amounted to the third-biggest total imposed on an industry so far by the European Union's top antitrust regulator.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the single market," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue," she said.

A total of nine companies formed a  cartel for hydrogen peroxide  and perborate,  used for bleaching, as far back as 1994, and they agreed to raise prices again at a meeting in a Brussels restaurant in 1997, the European  Commission said.

Belgium's Solvay , which faced the biggest  fine of 193 million euros as a "repeat offender," said it had prepared for the fine by setting aside reserves in 2004 and 2005 but that the amount was excessive and it intended to appeal.
"The fine will not affect our results," said Martial Tardy, a spokesman for  Solvay. Its shares were down
0.48 percent at 1137 GMT, in line with the decline in the pan-European blue chip index <.FTEU3>.

The company blamed the  cartel finding on the "reprehensible behaviour of some individuals" and said it was committed to healthy competition.

Solvay also had to pay a fine of 35 million euros to U.S antitrust authorities earlier this year for its part in a cartel for peroxygen products uncovered by Washington.
PROVIDED FOR

The other firms  fined by the Commission on Wednesday were Dutch chemical group  Akzo Nobel , Italian utility Edison , Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema , Finnish chemical group Kemira , Snia of Italy and FMC/Foret of Spain.

Kemira said it would consider whether to take further action over its  fine of 33 million euros but that it had already made provisions to cover it.

Akzo Nobel said it would study the full decision before deciding whether to appeal but noted that it had already made a provision in 2005 that accounted for its share of the total, 25.2 million euros.

"We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again. Indeed, we operate a zero tolerance policy for those who take part in any anticompetitive behaviour," Chief Executive Hans Wijers said in a statement.

Edison, which said it had been  fined a total 58.1 million euros, also said it would study the full decision before deciding whether to take any steps. Montedison, cited in the ruling by Brussels, was merged with Edison in 2002 and Edison said it did not think the firm had any direct involvement.
Several of the other companies declined to comment.

German chemical group Degussa was a "repeat offender" but escaped being  fined 130 million euros after it provided information about the  cartel, the Commission said.
Air Liquide and its subsidiary Chemoxal could not be  fined because the company had left the market in
1989, and the  Commission's right to impose financial penalties had expired.

The Commission said the companies exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and also fixed target prices of  hydrogen       peroxide  and perborate.
Other repeat offenders, whose  fines were increased, were Arkema and Edison.

Hydrogen peroxide  is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment.

Perborate is used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders.

In 2000, the combined market value in the European Economic Area, where the  cartel was found to be operating, was estimated at about 470 million euros for both products. (Additional reporting by Emma Davis in Brussels and Arild Moen in Helsinki and Emma Thomasson in Amsterdam.)

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday  fined seven chemical firms a total of €388 million (US$491 million) for running a  bleach cartel in the 1990s.

The European Commission said the high fines reflected the fact that two of the companies -- Total SA's Arkema, Belgium's Solvay SA and Edison SpA -- were repeat offenders and increased their  fines by 50 percent.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behavior," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement. "Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."
The commission said its investigation found that nine companies broke EU antitrust law from 1994 and
2000 by exchanging commercially important and confidential information, limiting production, allocating
market shares and customers as well as fixing target prices for  hydrogen peroxide  and one of its
products, PBS.

The paper industry is one of the largest customers for hydrogen peroxide  which it uses as a bleach and a disinfectant. The  commission said the hydrogen peroxide  and PBS market was worth about €470 million in 2000.

Solvay received the largest single  fine -- €167 million (US$211 million) -- followed by Arkema, which was
fined €78 million (US$99 million).

Edison -- now owned by  Solvay -- was ordered to pay €58 million (US$73 million). Finland's Kemira Oyj must pay €33 million (US$42 million), with both Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV and FMC Corporation of the United States  fined €25 million (US$32 million) each. Also fined €1 million (US$1.26 million) was Italy's Snia/Caffaro.
Degussa AG, "also a repeat offender," received full immunity for blowing the whistle. Another firm -- Air
Liquide -- was exempted because it left the market in 1998.

Solvay, Akzo and Arkema saw their  fines cut for cooperating. The  commission said some of these companies had come forward "within a matter of days or even hours from each other."
Regulators said they uncovered plenty of evidence for the  cartel -- from a meeting between rivals in early
1995 to discuss "a model for sharing out among producers" to a 1997 Brussels restaurant dinner to
discuss price increases.

"The practices uncovered are a very serious infringement," they said. "In fixing the fines, the commission took account of the size of the (European) market, the duration of the cartel and the size of the firms involved."

Solvay -- slapped with the fifth largest EU  cartel fine ever -- said its 2004 and 2005 reserves could cover its costs, which run to €193 million (US$244 million) including Edison's  fine.

"Solvay considers the fine as excessive and will analyze the decision with the intention to challenge it before the EU Tribunal of First Instance in Luxembourg," it said in a statement.

The company had cooperated with regulators, it said, and the  fine did not take  Solvay's arguments into account. "This situation results from reprehensible behavior of some individuals and is in contradiction with the rules and policies of the group and its board," it said.

The Belgian firm said the  fine would not affect its first quarter 2006 results due on May 9 nor the full-year results.

A Delta Lloyd analyst, Jan de Cauter, disagreed, telling Dow Jones Newswires he believed it unlikely the company would have taken provisions for the total amount and the news would hit the stock price.

Akzo Nobel and Kemira said they would have to study the  Commission's decision before deciding whether or not to file an appeal.  Akzo said it now operates a zero tolerance policy against  cartel behavior.

"We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again," said  Akzo Nobel CEO Hans Wijers in a statement.
Kemira said it had made provisions to cover the  fine.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday  fined seven chemical firms a total of euro388 million (US$491 million) for running a  bleach cartel in the 1990s.

The European Commission said the high fines reflected the fact that two of the companies -- Total SA's Arkema, Belgium's Solvay SA and Edison SpA -- were repeat offenders and increased their  fines by 50 percent.

The European  Commission fined Belgian chemical and pharmaceutical group  Solvay SA 167 mln euro ($210.7 mln) for cartelling in the  hydrogen peroxide  (HP) and perborate  (PBS) markets, the commission said on May 3, 2006.

Solvay's fine will be added to the estimated 26 mln euro ($32.8 mln)  fine incurred by its Italian subsidiary Solvay Solexis (previously Ausimont) for similar  cartel violations.

TD
Solvay announced on May 3, 2006 that the  fine is excessive and it will analyse the EC decision intending to challenge it before the European Union Tribunal of first instance in Luxembourg.  Solvay ( www.solvay.com ) added that the financial reserves from 2004 and 2005 will cover the  fine and will not affect the first quarter or the full year results for 2006.

EC fined seven companies 388.1 mln euro ($489.8 mln) for  cartel violations including Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV, French oil group Total SA (Elf Aquitaine and Arkema), Finnish chemicals group Kemira and Italian chemical and fiber manufacturer Snia, but German specialty chemical group Degussa AG's  fine was waived due to full cooperation in providing  cartel specifics.

According to the EC the companies traded commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market share and customers, monitored (target) prices and fixed the price of HP and PBS in the European Economic Area (EEA) between 1994 and 2000.

Cartels in the HP and PBS market involving Degussa,  Solvay, Atochem (now Arkema) and French industrial and medical gases group Air Liquide SA were already sanctioned in 1984 by a  Commission Decision.

In 2000, the combined EEA market value for HP and PBS was estimated at about 470 mln euro ($593.5 mln).

(Editor's note: HP is an oxidising agent used for  bleaching pulp in paper manufacturing industry, disinfection and environmental applications such as sewage treatment. HP is a raw material of downstream peroxigen products such as persalts, which include PBS an active ingredient in synthetic detergents and washing powders.)

EUR388 million for running a  cartel in bleaching chemicals.

The offenders included some of the biggest names in the global chemical industry, including  Solvay SA (SOLB.BT),  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), Total SA (TOT) and FMC Corp. (FMC). [ 03-05-06 0927GMT ]

In a statement, the  Commission said the companies "exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices" between 1994 and 2000.

Germany's Degussa AG (DGX.XE) was given immunity for providing information about the  cartel. Otherwise, the  Commission said, it would have been  fined.

French company L'Air Liquide SA (12007.FR) also would have been  fined, but was spared because it exited from the business in 1998.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders," said E.U. Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue." [ 03-05-06 0936GMT ]

The company hit hardest was Belgium's  Solvay, which was fined EUR167 million and faces payments of a further EUR58.1 million for offenses by an Italian unit it bought from Edison SpA (EDN.MI). Total was fined EUR78.7 million, Kemira Oyj (KRA1V.HE) EUR33 million,  Akzo Nobel EUR25.2 million, FMC EUR25 million and Snia SpA (SN.MI) EUR1.1 million.

The cartel focused on an oxidizing agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment. A similar cartel, involving Degussa, Solvay, Total and L'Air Liquide, had already been uncovered and banned in 1984 by the Commission.

The Commission estimated that the market value for the products involved was EUR470 million when the cartel ended in 2000.
In December 2002, Degussa applied to the  Commission for immunity. Subsequently, the  Commission
carried out inspections at Total and  Solvay in March 2003.

It uncovered records of a meeting between competitors in early 1995, which referred to discussion of "a model for sharing out among producers." At a meeting in a Brussels restaurant on November 26, 1997, the Commission said participants discussed and scheduled price increases.

Records of another high-level meeting in early 1998 show that participants welcomed the implementation of these price increases.
The Commission said it increased the  fines by 50% for those undertakings that are repeat  cartel
offenders.

(Updates a story published at 0927 GMT with company comments.)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined seven companies a total of
EUR388 million for running a  cartel in bleaching chemicals.

TD
The offenders included some of the biggest names in the global chemical industry, including  Solvay SA (SOLB.BT),  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), Total SA (TOT) and FMC Corp. (FMC).

In a statement, the  Commission said the companies "exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices" between 1994 and 2000.

Germany's Degussa AG (DGX.XE) was given immunity for providing information about the  cartel. Otherwise, the  Commission said, it would also have been  fined.

French company L'Air Liquide SA (12007.FR) would have been  fined as well, but was spared because it exited from the business in 1998.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders," said E.U. Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

The company hit hardest was Belgium's  Solvay, which was fined EUR167 million and faces payments of a further EUR58.1 million for offenses by an Italian unit it bought from Edison SpA (EDN.MI).

Total was  fined EUR78.7 million. Kemira Oyj (KRA1V.HE) EUR33 million,  Akzo Nobel EUR25.2 million, FMC EUR25 million and Snia SpA (SN.MI) EUR1.1 million.

Solvay said later it is considering appealing the decision. Kemira and  Akzo Nobel also said they may consider an appeal.

"The sanction does not seem to integrate appropriately the arguments put forward by  Solvay," the chemicals company said in a statement. "Consequently,  Solvay considers the fine as excessive and will analyze the decision with the intention to challenge it before the EU Tribunal of first instance in Luxembourg." It said it has sufficient provisions to cover the  fine.
Total declined to comment on the ruling.

The cartel focused on hydrogen peroxide,  an oxidizing agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment.

A similar cartel, involving Degussa, Solvay, Total and L'Air Liquide, had already been uncovered and banned in 1984 by the Commission.

The Commission estimated that the market value for the products involved was EUR470 million when the cartel ended in 2000.

In December 2002, Degussa applied to the  Commission for immunity. Subsequently, the  Commission
carried out inspections at Total and  Solvay in March 2003.
It uncovered records of a meeting between competitors in early 1995, which referred to a discussion of
"a model for sharing out among producers." At a meeting in a Brussels restaurant on November 26,
1997, the  Commission said participants discussed and scheduled price increases.

Records of another high-level meeting in early 1998 show that participants welcomed the implementation of these price increases.
The Commission said it increased the  fines by 50% for those undertakings that are repeat  cartel
offenders.

Akzo Nobel CEO Hans Wijers "Following the recent resolution of the hydrogen peroxide  investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, today's decision by the EU Commission brings us closer to resolving all previous breaches of competition law," said . "We will, of course, have to study the full
decision--which is expected within the next few weeks--before we can comment in detail and decide whether or not to file an appeal. I do want to reiterate, however, that we regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again. Indeed, we operate a zero tolerance policy for those who take part in any anticompetitive behavior."

Akzo Nobel Chief Executive Hans Wijers said in a later statement that the company is committed to ensuring such events don't recur. "We operate a zero tolerance policy for those who take part in any anticompetitive behavior," he said.

(This updates an item published at 0927 GMT, with more E.U. comment.)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined seven companies a total of
EUR388 million for running a  cartel in bleaching chemicals.

TD
The offenders included some of the biggest names in the global chemical industry, including  Solvay SA (SOLB.BT),  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), Total SA (TOT) and FMC Corp. (FMC).

In a statement, the  commission said the companies "exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices" between 1994 and 2000.

Germany's Degussa AG (DGX.XE) was given immunity for providing information about the  cartel. Otherwise, the  commission said, it would also have been  fined.

French company L'Air Liquide SA (12007.FR) would have been  fined as well, but was spared because it exited from the business in 1998.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders," said E.U. Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

The company hit hardest was Belgium's  Solvay, which was fined EUR167 million and faces payments of a further EUR58.1 million for offenses by an Italian unit it bought from Edison SpA (EDN.MI).

Total was  fined EUR78.7 million. Kemira Oyj (KRA1V.HE) EUR33 million,  Akzo Nobel EUR25.2 million, FMC EUR25 million and Snia SpA (SN.MI) EUR1.1 million.

Solvay said later it is considering appealing the decision, calling the  fines "excessive." Kemira and Akzo Nobel also said they may consider an appeal.  Akzo Nobel Chief Executive Hans Wijers said in a statement the company is committed to ensuring such events don't recur. "We operate a zero-tolerance policy for those who take part in any anticompetitive behavior," he said.
Total declined to comment on the ruling.

The cartel focused on hydrogen peroxide,  an oxidizing agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment.

A similar cartel, involving Degussa, Solvay, Total and L'Air Liquide, had already been uncovered and banned in 1984 by the commission.
The commission estimated the market value for the products involved was EUR470 million when the
cartel ended in 2000.
In December 2002, Degussa applied to the  commission for immunity. Subsequently, the  commission
carried out inspections at Total and  Solvay in March 2003.

It uncovered records of a meeting between competitors in early 1995, which referred to a discussion of "a model for sharing out among producers." At a meeting in a Brussels restaurant on Nov. 26, 1997, the commission said participants discussed and scheduled price increases.

Records of another high-level meeting in early 1998 show that participants welcomed the implementation of these price increases.
The commission said companies that were repeat  cartel offenders had their  fines increased by 50%. E.U. spokesman Jonathan Todd said this was the third-largest  cartel fine ever levied by the European
Commission.

The European Commission said Wednesday it was fining seven companies 388 million euros (490 million dollars) for running a cartel in the market for  bleaching chemicals.

The EU competitions regulator found that the companies had broken EU  cartel rules in the market for

In reaction, it slapped the  fine on Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, Edison of Italy, FMC Foret of the
United States, Kemira of Finland, Snia of Italy,  Solvay of Belgium and Arkema of France.
German group Degussa escaped  fines because it informed on the  cartel, and French company Air
Liquide was not fined because it left the market 1998.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the single market," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The European Commission said Wednesday it was fining seven companies 388 million euros (490 million dollars) for running a cartel in the market for  bleaching chemicals.

TD
The EU competitions regulator found that the companies had broken EU  cartel rules in the
470-million-euro market for  hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  between 1994 and 2000.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the single market," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue," she added. The biggest individual  fine went to Solvay of Belgium with 167 million euros, plus 26 million euros from a
joint venture with Italian firm Edison that it has since bought out.
The company slammed its  fine as excessive and vowed therefore lodge an appeal before an EU court.

Solvay was followed by Arkema of France with a fine of 79 million euros, Edison of Italy with 58 million euros, Kemira of Finland with 33 million euros, Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands and FMC Foret of the United States both with 25 million euros. Snia of Italy was  fined one million euros.
German group Degussa escaped  fines because it informed on the  cartel, and French company Air
Liquide was not fined because it left the market in 1998.

The EU competition watchdog said it had imposed tougher  fines on Arkema, Edison and  Solvay because they were repeat offenders.

The decision to crack down on the companies was based on evidence from a 1995 meeting where the rivals held talks about "a model for sharing out among producers," a commissiion statement said.

It pointed to further evidence from a 1997 meeting in a Brussels restaurant to coordinate price increases and a 1998 gathering where high-level company officials congratulated themselves on how well the arrangement was working.

HD      EC fines seven companies $490 million for bleach chemicals cartel

The European Commission has reprimanded nine companies for participating in cartels in the  hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  markets and fined seven of these offenders total of Eur388.13 million ($490.46 million), the EC announced Wednesday. The nine companies are  Akzo Nobel, Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia,  Solvay, Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema, Degussa and Air Liquide.

Out of the nine companies, Arkema, Solvay, Edison and Degussa "were repeat offenders," the EC statement said. As a result, Arkema, Solvay and Edison had their  fines increased, while Degussa escaped the penalty as it received full immunity for providing information about the cartel. Air Liquide
(and its subsidiary Chemoxal) is subject to the prohibition decision, but the Commission's right to impose
fines has expired as the company left the market in 1998, the statement said.

TD
The EC said this  cartel was in clear violation of EC Treaty rules against restrictive business practices (Article 81). The nine companies exchanged, what the EC described as "commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices" of HP and PBS in the European Economic Area between 1994 and 2000.

HP is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment. HP is also the raw material for the production of downstream peroxigen products, such as persalts (which include PBS). PBS is used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders. In 2000, the combined EEA market value for HP and PBS was estimated at about Eur470 million.
In December 2002, Degussa applied to the  Commission for immunity from  fines from. Subsequently,
the Commission carried out inspections at Atofina (Arkema) and  Solvay in March 2003, which triggered
applications for reduction of  fines by several undertakings.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the Single Market," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."
DETAILED EVIDENCE

The EC said that the essence of this infringement can be seen from the record of a meeting between competitors in early 1995 which referred to discussion of "a model for sharing out among producers."

At a meeting in a Brussels restaurant on November 26, 1997, the participants discussed the implementation and assessment of price increases agreed at a high-level meeting in August 1997 and scheduled further price increases, the EC said.

Records of another high level meeting in early 1998 show that participants welcomed the good implementation of the price increase of October/November 1997 and verified whether they had all stuck to the implementation guidelines fixed during this and earlier meetings, the EC said.

FINES



Page 30 of 73 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
According to the  Commission, the fines fixed took into account the size of the EEA market, the duration of the cartel and the size of the firms involved. The  Commission said it increased the  fines by 50% for those undertakings that are repeat  cartel offenders.

Degussa, which applied and was granted full immunity, had its  fine, which would otherwise have been Eur129.94 million, wiped off, while  Akzo/EKA, Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema and  Solvay had their fines reduced in return for information provided. The EC said the granting of  fine reductions depended "not only on the value of the information provided but also on its timing." In this case, the EC said various applications were made "within a matter of days or even hours from each other."

For Air Liquide, although the five-years prescription period to attribute  fines had elapsed when the Commission started the investigation, the  Commission nevertheless adopted a decision against Air Liquide. The Commission said Air Liquide had participated in the previous  cartel in the sector, and "there is ample evidence of Air Liquide's participation in the infringement until its market exit in 1998 and its role was similar to that of the other parties." Although there was no  fine imposed, the decision against Air Liquide can help injured parties to bring claims before national courts against all  cartel participants, the EC said.
Below is a table of the  fines imposed and reductions granted by the  Commission:

(Adds reaction from companies, recasts, repeats to fix typo in para 1)

BRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission slapped fines totalling 388 million euros ($491 million) on seven chemical companies on Wednesday for fixing prices in what it said was a "very serious infringement" of competition rules.

TD
The fines amounted to the third-biggest total imposed on an industry so far by the European Union's top antitrust regulator.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the single market," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue," she said.

A total of nine companies formed a  cartel for hydrogen peroxide  and perborate,  used for bleaching, as far back as 1994, and they agreed to raise prices again at a meeting in a Brussels restaurant in 1997, the European Commission said.

Belgium's Solvay , which faced the biggest  fine of 193 million euros as a "repeat offender", said it had prepared for the fine by setting aside reserves in 2004 and 2005 but that the amount was excessive and it intended to appeal.
"The fine will not affect our results," said Martial Tardy, a spokesman for  Solvay. Its shares were down
0.48 percent at 1137 GMT, in line with the decline in the pan-European blue chip index <.FTEU3>.

The company blamed the  cartel finding on the "reprehensible behaviour of some individuals" and said it was committed to healthy competition.

Solvay also had to pay a fine of 35 million euros to U.S antitrust authorities earlier this year for its part in a
cartel for peroxygen products uncovered by Washington.
PROVIDED FOR

The other firms  fined by the Commission on Wednesday were Dutch chemical group  Akzo Nobel , Italian utility Edison , Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema , Finnish chemical group Kemira , Snia of Italy and FMC/Foret of Spain.

Kemira said it would consider whether to take further action over its  fine of 33 million euros but that it had already made provisions to cover it.

Akzo Nobel said it would study the full decision before deciding whether to appeal but noted that it had already made a provision in 2005 that accounted for its share of the total, 25.2 million euros.

"We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again. Indeed, we operate a zero tolerance policy for those who take part in any anticompetitive behaviour," Chief Executive Hans Wijers said in a statement.
Several of the other companies declined to comment.

German chemical group Degussa was a "repeat offender" but escaped being  fined 130 million euros after it provided information about the  cartel, the Commission said.
Air Liquide and its subsidiary Chemoxal could not be  fined because the company had left the market in
1989, and the  Commission's right to impose financial penalties had expired.

The Commission said the companies exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and also fixed target prices of  hydrogen          peroxide  and perborate.
Other repeat offenders, whose  fines were increased, were Arkema and Edison.

Hydrogen peroxide  is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment.

Perborate is used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders.

In 2000, the combined market value in the European Economic Area, where the  cartel was found to be operating, was estimated at about 470 million euros for both products. (Additional reporting by Emma Davis in Brussels and Arild Moen in Helsinki and Emma Thomasson in Amsterdam.) [20060503 114223

The European  Commission continued its clampdown on  cartel activity on 3 May when it slapped  fines totalling 388 million on seven companies which participated in cartels in the  hydrogen peroxide  (HP) and perborate  (PBS) markets.

The EU competition watchdog found that nine companies exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored prices in the chemicals markets between 1994 and 2000.

TD
Solvay suffered the biggest  fine of 167 million followed by Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema ( 79 million). The other companies fined were Edison, now  Solvay Solexis ( 58 million), Kemira ( 33 million), FMC Corporation ( 25 million),  Akzo Nobel ( 25 million) and Snia ( 1 million).

Arkema, Edison and  Solvay had their fines increased because they were repeat offenders, but two further companies involved in the cartel were not fined. Degussa was immune because it furnished Brussels with information relating to the  cartel, and the  Commission was unable to impose a  fine on cartel member Air Liquide because it left the market for these chemicals in 1998.

The Commission's investigations into the sector originated in March 2003 when it carried out inspections at Atofina (now Arkema) after it received information from Degussa in return for immunity from  fines. The evidence for cartel activity came from records of meeting held between 1995 and 1998 - including one at a restaurant in Brussels - in which the companies discussed sharing the market out among themselves and agreed price increases for their products. In a meeting in 1998 the participants discussed how well they had all stuck to a plan to implement the price increases.

The Commission said that the  cartel was "a very serious infringement", that its  fines had taken into account the size of the market and the duration of the  cartel, and that the repeat-offending companies' fines had been doubled.

Degussa was granted full immunity from a fine - which would otherwise have been 129.938 million - but Akzo Nobel, Total/Elf Aquitaine, Arkema and Solvay also had their fines reduced in return for information provided under the  Commission's Leniency Notice.

Although Air Liquide left the market for HP in 1998 the  Commission said it had adopted a formal decision against the company anyway because this would enable third parties claiming injury as a result of the cartel to bring legal action for redress before their national courts.

Any individual or company can seek damages in this way citing the  Commission's decision as evidence for the cartel activity, and national courts may not reduce any damages awarded on account of the  fines imposed by the Commission on the companies.

HP is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment. PBS is used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders. The combined EEA market value for HP and PBS is estimated at about 470 million.

A Commission Decision in 1984 prohibited a  cartel in HP and PBS involving Degussa,  Solvay, Atochem
(now Arkema) and Air Liquide.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour that deprive customers of the benefits of the Single Market. These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

All cartel decisions by the Commission may be appealed against before the Court of First Instance and then before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. They can, therefore, be closely scrutinised by these two courts, which are empowered to reduce or increase  fines, where this is deemed appropriate.

This fine is the highest imposed on a sector in the last three years, but it does not match  fines imposed in the last six years on the vitamins sector ( 791 million in 2001) and the plasterboard sector ( 478 million in 2002).

The European  Commission yesterday slapped fines totalling Euros 388m (Dollars 491m) on seven companies involved in a chemicals  cartel, one of the highest financial penalties imposed by the regulator.

Solvay of Belgium bore the brunt of the punishment, and was ordered to pay Euros 167m. It will also have to pay the Euros 58m penalty imposed on Edison-Ausimont, an Italian company it acquired in
2002.

TD
France's Total was  fined Euros 79m and Finland's Kemira Euros 33m, while Dutch group  Akzo Nobel and Spain's FMC were ordered to pay Euros 25m each, and Snia of Italy Euros 1m.

Degussa, the German chemicals group and another member of the  cartel, escaped what would have been a Euros 130m  fine, in exchange for its role as whistleblower.

Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said: "These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

The chemicals industry has repeatedly been the subject of  cartel investigations, and already accounted for some of the most spectacular  fines. Yesterday's Euros 388m was the third-highest imposed by the Commission; at least one company, Edison-Ausimont, received the maximum penalty, equivalent to 10 per cent of global annual turn- over.

The Brussels regulator said the companies had conspired to allocate market share and fix prices in the market for hydrogen peroxide  and perborates - bleaching chemicals used in textiles production, disinfection and in synthetic detergents.
The combined market was worth about Euros 470m in 2000, the  Commission said.

The Commission found evidence of several meetings to discuss the workings of the  cartel, including one in a Brussels restaurant in November 1997 at which the companies discussed price increases.

Solvay said it had set aside sufficient reserves to cover the fines, and it expected no impact on its
first-quarter results. It was considering an appeal, arguing Solvay's co-operation had not been properly
taken into account.

Hans Wijers,  Akzo Nobel chief executive, said: "We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct and are fully committed to ensuring that events such as this do not occur again."
Kemira said it would look into the decision and then decide on any further action.

HD          Europe Fines 7 Chemical Firms $489.8 Million  for Bleach Cartel

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined seven companies a total of 388.1 million euros ($489.8 million) for running a cartel in bleaching chemicals, and the offenders included some of the biggest names in the global chemicals industry.

The commission said between 1994-2000,  Solvay SA of Belgium,  Akzo Nobel NV of the Netherlands, Total SA of France and FMC Corp. of Philadelphia "exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored prices."

TD
The commission estimated the market value for the products involved was 470 million euros when the cartel ended. Germany's Degussa AG was given immunity for providing information about the  cartel, and would have been fined otherwise, the  commission said. French company L'Air Liquide SA would have been fined, too, but was spared because it left the business in 1998.

The commission said two of the companies, Solvay and Total, had their  fines increased 50% because they were repeat offenders.  Solvay was fined 167 million euros and faces payments of a further 58.1 million euros for offenses by an Italian unit it bought from Edison SpA. Total was  fined
78.7 million euros.

Kemira Oyj of Finland was  fined 33 million euros, Akzo Nobel 25.2 million euros, FMC 25 million euros and Snia SpA of Italy was  fined 1.1 million euros. Solvay said it is considering appealing the decision, calling the  fines "excessive." Kemira and Akzo Nobel also said they might consider appealing. Total declined to comment.
The cartel focused on hydrogen peroxide,  an oxidizing agent used in the pulp- and
paper-manufacturing industries for bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental
applications such as sewage treatment.

In March Akzo Nobel and Solvay agreed to plead guilty and pay $73 million as part of a continuing U.S. Justice Department probe into international price-fixing in the chemicals industry.  Akzo Nobel was assessed $32 million for fixing hydrogen peroxide  and Solvay agreed to pay $41 million for
fixing the price of sodium perborates, another chemical used as a cleansing agent. Justice Department officials said these were the first charges to come out of its probe into markets for these two chemicals.

German chemicals company Degussa has escaped a  fine imposed by the European  Commission on seven chemicals groups in connection with cartels on the market for  bleach, as it notified the authorities of the cartel. The total  fine amounts to over 388.1m euros; Belgian company Solvay has received the highest fine of 167m euros, while Italian group Snia has been given the lowest fine of just 1m euros. In total, nine companies were involved in the cartel, which operated between 1994 and 2000. French group Air Liquide has also escaped without a fine as it has not been involved in business with  bleach since
1998.

The nine companies in the  cartel have been found to have exchanged confidential information, limited production, divided up the market and their customers and set target prices.

SEVEN chemicals companies were  fined almost Euro 400 million (Pounds 274 million) yesterday after the European  Commission found them guilty of operating an illegal  cartel that pushed up prices for consumers in Britain and across the Continent.
The penalty is the third- highest that the Brussels regulator has slapped on companies for breaking the
European Union's antitrust rules.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

A Commission spokesman added: "British and other housewives have been paying more for their washing powder because these companies were involved in  price-fixing practices."

The companies, none of them British, operated a  cartel in the hydrogen peroxide  and perborate markets. Hydrogen peroxide  is an oxidising agent used for bleaching paper and textiles and for disinfection and environmental applications such as sewage treatment.  Perborate is a common substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders.

After a series of dawn raids three years ago, the  Commission uncovered the records of a meeting held in early 1995 in which the competitors discussed "a model for sharing out among producers".

At a subsequent gathering in 1997, the group examined the implementation of price rises agreed earlier and scheduled further increases.

The companies involved were: Degussa, of Germany;  Solvay, of Belgium; Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema, of France;  Akzo Nobel, of the Netherlands; FMC Corporation/Foret, of the United States and Spain; Kemira, of Finland; Edison, of Italy; and Snia/Caffaro, of Italy.

Details of the exchanges of information between the companies first began to emerge three years ago. They included production limits, allocated market shares and customers, and fixed and target prices. In
2002, Degussa approached the  Commission offering to provide information in exchange for immunity. The move enabled the company to avoid a potential Euro 130 million penalty.

The heaviest individual penalty fell on Solvay, which was fined Euro 167 million, followed by Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema with Euro 78 million. Fines on the other five members ranged from Euro 1 million to Euro 58 million. The ninth company involved, L'Air Liquide, avoided any punishment since it had left the market in 1998.

Solvay described the fine as "excessive" and said that it would consider an appeal.

European Union regulators have  fined seven chemical companies, including FMC Corp. of the U.S., a total of 388 million euros ($491 million) for running a  bleach cartel in the 1990s.

The European Commission said the high fines reflected the fact that two of the companies -- Total SA's Arkema, Belgium's Solvay SA and Edison SPA -- were repeat offenders and it increased their fines by 50 per cent.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behaviour," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Fines for seven companies of €388.128 million for bleaching chemicals cartels

Brussels, 03/05/2006 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday the European  Commission decided to fine seven companies €388.128 million for  bleaching chemicals cartels. Nine companies exchanged commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices of HP and PBS in the European Economic Area (EEA) between 1994 and 2000. Two of these companies escaped  fines: Degussa would have been  fined if it had not received full immunity for providing information about the cartel. L'Air Liquide (and its subsidiary Chemoxal) is subject to the prohibition decision, but the Commission's right to impose  fines has expired as the company left the market in 1998.  Fines were imposed on Akzo Nobel (€ 25.2 millions), Edison (€
58.125 millions), FMC/Foret (€ 25 million), Kemira (€ 33 million), Snia (€ 1.078 million),  Solvay (€ 167.062 million) and Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema (€ 78.663 million).

TD
Arkema, formerly Atofina,  Solvay and Edison are repeat offenders and saw their  fines increase by 50%.

HP is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment. HP is also the raw material for the production of downstream peroxigen products, such as persalts (which include PBS). PBS is used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders. Cartels in HP and PBS involving Degussa,  Solvay, Atochem (now Arkema) and L'Air Liquide were already prohibited by a 1984
Commission Decision. In 2000, the combined EEA market value for HP and PBS was estimated at about
€470 million. During its investigation the  Commission got hold of the record of a meeting between
competitors in early 1995 which referred to discussion of “a model for sharing out among producers”.
Records of other high level meetings in 1997 and 1998 show that participants welcomed the good
implementation of the price increase of October/November 1997 and verified whether they had all stuck to
the implementation guidelines. In a press release the  Commission points out that anybody or any
company affected by uncompetitive behaviour of this kind can begin proceedings for damages and interest
at courts in the Member States.

The European Commission fined seven chemical companies 388 million euros ($489 million) for participating for six years in a price-fixing cartel in the markets for hydrogen peroxide  and perborate, two bleaching agents. The Belgian chemicals group  Solvay was fined the most, 167 million euros, because it had been found guilty of participating in several cartels, the commission said. Degussa escaped a fine because it was the first to inform the  commission about the cartel. Air Liquide also escaped a fine because it quit the markets involved in 1998, two years before the cartel was broken
up. PAUL MELLER (NYT)

HD      CHEMICALS : SOLVAY TO CONTEST COMMISSION'S FINE WC     262 words

Belgian chemicals giant  Solvay is to appeal against the European  Commission's 3 May decision to  fine its 193 million for being part of a  cartel in the hydrogen peroxide  sector in the European Union, dating back to the end of the 1990s. The amount includes 26 million for Solvay Solexis SA (called Ausimont SpA before 2002), jointly and severally with Edison SpA (see Europolitics 3078).

In a press release issued the same day,  Solvay explains that "the reserves constituted in 2004 and 2005 on the basis of our understanding of the European  Commission's statement of objections cover the amount of the  fine. Consequently the  fine will not affect the first-quarter results that will be announced on
9 May, nor 2006 results as a whole".

TD
The company also added that it has been actively cooperating with the European Commission in the course of its enquiry and yet the Group feels that despite this cooperation the fine does not fully reflect the arguments put forward by Solvay. Consequently,  Solvay considers the fine to be excessive and intends to analyse the Commission Decision with the intention of appealing to the EU Court of first instance in Luxembourg.
The situation results from reprehensible behaviour of some individuals and is contrary to rules and
policies of the Group which condemns illegal cartels and is committed to healthy competition.  Solvay has
reinforced its internal compliance program aimed at ensuring complete conformity with competition law.
The chemical and pharmaceutical group recorded consolidated sales worth 8.6 billion in 2005.

HD        EC fines seven companies $490 million for bleach chemicals cartel

The European Commission has reprimanded nine companies for participating in cartels in the hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  markets and fined seven of these offenders a total of Eur388.13 million ($490.46 million), the EC said May 3. The nine companies are  Akzo Nobel, Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia,  Solvay, Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema, Degussa and Air Liquide.

Out of the nine companies, Arkema, Solvay, Edison and Degussa "were repeat offenders," the EC statement said. As a result, Arkema, Solvay and Edison had their  fines increased, while Degussa escaped the penalty as it received full immunity for providing information about the cartel. Air Liquide (and its subsidiary Chemoxal) is subject to the prohibition decision, but the Commission's right to impose fines has expired as the company left the market in 1998, the statement said.

TD
The EC said this  cartel was in clear violation of EC Treaty rules against restrictive business practices (Article 81). The nine companies exchanged, what the EC described as "commercially important and confidential information, limited production, allocated market shares and customers and fixed and monitored (target) prices" of HP and PBS in the European Economic Area between 1994 and 2000.

HP is an oxidising agent used in the pulp and paper manufacturing industries for  bleaching textiles, disinfection and other environmental applications such as sewage treatment. HP is also the raw material for the production of downstream peroxigen products, such as persalts (which include PBS). PBS is
used mainly as an active substance in synthetic detergents and washing powders. In 2000, the combined EEA market value for HP and PBS was estimated at about Eur470 million.

"Cartels are unacceptable corporate behavior that deprive customers of the benefits of the Single Market," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders. Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

The EC said that the essence of this infringement can be seen from the record of a meeting between competitors in early 1995 which referred to discussion of "a model for sharing out among producers."

At a meeting in a Brussels restaurant on November 26, 1997, the participants discussed the implementation and assessment of price increases agreed at a high-level meeting in August 1997 and scheduled further price increases, the EC said. Records of another high level meeting in early 1998 show that participants welcomed the good implementation of the price increase of October/November
1997 and verified whether they had all stuck to the implementation guidelines fixed during this and earlier meetings, the EC said.
According to the Commission, the fines fixed took into account the size of the EEA market, the
duration of the cartel and the size of the firms involved. The  Commission said it increased the  fines by
50% for those undertakings that are repeat  cartel offenders.

Degussa, which applied and was granted full immunity, had its  fine — which would otherwise have been Eur129.94 million — wiped off, while  Akzo/EKA, Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema and  Solvay had their fines reduced in return for information provided. The EC said the granting of  fine reductions depended "not

Page 52 of 73 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
only on the value of the information provided but also on its timing." In this case, the EC said various applications were made "within a matter of days or even hours from each other."

While the five-year prescription period to attribute  fines had elapsed when the Commission started the investigation, the  Commission nevertheless adopted a decision against Air Liquide. The Commission said Air Liquide had participated in the previous  cartel in the sector, and "there is ample evidence of Air Liquide's participation in the infringement until its market exit in 1998 and its role was similar to that of
the other parties." Although there was no  fine imposed, the decision against Air Liquide can help injured parties to bring claims before national courts against all  cartel participants, the EC said.

Fines imposed and reductions granted by the  Commission:

2) Solvay 10 167.062

THE EUROPEAN Commission (EC) has fined seven companies a total of Ä388 million ($490 million), the third-largest sectoral fine imposed by the EC, for participation in a  bleaching chemicals cartel between 1994 and 2000.

Akzo Nobel, Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia, Solvay and Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema, which all received
fines, were seven of nine participants in the hydrogen peroxide  and perborate cartel.

TD
Degussa, a repeat offender, received full immunity for providing details about the  cartel. The EC's right to impose fines on Air Liquide had expired as the company left the market in 1998.

Edison and Solvay had their fines increased as they were repeat offenders, making the latter's Ä167 million fine (even after being reduced from $196 million for cooperating) the fifth-largest ever imposed on a single company by the EC.

Solvay's fine included Ä26 million for  Solvay Solexis (Ausimont SpA before 2002), jointly with Edison.

"These high  fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders," said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. "Directors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue."

"Solvay has been actively cooperating with the European Commission in the course of its enquiry," the company said. "Despite the frankness of its timely cooperation with the Commission, the group believes that the sanction does not seem to integrate appropriately the arguments put forward by  Solvay."

"Consequently,  Solvay considers the fine as excessive and will analyze the decision with the intention to challenge it before the EU Tribunal of First Instance in Luxembourg," it added.

Kemira, which was  fined Ä33 million for antitrust activity in its  hydrogen peroxide  business, said, "The company will look into the Commission's decision and then decide on any further action. Provisions made by the company will cover for the fine set by the Commission."

The EC's proceedings against the  hydrogen peroxide cartel started in January last year. Kemira was the only company to publicly announce it was being investigated at the time.

Edison,  Akzo Nobel, FMC/Foret, Snia, Kemira, Solvay and Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema have been  fined a total of EUR 388 M by the European Commission for running a bleaching chemicals cartel from 1994 to
2000. The participants in the hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  cartel totalled nine companies but only seven were charged. Degussa exposed the cartel and obtained full immunity while Air Liquide was also excluded since it left the market in 1998. Since Total, Edison and  Solvay were repeat offenders, their fines were increased to EUR 79 M, EUR 58 M and EUR 167 M respectively.  Solvay, which has been cooperating with the investigation, had made provisions for a potential fine, which will not affect its 1Q

The European  Commission has fined seven companies Ä388m for operating a bleaching chemicals cartel between 1994 and 2000. Akzo Nobel, Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia, Solvay and Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema, all received fines. These were seven of nine participants in the hydrogen peroxide and perborate  cartel. Degussa blew the whistle on the companies and received full immunity. The Commission was unable to fine Air Liquide because the company left the market in 1998.

Total, Edison and Solvay had their fines increased as they were repeat offenders.  Solvay's Ä167.062m is the fifth-highest fine that has been imposed on a single company by the EC.

ëThese high fines take into account that certain companies are repeat offenders,' says Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. ëDirectors and shareholders alike should ask why these practices were allowed to continue.'

HD            Solvay New CEO Jourquin Will Keep Current Strategy

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Belgian pharma and chemical firm  Solvay SA's (SOLB.BT) incoming Chief Executive Christian Jourquin said Tuesday he will stick to the company's current corporate strategy of moving from basic commodity chemicals to more value-added products.

Speaking after an annual general shareholder meeting, Jourquin said: "We have adopted a clear strategy which is well understood in the business world. We will continue the same way."

TD
Jourquin is replacing CEO Alois Michielsen. [ 09-05-06 1624GMT ]

Solvay, founded in the 19th century, is shedding its commodity chemicals and plastics business in favor of investing in specialty polymers and pharmaceuticals, as well as more rapid development of pharma and specialist polymers.

"The company is moving toward less cyclical activities," Jourquin said. He refused to give details on the outlook for the full year, sticking to the company's general previous guidance that it will be better than the previous year.

Earlier Tuesday,  Solvay reported that first-quarter net profit fell 26% on year, due to restructuring costs and one-off charges.

The group's first quarter net profit was EUR238 million, down from EUR325 million a year earlier, the company said. This was due to EUR88 million in one-off charges, including EUR77 million for restructuring costs.

E.U. regulators last week hit the company with an EUR193 million antitrust  fine for allegedly running a cartel to fix the price of  bleach. Jourquin said, "the size of the  fine goes far beyond what we could have expected," making "the chances of an appeal very, very high."

He said the company still hadn't received the formal decision from the European  Commission. He also insisted that the company faced no other potential antitrust  fines.

On a more upbeat note, Jourquin said the company was now benefiting from recent acquisitions, including last year's buy of France's Fournier pharmaceuticals.
"We are now going to increase our acquisitions in pharma," he said.

He said the company was looking to grow especially in the booming economies of China and India, but was also interested in South America and Russia
"We need to speed up development in those countries," Jourquin said.

HD      Hydrogen peroxide: 7 producers fined EUR 388 M by Brussels. WC    253 words

The European  Commission has fined 7 hydrogen peroxide  and sodium perborate  producers (Akzo Nobel, Edison, FMC/Foret, Kemira, Snia, Solvay and Arkema) a total of EUR 388 M for having participated in a  price-fixing cartel between 1994-2000. This fine is the largest imposed by Brussels for
3.5 years. It is also the third largest imposed by the Commission on a cartel. Degussa and Air Liquide, who were also implicated, will not be penalized as Degussa denounced the cartel and Air Liquide left the sector in 1998. Arkema,  Solvay and Edison all had their fines increased by 50% because of recidivism. By company the  fines are as follows: EUR 167 M for Solvay; EUR 78.66 M for Arkema; EUR 25.2 M for Akzo Nobel; EUR 25 M for FMC; EUR 33 M for Kemira; EUR 58.1 M for Ausimont (Edison's former subsidiary); and EUR 1 M for Snia. As Ausimont is a subsidiary of  Solvay, Solvay's total  fine will be EUR
193 M. Degussa would have been  fined EUR 130 M.

TD
These fines will not protect the companies from further legal action from companies who consider their own businesses to have been damaged as a result of the  cartel. Solvay has already declared it will appeal against the ruling and Kemira is considering its position. Both groups have indicated that they had already made provisions for the  fines.

The European Commission has fined seven companies a combined E388 million for conspiring to fix prices of hydrogen peroxide  and sodium perborate  in Western Europe between 1994 and 2000.  Solvay and Total received the highest fines, E193 million and E79 million respectively, because they are "repeat offenders." The  commission also fined Kemira E33 million;  Akzo Nobel E25 million; FMC Foret, an FMC subsidiary, E25 million; and Caffaro, a subsidiary of Snia E1 million. However, the  commission did not fine Degussa or Air Liquide, which it says also participated in the  cartel.

TOP STORIES

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) -- Inventories at U.S. wholesalers increased by 0.2% in March, while sales climbed 0.7%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
The inventory-to-sales ratio fell to 1.16 from 1.17 in February.

Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had been expecting a 0.5% rise in inventories in February. February's inventory gain was revised to 0.9% from 0. 8% earlier.

CHICAGO (XFN-ASIA) -- McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday that spicy and premium chicken sandwiches in the U.S. and Europe fed April's strong sales results.

On a comparable-store basis -- an important industry measure of receipts rung up at stores open longer than a year -- McDonald's turned in a 6.2% rise globally.

CHICAGO (XFN-ASIA) - Time Warner Inc.'s AOL unit said Tuesday that it would cut 1,300 jobs, most of them in conjunction with the shutdown of its Jacksonville, Fla. customer service call center.
The layoffs come less than seven months after AOL eliminated 700 call center jobs.

AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham echoed comments he made after the October job cuts, saying in a statement that the Internet service and content provider is implementing the latest round of layoffs to "better align our resources and continue to respond to a changing marketplace."

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co (EADS) unit Airbus has received 99 orders in the year to date and delivered 142 planes, according to the group's website.
Rival Boeing Co said on its website that orders over the period totalled 325 and deliveries 126.

This brings Airbus' April total to nine orders and 41 deliveries compared to 175 orders and 69 deliveries for Boeing.
Airbus sold only single-aisle planes in April: seven A320s and two A319s.
Since the start of the year, the group has had no new orders for its A380 superjumbo.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - Financial markets operator Euronext NV announced that net profit soared 136.6 pct to a higher-than-expected 107.1 mln eur in the first quarter from 45.3 mln a year earlier, as strong sales growth was matched by steady costs.
Page 63 of 73 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sales jumped 20.5 pct to 268.1 mln eur from 222.6, while costs eased 0.2 pct to 158.4 mln eur from
158.7.
EBITA surged 72 pct to 109.8 mln eur from 63.8 mln, lifting the EBITA margin to 40.9 pct from 72 pct. "Good market activity enabled the company to achieve record revenues and results. Euronexts decision
to concentrate all its IT operations in its joint-venture AEMS and the end of its migration programme led to
a reduction in costs," the company said.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - Bouygues said sales in the first quarter rose 10 pct, as strong French building demand pushed up construction sales, offsetting weak growth in telecoms, hit by regulator-imposed call charge cuts.

The group had first quarter sales of 5.228 bln eur, up from 4.737 bln a year earlier, well ahead of forecasts by Natexis analysts who saw sales at 4. 89 bln eur and Bear Stearns, which had forecast 5.01 bln.
The group gave no guidance.

MILAN (XFN-ASIA) - Edison SpA CEO Umberto Quadrino said during a conference call with analysts that the second quarter will be "better" than the first.

Earlier today, Edison said its first quarter net profit slipped to 67 mln eur from 99 mln in the same period a year earlier, due to a 32 mln charge for an EU antitrust  fine.
The first quarter "has been a good quarter and we believe that the next will be even better", he said. MILAN (XFN-ASIA) - Mediaset SpA said its EBIT slipped to 265.6 mln eur in the first quarter from 344.0
mln a year earlier due to higher costs and stronger year-earlier comparatives.
Analysts polled by AFX News had forecast an EBIT of 265.0-300.0 mln eur.

Analysts said the first quarter of 2005 benefited from a 43.1 mln eur capital gain from the sale of a 1.9 pct stake in Telecinco.

MILAN (XFN-ASIA) - Autostrade SpA's largest shareholder, the Benetton family, will keep its stake in the company created by the planned merger of Autostrade and Abertis Infraestructuras SA, said Luciano Benetton.

Benetton was speaking on the margins of the shareholder meeting of Benetton Group SpA, where he is chairman, and amid political concerns over loss of Italian control of its motorway network.

"The operation (between Autostrade and Abertis) favours the country. Italians will have advantages from it," Benetton said.

HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (XFN-ASIA) - Adidas-Salomon AG revealed consensus-beating first quarter operating profit boosted by rising demand ahead of this summer's football World Cup and a boost in sales due to the consolidation of newly-acquired US brand Reebok.

Operating profit jumped 21 pct to 248 mln eur, beating AFX News' 227 mln consensus forecast, as sales soared 47 pct to a consensus-beating 2.459 bln eur.
MADRID (XFN-ASIA) - DaimlerChrysler AG plans to cut 750 jobs over the next three years at its
Mercedes plants in the Spanish cities of Vitoria and Barcelona, union sources said.

The company's restructuring plan seeks to cut 600 of its 3,400 employees in Vitoria and 150 of its 500 employees at its Barcelona plant, directors told the unions.
BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) -  Solvay SA said it is very likely to appeal a 193 mln eur  fine imposed by the
European Commission for the pharmaceutical group taking part in a  bleaching chemicals cartel.

New chief executive Christian Jourquin told reporters at the group's annual shareholders meeting: "The likelihood that we will appeal the  fine is very high."

BAGHDAD (XFN-ASIA) - Iraq's prime minister-designate Nuri al-Maliki said the line-up for the country's first permanent government of the post-Saddam era was almost ready.

"We will finalize the cabinet today or tomorrow and will present the new government to the parliament this week," he told reporters.

Seven companies have been fined a total of EUR 388 M ($479 M) for running a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium perborate  cartel in Western Europe during 1994-2000. The highest fines were issued by the European Commission to Solvay and Total amounting to EUR 193 M and EUR 79 M, respectively, because they were repeat offenders. Included in  Solvay's fine is EUR 26 M related to the former Ausimont H2O2 business. Edison was charged EUR 32 M, Caffaro EUR 1 M, Kemira EUR 33 M and Akzo Nobel EUR 25 M.  Solvay and Arkema are planning to appeal separately against their  fines at
the European Court of First Instance.  Solvay cooperated with the  commission's investigation but regards its fine as excessive.

On 3 May 2006, seven companies found guilty of participating in cartels for  hydrogen peroxide  and perborate  were fined a total of EUR 388 M by the European  Commission. Between 1994 and 2000, they were found to have fixed prices, allocated shares of the market, limited output and exchanged confidential and commercially important information. The largest fine of EUR 167 M was imposed on  Solvay with Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema being  fined EUR 79 M. Solvay Solexis, formerly known as Edison, was fined EUR 58 M and a fine of EUR 33 M was imposed on Kemira.  Akzo Nobel and FMC Corp were each fined EUR 25 M and Snia was  fined EUR 1 M. No  fine was imposed on Degussa because of its cooperation in the investigation. If it had not been granted immunity, it would have been  fined EUR 129.928 M. Air
Liquide was not fined because in 1998 it ceased to produce these chemicals. The  fines imposed on Solvay, Akzo Nobel, Total/Elf Aquitaine and Arkema were also reduced because of the cooperation they gave.

Combined demand for both chemicals is estimated at EUR 470 M in the EEA market.
