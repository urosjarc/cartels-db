BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators fined four  Italian tobacco  firms 56 million (US$67 million)
on Thursday for running a  cartel to control the price paid to growers.

Italy's four main  tobacco  producers were fined for fixing prices from 1995 to 2000 and rigging bids in public tobacco  auctions in 1995 and 1998.

TD
"Cartel culture must be eradicated from all sectors, and agriculture is no exception," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "As  Italy is the largest producer of raw  tobacco  in Europe, today's decision is all the more significant."

The EU head office ordered Deltafina to pay 30 million (US$36 million), Transcatab to pay 14 million (US$17 million) and Mindo -- previously called Dimon -- 10 million (US$12 million) and Romana Tabacchi 2.05 million (US$2.5 million).
Deltafina had originally been granted immunity for blowing the whistle on the  cartel with Mindo and
Transcatab.

However the European  Commission said Deltafina then told its rivals about the EU investigation before regulators were able to carry out surprise inspections.

The EU head office also ordered two  Italian trade associations of processors and  tobacco  growers to pay fines of 1,000 (US$1,200) each.

Processed tobacco  is usually sold on to cigarette manufacturers. The EU said illegal contacts and agreements between the  tobacco  processors were "frequent and continuous."
In October 2004, the  Commission also imposed fines on processors and producers associations in
Spain.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Thursday fined  Italian raw tobacco  companies
EUR56 million for fixing the prices they paid to tobacco  growers, intermediaries and suppliers.
The price collusion, which went on for more than six years, violates E.U. law, the  commission said.

TD
Tobacco processor Deltafina, a unit of U.S.-based Universal Corp (UVV), will be fined EUR30 million, the Commission said in a statement. Transcatab, a unit of U.S.-based Alliance One International Inc (AOI), must pay EUR14 million. Mindo, which was formerly owned by Alliance One International Inc under the name of Dimon, has been fined EUR10 million. Romana Tabacchi, a family-owned enterprise, owes EUR2.05 million. [ 10-20-05 0558ET ]

The Commission also imposed a EUR1,000 fine on both the  Italian trade associations of processors and tobacco  growers for engaging in collective price negotiations.

"Cartel culture must be eradicated from all sectors and agriculture is no exception. Last year the Commission fined 5 processors on the Spanish  tobacco  market. As  Italy is the largest producer of raw tobacco  in Europe, today's decision is all the more significant" said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Between 1995 and 2002, the leading  tobacco  processors in Italy colluded on their overall purchasing strategy, the competition watchdog said. They agreed on purchase prices and allocated their suppliers on a preferential or exclusive basis.
They also rigged their bids in respect of public auctions organised by public authorities for the sale of
tobacco  in 1995 and 1998, the  Commission added.

After processing,  tobacco  can be sold to manufacturers of  tobacco  products, notably cigarettes. Illegal contactsand agreements between the  tobacco  processors were frequent and continuous throughout
the whole period of the infringement.

As from 1999, public negotiations took place between the two trade associations on reference minimum prices to be inserted in "cultivation contracts" at the beginning of the season. Processors however continued to collude on the final prices that they would actually pay upon the delivery of  tobacco,  as well as on the allocation of suppliers, the  Commission said.

This is the second time that the Commission has taken a decision with fines in the raw  tobacco  sector. In October 2004, the Commission also imposed fines on processors and producers' associations in Spain.

RUSSIA-BIRDFLU

Asked if the  Commission would take additional measures following Russian confirmation of avian flu outbreak, Ahrenkilde Hansen said that the  Commission on Wednesday had received confirmation by the Russian veterinary authorities of an outbreak of avian influenza H5N1 in the region of Tula, south Moscow.

"The Russian veterinary services have implemented all necessary measures to avoid spread of the disease. As far as the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health meeting today (Thursday) is concerned. That Committee this morning had endorsed the ban on imports of pet birds and feathers from Siberia to cover the whole territory of Russia, with the exception of Kanilingrad, Leningrad, Karelia,
Murmansk and St-Petersburg and the geographical scope of that decision has been decided on the basis of a risk assessment which has been carried out by the  Commission and Member States and this will be reviewed in light of the evolution of the situation in Russia," she said.

She added that the decision was valid for six months and that the decision was expected to be adopted by the Commission on Thursday by urgent procedure.

Four Italian tobacco  processors face a fine of euro 56 million for running a  cartel to control the prices paid to growers. The fines were dealt out by the European Commission on October 20 as punishment for price-fixing between 1995 and 2002, and for rigging bids in public tobacco  auctions between 1995 and 1998. "Cartel culture must be eradicated from all sectors", said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, adding that "as  Italy is the largest producer of raw  tobacco  in Europe, today's decision is all the more significant".

The four firms concerned are Deltafina (fined euro 30 million), Dimon (now known as Mindo - fined euro
10 million), Transcatab (euro 14 million) and Romana Tabacchi (euro 2.05 million). The  Commission
found that illegal contracts and agreements between processors were "frequent and continuous"
throughout the period, including the prior agreement of purchase prices and the preferential allocation of
suppliers. Such restrictive business practices are banned under Article 81 of the EC Treaty.

Deltafina had originally been granted conditional immunity by the Commission for revealing details of the cartel. However, it then informed its collaborators before the Commission was able to carry out surprise inspections, meaning that its final immunity was withheld. The Commission also imposed small fines on the Italian processors' association APTI and  tobacco  growers' association UNITAB for engaging in collective price negotiations from 1999 onwards.

Processed tobacco  is usually sold on to manufacturers, mainly for the production of cigarettes. This is the second time in as many years that the  Commission has clamped down on the raw tobacco  sector, having fined five Spanish processors euro 20 million in October 2004. The raw tobacco  market is subject to a common organisation as part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
