WARSAW (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission may formally reprimand Poland's Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS.WA) for abusing its dominant position in the country's Internet services market, daily Rzeczpospolita reports, citing unnamed sources.

The commission's decision is due out Wednesday, Rzeczpospolita says, adding the maximum  fine imposed can equal up to 10% of TPSA's annual sales. The company's 2010 revenue fell 5.1% to 15.72 billion ($5.68 billion).

TD
Telekomunikacja Polska, or TPSA, is Poland's largest phone and Internet provider, and France Telecom SA (FTE.FR) holds a 49.79% stake in the company. TPSA shares closed up 3.2% on Tuesday, at PLN17.30.

WARSAW (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR127 million on Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS.WA), Poland's dominant telecommunications company, for seeking to limit competition on the broadband Internet market in 2005-2009, the  commission said in a statement.

"In order to provide broadband Internet access to end-users, new market entrants...can either build an alternative access network, which is usually not economically viable, or use the network of the incumbent operator, in the present case Telekomunikacja Polska," the commission said. "Extensive
evidence gathered by the  commission shows that Telekomunikacja Polska deliberately sought to limit competition on the broadband markets in Poland by placing obstacles in the way of alternative operators."

TD
The commission said between August 2005 until at least October 2009 TPSA engaged in practices that prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors onto the Polish broadband market.

TPSA's total sales in 2010 was EUR3.9 million, the  commission said, and the  fine "takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement" and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TPSA's broadband sales between 2005 and 2009 in Poland.
France Telecom SA (FTE.FR) holds 49.78% of shares in TPSA.

WARSAW (Dow Jones)--Poland's dominant telecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS.WA) will take legal steps regarding a EUR127 million  fine imposed by the European Commission as the penalty isn't legally binding yet, the company said Wednesday.
The commission, which has antitrust powers in the  European Union, earlier Wednesday imposed the
fine on the company for seeking to limit competition on the broadband Internet market. Between
August 2005 until at least October 2009, TPSA engaged in practises that prevented or at least delayed
the entry of competitors to the Polish broadband market, the  commission said.

TD
TPSA called the  fine "surprising," adding that it had discontinued those practises upon their discovery in 2009.

"The European Commission didn't sufficiently consider that TPSA promptly and, what's even more important, voluntarily removed any and all obstacles in its cooperation with the alternative operators. It is necessary to stress that arguments regarding cooperation with alternative operators do not refer to the current situation," the company said.

WARSAW (Dow Jones)--Poland's dominant telecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS.WA) will take legal steps against a EUR127 million  fine imposed by the European Commission, as the penalty isn't yet legally binding and doesn't reflect changes in TPSA's behavior, the company said Wednesday.

The commission, which has antitrust powers in the  European Union, earlier Wednesday  fined the company for attempting to block smaller competitors from using its broadband Internet infrastructure. Between August 2005 until at least October 2009, TPSA engaged in practises that prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors to the Polish broadband market, the  commission said.
TPSA called the  fine "surprising," adding that it stopped those practises in 2009.

"The European Commission didn't sufficiently consider that TPSA promptly and, what's even more important, voluntarily removed any and all obstacles in its cooperation with the alternative operators. It is necessary to stress that arguments regarding cooperation with alternative operators do not refer to the current situation," the company said.
The commission said: "Alternative operators encountered numerous difficulties in obtaining access to
TPSA's broadband wholesale products."

"This case shows our determination to ensure that dominant telecom operators don't systematically hinder competitors who can make a real difference in the market to the benefit of consumers and businesses," said the  commission's vice-president, Joaquin Almunia, in the  commission's statement.

TPSA, in which France Telecom SA (FTE.FR) holds 49.78%, may also face further claims from market participants seeking compensation for the company's behavior between 2005 and 2009, the  European Commission said.

"Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behavior as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the [EU] member states and seek damages," the  commission said. "In cases
before national courts, a commission antitrust decision is binding proof that the behavior took place and was illegal. Even though the commission has fined the company concerned, damages may be
awarded without these being reduced on account of the  commission fine."

TPSA, a former state-owned monopoly, for years fought public battles with the Polish telecommunications market regulator over equal access to its infrastructure for alternative operators. The regulator at one point threatened to split the company into separate retail and infrastructure units. The regulator's chairwoman, Anna Strezynska, appointed in 2006, imposed  fines on TPSA for
non-compliance in excess of 500 million zlotys ($179 million), before the parties reached an agreement.

In October 2009, TPSA signed an investment agreement with the regulator, promising to give alternative operators equal access to its infrastructure in exchange for stable regulated wholesale rates for three years. In exchange, the regulator suspended the split plan.

The market reacted negatively to the EU  fine Wednesday. At 1311 GMT, TPSA shares were down 2.2% at PLN16.92. The  fine may eat into the company's second-quarter profit and aggravates TPSA's legal situation, as it comes as the company is trying to fend off high claims by Danish business partner DPTG, said Bank Zachodni WBK analyst Pawel Puchalski.

"The fine is huge and represents PLN0.38 a share," he said. "It may also remind investors of the lawsuits brought by DPTG."

DPTG, a unit of Denmark's GN Store Nord A/S (GN.KO), was last year awarded the equivalent of $530 from TPSA in an arbitration case over traffic volumes via a fiber-optic network installed in Poland in the
1990s. In January 2011, DPTG filed a further claim equivalent to $435 million. TPSA has created accounting provisions covering the DPTG claims.

HD     DOCUMENTATION: EC imposes  EUR 127.5 mln fine on TPSA telco for abuse of monopolist position

Warszawa. June 22, 2011 (PAP) - Following is a press statement by the  European Commission, following its decision to impose a EUR 127.55 mln  fine on Polish listed telco TPSA.
Antitrust:  Commission fines Telekomunikacja Polska S.A ? 127 million for abuse of dominant position

TD
Brussels, 22 June 2011 - The European Commission has imposed a fine of ?127 554 194 on telecoms operator Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. (TP) for abusing its dominant position in the Polish market in breach of EU antitrust rules (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU). As a dominant company TP is under an obligation to allow remunerated access to its network and wholesale broadband services in order to allow the effective entry of alternative operators on downstream broadband markets. But it consistently refused to do so or made it difficult for more than four years.

Commission Vice-President Joaquˇn Almunia said: "the  Commission cannot allow the development of the Internet and of the digital economy to be put at risk by anticompetitive practices. This case shows our determination to ensure that dominant telecom operators do not systematically hinder competitors who can make a real difference in the market to the benefit of consumers and businesses".

In order to provide broadband Internet access to end-users, new market entrants (alternative operators) can either build an alternative access network, which is usually not economically viable, or use the network of the incumbent operator, in the present case  Telekomunikacja Polska (TP). To use the
incumbent's network, operators need to acquire wholesale broadband access products, namely wholesale broadband access and local loop unbundling. In Poland, these are exclusively provided by TP, on which alternative operators are dependent to compete on the retail market.

Extensive evidence gathered by the  Commission shows that  Telekomunikacja Polska deliberately sought to limit competition on the broadband markets in Poland by placing obstacles in the way of alternative operators.

From August 2005 until at least October 2009 TP engaged in practices which prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors onto Polish broadband markets. Alternative operators encountered numerous difficulties to obtain access to TP's broadband wholesale products. For instance, TP proposed unreasonable conditions, delayed the negotiation processes, rejected orders in an unjustifiable manner and refused to provide reliable and accurate information to alternative operators.

Together, the above practices prevented alternative operators from competing effectively in the market and constituted an abuse of TP's dominant position on the Polish broadband market.

The Commission's antitrust decision requires TP to put an end to such conduct, in so far as it has not already done so, and not to engage in the same or equivalent practices in the future.

Telekomunikacja Polska's total turnover in 2010 was ? 3.9 billion (PLN 15.7 billion). The  fine takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TP's broadband sales between 2005 and 2009 in Poland.
For background information on antitrust rules and procedures see MEMO/11/444. Background

Page 8 of 56 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Poland has one of the lowest broadband penetration rates in  Europe - in January 2010 it reached only
13%, significantly below the EU average of 24%.Consumers have also suffered from lower connection
speeds: 66% of Internet access lines in Poland do not exceed the speed of 2Mbit/s compared to an EU
average of just 15%. Finally, monthly prices per advertised Mbit/s were much higher than the prices in
other Member States and the second highest in the OECD area.
The Commission's investigation was opened on its own initiative in April 2009 (see MEMO/09/203). The
Commission's decision follows a Statement of Objections sent in February 2010 (see IP/10/213).

Wholesale broadband access provides data transmission, on the basis of incumbents' networks to which alternative operators connect via interconnection points, so-called Service Access Nodes. This does not require much infrastructure investment on their side. With local loop unbundling, which requires more investments, the connection takes place closer to the end-user. Although local loop unbundling is more costly for alternative operators, it allows for broader control of the service with the ability to adjust it to the specific end-users' needs.
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behavior as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court and Council Regulation 1/2003 both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission antitrust decision is binding proof that the behavior took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has fined the company concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission fine.

The Commission considers that meritorious claims for damages should be aimed at compensating, in a fair way, the victims of an infringement for the harm done. More information on antitrust damages actions, including the public consultation and a citizens' summary, is available at:

BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's competition regulator says it is fining Polish telecoms operator Telekomunikacja Polskaeuro127.55 million ($183 million) for barring other boadband Internet providers from using its network.

The European Commission said Wednesday that between August 2005 and October 2009, Telekomunikacja Polska used numerous tactics to stop or delay competitors from entering the market for broadband Internet. Under EU rules, network operators have to allow paid access to competitors.

TD
The EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said "the  Commission cannot allow the development of the Internet and of the digital economy to be put at risk by anticompetitive practices."

As of January 2010, only 13 percent of Polish households had access to broadband Internet, far below the EU average.

Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, a Polish media tycoon, has entered exclusive talks to negotiate the purchase of
Polkomtel, Poland's second largest mobile phone operator.
The tycoon will try to finalise the acquisition with Polkomtel's shareholders after lodging an 18bn zloty
($6.5bn) bid for the mobile operator, said people familiar with the situation on Wednesday.

TD
Mr Solorz-Zak's bid was the highest of three offers, added these people. Apax, the private equity firm, made a bid of $6bn for Polkomtel, and Telenor also submitted an offer.
Mr Solorz-Zak, Apax and Telenor declined to comment, but a deal might be finalised before the end of
June.

The Polish government is keen to secure the maximum possible proceeds from selling Polkomtel, said one person close to the situation.

Four of Polkomtel's five shareholders are state-controlled companies that could help the government reduce Poland's budget deficit by paying special dividends from a sale of the mobile operator.

Vodafone, which owns 24.4 per cent of Polkomtel, is not expected by analysts to try and secure full ownership of the operator by exercising a right of first refusal to buy out the other shareholders. Vodafone has sold minority stakes in three mobile operators since last year.

Will Draper, analyst at Espírito Santo, said Mr Solorz-Zak's bid valued Polkomtel at 6.4 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  European telecoms companies are on a multiple of about five times earnings.

"We believe at the current level of the bids the most likely outcome is that Vodafone sells its stake alongside the other shareholders, raising $1.5bn," said Mr Draper.
Polkomtel was founded in 1996 and had 13.7m customers at the end of last year.
The Polish telecoms market is mature, with most of the population owning a mobile phone.
The mobile market is dominated by three operators. The largest by customer numbers is France
Telecom's Polish business, followed by Polkomtel and Deutsche Telekom's Polish unit.

European Union regulators on Wednesday imposed a €127.5m ($183.9m)  fine on France Telecom's Polish business, called  Telekomunikacja Polska (TP), for breaching EU rules by abusing its position as the country's former fixed-line phone monopoly.

The European Commission said TP had between 2005 and 2009 refused, or made it difficult, for rivals to gain access to its telecoms network, which in turn impeded their ability to supply broadband services.

The fine follows a long investigation by EU officials, and led to charges against TP last year. TP has the right to appeal.

WARSAW -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR127 million on Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS.WA), Poland's dominant telecommunications company, for seeking to limit competition on the broadband Internet market in 2005-2009, the  commission said in a statement.

"In order to provide broadband Internet access to end-users, new market entrants...can either build an alternative access network, which is usually not economically viable, or use the network of the incumbent operator, in the present case Telekomunikacja Polska ," the commission said. "Extensive evidence gathered by the  commission shows that Telekomunikacja Polska deliberately sought to limit competition on the broadband markets in Poland by placing obstacles in the way of alternative operators."

TD
The commission said between August 2005 until at least October 2009 TPSA engaged in practices that prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors onto the Polish broadband market.

TPSA's total sales in 2010 was EUR3.9 million, the  commission said, and the  fine "takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement" and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TPSA's broadband sales between 2005 and 2009 in Poland.
France Telecom SA (FTE.FR) holds 49.78% of shares in TPSA.

HD        TP fined EUR 128 mln by EC for abuse of dominant position

LP
The European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 127.55 million on Polish operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) for abusing its dominant position in the Polish market. Extensive evidence gathered by the commission shows that TP deliberately sought to limit competition on the broadband markets in Poland by placing obstacles in the way of alternative operators. From August
2005 until at least October 2009, TP engaged in practices which prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors onto Polish broadband markets. For instance, TP proposed unreasonable conditions, delayed the negotiation processes, rejected orders in an unjustifiable manner and refused to provide reliable and accurate information to alternative operators. Together, the practices prevented alternative operators from competing effectively in the market and constituted an abuse of TP's dominant position on the Polish broadband market.

TD
The commission's antitrust decision requires TP to put an end to such conduct, in so far as it has not already done so, and not to engage in the same or equivalent practices in the future. The  fine takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TP's broadband sales between 2005 and 2009. TP disagreed with the  fine, saying it could better spend the money investing in infrastructure. The operator claims the EC should have taken into account the current, improved situation and its agreement with the national telecommunications regulator UKE in October 2009 on improving wholesale services. The operator noted that the EC decision is not binding yet and said it's considering further legal action.

Brussels, 22/06/2011 (Agence  Europe) - Further to an investigation which started in April 2009 and a statement of objections submitted in February 2010, the  European Commission on Wednesday 22 June fined the operator  Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. (TP) €127,554,194 for abuse of its dominant position on the Polish telecommunications market. In violation of its obligations as incumbent operator, TP
deliberately refused or used various techniques to slow down, over more than four years (from August
2005 to October 2008, at least) the remunerated access of other operators to its network and its
wholesale broadband services, thereby preventing their effective entry onto the downstream
telecommunications markets and depriving consumers of a more diversified offer. The  fine takes account
of the duration and seriousness of the infringement and was calculated on the basis of the average value
of sales related to the provision of broadband access by TP in Poland between 2005 and 2009.

TD
In 2010, the total turnover of  Telekomunikacja Polska stood at €3.9 billion (15.7 billion PLN). (F.G./transl.fl)

N/A Polish markets closed Thursday for Corpus Christi
1230/1030 Conference with British PM David Cameron in Prague

Czech central bankers are set to keep monetary policy unchanged Thursday amid tame domestic inflationary pressures and a recently strong currency.

Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires unanimously expect the Czech central bank to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday at the historic low of 0.75% amid the market consensus that demand-driven inflationary pressures are virtually non-existent.

Economic weakness in western  Europe, the deteriorating fiscal situation in the  euro-zone's periphery and weak domestic inflationary expectations will likely force Czech policy makers to take a wait-and-see tack, analysts said.
What is more, in recent weeks the koruna has been trading near but not moving below 24.0 to the  euro,
a level the central bank considers strong. The Czech currency neared 24.0 to the  euro in May and at the
start of the year but otherwise had traded at weaker levels since autumn 2009.

Separately in Prague, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is in town to meet with his Czech peer Petr Necas and Czech President Vaclav Klaus. Cameron will hold a press conference at 1230 GMT to discuss the meetings.

The Czech koruna will be little traded early in the session as the market awaits the 1100 GMT Czech central bank rate decision. The koruna may see volatility after the rate call and then if there is no change as expected, it should end the day moving with the region, traders said.

Without negative news from Greece, the zloty should stay stable or skewed toward strengthening to 3.95 versus the euro, a trader said.

The Hungarian forint could trade within the 266.60-268.35 range versus the  euro Thursday, Raiffeisen Bank analyst Matyas Kovacs said, adding market concerns over Greece still linger and comments following the U.S. Federal Reserve Board decision are also eyed.



FIXED INCOME

HUNGARIAN BOND YIELDS - The three-year benchmark bond yield was 6.60% Wednesday from
6.57% late Tuesday. The five-year yield was 7.00% against 6.99%, and the 10-year was 7.23% versus
7.25%.
POLISH BOND YIELDS - The average yield on two-year bonds was at 4.81% late Wednesday from
4.84% late Tuesday; five- and 10-year unchanged at 5.36% and 5.85%, respectively.
CZECH BOND YIELD - The yield on the benchmark paper maturing in 2022 was at 3.88% late
Wednesday from 3.92% late Tuesday.

In Warsaw low activity is expected on Poland's bond market and Treasury paper will most likely follow the zloty's movements, traders said.

The Hungarian bond market is once again trading in very low volumes, unfazed by a positive turn in sentiment post the Greek confidence vote, a trader said.

In its post-meeting statement, the U.S. Federal Reserve downgraded its assessment of the U.S.
economy's performance, but gave no indication itintends to take new steps to boost growth and jobs.
Instead, officials said they are sticking with plans to end the purchase of $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys
on June 30 and to keep short-term interest rates near zero.
"The Fed didn't say anything new. (It) certainly didn't offer QE3," said Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners. "It was a neutral event for the stock market and the reason why we are seeing stocks off a little bit is
because the dollar is strengthening," he added.

HD       TP Hit With USD182-Mil. Fine for Abuse of Wholesale Broadband Market

Polish incumbent operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) has been hit with a EUR127-million (USD182-million)  fine from the European Commission (EC) for anti-competitive behaviour in the wholesale broadband market. The EC decided that TP had, between August 2005 and October 2009, engaged in practices that prevented or delayed new entrants to the broadband market.Significance: The fine, which amounts to 3.2% of 2010 revenues, may lead to further claims on TP, by competitors blocked from entering the market. TP plans to appeal the decision, citing changes in behaviour since 2009,
adding that the  fine is not yet legally binding. The  fine will add further woe to TP, which saw its profitability fall in the first quarter, as fixed-line services continued to drag on the operator (see Poland:
21 April 2011: ).

HD     'TP fined EUR 128 mln by EC for abuse of dominant position' WC    289 words

LP
The European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 127.55 million on Polish operator  Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) for abusing its dominant position in the Polish market. Extensive evidence gathered by the commission shows that TP deliberately sought to limit competition on the broadband markets in Poland by placing obstacles in the way of alternative operators. From August 2005 until at least October 2009, TP engaged in practices which prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors onto Polish broadband markets. For instance, TP proposed unreasonable conditions, delayed the negotiation processes, rejected orders in an unjustifiable manner and refused to provide reliable and accurate information to alternative operators. Together, the practices prevented alternative operators from competing effectively in the
market and constituted an abuse of TP's dominant position on the Polish broadband market.

TD
The commission's antitrust decision requires TP to put an end to such conduct, in so far as it has not already done so, and not to engage in the same or equivalent practices in the future. The  fine takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TP's broadband sales between 2005 and 2009. TP disagreed with the  fine, saying it could better spend the money investing in infrastructure. The operator claims the EC should have taken into account the current, improved situation and its agreement with the national telecommunications regulator UKE in October 2009 on improving wholesale services. The operator noted that the EC decision is not binding yet and said it's considering further legal action.

1430/1230 Czech central bank holds press conference
N/A Polish markets closed Thursday for Corpus Christi
1230/1030 Conference with British PM David Cameron in Prague

Czech central bankers are set to keep monetary policy unchanged Thursday amid tame domestic inflationary pressures and a recently strong currency.

Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires unanimously expect the Czech central bank to leave interest rates unchanged Thursday at the historic low of 0.75% amid the market consensus that demand-driven inflationary pressures are virtually non-existent.

Economic weakness in western  Europe, the deteriorating fiscal situation in the  euro-zone's periphery and weak domestic inflationary expectations will likely force Czech policy makers to take a wait-and-see tack, analysts said.
What is more, in recent weeks the koruna has been trading near but not moving below 24.0 to the  euro,
a level the central bank considers strong. The Czech currency neared 24.0 to the  euro in May and at the
start of the year but otherwise had traded at weaker levels since autumn 2009.

Separately in Prague, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is in town to meet with his Czech peer Petr Necas and Czech President Vaclav Klaus. Cameron will hold a press conference at 1230 GMT to discuss the meetings.

LP
The first company in a new' member state to receive a fine for abuse of dominant position in the domestic market is in Poland: the European Commission has fined incumbent Polish telecommunications
operator Telekomunikacja Polska SA.

This Polish subsidiary of France Telecom did not - for more than four years - keep to its obligation, as a dominant company, of allowing remunerated access to its network and wholesale broadband services in order to allow the effective entry of alternative operators - who are new on the market - on downstream telecoms markets.

TD
In order to facilitate access to new entrants,  Telekomunikacja Polska should have either created a network of alternative access - an option which tends not to be economically viable - or used its
high-speed network. Far from it, according to the  Commission, which holds proof of the offense: Telekomunikacja Polska intentionally put in place, between August 2005 and October 2009, all sorts of obstacles, which prevented or at least delayed the entry of competitors: proposing unreasonable conditions governing access to new entrants; delaying the negotiation process; rejecting alternative operators on unreasonable grounds; refusing to provide reliable and complete information, etc.

Such practices are strongly condemned by the Commissioner for Competition, Joaquín Almunia, who declared that he would fight to prevent this "threat to the development of the internet and the digital economy". The  fine takes into account the average value of sales of  Telekomunikacja Polska's
high-speed internet services between 2005 and 2009, as well as the duration and gravity of the infringement. The company's turnover was €3.9 billion in 2010.

18bn zlotys offer for mobile operator

TD
Deal expected by end of the month

Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, a Polish media tycoon, has entered exclusive talks to purchase Polkomtel, Poland's second-largest mobile phone operator.
He will try to finalise the acquisition with Polkomtel's shareholders after lodging an 18bn zlotys ($6.5bn)
bid for the mobile operator, said people familiar with the situation.

Mr Solorz-Zak's bid was the highest of three offers, added these sources. Apax, the private equity firm, made a bid of $6bn and Telenor of Norway also submitted an offer.

Mr Solorz-Zak, Apax and Telenor declined to comment, but a deal could be finalised before the end of the month .

The Polish government is keen to secure the maximum possible price for Polkomtel, said one person close to the situation.

Four of Polkomtel's five shareholders are state-controlled companies that could help the government reduce Poland's budget deficit by paying special dividends from a sale of the mobile operator.

Analysts do not expect Vodafone, which owns 24.4 per cent of Polkomtel, to try to secure full ownership of the operator by exercising a right of first refusal to buy out the other shareholders. Vodafone has sold minority stakes in three mobile operators since last year.

Will Draper, analyst at Espirito Santo, said Mr Solorz-Zak's bid valued Polkomtel at 6.4 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  European telecoms companies on average trade on multiples of about five times earnings.

"We believe at the current level of the bids the most likely outcome is that Vodafone sells its stake alongside the other shareholders, raising $1.5bn," said Mr Draper.
Polkomtel was founded in 1996 and had 13.7m customers at the end of last year.
The Polish telecoms market is mature, with most of the population owning a mobile phone.

The market is dominated by three operators. The largest by customer numbers is France Telecom's Polish business Telekomunikacja Polska (TP), followed by Polkomtel and Deutsche Telekom's Polish unit.

European Union regulators on Wednesday imposed a €127.5m ($183.9m)  fine on TP for breaching
EU rules by abusing its position as the country's former fixed-line phone monopoly.

The European Commission said that between 2005 and 2009 TP had refused, or made it difficult, for rivals to gain access to its telecoms network, which had impeded their ability to supply broadband services.

TPSA was fined for EUR 127.5mn by EC, an appeal is expected The  European Commission has fined Poland's Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) for its business practices on the telecom market. According to the decision of the executive body, TPSA is charged for paying EUR 127.5 million for shutting out competitors from its high-speed Internet network, thus abusing its dominant market position. The  fine concerns business practices conducted by the telecom firm between 2005 and 2009. According to the EC’s decision, TPSA gave unreasonable conditions to its competitors, used delaying tactics in negotiations and rejected requests to access to its infrastructure with no justification. TPSA announced after the EC decision that this shall not be

the final say on the matter as the company will take all possible and reasonable steps against the decision. This was a definite negative news for TPSA which closed yesterday’s trading 2.3% lower, and
we expect a further decline. TPSA needs to face several charges concerning previous business practices, i.e. there is another case on trial with a Danish operator that claims some USD 500-700 million from TPSA to compensate for an earlier agreement. Due to these tense disputes and special juridical costs, TPSA
has been forced for a heavy provisioning for over a year now, thus the special reserve items now picked to PLN 2.2 billion and it may stay at such high level for longer than previously expected. Source: Equilor Research

PKN started to sell parts of Anwill PKN Orlen’s Anwill plans to sell its Czech PVC and caprolactum producer unit, Spolana. (Caprolactum is used in the textile and plastic industries). This process might be the first step to put the whole Anwil unit on sale, since it is no secret that PKN has been planning such step for some times. The only question is whether PKN is going to sell the firm as a whole or parts of it. The latest news regarding Spolana strengthens the possibility of the latter case. Spolana used to belong to Unipetrol which is also controlled by PKN but in 2006 the shares of Spolana was transferred to Anwil. Source: Equilor Research

Hungary modified deficit targets, tax revenues will lack projections According to the new law modification of the finance ministry, the Hungarian government will exceed the original deficit target with approximately HUF 170bn (USD 1bn) in 2011 and that was the original reason why the government created the HUF
250bn stabilisation fund. The corporate tax sources probably will be lower with roughly HUF 84bn, while the VAT will be less with roughly HUF 69bn. In addition, top official in the Prime Minister's Office said yesterday afternoon, that Hungary's forint is now at levels which are acceptable for exporters and do not hurt foreign currency loan holders. The official expects that the forint will stabilize around the current

levels. However, the  euro zone peripheries could weigh on the CEE currencies including HUF. Source: Equilor Research

Poland will prefund next year’s FX-borrowing needs after the Summer Poland is to return to the international debt market after the Summer and a further dollar or  euro denominated bond sale is expected in the size of EUR 1 billion – deputy director of Poland’s finance ministry noted in a conference. The government has raised 86% of its planned EUR 8.3 billion foreign-currency borrowing needs. The country still has a room to take EUR 800 million to 1.3 billion in loans in the second half of the year to meet some of the needs of next year’s borrowing plans – the officer added. The government has USD
4.56 billion of foreign-currency denominated bonds coming due next year – according to Bloomberg data. Source: Equilor Research

The successful vote of confidence in the Greek government did not improve the situation on stock markets, including the Warsaw bourse, with investors realising that the Greek parliament is yet to see the main battle for EU financial aid. As a consequence, Wednesday saw a decline of all the main indices on the WSE. Among the blue chips, Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) saw its share price go down sharply
in reaction to a huge  fine imposed on the telecom by the European Commission (more on the subject on p. 5), with considerable slumps also recorded by Pekao, PKN Orlen and TVN.

On Tuesday, the  European Commission (EC) imposed a EUR127.5m  fine on Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) for abusing its dominant position on the Polish broadband Internet market. According to the institution, for over four years the telecom failed to grant sufficient access to its infrastructure to alternative operators. TPSA sees the EC's decision as surprising, stating that it "voluntarily eliminated the said irregularities immediately after they had been discovered." The company has already announced that it
will take "all possible steps concerning the EC's decision." In their comments, analysts point out that the fine exceeds the reserves set up by the telecom so far by PLN458m and therefore will have a negative effect on its net profits for 2011. They estimate that it may cause TPSA to incur a PLN200-300m loss in Q2. In related news, the company has announced that it completed the sale of TP Emitel to Montagu Private Equity for PLN1.725bn.

According to the head of Tipsport, Petr Knybel, the real of rate betting should return a maximum of 10 % of its yield, because it involves much higher risk and lower profitability than other lottery segments.

TD
Functional separation of Poland's incumbent operator into wholesale and retail divisions has been delayed by at least six months.
Implications

The delay should serve as a warning for TP to improve access to infrastructure and increase local-loop unbundling.
Outlook

TP will look to strike a new deal with alternative operators and increase investments in unbundled infrastructure.

The functional separation of Polish incumbent  Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) has been delayed by at least six months, reports Rzeczpospolita. The formal separation of TP into wholesale and retail divisions was due to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2011, but has again failed to come to fruition. In reporting the failure, the head of the regulator, Anna Strezynska, said that there is waning interest at TP to complete the agreement.
Outlook and Implications
Split to Boost Competition: The procedure to split TP into wholesale and retail units began in December
2008 and was postponed following a deal with alternative operators in August 2009 (see Poland: 12
August 2009: ). The functional separation of TP into wholesale and retail divisions has been pursued by
the regulator to improve access by alternative operators to TP’s network, thereby improving competition
in the fixed-line market, which comes primarily from operators with their own infrastructure, cable
operators and two of the big alternates, Netia and Telefonia Dialog. The lack of access to infrastructure in
the broadband market up to October 2009 led to a substantial  fine from the European Commission (EC)
last week (see Poland: 23 June 2011: ).Time to Negotiate: The delay gives TP time to negotiate a new
deal with alternates to avoid the split. In order to do this, TP will have to agree to concessions on
unbundled local-loop (LLU) and bitstream pricing alongside growing investments in increasing the
availability of LLU-enabled exchanges. The initial deal between alternates and TP was for 1 million lines
with above 6-Mbps speeds, and a further 200,000 with bandwidth of below 6 Mbps. TP is against splitting
into two units as it reduces dynamism and puts up internal barriers to growth.

According to data collected by the Central Statistical Office (GUS), in May retail sales declined 1.1 percent month-on-month and grew 13.8 percent, which is slightly better than expected. Footwear and clothing sales rose 24.2 percent in comparison to the respective month of 2010, while food, beverage and tobacco product sales went up only 5.9 percent. "Consumer demand is by all means satisfactory; Polish consumers continue to spend their money, thus propelling economic growth," says BZ WBK economist Piotr Bielski. The data presented by the GUS also shows a slight decline in the unemployment rate, which decreased from 12.6 to 12.2 percent last month. At the end of May, 386 firms declared plans to fire a total of 37,100 employees in the near future. According to Polish Confederation of Private Employers (PKPP) Chief Economist Malgorzata Starczewska-Krzysztoszek, there is no chance of unemployment dropping below 10 percent at the end of the year, as forecasted by the government.

TPSA to Pay Giant  Fine

On Tuesday, the  European Commission (EC) imposed a EUR127.5m  fine on Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) for abusing its dominant position on the Polish broadband Internet market. According to the institution, for over four years the telecom failed to grant sufficient access to its infrastructure to alternative operators. TPSA sees the EC's decision as surprising, stating that it "voluntarily eliminated the said irregularities immediately after they had been discovered." The company has already announced that it
will take "all possible steps concerning the EC's decision." In their comments, analysts point out that the fine exceeds the reserves set up by the telecom so far by PLN458m and therefore will have a negative effect on its net profits for 2011. They estimate that it may cause TPSA to incur a PLN200-300m loss in Q2. In related news, the company has announced that it completed the sale of TP Emitel to Montagu Private Equity for PLN1.725bn.

HD       Commission Fines Polish Telecoms Operator For Abuse Of Dominance

On 22 June 2011, the  European Commission (the 'Commission') announced that it had imposed a fine of €127,554,194 on Polish telecommunications company Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. ('TP') for abusing its dominant position on the Polish broadband market. This behaviour was in breach of Article
102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the  European Union.

In Poland, TP is the owner of the only nationwide telecom access network. This means that operators who wish to enter the retail broadband market are dependent on obtaining wholesale broadband access products from TP. The only other option for new entrants is to build an alternative access network, which is usually not economically viable. TP is under specific regulatory obligations to permit access to its network and wholesale broadband services in order to allow the effective entry of alternative competitors on downstream broadband markets.

TD
Despite these regulatory obligations, the  Commission has found that TP deliberately sought to limit competition by engaging in a number of practices. These practices included: the proposal of what the Commission considered "unreasonable conditions"; delaying negotiation processes; rejecting requests to make use of its infrastructure; and refusing to provide reliable and accurate information to alternative operators.

It is notable that Poland has one of the lowest broadband penetration rates in  Europe and that consumers there also suffer from low connection speeds. The decision brings into sharp focus the Commission's aim in this area as highlighted by  Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, "the Commission cannot allow the development of the Internet and of the digital economy to be put at risk by anticompetitive practices. This case shows our determination to ensure that dominant telecom operators do not systematically hinder competitors who can make a real difference in the market to the benefit of consumers and businesses."

The Commission believes that the decision will make entry and expansion in Polish broadband markets easier and in turn will facilitate greater access to better quality internet services. The  Commission has previously taken Article 102 decisions in a number of cases involving abusive practices on telecoms markets; including Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Telefonica in Spain (both for charging unfair access prices).

The fine (which equates to 3.2% of TP's annual turnover) takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement and has been calculated on the basis of the average value of TP's broadband sales
between 2005 and 2009.

TP is understood to be considering challenging the decision. It is claiming that the  Commission should have taken into account the current improved situation and its agreement with the Polish national telecommunications regulator (UKE) in October 2009 on improving wholesale services.

Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) chairman Maciej Witucki has announced that the telecom will create a reserve for the EUR217.5m  fine imposed on it by the  European Commission (EC) in June. The  fine exceeds its existing reserves by PLN458m. Witucki sees its size as unjustified, pointing out that it amounts to 3 percent of his company's revenue, while with the  fines the EC had imposed earlier on Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica the respective share was only 0.3 percent. He confirms plans to appeal against the  Commission's decision in the near future. The TPSA boss also declares that it may reach an agreement with Denmark's DPTG, which is demanding a total of around PLN2.8bn from the Polish telecom. In related news, it has been announced that TPSA redeemed  eurobonds worth EUR300m and that it will reveal the details of its infrastructural co-operation with PTC mobile network operator within the next few weeks.

Warsaw, Jul 6, 2011 (ISB/ IntelliNews) -  Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) can resign from TP brand in
2012 and rebrand all its retail operations, transpires from declarations of companys CEO Maciej Witucki. I
think a logical step would be to make this decision at the beginning of 2012, as maintaining two brands is
also costly. We are currently running the program called "Misja Klient" (Mission: Client) focused on
improving the quality of client service. Its aim is to transform the most painful processes, mainly in the
fixed-line telephony and internet segments. The program's implementation fits in well with the possible
rebranding," said Witucki quoted by PAP. Witucki also admitted that company will need to create a reserve
for the EUR 127.6 mln  fine from the European Commission in Q2 but will appeal against the EC's
decision as soon as possible and sees no negative effect on its dividend policy from either the  fine or the
dispute with DPTG. (ISB/ IntelliNews)

Polish fixed operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) plans to set aside a provision for the  fine imposed on the operator by the European Commission, CEO Maciej Witucki told news agency PAP. The new provision will total PLN 458 million. Despite taking the provision, the operator still plans to appeal the  fine. Witucki also said that a settlement with DPTG is possible. DPTG is claiming PLN 2.8 billion from TP in a lawsuit over revenues from earlier joint venture with the company. The Polish operator has already taken
a provision for the DPTG case.

[Editorial Comment: Poland is the fifth largest member of the EU both in terms of population (around 38.4 million, 13% more inhabitants than Canada) and also in terms of PPP-valued GDP, which is estimated at
$721.3 billion in 2010 - 18.3% less than Australia but 7% wealthier than the Netherlands.] [According to PMR Publications, a British-American company located in Poland, at the end of 2009:] [1. Mobile telephony penetration in Poland was 117.4%, up 1.7 points from 2008 and up 8.5 points over two years. Assuming penetration of 120.0% at the end of 2010, the number of mobile subscribers at the end of 2010 was around 46.1 million.] [2. The length of the telecommunications network was 709,122 km, down 1,566 km year on year but up 23.2% over five years. Of this, 39,146 km, or 5.52%, was optical fibre up 86.7% from 20,966 km in 2004 when the penetration was 3.64%.] [3. There were 116 exchanges, 12 more than in 2008 and 54 more than in 2004.] [4.

TD
There were 24,963 base stations, up 9.3% from 2008 and up 71.9% from 2004.] [5. Fixed line telephony penetration was 22.2%, down 2.0 percentage points on 2008 and down 10.7 percentage points on 2004. Assuming this had dropped to 20.0% by the end of 2010, that would give around 7.6 million lines, considerably lower than some sources.] [6. The value of the telecommunications market was PLN 39.5 billion ($13.9 billion), up 11.6% over 5 years, with hardware accounting for PLN 10.8 billion ($3.8 billion) or
27.3%.] [7. There were 5.165 million broadband subscribers, up 725,000 from 2008 and up 3.148 million since 2005.] [8. There were 2.106 million mobile Internet access subscribers, almost double the 1.064 million estimated for 2008.] [According to the FTTH Council  Europe, in December 2010, 25,500 Polish Internet users had FTTH connections, while FTTB was available in 110,200 Polish buildings, and according to the ITU, at the end of 2010 around 58.4% of the Polish population (22,450,600 individuals) used the Internet.] [Structure of the Polish market] [The Polish fixed line market - estimated at as few as
7.6 million lines at the end of 2010 - is dominated by incumbent provider TP SA (Telekomunikacja           Polska), which is controlled by France Telecom with a 49.78% stake. Other operators include Netia and niche suppliers Telefonia Dialog, Telekomunikacja Kolejowa, GTS and Exatel.] [The Polish mobile market of over 46 million subscribers is served mainly by TPSA/PTK CenterTel (as Orange), Polkomtel, Deutsche Telekom's PTC (as Era), P4/Play, Centernet and Mobyland, plus a large number of MVNOs (on July 1,
2011 it was reported that Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz-Zak had agreed to buy Polkomtel SA for
$5.43 billion in cash).] [The main government owned broadcaster is TVP, while the four main commercial
broadcasters are Polsat, TVN, Polskie Media and TV Plus. The confirmed analogue switch off date is the
July 31, 2013.] [Recently, Poland's parliament, the Sejm, voted through the new DTT law, and TVP and
other broadcasters will operate the country's first DTT multiplex. According to the EU's MAVISE database
there were 12.959 million TV households in Poland at the end of 2009.] [The Polish cable TV market of
around 4 million subscribers is led by UPC Polska, followed by Vectra, Multimedia Polska and Aster, with
also hundreds of local networks, most of which belong to the trade association PIKE. Around 25-30% of
these cable subscribers (1.1 million) are believed to take digital TV services.] [In mid-2010 it was
announced that UPC had agreed to acquire Aster in a deal that was expected to close in the first half of
2011.] [One estimate puts the total number of DTH homes in the country at the end of 2010 at 6.23 million,
with Cyfrowy Polsat claiming 3.37 million, 'n' 802,000 and Cyfra+ and Orange taking the rest.] [According
to Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's largest daily papers, the Polish pay TV market is close to saturation,
with some 70% of TV homes now receiving either cable or DTH services. The paper estimates that 2011 is
likely to be the last year of real growth in the DTH sector, while the number of cable subscribers will
probably not increase for the second year running.] [Regulation] [The telecommunications market in
Poland became fully liberalised at the beginning of 2003, at which time  Telekomunikacja Polska, the
national operator, lost its monopoly for international voice services, the last segment of the

Page 51 of 56 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
telecommunication services sector protected against competition.] [Poland's telecommunications markets are directly regulated by UKE (Urzad Komunikacji Elektronicznej or the Office of Electronic Communications). The UKE, under President Mrs Anna Strezynska, is the national regulatory authority for telecommunications and postal services and is also the specialised authority in the area of equipment conformity assessment, including telecommunications terminal equipment and radio equipment.] [The specific duties of the President of the UKE relating to telecom include, inter alia:] [1. The performance of tasks related to the regulation and supervision of telecommunications services markets, spectrum management, orbital and numbering resources, as well as the enforcement of compliance with EMC requirements.] [2. Intervening in matters related to the functioning of the market for telecommunications and the settlement of disputes between telecommunications undertakings.] [3. Cooperation with domestic and international telecommunications organisations and other competent national authorities.] [4. Cooperation with the President of the Office for Competition and Consumer Protection and with the National Broadcasting Council.*] [Recent decisions and initiatives taken by or affecting the regulator include, on March 3, 2011, a proposal to the three main mobile operators (Orange Poland a brand of TPSA, Polkomtel and Deutsche Telekom AG's PTC) that they should cut their mobile termination rates by around 42% to PLN 0.0966 - a reduction that if implemented is expected to cut their collective revenue by
about PLN 1.5 billion.] [The UKE gave the three operators one month formally to respond to the proposals, which in principle would become law as of July 1. However, it entered into negotiations with them immediately saying that it might be prepared to slow the reduction in rates to somewhere in the range PLN
0.12 to PLN 0.15 if operators agreed to improve coverage of areas lacking full mobile services.] [In April, Poland's antitrust court cancelled  Telekomunikacja Polska's 2007 regulatory  fine of PLN 339 million ($121 million, or 3% of its previous year's revenue) for refusing to follow the regulator's orders on the broadband Internet market, which would have forced the company to offer its access services independently from its phone services.] [TPSA said at the time the regulator had no right to regulate the Internet market and it would appeal the  fine, although Rzeczpospolita quoted sources within the EU as saying the Commission might impose its own  fine on the company for its behaviour.] [In May 2011, the President of UKE issued a decision approving detailed conditions for the implementation of a regulatory obligation imposed on Polkomtel, which in particular included the operator's obligation to ensure coverage of the telecommunications network in areas where it was not economically viable. Specifically, the regulation covers areas with no 2G network coverage and areas with low population density where 3G network coverage cannot be economically justified.] [On June 1, UKE issued a detailed comparison of broadband Internet access prices, comparing a new offer - Neostrada Fiber - from Telekomunikacja       
Polska with offers from UPC Polska, Vectra and Multimedia Polska.] [In the mobile space, the President of UKE issued a decision on June 13 under which the results of a tender announced in October 2007 for two general exclusive frequency licences, each covering 49 duplex channels with 95 MHz duplex spacing in
the 1710-1730 and 1805-1825 frequency ranges nationwide for use in the public telecommunications network by the end of 2022, were found to be null and void with respect to the offer submitted by Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa.] [Most recently, on June 22 the European Commission announced it had imposed a fine of Euro 127 million on Telekomunikacja Polska for seeking to limit competition in the broadband Internet market from 2005 to 2009. The EC stated that "extensive evidence" gathered by the  Commission had shown that between August 2005 until at least October 2009, TPSA engaged in practices that prevented or delayed the entry of competitors into the Polish broadband market.] [* KRRiT (Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji), also known as the National Broadcasting Council, was set up by the Sejm in December 1992 and started operations in March 1993.] [Under Article 213 of the Polish Constitution, this organ of the state shall "safeguard the freedom of speech, the right to information as well as safeguard the public interest regarding radio and television broadcasting" and "issue regulations and, in individual cases, adopt resolutions".] [UOKiK (Urzad Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów), or the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, is a central government administration body responsible for implementing consumer protection policy and acting in the public interest by initiating administrative proceedings concerning infringements of consumer interests.]

IHS Global Insight Perspective
Significance

TD
TP has had a  fine imposed for wholesale access violations cancelled by the Polish Supreme Court.
Implications
The fine was issued in 2007 and would have cost the operator 33 million zloty (USD11.5 million). Outlook
While TP has had a host of local  fines cancelled recently, the  European Commission added another with a massive fine imposed for broadband market abuse.

Polish incumbent operator  Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) has won its appeal over a PLN33-million (USD11.5 million)  fine imposed for violating the framework on wholesale access to unbundled local loops (LLU). The Supreme Court ruled that the regulator (UKE) did not use the correct procedures to issue the fine in 2007 (see Poland: 20 August 2007: ).
Outlook and Implications

TP Improves Stance from 2007: TP’s record of allowing competitors access to its network back in 2007 was far from stellar. The appeals courts have been working through a host of claims from that era, and TP has had many of the fines reduced or struck off (see Poland: 19 April 2011: and 14 April 2011: ). However, the European Commission (EC) recently waded into the storm, issuing a EUR127-million (USD182 million) fine for TP's abuse of the wholesale broadband market between August 2005 and October 2009 (see Poland: 23 June 2011: ).Competition in Fixed-Line Market: The Polish fixed-line market is much more competitive now than it was back in 2007. Netia has become a large force to be
reckoned with, particularly in the LLU market, with 1.23 million total voice subscribers at the end of March
2011, up 4.5% year-on-year. The upcoming consolidation in the fixed-line sector will also increase
competitive pressures on TP, with a deal for Telefonia Dialog approaching completion and Exatel being
readied for sale (see Poland: 7 July 2011: and 23 March 2011: ). Netia is expected to be heavily involved
in M&A activity in 2011 with its USD260-million war-chest for acquisitions (see Poland: 6 June 2011: ).

The Telekomunikacja Polska (TPSA) supervisory board has re-elected Maciej Witucki as the telecom's president for a further three-year term. In a statement TPSA praises Witucki for the results he has achieved so far, and expresses trust in his long-term plans. Witucki's third tenure will start in April 2012, and it will last three years. TPSA has also announced it has not started the sale procedure for Wirtualna Polska web portal. The telecom denies speculation on the matter. Meanwhile according to a survey
carried out among analysts during the second quarter of this year TPSA's revenues fell by 4.54 percent to PLN 3.8bn versus the same period in 2010. This means the drop is still within the brackets which the management announced at the beginning of the year. Analysts are also of the opinion the probability of TPSA paying out dividend is falling in connection with a PLN507m  fine imposed by the European            Commission.
