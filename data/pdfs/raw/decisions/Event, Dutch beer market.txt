BRUSSELS, April 17, 2007 (AFP) -

EU regulators are to turn their crackdown on illegal cartels to the  Dutch beer market on Wednesday with fines on brewing giants such as Heineken and InBev, sources said on Tuesday.

TD
The beer cartel would be the third to be hit with fines this year after EU trustbusters chalked up a record
1.7 billion euros (2.3 billion dollars) in penalties against makers of lifts and power generation equipment
in separate cases.
According to several sources close to the matter, the  European Union's top antitrust regulator Neelie
Kroes has targeted  Dutch brewers Heineken, Bavaria and Grolsch and Belgian-Brazilian group InBev.
While the  European Commission declined to comment on the matter, Heineken acknowledged that it
"expected a fine."

Between 1994 and 1998, the four brewers shared sensitive information about prices and divvied up the market among themselves, keeping prices artificially high in the Netherlands, according to one source who asked to remain anonymous.

The roots of the case go back to the beginning of the decade when the  Commission's trustbusters launched a probe into suspected unfair practices by some  European brewers, leading in September
2005 to formal charges being lodged.
The regulators' probe has already led to fines against brewers for running cartels in Belgium, France, and
Luxembourg and now it appears that it is the turn of The Netherlands.

Because InBev and Heineken have participated in the past in cartels, they risk particularly heavy fines, although the exact amount is unlikely to be set until shortly before they are officially announced on Wednesday.

While InBev declined to comment, a Heineken spokeswoman Veronique Schyns said from Amsterdam: "We've expected a decision for some time but now we expect a decision tomorrow (Wednesday) and we expect a fine."

In late trading, shares in Heineken were showing a loss of 0.61 percent at 38.79  euros in Amsterdam while InBev was down 0.36 percent at 56.74  euros in Brussels.

Also in Amsterdam, Grolsch shares were off 1.24 percent at 31.75  euros. Bavaria is a privately-held company.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made a "no-tolerance" crackdown on cartels a top priority during her tenure as  Europe's top regulator and has lodged ever-rising record fines against the illegal clubs.

Most recently, the  Dutch commissioner imposed the biggest fine ever in a EU cartel case by bringing an illegal trust of lift makers crashing down in February with a penalty of 992 million euros.

In recent months, her growing team of trustbusters have handed formal charges against suspected cartels making professional-quality videotape, glass and bathroom fittings and bulk liquids shippers.

She also said last month that she expected to break up as many as nine or 10 cartels this year and set a new record in annual fines handed out to offending firms.

Dutch brewer Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) was also taken unawares by an imminent  European      Commission cartel fine. "(We) are very surprised that we had to find out this way about a possible fine," said Grolsch spokeswoman Annemik Louwers.

In 2005, the  commission began the probe into whether Heineken NV, Belgium's InBev (INB.BT), Grolsch and Bavaria NV fixed prices on their home market between 1996 and 1999.

TD
As a result of the impending fine, shares on the brewers have been hit.
Around 1154 GMT, Inbev shares were down 0.4% on the day at EUR56.72, while Heineken fell by
0.7% to EUR38.75. Grolsch was down by 1.95% at EUR31.52.

The Dutch case culminates a number of similar investigations into  European brewers fixing prices in their home markets.

In 2004, the E.U. fined Heineken and French food and beverage maker Groupe Danone (DA) EUR2.5 million for illegally manipulating the French  beer market. It has also fined brewers in Belgium and Luxembourg. A similar investigation in Italy was closed without charges being brought.
InBev could not be reached for comment Tuesday. The commission declined to comment.

HD          Heineken and Grolsch  to be fined for price fixing

European commission set to hit  Dutch brewers with heavy fines. By David Gow in Brussels.

The Dutch brewers Heineken and Grolsch will be heavily fined tomorrow by the European commission for operating a  price-fixing cartel with two other companies in Holland, one of Europe's biggest beer markets.

TD
The fines, to be fixed by the 27 EU commissioners, come out of the blue after Brussels charged the two brewers - along with InBev, now the world's largest  beer producer, and the privately owned Bavaria - in September 2005 with fixing prices and allocating customers among themselves.
The commission, which can levy fines of up to 10% of turnover, objected to the brewers controlling
95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each. It accused
them of exchanging commercial information and of fixing prices charged to supermarkets, hotels,
restaurants and cafes between 1996 and 1999.

Heineken said yesterday it expected to receive a fine but Bavaria denied the charges. Peer Swinkels, a director, said he "fell from his chair" when he heard the news on  Dutch television and was "absolutely furious" it had been leaked. "We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model."

It was unclear what punishment would be faced by InBev, formerly Interbrew, after it co-operated with the investigation into the  European beer market. Whistleblowers normally see penalties reduced under the EU leniency scheme while repeat offenders can see fines raised.
In 2001, Interbrew, Danone, the then owner of Kronenbourg, and two other smaller brewers were fined
€91m (£61m) for operating a  cartel in Belgium and four Luxembourg companies were fined ¤448,000.
In 2004, Heineken and Kronenbourg were fined €2.5m, with the penalty reduced for co-operating.
Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, fined cartels a record €1.84bn last year.

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) - Shares in  Dutch brewers Heineken NV and Royal Grolsch NV, as well as Belgian giant InBev SA, dipped Tuesday after a report that the EU  Commission is planning to fine them for price fixing  in the Netherlands.

The companies, along with privately held Bavaria NV, have been under investigation since they were raided in 2000 for alleged  price fixing  in 1996-1999.

TD
InBev shares fell 0.5 percent to €56.64 (US$76.57) in Brussels, while Heineken fell 1.1 percent to €38.61 (US$52.19) and Grolsch was down 2 percent to €31.50 (US$42.58) in Amsterdam.

In 2005, the EU issued the companies a formal charge sheet accusing them of fixing prices, allocating customers, discussing individual customers and exchanging confidential information.

"These practices affected the price of  beer both sold to supermarkets and to hotels, restaurants and cafes,"  European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said at the time.
Companies were then given two months to respond.

But Grolsch spokeswoman Annemiek Louwers said Tuesday "it's been completely quiet since then," and she was surprised by the report by  Dutch state broadcaster NOS, which cited a still-secret EU competition authority decision.
The EU could not confirm the NOS report.

Heineken spokeswoman Veronique Schijns confirmed that the company was expecting a decision Wednesday. She added that Heineken would not comment on the possible outcome or merit of the charges.
"A decision had to come sometime," she said.

Peer Swinkels, a director at Bavaria NV and member of the family that owns the company, denied the charges and said he "fell from his chair" when he heard the report on the NOS late Monday.
"I'm absolutely furious," he said.

"This was a dirty trick by the EU, to leak this information to NOS late at night, so the brewers wouldn't have a chance to respond and it would end up in all the papers as a one-sided story."
He said that Bavaria was "completely innocent" of any  price-fixing.

"We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model," he said. He vowed to contest any fine.
InBev could not immediately be reached for comment.

The NOS report didn't say what the fines would be, but noted that under EU rules, they could be as high as 10 percent of annual sales -- though that is unlikely.

In 2004, the EU fined Heineken and French food and beverage maker Groupe Danone SA €2.5 million for illegally manipulating the French  beer market. It has also fined brewers in Belgium and Luxembourg. A similar investigation in Italy was closed without charges being brought.

AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS, April 17 (Reuters) - Europe's top antitrust authority will fine beer producers Heineken , Grolsch and InBev on Wednesday for cartel activities in the  Dutch market, a European Commission source said.

TD
The source said on Tuesday the world's top brewer by volume, InBev, had cooperated with the Commission's investigation, but it was not clear whether the company was eligible for a cut in the fine for any information it may have provided.

A fourth member of the  cartel called Bavaria (not related to SABMiller's Colombian unit of the same name) will also be fined, the source said.

"Tomorrow's meeting (of EU Commissioners) is to determine the amount of the fine", the source said. The Commission normally announces fines after informing the companies involved of the meeting's conclusions.

Earlier in the day,  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it had expected to be fined by the  Commission for violating competition laws.
"This is a long-running case. We haven't received any information but we are expecting a fine on
Wednesday," said a spokeswoman for Heineken, the world's fourth-largest brewer in terms of sales.
The EU executive can fine companies involved in cartels up to 10 percent of their annual turnover. Grolsch declined to comment on the report. InBev said it would not comment until an official decision
was taken.

By 1130 GMT shares in Heineken traded down 0.9 percent at 38.70 euros, InBev was down 0.4 percent at 56.72  euros and Grolsch was down 2 percent at 31.52 euros.

Dutch NOS television reported earlier in the day that the four companies had fixed prices to keep them artificially high and coordinated on market share and delivery conditions to bars and restaurants.

Heineken said in 2005 it had received a statement of objections from the European Commission, which contained an alleged violation of the competition rules by a number of brewers in the Dutch market.

The Commission sent charge sheets also to Grolsch and InBev in 2005 saying it suspected a  cartel had taken place between 1996 and 1999 and that the  price-fixing practices affected  beer buyers such as supermarkets, hotels, cafes and restaurants.

The EU's top antitrust chief, Neelie Kroes, has made it a priority to crack down on price fixing  and has set record penalties in the past year, most recently fining companies in an elevator cartel almost 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion).

BRUSSELS, April 18, 2007 (AFP) -
EU regulators fined  Dutch brewers Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria 274 million  euros (372 million dollars)
on Wednesday for running an illegal  cartel in the Dutch beer market.

TD
Belgian-Brazilian brewing giant InBev was also named in the case but was not fined because it had given
"decisive information" to help EU trustbusters break up the  cartel.

In the latest action by the  European Commission's anti-cartel campaign, the EU's competition watchdog accused the companies of fixing prices in the Dutch market during informal meetings between at least 1996 and 1999.

"It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she added.

BRUSSELS, April 18, 2007 (AFP) -
EU regulators brought their "no-tolerance" anti-cartel campaign to the Dutch beer market on
Wednesday, fining  Dutch brewers Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria 274 million euros (372 million dollars).

TD
Belgian-Brazilian brewing giant InBev was also named in the case but was not fined because it had given
"decisive information" helping EU trustbusters break up the  cartel.

The latest action in the European Commission's anti-cartel campaign, the EU's competition watchdog accused the companies of fixing prices in the Dutch market between at least 1996 and 1999.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that officials from the companies used false names and other covers to hide their participation in secret meetings at hotels and restaurants.

"It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves," Kroes said.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she added.

Heineken was handed the biggest penalty for its role because of its size and was ordered to pay 219 million euros. However, the two smaller  Dutch brewers did not get off easy either with Grolsch told to pay
31.7 million euros while Bavaria was fined 22.9 million  euros.

The roots of the investigation go back to the beginning of the decade when the Commission's trustbusters launched a probe into suspected unfair practices by some European brewers, leading in September 2005 to formal charges being lodged against the Dutch cartel.
The regulators' probe has already led to fines against brewers for running cartels in Belgium, France, and
Luxembourg.

Kroes has made a "no-tolerance" crackdown on cartels a top priority during her tenure as  Europe's top regulator and has lodged ever-rising record fines against the illegal clubs.
Four months into the year, EU regulators have already made a new annual record for fines in  cartel
cases with the  Dutch trust bust bringing the 2007 total to slightly over two billion  euros.

Much of the total for this year came in February when the  Dutch commissioner slapped the biggest fine ever in a EU cartel case by ordering leading lift makers to pay a combined 992 million  euros.

In recent months, her growing team of trustbusters have handed formal charges against suspected cartels making professional-quality videotape, glass and bathroom fittings and bulk liquids shippers.

BRUSSELS, April 18, 2007 (AFP) -
EU regulators brought their "no-tolerance" anti-cartel campaign to the Dutch beer market on
Wednesday, fining  Dutch brewers Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria 274 million euros (372 million dollars).

TD
Judging the fines to be unfairly high, the three companies said they would contest the decision by lodging appeals before an EU court.

Belgian-Brazilian brewing giant InBev was also named in the case but was not fined because it blew the whistle with "decisive information" leading to EU trustbusters breaking up the  cartel.

In the latest action in the European Commission's anti-cartel campaign, the EU's competition watchdog accused the companies of fixing prices in the Dutch market between at least 1996 and 1999.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said officials from the companies used false names and other covers to hide their participation in secret meetings at hotels and restaurants.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she added.

Heineken was handed the biggest penalty for its role because of its size and was ordered to pay 219 million euros. However, the two smaller  Dutch brewers did not get off easy either, with Grolsch told to pay 31.7 million euros while Bavaria was fined 22.9 million  euros.

"Heineken is highly surprised by the decision and finds the fine excessive and unjustified given the strong arguments that the company put forward to the  European Commission," the company said in a statement.

Despite their smaller fines, Grolsch and Bavaria also expressed shock at the decision and, like Heineken, vowed to appeal.

Shares in Heineken, which had said it expected a fine, recovered from early losses and were showing a gain of 0.33 percent at 38.79  euros in late trading in Amsterdam while Grolsch tumbled 1.51 percent to
31.12 euros. Bavaria is a privately held company.
Even though it escaped a fine, InBev shares were off 0.91 percent at 56.37  euros in Brussels trading. Between them, the three Dutch brewers and InBev hold 92 percent share of the  beer market in The

HD          Heineken and Grolsch  to be fined for price-fixing cartel

The Dutch brewers Heineken and Grolsch will be heavily fined today by the European commission for operating a  price-fixing cartel with two other companies in Holland, one of Europe's biggest beer markets.

The fines, to be fixed by the 27 EU commissioners this morning, come out of the blue after Brussels charged the two brewers - along with InBev, now the world's largest  beer producer, and the privately owned Bavaria - in September 2005 with fixing prices and allocating customers among themselves.

TD
The commission, which can levy fines of up to 10% of turnover, objected to the brewers controlling
95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each. It accused
them of exchanging commercial information and of fixing prices charged to supermarkets, hotels,
restaurants and cafes between 1996 and 1999.

Heineken said yesterday it expected to receive a fine but Bavaria denied the charges. Peer Swinkels, a director, said he "fell from his chair" when he heard the news on  Dutch television and was "absolutely furious" it had been leaked. "We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model."

It was unclear what punishment would be faced by InBev, formerly Interbrew, after it co-operated with the investigation into the  European beer market. Whistleblowers normally see penalties reduced under the EU leniency scheme while repeat offenders can see fines raised.

In 2001, Interbrew, Danone, the then owner of Kronenbourg, and two other smaller brewers were fined [currency]91m (pounds 61m) for operating a  cartel in Belgium and four Luxembourg companies were fined [currency]448,000. In 2004, Heineken and Kronenbourg were fined [currency]2.5m, with the penalty reduced for co-operating. Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, fined cartels a record [currency]1.84bn last year.

The European commission accused Heineken of  price fixing  in the Netherlands with Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev

HD          Financial: Heineken and Grolsch  to be fined for price-fixing cartel

The Dutch brewers Heineken and Grolsch will be heavily fined today by the European commission for operating a  price-fixing cartel with two other companies in Holland, one of Europe's biggest beer markets.

The fines, to be fixed by the 27 EU commissioners this morning, come out of the blue after Brussels charged the two brewers - along with InBev, now the world's largest  beer producer, and the privately owned Bavaria - in September 2005 with fixing prices and allocating customers among themselves.

TD
The commission, which can levy fines of up to 10% of turnover, objected to the brewers controlling
95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each. It accused
them of exchanging commercial information and of fixing prices charged to supermarkets, hotels,
restaurants and cafes between 1996 and 1999.

Heineken said yesterday it expected to receive a fine but Bavaria denied the charges. Peer Swinkels, a director, said he "fell from his chair" when he heard the news on  Dutch television and was "absolutely furious" it had been leaked. "We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model."

It was unclear what punishment would be faced by InBev, formerly Interbrew, after it co-operated with the investigation into the  European beer market. Whistleblowers normally see penalties reduced under the EU leniency scheme while repeat offenders can see fines raised.

In 2001, Interbrew, Danone, the then owner of Kronenbourg, and two other smaller brewers were fined [currency]91m (pounds 61m) for operating a  cartel in Belgium and four Luxembourg companies were fined [currency]448,000. In 2004, Heineken and Kronenbourg were fined [currency]2.5m, with the penalty reduced for co-operating. Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, fined cartels a record [currency]1.84bn last year.

Midday: Four brewers fined a total of €273.7m for operating a  cartel in Holland, one of  Europe's biggest beer markets. By David Gow in Brussels.

The European commission today imposed a fine of &#8364;219.3m (£150m) on  Dutch brewer Heineken for operating a price-fixing cartel with three other companies in Holland, one of  Europe's biggest beer markets.

TD
The penalties totalled &#8364;273.7m, bringing the total levied on cartels to a new record high of
&#8364;2bn in less than four months this year.
The fines, including one of &#8364;31.65m on Grolsch and another of &#8364;22.85m on
privately-owned Bavaria, came out of the blue after Brussels charged the three brewers and Belgian
rival InBev, now the world's largest  beer-producer, as long ago as September 2005 of fixing prices and
allocating customers among themselves.

InBev, then Interbrew, escaped without a penalty because, Brussels said, it provided "decisive information" about the cartel which operated between 1996 and 1999 and others in the EU market. Under the commission's leniency programme whistleblowing firms which co-operate with the
anti-trust authority see their prospective penalties either wiped out or reduced.

Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said: "This is simply unacceptable: that major  beer suppliers colluded to up prices and to carve up markets among themselves." She added: "If you do take part in cartels, you will face very substantial fines, so don't be tempted to start is my advice." She effectively urged consumers to launch damages for action in national courts under new EU rules.
Ms Kroes, who plans to clamp down even more firmly on cartels with increased fines, said she was
"very disappointed" that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level.

The brewers, she added, tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings as they carved up the  Dutch market for beer sold to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes. The  price-fixing even extended to cheaper own-brand labels and rebates for bars.
The commission, which can levy fines of up to 10% of turnover, says that the brewers controlled 95%
of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each.

Heineken made no immediate comment but Bavaria denied the charges. Peer Swinkels, a director, told AP last night he "fell from his chair" when he heard the news on  Dutch television and was "absolutely furious" that it had been leaked.
"We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model," he said.

Grolsch said it would appeal. The three penalised brewers had their fines reduced by &#8364;100,000 because of the seven years it took to complete the investigation.

In December 2001 Interbrew, Danone, the then owner of Kronenbourg, and two other smaller brewers were fined &#8364;91m for operating a  cartel in Belgium while four Luxembourg companies were fined &#8364;448,000 the same month.

In 2004 Heineken and Kronenbourg, the two dominant brewers in France, were fined &#8364;2.5m - with the penalty reduced for co-operating. A similar inquiry into an alleged Italian  cartel was closed without proceedings while the British and German  beer markets were specifically excluded.

Separately, Japanese firms Hitachi and Toshiba said they are appealing against heavy fines levied on them and several other companies, including Siemens, for running a  cartel in gas-insulated
switchgear used at power stations and using code names and encrypted emails. The  commission
imposed fines of &#8364;750m.

European Union regulators plan to fine Heineken, Bavaria and Royal Grolsch for fixing prices in the Dutch beer market, three people with knowledge of the investigation said Tuesday. The  European        Commission may also penalize InBev, the largest brewer in the world, according to the people, who declined to be identified before the decision is made public. The  European Union executive body plans to levy the fines, which can be as much of 10 percent of sales, as soon as Wednesday, the people said.
The Dutch case was part of a wider investigation of  beer markets in Europe, which started with raids in
January 2000 in countries including France, Italy and Denmark.

Three brewers have been slapped with fines totalling over EUR270m (US$367.5m) after being found guilty of  cartel activities in Holland.
The European Commission announced today (18 April) that Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria will have
to pay EUR273.8m for their parts in a  cartel in the Dutch beer market between 1996 and 1999. In 2005,
the Commission's antitrust authorities claimed that the brewers had fixed prices, allocated customers
and exchanged commercially-sensitive information between themselves in Holland.

TD
While Heineken was hit hardest, with a EUR219.3m fine, Grolsch was told to pay EUR31.58m, while Bavaria was fined EUR22.9m. InBev, meanwhile, escaped a fine for blowing the whistle on the  cartel to the Commission.

"It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves,” said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. “The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to
cover their tracks."

The Commission said that it has evidence that, in all four companies, high-ranking management, including board members, the managing director and national sales managers, participated in the  cartel meetings and discussions. “There is also evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal and took measures to avoid detection, such as using a panoply of code names and abbreviations to refer to their unofficial meetings and holding these meetings in hotels and restaurants,” the Commission added.

When contacted by just-drinks today, a spokesperson for the  Commission said: “Our investigations into the cartel began in 2000 on the initiative of the  Commission, but also thanks to InBev, who provided us with further information about the  cartel.”

Grolsch has said that it is “stunned” by the ruling, and noted that it plans to take further legal action. Heineken were not prepared to comment on the fines at this time, while no-one at Bavaria was available for comment.
The Commission spokesperson noted that the brewers will be able to appeal to the  European Court of
Justice over the fines. “Then, it will be in the hands of the courts,” she concluded.

(Adds more from Heineken paragraph 14,  Dutch restaurant association)

BRUSSELS, April 18 (Reuters) - Three  Dutch brewers were fined 273.7 million  euros ($372 million) by the European Commission on Wednesday for fixing  beer prices in their home market, with Heineken taking the brunt.

TD
The EU's antitrust chief,  Dutch-born Neelie Kroes, vowed to increase fines for cartels in the future after hitting Heineken with a 219 million-euro penalty, the seventh highest the  Commission has ever set for such a violation of EU rules.
The Commission fined Grolsch 31.7 million  euros and levied a 22.9-million-euro fine on Bavaria, a
Dutch brewer not related to SABMiller's Colombian unit of the same name.
The world's largest brewer by volume, Belgium's InBev , received no fine because it provided what the
Commission called "decisive information" about the  cartel.

"My message to companies is quite clear. The  European Commission will not tolerate cartels and if you do take part in cartels you will face very substantial fines," Kroes told reporters.
"So don't be tempted to start, that's my advice. If you are already in a  cartel, then blow the whistle."

The Commission said the evidence for the  beer cartel, which took place between 1996-1999, included "hand-written notes taken at unofficial meetings and proof of the dates and places when these meetings took place."
That evidence "showed that Heineken, InBev, Grolsch and Bavaria ran an illegal  cartel in The
Netherlands," the  European Union's top antitrust regulator said.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she said.
The cartel covered beer sold in hotels, restaurants and cafes and supermarkets. RECORD-BREAKING YEAR FOR FINES
Shares in Grolsch dropped after the  Commission made the announcement and at 1308 GMT were trading at 31.20  euros, down 1.3 percent. Grolsch said it would appeal against the fine.

"With amazement Grolsch has taken note of the decision and will appeal against it," the brewer said in a statement.
Heineken's shares were down 0.2 percent at 38.60  euros.

"Heineken is highly surprised by the decision and finds the fine excessive and unjustified given the strong arguments that the company put forward to the  European Commission," the company said, adding that it intends to appeal.

A Dutch catering, restaurant and hotel association demanded cuts in  beer prices and planned action against the  cartel.
"We are preparing a claim to seek compensation for entrepreneurs," Koninklijk Horeca Nederland (KHN)
said in a statement.
InBev's shares were down 1.6 percent at 56  euros. InBev said it respected the decision.

"We want to stress that this is a case that is old", an ImBev spokeswoman said, adding that the company had applied for leniency and cooperated fully with the inquiry.
Bavaria said it would appeal against the fine.

After setting 1.8 billion  euros of cartel fines in 2006, Kroes said the  Commission had already smashed that record-breaking year by imposing over 2 billion  euros in just the first four months of this year.
The EU executive fined companies that had formed a  cartel in elevator manufacturing close to 1 billion
euros in February, with ThyssenKrupp incurring the heaviest ever penalty set by the  Commission of
480 million euros.
"No doubt, in the near future there will be, in our philosophy, higher fines," she told a news conference. (Additional reporting by Gilbert Kreijger in Amsterdam, Philip Blenkinsop and Marcin Grajewski in

TCI says timing of ABN talks with RBS group 'disadvantageous'

TD
AMSTERDAM (Thomson Financial) - ABN Amro Holding NV shareholder The Children's Investment Fund
(TCI) has attacked the  Dutch bank's decision to wait until next week before talking to a consortium
thought to be planning a break-up bid for the group. In a statement, TCI said holding the talks after
Friday's 5 pm deadline for ABN shareholders to register to vote at the bank's April 26 Annual General
Meeting is "disingenuous and disadvantageous for shareholders".
Lufthansa still interested in acquisitions; main focus on organic growth

BERLIN, Germany (Thomson Financial) - Deutsche Lufthansa AG chief executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said the airline is generally interested in making acquisitions if the right opportunity arises. The company
"is in the position to make acquisitions (such as) 'Swiss'", he said, but added that the flagship carrier wants to "mainly grow organically".
EADS not involved in possible legal action by  Eurofighter against Austria

European Union regulators plan to fine Heineken NV, Bavaria NV and Royal Grolsch NV for fixing prices in the Dutch beer market, three people with knowledge of the probe said.

The European Commission may also penalize InBev NV, the world's largest brewer, according to the people, who declined to be identified before the decision is made public.

The Dutch case was part of a wider investigation of  Europe's beer markets, which started with raids in January 2000 in countries including France, Italy and Denmark.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday imposed more than EUR273 million in fines on three Dutch brewers for fixing prices in their home market. It said their senior managements operated a cartel and that it was imposing the heavy penalties as a deterrent.

Heineken NV (00916.AE) was fined EUR219.27 million, Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) EUR31.65 million and privately-held Bavaria NV EUR22.85 million.

Belgian brewer InBev NV (INB.BT) escaped a potential EUR84 million fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided "decisive information" on it,  European antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
Corrected April 18, 2007 5:52 ET (0952 GMT) [ 18-04-07 0920GMT ]
The European Commission Wednesday imposed more than EUR273 million in fines on three  Dutch
brewers for fixing prices in their home market.

(In "EU Hands Out Heavy Fines To Brewers In  Dutch Cartel Case" published 0920 GMT, the day was incorrect.) [ 18-04-07 0949GMT ]

Under Kroes, the  commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including a EUR992 million fine in February against five elevator makers.

The Dutch case culminates a number of similar investigations into  European brewers fixing prices in their home markets.

In 2001, the E.U. fined a number of brewers a total of just EUR91 million for running a similar cartel in Belgium. Danone SA (DA) received a EUR44 million fine, later trimmed on appeal to the European Court of First Instance to EUR42.41 million. InBev was fined EUR46.5 million. [ 18-04-07 0950GMT ]
In Wednesday's case, the  commission said brewers ran a cartel between 1996 and 1999.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behavior was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," said Kroes.

"It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves."

After the  commission on its own initiative uncovered the  cartel in the Belgian  beer market, InBev provided information on other cartels. This led to surprise raids in 2002 on brewers in France, Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands. Fines were imposed in the French and Luxembourg cases, though the Italian investigation was closed without charges being filed.
Kroes Wednesday said  beer makers had fixed prices throughout the continent. She said it would be
"unwise" to say whether other investigations were ongoing or this was "the end of the story."

The commission said its raids had uncovered handwritten notes and proof of the dates and places when cartel meetings took place.

Page 40 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
At meetings dubbed "agenda meeting", "Catherijne meeting" or "sliding scale meeting," the four brewers coordinated prices, and price increases of  beer in both restaurants and supermarkets. Evidence
showed board members, managing directors and national sales managers participated in the  cartel
meetings and discussions, the  commission said.

The companies were aware their behavior was illegal and took measures to avoid detection, by using code names and abbreviations to refer to their unofficial meetings and holding these meetings in hotels and restaurants, the  commission said.

"The fines take account of the size of the markets for the products, the duration of the cartels and the size of the firms involved," Kroes said.

"In particular, the larger companies have been allocated larger fines compared to the smaller companies, but even the smaller companies need to be punished with a deterrent fine for participating in a hard-core cartel."

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday imposed EUR274 million in fines on three Dutch brewers for fixing prices in their home market, saying their senior managements operated a cartel and that it was imposing the heavy penalties as a deterrent.

Heineken NV (00916.AE) was fined EUR219.27 million, Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) EUR31.65 million and privately-held Bavaria NV EUR22.85 million.

Belgian brewer InBev NV (INB.BT) escaped a potential EUR84 million fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided "decisive information" on it,  European antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Under Kroes, the  Commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including the largest ever fine of EUR992 million in February against five elevator makers led by ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) and also in February 10 power gear companies EUR397 million led by Siemens AG (SIE.XE).

Unlike U.S. trustbusters, Kroes cannot bring criminal charges and threaten  cartel offenders with jail, which makes it harder to crack tough cases.

But she can fine companies up to 10% of their worldwide sales if they are found guilty of participating in a cartel and she said Wednesday that the  Commission will up its push for higher  cartel fines.
"No doubt, in the near future there will be, in our philosophy, higher fines," she told a news conference. The cartel crackdown represents a major policy change in  Europe. Ever since the trade guilds of the
Middle Ages, antitrust experts say cozy cooperation long was the norm among  European companies.
But experts say the move to a single currency and a unified market, followed by deregulation of major
industries and the privatization of national monopolies have changed attitudes.

Companies face tough choices. Regulators allow companies to apply for leniency and cooperate with investigations, as InBev did in the present case.

" InBev today complies with all relevant competition laws," InBev spokeswoman Marianne Anssoms. Our employees must understand the extent competition laws apply to their work.

Companies can also fight  cartel probes, dragging out investigations. Heineken fought the present  cartel charges, "thoroughly exercising its right to defense," a  Commission official said, explaining why it had been more than five after the  cartel was uncovered before fines were imposed.

Once fines are imposed, many companies appeal them to the  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Heineken said Wednesday it was studying this option, while Grolsch said it would go ahead with this legal option. Although the Court has upheld most  cartel fines, it sometimes has reduced the amounts involved.

E.U. Commissioner Kroes said Wednesday she believed the evidence was strong enough against the brewers to overcome any appeal.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday imposed EUR274 million in fines on three Dutch brewers for fixing prices in their home market, saying their senior managements operated a cartel and that it was imposing the heavy penalties as a deterrent.

Heineken NV (00916.AE) was fined EUR219.27 million, Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) EUR31.65 million and privately-held Bavaria NV EUR22.85 million.

Belgian brewer InBev NV (INB.BT) escaped a potential EUR84 million fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided "decisive information" on it,  European antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Analysts said the fines are higher than they anticipated. ING analyst Gerard Rijk said he expected a fine for Heineken of up to EUR100M and only EUR20M for Grolsch. As a smaller company, the impact is greatest on Grolsch, whose fine equals EUR1.90 per share, compared with EUR0.50/shr for Heineken.
If there's a positive side, analysts said, it is that the maximum amount of the penalty is known. Heineken said that the fine will be treated as an exceptional item in this current year and will have no impact on
the company's 2007 full-year forecast of 10%-13% organic profit growth.

Investors, for the most part, shrugged off the news. In mid-afternoon trading, Heineken shares were down 0.15% at EUR38.6, Grolsch traded down 1.9% at EUR31, and InBev shares were down 1.2% at EUR56.2.

Under Kroes, the  Commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including the largest ever fine of EUR992 million in February against five elevator makers led by ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) and also in February 10 power gear companies EUR397 million led by Siemens AG (SIE.XE).

Once fines are imposed, many companies appeal them to the  European Court of First Instance in
Luxembourg.

Grolsch said it is "stunned by the ruling and plans to appeal." Heineken said it is "highly surprised" and has the same intention. And Bavaria said in a response that it will "definitely appeal" the decision. Although the Court has upheld most  cartel fines, it sometimes has reduced the amounts involved.

E.U. Commissioner Kroes said Wednesday she believed the evidence was strong enough against the brewers to overcome any appeal.

HD          EU Fines Dutch Beer Cartel 274 Mln Euro

The European Commission (EC) has imposed a fine, totalling 273,783,000 euro ($372.6 mln), on three Dutch brewers - Heineken NV, Royal Grolsch and Bavaria - for violating European Union (EU) competition laws, the EC said on April 18, 2007.

Heineken, with a domestic market share of more than 50 pct, will pay 219,275,000  euro ($298.4 mln), Grolsch 31,658,000  euro ($43.1 mln) and Bavaria 22,850,000  euro ($31.1 mln).

TD
Belgo-Brazilian brewer InBev, although involved in the illegal activity, received no fines as it provided decisive information on the forbidden  cartel.
Grolsch will appeal the fine, while Heineken did not elaborate on potential legal steps.

The EC said the companies held numerous unofficial meetings between 1996 and 1999, during which they coordinated prices and price increases in the  Dutch beer market.

"It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

According to Kroes, the top management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks.

The brewers coordinated prices and price increases both in the on-trade segment of the market, including hotels, restaurants and cafes, as well as the off-trade market segment, including private label beer.

In 2000, the EC initiated probes at various brewers and in 2005 it brought charges of price fixing during the late 1990s. Due to the long-lived procedure, the fines were reduced by 100,000 euro ($136,000).

Four Belgian brewers were hit with a total fine of 91 mln  euro ($123.8 mln) by the EC in 2001 as they took part in two forbidden cartels.

The first  cartel, between market leader Interbrew, now InBev, and number two in the market, Danone/Alken-Maes, existed from 1993 to the beginning of 1998. The second  cartel was much smaller in size and time and included also the smaller brewers Haacht and Martens.
In the French  beer market, the total fine amounted to 2.5 mln  euro ($3.4 mln), of which 1.0 mln  euro
($1.3 mln) paid by Heineken and the rest by Groupe Danone/ Brasseries Kronenbourg.

HD         Hefty fines likely for Dutch beer cartel

InBev, the world's largest beer producer, and three other  European breweries are facing hefty fines today for operating an illegal cartel in the Netherlands during the mid to late 1990s.

In 2000, the European Commission raided the quartet - InBev, Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria -after suspecting that they had broken European Union competition policy rules by colluding to carve up the Dutch market between themselves.

TD
Five years later, it formally charged the companies with  price-fixing, allocating customers, discussing individual customers and exchanging confidential information between 1994 and 1999. According to the Commission, the practice kept the price of  beer artificially high in supermarkets, hotels, restaurants
and cafes.

The Commission would not comment yesterday about the possibility of penalties, but Veronique Schyns, a spokeswoman for Heineken, the world's fourth-largest brewer by volume, said that fines were imminent.

"We have been expecting a decision for some time and, according to reports in the Netherlands, we expect a fine," she told The Times.

InBev and Grolsch, the third-largest brewer in the Netherlands, refused to comment until a decision was made.
The Commission is expected to determine the fines today. Under EU rules, these can be as high as
10 per cent of a company's worldwide turnover and would take account of the duration and gravity of
the offence.

However, under an amnesty scheme penalties can be reduced or even waived for companies that voluntarily provide the Brussels regulators with evidence enabling them to uncover illegal business practices. The crackdown is the latest example of the determination of Neelie Kroes, the European Competition Commissioner, to use her anti-trust powers to punish companies that flout European rules and prevent consumers benefiting from lower prices.

Last year, the  Commission imposed fines worth  Euro 1.85 billion (Pounds 1.25 billion) on companies involved in cartels. Already this year the penalties have reached  Euro 1.7 billion.

HD         Dutch brewer Heineken faces EU fine for price fixing

BRUSSELS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is expected to announce a heavy fine on
Wednesday on Dutch brewer Heineken for operating a price-fixing cartel in the Netherlands.

Three other brewers may also be fined; Dutch beer maker Grolsch, the world's largest  beer producer, InBev in Belgium and the privately owned Bavaria, Dutch media reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources close to the case.

TD
The European Commission declined to comment on the media reports but the Heineken acknowledged on Tuesday that it was to receive a fine. Bavaria denied the charges.
"Heineken is expecting a fine from the  Commission tomorrow," Heineken spokeswoman Veronique
Schyns said.

In September 2005, the four companies were formally charged by the European Commission with fixing prices, exchanging confidential information and dividing up the Dutch beer market among themselves between 1994 and 1998. The four brewers controlled 95 percent of the  Dutch market, with Heineken claiming half and the three others 15 percent each.

If found guilty, the companies could face fines of up to 10 percent of their total annual turnover. Since Heineken and InBev had been previously accused of participating in illegal cartels, they would risk particularly heavy fines, although the exact amount was not disclosed.

It would be for the third time this year for the  European Commission to hand down anti-trust fines against illegal  cartel.

Nearly one month after 10 power equipment makers were fined 750 million  euros (1 billion U.S. dollars) in January, several lift manufacturers were given a combined penalty worth 992 million euros (1.34 billion dollars), the biggest ever imposed by the  European Union's anti-trust watchdog for cartel violations.
Shares in Heineken, Grolsch and InBev all dipped Tuesday following media reports of imminent fines.

BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission decided on Wednesday to fine  Dutch brewer Heineken and two other companies a total of 274 million  euros for their role in operating an illegal cartel on the Dutch beer market.

"It is unacceptable that the major beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves," the European Union's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said when declaring the fine.

TD
Four companies, including Heineken,  Dutch beer maker Grolsch, as well as Belgian giant InBev and the privately owned Bavaria, were found to be participants of the  cartel.

Heineken alone had to pay a penalty of 219 million  euros, while Grolsch and Bavaria were fined 31.7 million euros and 22.9 million  euros respectively. InBev was exempted from a potential fine of 84 million euros because the company helped investigation of  beer cartels in several other EU countries.

The European Commission formally charged the four companies in September 2005 with fixing prices and dividing up the Dutch beer market among themselves at least between 1996 and 1999.
It was for the third time this year that the EU antitrust watchdog handed down heavy fines against illegal
cartel.

Nearly one month after ten companies making power generation equipment were fined 750 million euros in January, several lift manufacturers were given a combined penalty worth 992 million  euros, the biggest ever fine imposed for  cartel violations.

BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission decided on Wednesday to fine  Dutch brewer Heineken and two other companies a total of 274 million  euros (370 million U.S. dollars) for their role in operating an illegal  cartel on the Dutch beer market.

"It is unacceptable that the major beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves," the European Union's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said when declaring the fine.

TD
Four companies, including Heineken,  Dutch beer maker Grolsch, as well as Belgian giant InBev and the privately owned Bavaria, were found to be participants of the  cartel.

Heineken, who occupied half of the  Dutch market, had to pay a penalty of 219 million  euros, while Grolsch and Bavaria were fined 31.7 million euros and 22.9 million  euros respectively. InBev was exempted from a potential fine of 84 million euros because the company helped investigation of  beer cartels in several other EU countries.

The European Commission formally charged the four companies in September 2005 with fixing prices and dividing up the Dutch beer market among themselves at least between 1996 and 1999.
Evidence showed that in all four brewery groups high-ranking management, such as board members,
the managing director and national sales managers, participated in the  cartel meetings and discussions.

They even used code names and abbreviations to refer to their unofficial meetings held in hotels and restaurants, obviously to avoid detection.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behavior was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," Kroes said.

Heineken said it was surprised by the  commission's decision and intended to appeal against the fine once the company was informed of full details.

Shares in InBev and Grolsch traded lower following the news, while Heineken recovered from earlier falls.
The European Commission, on its own initiative, uncovered a  cartel on the Belgian  beer market in
2001, involving InBev. The Belgian beer maker, in exchange for leniency, provided information about its
participation in cartels in other European countries, which led to surprise inspections on brewers in
France, Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands.

It was for the third time this year that the EU antitrust watchdog handed down heavy fines against illegal cartels.
Nearly one month after ten companies making power generation equipment were fined 750 million
euros in January, several lift manufacturers were given a combined penalty worth 992 million  euros, the
biggest ever fine imposed for  cartel violations.

The total fines against illegal cartels levied by the  European Commission amounted to 2 billion  euros for the first four months of this year, which already surpassed the record figure throughout 2006. Last year, the total fines against cartels came to 1.8 billion  euros.

HD     EU fines Heineken €219 million for beer cartel, brings  fine total to €2 billion this year

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators fined Heineken NV €219.27 million (US$297.09 million) on Wednesday for fixing Dutch beer prices, setting a record by bringing to €2 billion (US$2.7 billion) the amount the European Union has fined cartels in a year.

The European Commission also ordered Grolsch NV to pay €31.65 million (US$42.88 million) and privately held Bavaria NV €22.85 million (US$30.96 million) for a  cartel it said they ran from at least 1996 to 1999 to coordinate price increases.

TD
Brewer InBev SA was exempted from a fine because it blew the whistle on several  European beer
cartels after regulators caught it fixing prices in Belgium.

Heineken said it found the fine "excessive and unjustified" and would study the ruling with the intention of appealing to the EU courts. Grolsch said it was "stunned" and would appeal. Bavaria had previously vowed to contest any fine.

Consumers could also take damage actions against the companies in national courts, said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Royal Horeca Netherlands, the organization of  Dutch hotels, restaurants and cafes, said it would file suit against the brewers, seeking "substantial" damages and demanding they lower wholesale prices that the group says have increased more than inflation.
Kroes said the high fines were a warning to companies involved similar activity.

"If you do take part in cartels, you will face very substantial fines, so don't be tempted to start is my advice," she said. "If you are already in a  cartel, then blow the whistle to the  Commission to gain immunity before someone else blows the whistle on you."

In all the  beer companies, the EU said, senior executives such as board members, the managing director and national sales managers took part in  cartel meetings and discussions.

"The management of these companies at the very highest level participated in this  cartel ... knowing that this behavior was illegal," Kroes said. "Instead of respecting the law, they instead covered their tracks."

The executives tried to avoid detection, the  Commission said, by using code names and abbreviations to refer to the meetings held in hotels and restaurants. Under EU law, executives are not personally liable for taking part in a  cartel.

There were numerous unofficial meetings at which the four companies coordinated prices and price increases for beer that customers buy in bars and the  beer they buy from supermarkets, even under cheaper "no brand" private label  beer, the EU's executive arm said.

Heineken's fine was much higher than the others because it has more than half the  Dutch market by value and volume, Kroes said.

Page 55 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
She said the amount also reflected the length of the  cartel and the effort EU officials faced in unearthing evidence that had been covered up.

Heineken said it was "highly surprised" by the decision, rejecting the EU conclusion that  Dutch price hikes were coordinated. Instead, it said consumer prices for  beer sold in shops fell during the late 1990s and price increases for trade customers were in line with general price trends. The company did not make private label beer at all, it said.
The fine would be treated as an exceptional item in this year's results and would have no impact on its
2007 forecast that net profit would grow by between 10 percent and 13 percent, it said.
Bavaria director Peer Swinkels had said Tuesday that his company was "completely innocent" of any
price-fixing and vowed to contest any fine.

Regulators said they found handwritten notes taken during the meetings that confirmed they took place, backing up information supplied by InBev. Providing "decisive information" allowed InBev to escape a potential €84 million (US$113.81 million) fine.

Information it provided led to the EU fining Heineken and Groupe Danone SA in 2004 for a French  cartel, adding to other fines levied on brewers in Belgium and Luxembourg. A similar investigation in Italy was closed without charges being brought.

The EU has been cracking down on cartels in recent years, imposing ever-higher penalties. It fined a group of elevator and escalator makers €992 million (US$1.3 billion) in February, a month after it levied
€750 million (US$978 million) in fines on several companies that supplied power utilities.
These fines, from just the first four months of this year, already surpass last year's record-breaking total of
€1.8 billion (US$2.44 billion).

HD     EU fines beer makers Heineken, Grolsch  and Bavaria about $370M in Dutch price-fixing probe

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators fined Heineken NV, Grolsch NV and Bavaria NV
nearly 275 million euros ($370 million) on Wednesday for fixing  Dutch beer prices.

The fines, including a 219.3 million  euro penalty to be paid by Heineken, pushes the total levied by the European Commission against cartels in 2007 to 2 billion  euros ($2.7 billion), already surpassing last year's record total.

TD
The EU ordered Grolsch NV to pay 31.7 million  euros and Bavaria NV 22.9 million  euros for a cartel
regulators said they ran from at least 1996 to 1999 to coordinate  Dutch beer price increases.

Brewer InBev SA was exempted from a potential fine of 84 million  euros ($114 million) because it blew the whistle on several  European beer cartels, providing "decisive information," after regulators caught it price-fixing in Belgium.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high fines were a warning to any company currently involved in an illegal cartel that increases prices for customers.

"If you do take part in cartels, you will face very substantial fines, so don't be tempted to start is my advice," she said. "If you are already in a  cartel, then blow the whistle to the  Commission to gain immunity before someone else blows the whistle on you."

Heineken called the fine "excessive and unjustified" and said would study the ruling with the intention of appealing to the EU courts. The company rejected the EU conclusion that  Dutch price hikes were coordinated. Instead, it said, consumer prices for  beer sold in shops fell during the late 1990s and price increases for trade customers were in line with general price trends.
Grolsch said it was "stunned" and would appeal. Bavaria had previously vowed to contest any fine.

The EU said the illegal cooperation among the  beer companies involved senior executives such as board members, the managing director and national sales managers.

"I was very disappointed to learn from our investigation into this case that the management of these companies at the very highest level participated in this  cartel ... knowing that this behavior was illegal," Kroes said. "Instead of respecting the law, they instead covered their tracks."

They knew what they were doing was illegal, the  Commission said, because they tried to avoid detection by using code names and abbreviations to refer to the meetings held in hotels and restaurants. Under EU law, executives are not personally liable for taking part in a  cartel.

There were numerous unofficial meetings where the four companies coordinated prices and price increases for beer that customers buy in bars and  beer they buy from supermarkets, the EU's executive arm said.

Heineken's fine was higher because it holds more than half the  Dutch market in terms of revenue and volume, Kroes said. She said the amount also reflected the length of the activity and the effort EU officials faced in unearthing evidence.
The levies against the  beer makers come two months after the EU fined elevator and escalator makers
992 million euros ($1.3 billion), including 479 million  euros ($630 million) against repeat offender
ThyssenKrupp, the largest ever for one company.

In January, it levied a 750 million  euro ($978 million) fine on a  cartel that fixed the prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, with Siemens AG ordered to pay more than half the total.

Last year, the total fines against cartels came to 1.8 billion  euros ($2.4 billion), a figure already surpassed by such fines in the first four months of this year.

HD     Brewers hit with price-fixing fines as EU cracks down on cartels

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators fined Heineken 219.27 million  euros ($297.09 million) on Wednesday for fixing  Dutch beer prices, setting a record by bringing to 2 billion  euros ($2.7 billion) the amount it has fined cartels in a year.

The European Commission also ordered Grolsch NV to pay 31.65 million  euros ($42.88 million) and privately held Bavaria NV 22.85 million  euros ($30.96 million) for a  cartel it said they ran from at least
1996 to 1999 to coordinate price increases.

Brewer InBev SA was exempted from a fine because it blew the whistle on several  European beer
cartels after regulators caught it fixing prices in Belgium.

Heineken NV said it found the fine "excessive and unjustified" and that it may appeal to the EU courts. Grolsch said it was "stunned" and would appeal. Bavaria had previously vowed to contest any fine.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the high fines were a warning to other companies. "If you do take part in cartels, you will face very substantial fines, so don't be tempted to start is my
advice," she said. "If you are already in a  cartel, then blow the whistle to the  Commission to gain
immunity before someone else blows the whistle on you."
In all the  beer companies, the EU said, senior executives took part in fixing prices.

"The management of these companies at the very highest level participated in this  cartel ... knowing that this behavior was illegal," Kroes said.

The executives sued code names and abbreviations to refer to the meetings held in hotels and restaurants to avoid detection, the  Commission said.

Heineken's fine was the largest because it has more than half the  Dutch market by value and volume, Kroes said.
Consumers could take further action against the companies in national courts, she said.

Heineken said it was "highly surprised" by the decision and denied  price fixing.  The company said consumer prices for beer sold in shops actually fell during the late 1990s and that price increases for trade customers were in line with general price trends.
The fine would be treated as an exceptional item in this year's results and would have no impact on
Heineken's 2007 forecast that net profit would grow by between 10 percent and 13 percent, it said.

Bavaria director Peer Swinkels, a member of the family that owns the company, said Tuesday that his company was "completely innocent" of any  price-fixing would contest any fine.
"We compete on prices. We're the underdog. That's our whole business model," he said.

Regulators said they found handwritten notes from the meetings that confirmed they took place, backing up information supplied by InBev. Providing "decisive information" allowed InBev to escape a potential 84 million euros ($113.81 million) fine.

Information it provided led to the EU fining Heineken and Groupe Danone SA in 2004 for a French  cartel, adding to other fines levied on brewers in Belgium and Luxembourg.

The EU has been cracking down on cartels in several industries in recent years. It fined a group of elevator and escalator makers 992 million  euros ($1.3 billion) in February, a month after it levied 750 million euros ($978 million) in fines on several companies that supplied power utilities.

Fines in the first four months of this year have already surpassed last year's record-breaking total of 1.8 billion euros ($2.44 billion).

Of Dow Jones Newswires

The European Commission Wednesday imposed EUR274 million in fines on three Dutch brewers for fixing prices in their home market, saying their senior managements operated a cartel and that it was imposing the heavy penalties as a deterrent.

Heineken NV (00916.AE) was fined EUR219.27 million, Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) EUR31.65 million and privately-held Bavaria NV EUR22.85 million.

Belgian brewer InBev NV (INB.BT) escaped a potential EUR84 million fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided "decisive information" on it,  European antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Under Kroes, the  Commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including the largest ever fine of EUR992 million in February against five elevator makers led by ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) and also in February 10 power gear companies EUR397 million led by Siemens AG (SIE.XE).

Unlike U.S. trustbusters, Kroes cannot bring criminal charges and threaten  cartel offenders with jail, which makes it harder to crack tough cases.

But she can fine companies up to 10% of their worldwide sales if they are found guilty of participating in a cartel and she said Wednesday that the  Commission will up its push for higher  cartel fines.
"No doubt, in the near future there will be, in our philosophy, higher fines," she told a news conference. The cartel crackdown represents a major policy change in  Europe. Ever since the trade guilds of the
Middle Ages, antitrust experts say cozy cooperation long was the norm among  European companies.
But experts say the move to a single currency and a unified market, followed by deregulation of major
industries and the privatization of national monopolies have changed attitudes.

Companies face tough choices. Regulators allow companies to apply for leniency and cooperate with investigations, as InBev did in the present case.

" InBev today complies with all relevant competition laws," InBev spokeswoman Marianne Anssoms. Our employees must understand the extent competition laws apply to their work.

Companies can also fight  cartel probes, dragging out investigations. Heineken fought the present cartel charges, "thoroughly exercising its right to defense," a  Commission official said, explaining why it had been more than five after the  cartel was uncovered before fines were imposed.

Once fines are imposed, many companies appeal them to the  European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Heineken said Wednesday it was studying this option, while Grolsch said it would go ahead with this legal option. Although the Court has upheld most  cartel fines, it sometimes has reduced the amounts involved.
Page 64 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
E.U. Commissioner Kroes said Wednesday she believed the evidence was strong enough against the brewers to overcome any appeal.

The Dutch beer case culminates a number of similar investigations into  European brewers fixing prices in their home markets. In 2001, the E.U. fined a number of brewers a total of only EUR91 million for running a similar cartel in Belgium. Danone SA (DA) received a EUR44 million fine, later trimmed
on appeal to the European Court of First Instance to EUR42.41 million. InBev was fined EUR46.5 million.

Under Kroes, the  commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including a EUR992 million fine in February against five elevator makers.

After the  commission on its own initiative uncovered the  cartel on the Belgian  beer market, InBev provided information on other cartels. This led to surprise raids in 2002 on brewers in France, Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands. Fines were imposed in the French and Luxembourg cases, though the Italian probe was closed without charges being filed.

On Wednesday, Kroes said  beer makers fixed prices throughout the continent and it would be "unwise" to say whether other probes were ongoing or this "was the end of the story."

From its raids, the  commission said it uncovered handwritten notes and proof of the dates and places when cartel meetings took place.

At meetings, called "agenda meeting", "Catherijne meeting" or "sliding scale meeting," the four brewers coordinated prices, and price increases of  beer in both restaurants and supermarkets.

Evidence showed board members, the managing director and national sales managers participated in the cartel meetings and discussions, the  commission said.

The companies were aware their behavior was illegal and took measures to avoid detection, by using code names and abbreviations to refer to their unofficial meetings and holding these meetings in hotels and restaurants, the  commission said.

"The fines take account of the size of the markets for the products, the duration of the cartels and the size of the firms involved," Kroes said.

"In particular, the larger companies have been allocated larger fines compared to the smaller companies, but even the smaller companies need to be punished with a deterrent fine for participating in a hard-core cartel."

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday imposed EUR274 million in fines on three Dutch brewers for fixing prices in their home market, saying their senior managements operated a cartel and that it was imposing the heavy penalties as a deterrent.

Heineken NV (00916.AE) was fined EUR219.27 million, Royal Grolsch NV (35479.AE) EUR31.65 million and privately-held Bavaria NV EUR22.85 million.

Belgian brewer InBev NV (INB.BT) escaped a potential EUR84 million fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided "decisive information" on it,  European antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Analysts said the fines are higher than they anticipated. ING analyst Gerard Rijk said he expected a fine for Heineken of up to EUR100M and only EUR20M for Grolsch. As a smaller company, the impact is greatest on Grolsch, whose fine equals EUR1.90 per share, compared with EUR0.50/shr for Heineken.
If there's a positive side, analysts said, it is that the maximum amount of the penalty is known. Heineken said that the fine will be treated as an exceptional item in this current year and will have no impact on
the company's 2007 full-year forecast of 10%-13% organic profit growth.

Investors, for the most part, shrugged off the news. In mid-afternoon trading, Heineken shares were down 0.15% at EUR38.6, Grolsch traded down 1.9% at EUR31, and InBev shares were down 1.2% at EUR56.2.

Under Kroes, the  Commission has cracked down on cartels, imposing ever higher fines. In the past year, it has imposed a record EUR2 billion, including the largest ever fine of EUR992 million in February against five elevator makers led by ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) and also in February 10 power gear companies EUR397 million led by Siemens AG (SIE.XE).

HD     Hefty fines likely for Dutch beer cartel

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - InBev, the world's largest beer producer, and three other  European breweries are facing hefty fines for operating an illegal cartel in the Netherlands during the mid- to late-1990s.

TD
In 2000, the European Commission raided the quartet -- InBev, Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria -- after suspecting they had broken European Union competition policy rules by colluding to carve up the  Dutch market between themselves.

Five years later, it formally charged the companies with  price-fixing, allocating customers, discussing individual customers and exchanging confidential information between 1994 and 1999. According to the Commission, the practice kept the price of  beer artificially high in supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes.

The Commission would not comment yesterday about the possibility of penalties, but Veronique Schyns, a spokeswoman for Heineken, said fines were imminent.

"We have been expecting a decision for some time and, according to reports in the Netherlands, we expect a fine," she said.
InBev and Grolsch refused to comment until a decision was made.

Dutch brewing giants Heineken and Grolsch have been fined by  European regulators after being found guilty of  price fixing.

TD
The European Commission ruled that Heineken, Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev ran a  cartel in the
Netherlands between 1996 and 1999, stifling competition and colluding to fix prices.

Heineken received the biggest fine of 219.3 million  euros (£148.5 million), as it has the largest share of the market - accounting for more than 50% of sales - while Grolsch was fined 31.7 million  euros (£21.5 million) and Bavaria 22.9 million  euros (£15.5 million).

InBev, which makes Stella Artois, escaped a fine after it provided key information on the  cartel to investigators.
It is expected that the three firms will contest the fines.

The fines come at the end of a seven-year investigation which began after the  Commission uncovered a cartel involving InBev in the Belgium  beer market.
InBev then provided information about other cartels in which it was involved in other  European
countries, under the auspices of the  Commission's leniency policy.

The Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves.

'The highest management of these companies knew that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks.''

The Commission said it had collected evidence which showed that the firms had held meetings to co-ordinate prices and price increases to licensed premises and supermarkets in the Netherlands.

It said there was also proof that the companies knew what they were doing was illegal as they took measures to avoid detection, including inventing codenames to conceal the unofficial meetings.
Heineken said it was 'highly surprised'' by the  Commission's decision, adding that it finds the fine
'excessive and unjustified''.

It disagreed with the suggestion that prices in the  Dutch market were increased via co-ordinated practices and said it had demonstrated that prices in the off-trade (supermarket) market actually declined during the time period in question, while the rises to licensed premises increased in line with the consumer price index.
It said it intended to appeal the decision once the full details of the investigation became available.

BRUSSELS, April 18 (Reuters) - Three  Dutch brewers were fined 273.7 million  euros ($372 million) by the European Commission on Wednesday for fixing  beer prices in their home market, with Heineken taking the brunt.

TD
The EU's antitrust chief,  Dutch-born Neelie Kroes, vowed to increase fines for cartels in the future after hitting Heineken with a 219 million-euro penalty, the seventh highest the  Commission has ever set for such a violation of EU rules.
The Commission fined Grolsch 31.7 million  euros and levied a 22.9-million-euro fine on Bavaria, a
Dutch brewer not related to SABMiller's Colombian unit of the same name.
The world's largest brewer by volume, Belgium's InBev , received no fine because it provided what the
Commission called "decisive information" about the  cartel.

"My message to companies is quite clear. The  European Commission will not tolerate cartels and if you do take part in cartels you will face very substantial fines," Kroes told reporters.
"So don't be tempted to start, that's my advice. If you are already in a  cartel, then blow the whistle."

The Commission said the evidence for the  beer cartel, which took place between 1996-1999, included "hand-written notes taken at unofficial meetings and proof of the dates and places when these meetings took place."
That evidence "showed that Heineken, InBev, Grolsch and Bavaria ran an illegal  cartel in The
Netherlands," the  European Union's top antitrust regulator said.

"The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she said.
The cartel covered beer sold in hotels, restaurants and cafes and supermarkets. RECORD-BREAKING YEAR FOR FINES
Shares in Grolsch dropped after the  Commission made the announcement and at 1308 GMT were trading at 31.20  euros, down 1.3 percent. Grolsch said it would appeal against the fine.

"With amazement Grolsch has taken note of the decision and will appeal against it," the brewer said in a statement.
Heineken's shares were down 0.2 percent at 38.60  euros.

"Heineken is highly surprised by the decision and finds the fine excessive and unjustified given the strong arguments that the company put forward to the  European Commission," the company said, adding that it intends to appeal.

A Dutch catering, restaurant and hotel association demanded cuts in  beer prices and planned action against the  cartel.
"We are preparing a claim to seek compensation for entrepreneurs," Koninklijk Horeca Nederland
(KHN) said in a statement.
InBev's shares were down 1.6 percent at 56  euros. InBev said it respected the decision.

"We want to stress that this is a case that is old", an ImBev spokeswoman said, adding that the company had applied for leniency and cooperated fully with the inquiry.
Bavaria said it would appeal against the fine.

After setting 1.8 billion  euros of cartel fines in 2006, Kroes said the  Commission had already smashed that record-breaking year by imposing over 2 billion  euros in just the first four months of this year.
The EU executive fined companies that had formed a  cartel in elevator manufacturing close to 1 billion
euros in February, with ThyssenKrupp incurring the heaviest ever penalty set by the  Commission of
480 million euros.
"No doubt, in the near future there will be, in our philosophy, higher fines," she told a news conference. (Additional reporting by Gilbert Kreijger in Amsterdam, Philip Blenkinsop and Marcin Grajewski in

HD     CARTELS : BEER BUST LEADS TO 273 MILLION EURO IN FINES WC     487 words

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes announced on 18 April that three  Dutch brewers - Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria - have been fined a total of €273.783 million for taking part in a cartel to fix the price of their beers. The fourth  cartel member, InBev, was granted 100% immunity under the European Commission's leniency programme and received no fine. From 1996 to 1999, the companies, which jointly held a huge 92% of the Dutch beer market, got together to fix prices and price increases for their products. This included both beer sold to hotels, pubs and cafés and the off-sales market - primarily supermarkets, including private label  beer sold under supermarkets' own brands. The companies jointly set rebate levels granted to pubs and bars and shared out customers amongst themselves.

TD
It was InBev which blew the whistle and gave up details of the  cartel to the Commission. Secret meetings took place in different hotels and restaurants attended by high-ranking management' - CEOs or board members, who attempted to cover their tracks by using code names. The other companies did not cooperate with the  Commission investigation and received no reductions, bar a mere €100,000 each in recognition of the long duration of the investigation. Heineken, as the biggest company with the largest market share, received the largest fine of €219,275,000. Grolsch and Bavaria, being smaller market players, were fined €31.65 and €22.85 million, respectively.

Commenting on the justifiability of the leniency system, which led to a zero fine for InBev despite its undisputed involvement, Kroes said, "We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea with this". "But," she continued, "it works". On average, 85% of Commission cartel cases are founded on information from whistle blowers, the rest stemming from Commission-led investigations.

Kroes reiterated the right of consumers to take redress action in national courts. Any claimant would be able to rely on the public version of the  Commission decision (ie after deletion of confidential business information), but as the  Commission only has to prove the fact of the  cartel and not any real effects on price, a claimant would still have to prove the existence and level of detriment caused.
BACKGROUND

This case is the latest in a larger investigation covering several member states, which has already seen three decisions. In 1999, the  Commission uncovered cartel activity in the Belgian  beer market, ultimately leading to fines in December 2001 for Interbrew, Danone-Alken Maes, Haacht and Martens.
InBev then came to the  Commission with more information, which led to investigations and fines against Brasserie Nationale-Bofferding, Brasserie de Wiltz and Brasserie Battin in Luxembourg in 2001 and against Group Danone and Heineken in France in 2004. Investigations concerning the Italian market and a case involving a market-sharing agreement between Denmark's Carlsberg and Heineken were not proceeded with.

HD        EU slaps hefty fines on three brewers ILLEGAL CARTELS. BY        By TOBIAS BUCK

Neelie Kroes yesterday warned companies engaged in illegal  cartel activity to "blow the whistle before someone else blows the whistle on you", after the EU competition commissioner imposed her latest penalties on a price-fixing agreement.

The EU's top antitrust regulators ordered three brewers - Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria - to pay fines totalling  Euros 273.8m (Dollars 371.56m) for rigging the  Dutch beer market between 1996 and 1999. Heineken received the highest fine -  Euros 219.3m - followed by Grolsch with  Euros 31.7m and Bavaria with Euros 22.9m.

TD
All three groups said they would appeal against the  Commission's ruling.

InBev, the Belgian brewer, was the fourth member of the  cartel, but it escaped punishment because it turned in its co-conspirators, triggering the  Commission probe. In a stark illustration of the advantages of the Commission's leniency programme for whistleblowers, the regulator said InBev would otherwise have faced a fine of  Euros 84.4m.

Ms Kroes said: "It is unacceptable that the major  beer suppliers colluded to hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves. The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks."

The Commission said it had evidence that "in all four brewery groups high-ranking management (such as board members, the managing director and national sales managers) participated in the  cartel meetings and discussions". To cover their tracks, managers used "a panoply of code names and abbreviations to refer to their unofficial meetings" and held its gatherings in hotels and restaurants.

The Commission had previously broken up beer cartels in France, Belgium and Luxembourg. It also raided brewers in Italy, though that inquiry was later closed without charges being filed.
Yesterday's fines mean the  Commission has this year imposed cartel penalties totalling more than
Euros 2bn, already exceeding last year's record total of  Euros 1.85bn.

European Union regulators fined Heineken NV, Bavaria NV and Grolsch NV €274-million
($372-million U.S.) after finding evidence the brewers used codenames and held secret meetings to
fix beer prices in the Netherlands.

Heineken received the biggest penalty of €219-million. The  European Commission, the 27-nation EU's regulator in Brussels, fined Grolsch €31.7-million and Bavaria €22.9-million. InBev NV, the world's largest brewer, avoided a fine by tipping off EU inspectors who raided brewers in France, Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands.

TD
European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told journalists today she was “disappointed” top managers at the companies attended price-setting meetings. “The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks,” she said in a statement.

Kroes has stepped up the war against  price fixing,  levying €1.84-billion in fines in 2006. With today's decision, the EU has already broken last year's record by imposing more than €2-billion in fines, including €479.7-million against ThyssenKrupp AG, the biggest  cartel fine against a company.
Heineken, Bavaria and Grolsch said they plan to appeal.

Heineken received the EU's seventh-largest fine against an individual  cartel member. The commission said it based the amount on the company's size, the seriousness of the offence and its refusal to co-operate with regulators. Heineken called the penalty “excessive and unjustified.”

Koninklijke Horeca Nederland, the  Dutch lobby group for bars, hotels and restaurants, wants the brewers to cut prices immediately because the decision shows that businesses paid too much, the group said in a statement today. It plans to ask the brewers for compensation.

The EU made unannounced visits at companies for the  Dutch cartel in March 2000. The commission said today that these “inspections” had uncovered handwritten notes from unofficial meetings and proof of when and where these meetings took place, confirming the information provided by InBev. The  cartel took place between at least 1996 and 1999, the  commission said.

Meetings, code-named “agenda, Catherijne or sliding scale,” were held in hotels and restaurants, the commission said. The four brewers co-ordinated prices for  beer sold in cafes and restaurants, as well as through supermarkets. Together, the companies had 92 per cent of the  Dutch beer market, Jonathan Todd, a  commission spokesman, told journalists.

Grolsch is “stunned” by the ruling and plans to take further legal action, the Enschede, Netherlands-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.

Grolsch (Amsterdam) shares fell as much as 80  euro cents after the announcement and closed at
€31.20. Bavaria shares declined 52  euro cents to €56.37. Heineken shares rose 4  euro cents to
€38.70.

The case was part of a wider investigation of  Europe's beer markets, which started with raids in
January, 2000, in countries including France, Italy, and Portugal.

HD             Brewers fined €273.8m by the EU for price fixing. BY              Jamie Smyth, in Brussels

Three Dutch brewers have been fined €273.8 million by the EU for  price fixing.

Heineken, Grolsch, and Bavaria, which produce three of the most popular  Dutch beers, all face stiff penalties following an investigation by the  European Commission.

TD
A fourth  Dutch company, InBev, was also found to have taken part in the  cartel but will face no penalty because it provided key information to help the investigation.

In a decision published yesterday, the  commission said the brewers held numerous official meetings, during which they co-ordinated prices and price increases of  beer between 1996 and
1999. Price fixing  took place in the off-licence sector and the on-trade segment of the market, which relates to beer sold in pubs, hotels and restaurants.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said it was unacceptable that major  beer firms had colluded to increase prices and carve up the market between themselves. "The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks," she added.
Heineken said it would appeal against its €219 million fine, calling it "excessive".

A Heineken spokeswoman also said that the investigation had nothing to do with the brewer's extensive Irish operations, which are based in Cork.

The commission also levied fines worth €31.7 million for Grolsch and €22.9 million for Bavaria, the lower fines reflecting the fact they sell less  beer than Heineken.

The huge penalty imposed by the  commission in the cartel case reflects its increasingly tough stance in antitrust cases. This year already it has fined companies more than €2 billion. This cash will go into the EU budget to help reduce member states' contributions to the running of the union.

The commission has also undertaken surprise inspections of brewers in several other EU states including France, Luxembourg, Italy and Belgium.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: With decision to fine members of Dutch beer cartel, 2007 is already a record year for anti-cartel fines

Brussels, 18/04/2007 (Agence  Europe) - Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told press on Wednesday that those involved in restrictive trade practices on the  Dutch beer market had been fined a total of €273 million. This decision means the total amount imposed in fines for anti-competitive conduct in
2007 is already over €2 billion, compared with €1.8 for the whole of 2006.

TD
The Commission investigation and surprise inspections carried out in 2000 in several member states has led, in the case of the  Dutch market, to fines being imposed on four brewers: - €219 million on Heineken (Netherlands), €32 million on Grolsch (Netherlands) and €23 million on Bavaria (Netherlands). The fourth, InBev - InBev NV (Belgium) & InBev Nederland BV (Netherlands) - was also found guilty and fined €84 million, but saw this amount reduced by 100% because it provided decisive information about the  cartel under the Commission's leniency programme. In other words, InBev was fined, but will not have to pay anything.

The evidence uncovered during inspections, in particular handwritten notes taken at unofficial meetings and proof of the dates and places of these meetings, showed that the four companies ran an illegal  cartel in the Netherlands at least from 1996 to 1999, fully confirming the corporate statements provided by
InBev. At meetings called “agenda meeting”, “Catherijne meeting” or “sliding scale meeting”, the four brewers coordinated prices and price increases of  beer in the Netherlands, both in the on-trade segment of the market - where consumption is on the premises (known in  Dutch as “horeca”, an acromym for
“hotels, restaurants and cafés”) - and the off trade market segment - consumption off the premises (mainly sold through supermarkets), including private label  beer.

Replying in her native  Dutch to the questions of journalists from the Netherlands, Ms Kroes said that the high level of these fines was not simply due to the large turnovers of the companies involved, but also to their market position, with Heineken, for example, holding a more than 50% market share. Ms Kroes refused to speculate on the outcomes of the ongoing  Commission investigations in Belgium, Luxemburg, France and Italy, but said that she expected the number of decisions by DG Competition to continue to increase, thanks in part to the creation of the dedicated  cartel-busting directorate.

Ms Kroes also said she was “very disappointed” to learn that management at the very highest levels of these four companies had taken part in this  cartel activity, despite knowing that this behaviour was illegal. Questioned directly on this issue by press, she did not express the desire to see those responsible face criminal sanctions. She, nonetheless, let it be understood that  Dutch consumers who felt they had been adversely affected by the actions of the  cartel might consider organising themselves and initiating legal proceedings at national level. Average annual per capita  beer consumption in the Netherlands, she pointed out, was of the order of 80 litres, after all. According to a  Commission press release, such proceedings could use the  Commission decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal, and damages may be awarded by a national court without these being reduced on account of the Commission fine.

European Union regulators fined Heineken NV, Grolsch NV and Bavaria NV nearly 275 million
euros ($370 million US) Wednesday for fixing  Dutch beer prices.
The fines, including a 219.3 million penalty to be paid by Heineken, pushes the total levied by the
European Commission against cartels in 2007 to two billion  euros ($2.7 billion).

TD
The EU ordered Grolsch NV to pay 31.7 million  euros and Bavaria NV 22.9 million euros for a cartel regulators said they ran from at least 1996 to 1999 to co-ordinate Dutch beer price increases.

HD         Dutch Heineken To Appeal Against  EU Price Fixing Fine

Dutch brewer Heineken NV intends to appeal against the fine of 219.3 mln  euro ($298.1 mln) imposed by the European Commission (EC) for violating  European Union (EU) competition laws and taking part in illegal price fixing  practices, the company said on April 18, 2007.

The fine will be booked as an extraordinary item and will have no impact on the company's profit outlook for 2007, Heineken added.

TD
Heineken said, it was surprised by the EC decision, which it found "excessive and unjustified", given the strong arguments it had put forward to the commission. The company disagrees with the suggestion made by the EC that prices on the Dutch beer market were increased via coordinated moves.

Heineken demonstrated to the EC that consumer prices in the food market actually decreased during the period in question. In the horeca market, the company's price increases were in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In addition, Heineken also argued that in the Netherlands, it has absolutely no involvement in the private label segment of the market, one of the areas that was investigated by the EC.
Once the full version of the decision of the EC is available, Heineken (  www.heinekeninternational.com )
has two months and ten days to file an appeal.
The forbidden  beer cartel included also Dutch brewers Royal Grolsch and Bavaria and Belgo-Brazilian
InBev.InBev, although involved in the illegal activity, received no fines as it provided decisive
information on the forbidden  cartel. The total fine amounted to 273.78 mln  euro ($372.1 mln).

At the same time the brewer confirmed its expectation for a net profit growth of between 10 pct and 13 pct in 2007.

Dutch brewer Heineken NV's CEO Jean-Francois van Boxmeer denied the company's participation in a beer cartel during the late 1990s.

Heineken maintains that a  cartel is out of the question. The  Dutch market is one of the most competitive in the world, Boxmeer said on April 19, 2007.

TD
The European Commission (EC) imposed yesterday a fine of a total 273.8 mln euro ($372.2 mln) on three Dutch brewers -- Heineken, Royal Grolsch and Bavaria -- for violating European Union (EU) competition laws.
Heineken, with a domestic market share of more than 50 pct, will have to pay a hefty 219.3 mln  euro
($298.1 mln).

The EC said the companies held numerous unofficial meetings between 1996 and 1999, during which they fixed prices and price hikes in the  Dutch beer market.

Heineken said it was surprised by the EC decision, which it found "excessive and unjustified", given the strong arguments it had put forward in its defence. The company intends to appeal against the fine.

The fine will be, however, booked as an extraordinary item this year, but it will have no impact on the company's profit outlook for 2007, Heineken (  www.heinekeninternational.com ) added.
The brewer confirmed it expected organic net profit growth at a rate of between 10 pct and 13 pct in
2007.

Economics

* Headline average earnings growth rose by 4.6 per cent in the year to February, the fastest pace since March 2004, although the effect was driven entirely by bonus payments. Excluding bonuses, pay rose by 3.6 per cent -unchanged from January, the Office for National Statistics said.

TD
* The unemployment rate was 5.5 per cent in the three months to February, up from 5.4 per cent in the previous three months, according to the Labour Force Survey measure. The alternative claimant count gauge of joblessness was unchanged at 2.9 per cent in March. Employment fell by 47,000 over the three months to February and the number of people classed as economically inactive rose.

* Interest rates The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep interest rates on hold in April by seven votes to two, with Andrew Sentance and Tim Besley, the panel's hawks, calling for a quarter-point rise, minutes revealed.

* German economic growth Germany's leading economic research institutes sharply upgraded their forecasts for economic growth this year and next year to 2.4 per cent. In their report last autumn they had forecast growth of 1.4 per cent for 2007.

* The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, sparked protests from congressmen after he said that it would require "draconian" measures to narrow the gap between the taxes Americans owe and what they pay. The Internal Revenue Service, part of the Treasury Department, estimated that in the 2001 tax year, the gross tax gap was $345 billion, mostly because people had under-reported their income. Mr Paulson suggested that a lot of it will never be collected.

* The dollar hit a 26-year low against sterling and traded near a record low against the  euro as expectations for US interest rate cuts contrasted with prospects for monetary tightening in Britain, the eurozone and Asia. The pound, which rose above $2 on Tuesday for the first time since 1992, climbed as high as $2.0133, its strongest level since June 1981. Page 57

Heineken and two other Dutch brewers were fined almost  Euro 274 million (Pounds 180 million) by the European Commission for operating an illegal  cartel in the Netherlands in the late 1990s. InBev, the world's largest beer producer, which had also participated in the market-fixing practices, faced a
penalty of just over Euro 84 million, but it escaped any financial sanctions under the  Commission's leniency programme. (Rory Watson)

HD        Dutch Beer-Makers Fined by EU for Operating  Cartel

The European Commission has handed down a heavy 273.8-million-euro (US$372.2-million) fine to three key brewers over price-fixing between "at least 1996 and 1999". Top management apparently used code names to arrange secret meetings at hotels and restaurants. The executives used the meetings to co-ordinate their pricing of  beer, the Commission ruled. Heineken has been hit with a fine
of almost 220 million  euro, Grolsch with a fine of 31.5 million euro, and Bavaria with a fine of 22.8 million euro. The fines were reduced on account of the long delay since the inspections took place. Danone was meanwhile fined 42 million euro in February for its role in similar Belgian  beer price-fixing. InBev had also been a member of that cartel, but was excused fines after helping the inquiry.

TD
Heineken has said that it will appeal against the latest decision, and argues that the fine is "excessive and unjustified".Significance: This key ruling shows that the  European Union (EU) has not lost its teeth when it comes to competition matters, although it remains to be seen how the appeals turn out. The past three months have seen a series of major competition rulings and heavy fines, most notably against elevator and escalator manufacturers, and firms producing heavy equipment used by power utilities.

ADVERTISING/MARKETING: Wal-Mart launches 'green' campaign
Wal-Mart launched a national ad campaign Wednesday touting environmentally friendly products like
light bulbs and organic cotton pajamas, part of what analysts call a move by major retailers to test exactly
how much demand there is from "green" consumers. Wal-Mart's 30-second television ads feature a
woman urging Wal-Mart shoppers to help the environment by buying low-energy light bulbs, organic
cotton clothes or concentrated laundry detergent, which reduces packaging. Matching print ads will
appear in Friday and Sunday editions of USA Today and The New York Times and in national Sunday
supplements, said Linda Blakely, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer. She declined to
say how much the campaign cost.

FOOD / BEVERAGES: EU brewers fined for  price-fixing
Brussels, Belgium ---  European Union regulators fined Heineken NV, Grolsch NV and Bavaria NV nearly
275 million euros ($370 million) on Wednesday for fixing  Dutch beer prices. The fines, including a
219.3-million-euro penalty to be paid by Heineken, pushes the total levied by the European                   
Commission against cartels in 2007 to 2 billion  euros ($2.7 billion), already surpassing last year's
record total. The EU ordered Grolsch to pay 31.7 million  euros and Bavaria 22.9 million  euros for a
cartel regulators said they ran from at least 1996 to 1999 to coordinate Dutch beer price increases.
Brewer InBev SA was exempted from a potential fine of 84 million euros ($114 million) because it blew
the whistle on several  European beer cartels, providing "decisive information" after regulators caught it
price-fixing in Belgium.
HEALTH CARE: Sales increase 16% at Roche Holding

Basel, Switzerland --- Pharmaceutical maker Roche Holding AG said Wednesday that first-quarter sales grew 16 percent, led by strong sales of cancer medicines and the influenza treatment Tamiflu. Sales rose to 11.4 billion Swiss francs ($9.42 billion) in the quarter ended March 31, from 9.83 billion francs a year earlier and above the 11.1 billion francs ($9.16 billion) expected by analysts polled by Dow Jones News Service.
HealthSouth forms hospital partnership

Birmingham --- HealthSouth Corp. has formed a partnership with a Tennessee company to operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Tennessee and Virginia. HealthSouth and Kingsport, Tenn.-based Wellmont Health System announced Tuesday that the partnership will run the existing 50-bed HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Kingsport, Tenn., and will seek regulatory approval to build a
25-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Bristol, Va. HealthSouth operates 93 rehabilitation hospitals, including the one in Kingsport, and will add one under the partnership; Wellmont will add two to the nine it currently runs. HealthSouth, which also operates 81 rehabilitation satellite centers and 10 long-term
acute care hospitals, has sold off major segments, including its walk-in therapy clinics, during an attempt by new management to stabilize its financial future after a $2.7 billion accounting fraud.
MANUFACTURING : Owens Corning CEO to retire

Toledo, Ohio --- The chief executive at Owens Corning, who led the building and industrial materials supplier out of bankruptcy, will retire this year, the company said Wednesday. Dave Brown, who has been chief executive since 2002, will be replaced by Mike Thaman, board chairman and chief financial officer of the company known for its Pink Panther mascot and pink insulation. Thaman, 43, has been Owens Corning's CFO since 2000. He became chairman in 2002. Owens Corning emerged from bankruptcy protection in October, six years after it sought protection from the rising costs of asbestos lawsuits.
Ford to unload three glass plants

Detroit --- Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it reached a preliminary agreement to sell three glass plants as the automaker looks to shed its unprofitable Automotive Components Holdings group. Ford said it reached a memorandum of understanding with Glass Products for plants in Nashville, Tulsa, Okla., and its Vidriocar unit in Juarez, Mexico.
REAL ESTATE: Pulte expects loss in quarter

Pulte Homes Inc., one of the nation's biggest home builders, said Wednesday it expects a first-quarter loss, as new orders for homes declined amid a sagging home market. The company reported a preliminary loss from continuing operations between 34 cents and 38 cents per share, including impairments and land-related charges of about 32 cents to 34 cents per share.
TECHNOLOGY: AT&T gains ground with video service

AT&T on Wednesday said it now has 18,000 subscribers for its U-verse video services. AT&T, which started offering U-verse last year to compete with cable operators, disclosed in March that it had 10,000 customers. The company said its average installation rate has jumped to about 2,000 per week, five times its average rate in January.
TRADE: EU on lookout for trade barriers

The European Union said Wednesday it would set up an early warning system to watch for foreign trade barriers that prevent  European companies from exporting to growing markets. EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said barriers in China alone cost European businesses 20 billion euros ($27.1 billion)
a year in lost opportunities. The European Commission said it would ask EU delegations and national embassies throughout the world to work with businesses to identify unfair obstacles to their trade in other countries such as rules that effectively shut out foreigners. The  Commission cited Mexican legislation on diesel car emissions that did not recognize EU standards and Ukraine's high fees for imported pharmaceuticals.
TRANSPORTATION: American's parent swings to profit

Fort Worth, Texas --- The parent of American Airlines said Wednesday it earned a profit in the first quarter, reversing the loss of a year ago, as the nation's largest carrier overcame stubbornly high fuel prices and winter storms that scrambled flight schedules. AMR Corp. said it earned $81 million, or 30 cents per share, in the first three months of the year, compared to a loss of $92 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.
UTILITIES / ENERGY: Dow Chemical to invest in Libya

Dow Chemical Co. and Libya's state-owned National Oil Corp. announced Wednesday they have entered into a joint venture agreement to operate and expand a petrochemical complex in the North Africa nation. Dow is the first global chemical company to take part in the economic development of the petrochemical industry there since Libya recently embarked on a policy of attracting foreign expertise and investment to help diversify its domestic economy.

HD         Fines for collusion are soaring  in Europe --- Regulators attempt to keep up with U.S. on enforcing rules

Brussels -- IN 1998,  EUROPEAN Union regulators fined German industrial giant ThyssenKrupp AG 3.6 million euros ($4.9 million) for fixing stainless-steel prices. In February, they penalized the company for its role in an elevator  cartel -- 479.7 million euros.

Cartel fines are soaring in Europe, and companies are rushing to confess and gain immunity from fines. By making collusion costly, European regulators are attempting to bury the continent's long history of cartels and keep up with the rigorous enforcement practiced in the U.S.

TD
Europe's single market is driving this crackdown. Instead of competing in small, national markets, companies now must either improve their products or cut prices -- or collude with their rivals. Regulators are determined to stop them, in part to protect consumers and in part to ensure  European companies are cutting-edge.

"The old European idea is that the only way to do business was through a  cartel. And you still have European countries that regard cartels as no more serious than a traffic violation," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  European                 Commission's cartel team.

The commission's escalating fight against corporate collusion marks a sharp change in focus. Commissioner Mario Monti blocked General Electric Co.'s planned takeover of Honeywell International Inc. in 2001 and several other high-profile deals. Since taking office in November 2004, his successor Neelie Kroes has stopped only one merger.
Instead, she has intensified the commission's fight against cartels.  Price-fixing penalties totaled
390.2 million euros in 2004 and 683 million euros in 2005. Last year, that figure climbed to 1.8 billion
euros, and so far this year, penalties have topped 2 billion  euros.

Fines are due to become even costlier. EU rules long have allowed the  commission to penalize companies up to 10% of their global annual sales, but old guidelines led to much smaller sanctions. Worried that its fines weren't large enough to deter price-fixers, the EU created new rules last September that encourage hefty penalties for rich, multinational companies.

Some of the key changes include an additional penalty for a company that acts as the  cartel's ringleader. For repeat offenders, fines can now be increased 100%, instead of 50%.

"My message to cartels is quite clear -- the EU will not tolerate cartels and if you do take part in cartels you will face very substantial fines," Ms. Kroes said last week after she fined three Dutch brewers a total of 273.7 million  euros for fixing  beer prices. Heineken NV was fined 219 million euros.

As they battle cartels, EU antitrust regulators are fighting a long tradition. Cozy cooperation long characterized European business. Trade guilds established in the Middle Ages encouraged craftsmen to set common prices and divvy up their customers.



Page 102 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Remnants of these practices have persisted. Cartels were legal in the Netherlands until 1996. Germany and Austria until 2000 discouraged price competition by barring retailers from discounting books. Belgian architects until recently set minimum fees for their work.

The U.S., by contrast, pioneered antitrust legislation with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and has spent decades escalating its fight against  price-fixing. It not only fines companies hundreds of millions of dollars, it also jails executives. Sotheby's then-chairman A. Alfred Taubman was imprisoned for a year in 2002 for rigging  commission fees with rival auction house Christies. London-based Christies Chairman Anthony Tennant faces criminal charges in the U.S., but not in the U.K., where anticartel
laws are weaker.

Even more painful, it promotes civil lawsuits that often result in costly judgments or settlements. U.S. antitrust authorities fined Archer Daniels Midland Co. $100 million in 1996 for fixing prices for an animal feed additive and citric acid. In that case, officials also uncovered  price-fixing schemes involving other food additives, fueling a raft of civil lawsuits against the company. Since then, Archer Daniels Midland has paid over $500 million to settle cases brought by customers seeking damages, including PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.

Europe's cartel offensive is gaining praise across the Atlantic. Since many cartels involve multinational companies and global agreements, the U.S. needs strict enforcement in  Europe and Japan for its own price-fixing punishments to be effective.

"In the U.S.,  cartel enforcement isn't so much the fines as it is the damages claims," said Clive Stanbrook an antitrust lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery/Stanbrook in Brussels. "The EU can keep raising fines to fight cartels, but their tools are less sophisticated than those used in the U.S."

Without the ability to jail executives and only limited scope for civil claims, regulators continue to face obstacles. Until recently, when  European regulators raided company offices, they found documents on computers or in file cabinets that described the terms of  price-fixing deals. Some companies now are covering their tracks by avoiding email messages, using untraceable mobile phones and meeting in countries outside the EU, where the commission depends on other regulators to uncover evidence, according to Jonathan Todd, the commission's antitrust spokesman.

Another complication comes from the EU courts in Luxembourg. Companies can appeal their  cartel punishments and most do. Although judges have upheld the bulk of regulator's decisions, they have on several occasions reduced companies' fines. Thursday, judges reduced to 141.8 million  euros a 184.3 million euro fine levied in 2001 against Arjo Wiggins Appleton PLC, now a unit of French paper group Sequana Capital SA.

Despite such pitfalls, officials insist they are achieving results. Increasing numbers of companies are approaching the commission to offer information on illegal  price-fixing schemes in return for immunity from fines. The commission last year received about 30 leniency applications, up from the dozen or so it averaged just a few years ago. Heftier fines are compelling more confessions, Mr. Todd says.

Chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV is one company that claims to have seen the light. It ranks among Europe's worst cartel offenders, receiving five fines between 1994 and 2006. But the  Dutch company this year blew the whistle on a  cartel in four Central  European countries that fixed prices on a chemical used in steel production. Under the EU's leniency rules, Akzo Nobel will avoid fines if its disclosure helps punish the other participants.

Akzo Nobel now requires its new employees to go through a training course where they learn about cartels and how to comply with antitrust rules, company spokeswoman Heleen van de Lustgraaf says. Akzo Nobel Chief Executive Hans Wijers, who took over in 2003, has made antitrust compliance a priority, she says, citing concerns about hefty fines and damage to the company's reputation.

ThyssenKrupp says the February  price-fixing case involving its elevator unit was the act of a few rogue employees who have since left the company, and has prompted a strengthening of its compliance procedures.

"It's not a nice story, but there are now very clear messages repeated from the top down and from the CEO" that  price fixing  will not be tolerated by the company, says Monica Soffritti, a ThyssenKrupp spokeswoman.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In 1998,  European Union regulators fined German industrial giant ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) EUR3.6 million for fixing stainless steel prices. In February, they penalized the company for its role in an elevator  cartel - that penalty was EUR479.7 million.

Cartel fines are soaring in Europe, and companies are rushing to confess and gain immunity from them. By making collusion costly, European regulators are attempting to bury the continent's long history of cartels and keep up with the rigorous enforcement practiced in the U.S.

TD
Europe's single market is driving this crackdown. Instead of competing in small, national markets, companies now must either improve their products or cut prices - or collude with their rivals. Regulators are determined to stop them, in part to protect consumers and in part to insure  European companies' are cutting-edge.

"The old European idea is that the only way to do business was through a  cartel. And you still have European countries that regard cartels as no more serious than a traffic violation," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team.

The commission's escalating fight against corporate collusion marks a sharp change in focus. Commissioner Mario Monti blocked General Electric Co's (GE) planned takeover of Honeywell International Inc. (HON) in 2001 and several other high-profile deals. Since taking office in November
2004, his successor Neelie Kroes has stopped only one merger.

Instead, she has intensified the  commission's fight against cartels.  Price-fixing penalties totaled EUR390.2 million in 2004 and EUR683 million in 2005. Last year, that figure climbed to EUR1.8 billion, and so far this year, penalties have topped EUR2 billion.

Fines are due to become even costlier. E.U. rules long have allowed the  commission to penalize companies up to 10% of their global annual sales, but old guidelines led to much smaller sanctions. Worried that its fines weren't large enough to deter price-fixers, the E.U. created new rules last September that encourage hefty penalties for rich, multinational companies.

Some of the key changes include an additional penalty for a company that acts as the  cartel's ringleader. For repeat offenders, fines can now be increased 100% instead of 50%.

"My message to cartels is quite clear - the E.U. will not tolerate cartels and if you do take part in cartels you will face very substantial fines," Kroes said last week after she fined three  Dutch brewers a total of EUR273.7 million for fixing  beer prices. Heineken Holding NV (00897.AE) was fined EUR219 million.

As they battle cartels, E.U. antitrust regulators are fighting a long tradition. Cozy cooperation long characterized European business. Trade guilds established in the Middle Ages encouraged craftsmen to set common prices and divvy-up their customers.

Remnants of these practices have persisted. Cartels were legal in the Netherlands until 1996. Germany and Austria until 2000 discouraged price competition by barring retailers from discounting books. Belgian architects until recently set minimum fees for their work.

The U.S., by contrast, pioneered anti-trust legislation with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and has spent decades escalating its fight against  price fixing.  It not only fines companies hundreds of millions of dollars, it also jails executives. Sotheby's (BID) then-chairman A. Alfred Taubman was imprisoned for a year in 2002 for rigging  commission fees with rival auction house Christies. London-based Christies' Chairman Anthony Tennant faces criminal charges in the U.S., but not in the U.K., where anti-cartel laws are weaker.

Even more painful, it promotes civil lawsuits that often result in costly judgments or settlements. U.S. antitrust authorities fined Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) $100 million in 1996 for fixing prices for an animal feed additive and citric acid. In that case, officials also uncovered  price-fixing schemes involving other food additives, fueling a raft of civil lawsuits against the company. Since then, Archer Daniels Midland has paid over $500 million to settle cases brought by customers seeking damages, including PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO)

Europe's cartel offensive is gaining praise across the Atlantic. Since many cartels involve multinational companies and global agreements, the U.S. needs strict enforcement in  Europe and Japan for its own price fixing  punishments to be effective.

"In the U.S.,  cartel enforcement isn't so much the fines as it is the damages claims," said Clive Stanbrook an antitrust lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery/Stanbrook in Brussels. "The E.U. can keep raising fines to fight cartels, but their tools are less sophisticated than those used in the U.S."

Without the ability to jail executives and only limited scope for civil claims, regulators continue to face obstacles. Until recently, when  European regulators raided company offices, they found documents on computers or in file cabinets that described the terms of  price-fixing deals. Some companies now are covering their tracks by avoiding e-mail messages, using untraceable mobile phones and meeting in countries outside the E.U., where the commission depends on other regulators to uncover evidence, according to Jonathan Todd, the commission's antitrust spokesman.

Another complication comes from the E.U. courts in Luxembourg. Companies can appeal their  cartel punishments and most do.

Economics

House prices gathered momentum this month, according to the latest survey from the Nationwide Building Society. It showed average prices rose by 0.9 per cent in April, after a 0.5 per cent March gain. But economists said the underlying trend was weakening, with prices up 2 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous three, against peaks of more than 3 per cent at the turn of the year.

Remnants of these practices have persisted. Cartels were legal in the Netherlands until 1996. Germany and Austria until 2000 discouraged price competition by barring retailers from discounting books. Belgian architects until recently set minimum fees for their work.

The U.S., by contrast, pioneered anti-trust legislation with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and has spent decades escalating its fight against  price fixing.  It not only fines companies hundreds of millions of dollars, it also jails executives. Sotheby's (BID) then-chairman A. Alfred Taubman was imprisoned for a year in 2002 for rigging  commission fees with rival auction house Christies. London-based Christies' Chairman Anthony Tennant faces criminal charges in the U.S., but not in the U.K., where anti-cartel laws are weaker.

Even more painful, it promotes civil lawsuits that often result in costly judgments or settlements. U.S. antitrust authorities fined Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) $100 million in 1996 for fixing prices for an animal feed additive and citric acid. In that case, officials also uncovered  price-fixing schemes involving other food additives, fueling a raft of civil lawsuits against the company. Since then, Archer Daniels Midland has paid over $500 million to settle cases brought by customers seeking damages, including PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO)

Europe's cartel offensive is gaining praise across the Atlantic. Since many cartels involve multinational companies and global agreements, the U.S. needs strict enforcement in  Europe and Japan for its own price fixing  punishments to be effective.

"In the U.S.,  cartel enforcement isn't so much the fines as it is the damages claims," said Clive Stanbrook an antitrust lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery/Stanbrook in Brussels. "The E.U. can keep raising fines to fight cartels, but their tools are less sophisticated than those used in the U.S."

Without the ability to jail executives and only limited scope for civil claims, regulators continue to face obstacles. Until recently, when  European regulators raided company offices, they found documents on computers or in file cabinets that described the terms of  price-fixing deals. Some companies now are covering their tracks by avoiding e-mail messages, using untraceable mobile phones and meeting in countries outside the E.U., where the commission depends on other regulators to uncover evidence, according to Jonathan Todd, the commission's antitrust spokesman.

Another complication comes from the E.U. courts in Luxembourg. Companies can appeal their  cartel punishments and most do. Although judges have upheld the bulk of regulators' decisions, they have on several occasions reduced companies' fines. Thursday, judges reduced to EUR141.8 million a EUR184.3 million fine levied in 2001 against Arjo Wiggins Appleton PLC, now a unit of French paper group Sequana Capital SA. (VOR.FR)

Despite such pitfalls, officials insist they are achieving results. Increasing numbers of companies are approaching the commission to offer information on illegal  price-fixing schemes in return for immunity from fines. The commission last year received about 30 leniency applications, up from the dozen or so it averaged just a few years ago. Heftier fines are compelling more confessions, Todd says.

Chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) is one company that claims to have seen the light. It ranks among Europe's worst cartel offenders, receiving five fines between 1994 and 2006. But the  Dutch company this year blew the whistle on a  cartel in four Central  European countries that fixed prices on a chemical used in steel production. Under the E.U.'s leniency rules, Akzo Nobel will avoid fines if its disclosure helps punish the other participants.

Akzo now requires its new employees to go through a training course where they learn about cartels and how to comply with antitrust rules, company spokeswoman Heleen van de Lustgraaf says. Nobel's Chief Executive Hans Wijers, who took over in 2003, has made anti-trust compliance a priority, she says,
noting concerns about hefty fines and damage to the company's reputation.

ThyssenKrupp says the February  price fixing  case involving its elevator unit was the act of a few rogue employees who have since left the company, and has prompted a strengthening of its compliance procedures.

"It's not a nice story, but there are now very clear messages repeated from the top down and from the CEO" that  price fixing  will not be tolerated by the company, says Monica Soffritti, a ThyssenKrupp spokeswoman.

HD     CARTELS : BEER BUST LEADS TO 273 MILLION EURO IN FINES WC     478 words

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes announced on 18 April that three  Dutch brewers - Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria - have been fined a total of €273.783 million for taking part in a cartel to fix the price of their beers. The fourth  cartel member, InBev, was granted 100% immunity under the European Commission's leniency programme and received no fine. From 1996 to 1999, the companies, which jointly held a huge 92% of the Dutch beer market, got together to fix prices and price increases for their products. This included both beer sold to hotels, pubs and cafés and the off-sales market - primarily supermarkets, including private label  beer sold under supermarkets' own brands. The companies jointly set rebate levels granted to pubs and bars and shared out customers amongst themselves.

TD
It was InBev which blew the whistle and gave up details of the  cartel to the Commission. Secret meetings took place in different hotels and restaurants attended by high-ranking management' - CEOs or board members, who attempted to cover their tracks by using code names. The other companies did not cooperate with the  Commission investigation and received no reductions, bar a mere €100,000 each in recognition of the long duration of the investigation. Heineken, as the biggest company with the largest market share, received the largest fine of €219,275,000. Grolsch and Bavaria, being smaller market players, were fined €31.65 and €22.85 million, respectively.

Commenting on the justifiability of the leniency system, which led to a zero fine for InBev despite its undisputed involvement, Kroes said, "We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea with this". "But," she continued, "it works". On average, 85% of Commission cartel cases are founded on information from whistle blowers, the rest stemming from Commission-led investigations.

Kroes reiterated the right of consumers to take redress action in national courts. Any claimant would be able to rely on the public version of the  Commission decision, but as the  Commission only has to prove the fact of the  cartel and not any real effects on price, a claimant would still have to prove the existence and level ofdetriment caused.
BACKGROUND

This case is the latest in a larger investigation covering several member states, which has already seen three decisions. In 1999, the  Commission uncovered cartel activity in the Belgian  beer market, leading to fines in December 2001 for Interbrew, Danone-Alken Maes, Haacht and Martens. InBev then came to the Commission with more information, which led to investigations and fines against Brasserie Nationale-Bofferding, Brasserie de Wiltz and Brasserie Battin in Luxembourg in 2001 and against Group Danone and Heineken in France in 2004. Investigations concerning the Italian market and a case
involving a market-sharing agreement between Denmark's Carlsberg and Heineken were not proceeded with.

The Prüm Treaty (signed outside the framework of the EU by Austria, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 2005) provides for cross-border cooperation in the fight against terrorism, crime and illegal migration throught the exchange of police information on DNA data, fingerprints, vehicle registration and personal data. Since 2005, eight additional Member States have formally declared their intention to join. MEPs will discuss the possibility of transposing certain measures of the Prüm Treaty into EU legislation, making it binding for all member states. This initiative, hardly expected few months ago, could become soon a reality since the German Presidency made it a priority for this semester.

+ ECORICE PROJECT - "Making it real: Innovative and sustainable solutions for local problems in rural areas"

For years, the farmers of La Albufera in Valencia have been burning rice straw wastes. In order to abate the noxious smoke produced by this incineration process, the City Council of Valencia (Municipal Service for the Protection of the Natural Park of La Albufera) launched in December 2004 the Eco-Rice LIFE Project "Sustainable management of rice straw". Eco-Rice provides an alternative solution to this common practice by re-using the rice straw to fabricate organic fibre blankets that can be used subsequently on dry or eroding land, making this activity more profitable and water-saving friendly.

Organiser: Fundacion Comunidad Valenciana - Region  Europea (FCVRE), dissemination partner of the project.

This roundtable will allow  European Regional and local authorities' representatives:
To make Regional and local authorities legitimate actors in the context of the evaluations of the directive

The Mission: discover, investigate, invent
Short description

It is at once a participatory exhibition, an interactive science centre, and a historical-cultural panorama. In an area of 6000 square metres inside the Blower House of the former Völklingen ironworks, the exhibition will offer a wide-angle view of the subject of innovation. Grouped into ten categories, it presents the high points of inventions which have marked human history, portrays the lives of great inventors whose discoveries have changed the world, and shows how those inventions have affected our daily lives. Through the lives of three families, one around 1500, the second around 1850, and the third in the present day, the project traces the major innovations of our history and analyses the level of civilisation in each of these
