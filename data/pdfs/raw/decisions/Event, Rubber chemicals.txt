(Adds analyst comment, share recovery, comment on tax)

FRANKFURT, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Germany's  Bayer will create a provision of 275 million euros ($323 million) in the current quarter to settle a number of U.S. civil antitrust actions, the company said on Tuesday, sending its shares down.

TD
The drugs and chemicals group also said it expected to incur further costs as the result of remaining governmental proceedings and civil actions.

"As the financial risk associated with the remaining actions is currently not quantifiable, it was not possible to take accounting measures with respect to these litigations as a whole," it said.

The legal battle is the latest to hit the German company and comes after it paid more than $1 billion in settlements over its recalled cholesterol drug Baycol.

Its shares fell as much as 1.9 percent but recovered after a spokesman said a large part of the provision was tax deductible. At 1039 GMT,  Bayer was down 0.2 percent at 34.62 euros, still underperforming a
0.6-percent rise in the DAX index <.GDAXI>.
"Investors are clearly worried that this matter is not completely settled," said a London-based analyst. "Price-fixing is not uncommon in the chemical industry, but people may be drawing parallels with the
much bigger vitamins settlements," he said, referring to billions of dollars in  fines on Aventis, Roche and
BASF in a  cartel case.
Sal. Oppenheim analyst Ludger Mues said in a note the provision was unexpectedly high. "We had expected ... 100-150 million euros to solve these cases," he said.

Bayer said it had agreed in principle to settle some of the actions claiming damages, which relate to its polymers unit. Some of these agreements, once finalised, are subject to court approval.
"The company deeply regrets the violations of law,"  Bayer said.

Bayer had earlier reached agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay  fines of $66 million for antitrust violations related to rubber chemicals, and established provisions of 50 million euros in
2003 relating to a EU Commission investigation.
SPIN-OFF ALSO HIT

Separately, chemical maker Lanxess , which was spun off from  Bayer in January, said it was making a provision of 61 million euros in the current quarter due to the proceedings against  Bayer, sending its stock down 1.3 percent.

Lanxess, which contains part of  Bayer's erstwhile polymer business, said it had agreed to reimburse Bayer for 30 percent of liabilities from the legal process subject to a ceiling of 100 million euros plus legal costs and tax impacts.
Lanxess said that with this provision, it had reached the maximum liability it had agreed with  Bayer.

It has also been agreed that Lanxess will pay this sum in instalments of no more than 50 million euros a year, but the timing has yet to be determined.

Both Bayer and Lanxess have provided annual earnings forecasts for 2005 excluding special items, so the provisions do not affect these forecasts.

Sal. Oppenheim's Mues said he expected a  Bayer research and development day on Thursday to focus attention back on the operating performance.
"This negative news should have only a short-term impact on the share," he said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission will decide Wednesday whether to  fine German chemicals company  Bayer AG (BAY) and other companies over allegations of fixing prices of rubber chemicals, a person close to the case said Monday. [ 19-12-05 1058GMT ]

The European Union competition authority has been investigating allegations of price-fixing in the rubber sector for some time. In June, the watchdog sent a letter outlining price-fixing concerns to a number of rubber producers, asking them to explain their positions.

TD
Wednesday's decision will concern other companies besides  Bayer, the person said without naming them.

A spokesman for European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes later confirmed a decision on fining a cartel would be taken Wednesday. But spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to say which companies would be involved. [ 19-12-05 1115GMT ]

Bayer has set aside a EUR50 million fund in case Brussels decides to impose a  fine, according to the company's third-quarter earnings report.
A spokesman for  Bayer said the company has no knowledge of when Brussels make a decision. "Proceedings remain pending before the E.U.  Commission and the U.S. and Canadian antitrust
authorities in connection with anticompetitive conduct involving certain products in the  rubber field,"
said Bayer spokesman Christian Hartel.
The U.S. Justice Department last year fined Bayer $4.7 million for price-fixing. [ 19-12-05 1120GMT ] At 1125 GMT  Bayer shares were down EUR0.09 at EUR34.40. An analyst in Frankfurt said a possible
fine would be a minor one-off item for  Bayer. "The  fine may reduce cash-inflow a little bit, but  Bayer's
performance this year and in 2006 will be much better than expected," he said.

BRUSSELLS -- European Union regulators plan to  fine Bayer AG and Chemtura Corp. next week for fixing the price of  rubber chemicals, people familiar with the investigation say.

The regulator's decision, which follows probes in the United States and Europe, will be announced Wednesday, according to an EU document obtained by Bloomberg News. The EU investigation was prompted by information from Flexsys NV, a joint venture between Solutia Inc. and Akzo Nobel NV, said the people, who declined to be identified.

TD
Bayer set aside $50-million (U.S.) in provisions in 2003 for risks related to the EU investigation. The company last year agreed with U.S. authorities to pay $4.7-million for antitrust violations related to rubber chemicals, which are used to make plastic furniture, hoses, tires, belts and footwear.
“The question is how big the  fine is,” Peter Braendle, who helps manage $42-billion at Swissca
Portfolio Management in Zurich and owns  Bayer shares, said in an interview.

The European  Commission, the EU's antitrust enforcer in Brussels, can  fine companies accused of violating competition rules as much as 10 per cent of their annual sales. It typically opts for 2 to 3 per cent of sales. The largest EU  cartel fine was €462-million ($645-million Canadian) levied against Roche Holding AG in 2001 for fixing the price of vitamins.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined three chemical companies 75.86 million (US$91.2 million) for running a  cartel to swap information and control the price of  rubber chemicals used to make car tires -- and urged anyone hurt by the behavior to file a damage claim.

Bayer AG was fined 58.88 million (US$70.7 million),  Crompton Europe Ltd. was ordered to pay
13.60 million (US$16.3 million) and  Repsol SA's subsidiary General Quimica SA was  fined 3.38
million (US$4.1 million).

TD
U.S. regulators  fined Bayer and Crompton for a similar cartel last year.
Flexsys NV -- a Belgian joint venture between Dutch chemical company Akzo Nobel NV and U.S.-based
Solutia -- escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel in April 2002.

"Cartels are a scourge," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run."

The European  Commission said any person or business affected by the  cartel's behavior could take the case to their national courts and seek damages, using evidence from the EU decision.

It said Flexsys,  Bayer and Crompton -- now known as Chemtura -- broke EU antitrust rules by secretly agreeing to control both the European and global markets for  rubber chemicals from at least 1996 to
2001. General Quimica was involved in 1999 and 2000.

However, regulators said they believed collusion may have been taking place "at least occasionally" as far back as the 1970s.

"The Commission only has sufficiently firm and convincing evidence of the existence of the  cartel for the period covering the years 1996 to 2001," it said.

It quoted an unidentified company employee who called a 1998 price increase "the most orchestrated and collusive 'agreement' he ever made."

He said there was contact between rivals from at least the mid-1990s before, during and after every price increase for rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice fined Bayer US$66 million (53.2 million) and  Crompton
US$50 million for fixing the price of rubber chemicals on the U.S. market.
In 2001, the European  rubber market was worth about 200 million and the global market was valued at
1.5 billion, the EU said.

EU regulators raided  Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica in September 2002. All three
agreed to cooperate, a move which saw the  Commission cut Crompton's fine by 50 percent,  Bayer's by
20 percent and General Quimica's by 10 percent.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined three chemical companies 75.86 million euros ($91.2 million) for running a  cartel to swap information and control the price of  rubber chemicals used to make car tires.

Bayer AG was fined 58.88 million euros ($70.7 million),  Crompton Europe Ltd. was ordered to pay 13.60 million euros ($16.3 million) and  Repsol SA's subsidiary General Quimica SA was  fined 3.38 million
euros ($4.1 million).

TD
Flexsys NV escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel in April 2002.

"Cartels are a scourge," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run."

The European  Commission said Flexsys,  Bayer and Crompton -- now known as Chemtura -- broke EU antitrust rules by secretly agreeing to control both the European and global markets for  rubber chemicals from at least 1996 to 2001. It said General Quimica was involved in 1999 and 2000.

However, regulators said they believed collusion may have been taking place "at least occasionally" as far back as the 1970s.

"The Commission only has sufficiently firm and convincing evidence of the existence of the  cartel for the period covering the years 1996 to 2001," it said.

It quoted an unidentified company employee who called a 1998 price increase "the most orchestrated and collusive 'agreement' he ever made."

He said there was contact between rivals from at least the mid-1990s before, during and after every price increase for rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact.

In 2001, the European  rubber market was worth about 200 million euros and the global market was valued at 1.5 billion euros, the EU said.
EU regulators raided  Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica in September 2002. All three
agreed to cooperate, a move which saw the  Commission cut Crompton's fine by 50 percent,  Bayer's by
20 percent and General Quimica's by 10 percent.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday said Wednesday it would
fine four rubber companies EUR75.86 million for price-fixing between 1996 and 2001. [

Bayer AG (BAY) got the biggest  fine, at EUR58.88 million.

TD
Crompton Europe was fined EUR13.6 million, and  Repsol YPF SA (REP) unit General Quimica
fined EUR3.38 million.

The Commission imposed an undisclosed fine against Flexsys NV but exempted the company from having to pay because it complied with investigators' demands, the  Commission said. [
12-21-05 0600ET ]

Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton "agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals" on world markets between 1996 and 2001. General Quimica joined the cartel in 1999, the  Commission said.

The Commission gave Flexsys immunity in 2002 in exchange for a promise of information. Later in 2002, Brussels regulators raided the offices of  Bayer, Crompton Europe and General
Quimica.

The European  rubber chemicals market is worth about EUR200 million, compared with a world market of EUR1.5 billion, the  Commission said.

"Cartels are a scourge," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will ensure that cartels will be continue to be tracked down, prosecuted and punished."

The Commission has recently stepped up its monitoring of cartels, fining over 100 companies in the last five years, in sectors ranging from industrial thread to French beer. The biggest  fine ever imposed was against Hoffman-La Roche AG, a drug company, in 2001 for EUR462 million.

HD            Bayer: To Review EU Fine Before Considering Legal Appeal

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German chemical and pharmaceutical company  Bayer AG (BAY) Wednesday said it will review in detail a  price-fixing fine imposed by the E.U. before deciding whether to fight it in court.
Spokesman Christian Hartel said  Bayer won't comment until the company receives details on the E.U.
Commission's decision, which could take some time.

TD
The Commission said Wednesday it will  fine Bayer EUR55.8 million for  price-fixing in rubber
chemicals between 1996 and 2001, together with the three other companies. [ 21-12-05 1209GMT ]
A Frankfurt-based chemicals industry analystearlier in the week said a  fine would have little impact on
Bayer if it isn't much more than the EUR50 million the company set aside in 2003.

He said the greater concern is whether the company must make further provisions for U.S. lawsuits over the same price fixing  issue. The company earlier in December made provisions of EUR275 million for U.S. and Canada lawsuits.

"In the course of the remaining governmental proceedings and civil actions, additional expenses will become necessary that may also be of material importance to the company,"  Bayer said after announcing the new provisions.
The other companies penalized by the E.U. Wednesday are Crompton Europe, which was  fined
EUR13.6 million, and  Repsol YPF SA (REP) unit General Quimica, fined EUR3.38 million.

The E.U.  Commission imposed an undisclosed fine against Flexsys NV but exempted the company from having to pay because it complied with investigators' demands. Flexsys is a joint venture between Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) and U.S. chemicals group Solutia Inc. (SOLUQ).

The EU Commission is to impose a fine on Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, and on other chemicals companies in connection with  cartel agreements relating to certain  rubber products. The  fines, which are to be issued today, will run into tens of millions of euros.

The Commission had commenced investigations into the  cartel in June after searches at the companies concerned in September 2002 indicated that agreements had been signed. The  cartel, which appears to have operated internationally, has already received a  fine in the US.

HD      EC fines 4 firms, including Bayer, Repsol for rubber chem cartel

The European Commission has fined four companies - including Germany's  Bayer and General Quimica, a unit of Spain's Repsol - a total of Eur75.86-mil (around $86.51-mil) for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market, the EC announced Wednesday. The other two companies are Flexsys and Crompton (now Chemtura) (including  Crompton Europe and Uniroyal Chemical Co).

In clear violation of EC Treaty competition rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices (Article 81), the EC said that Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the EEA and world-wide markets at least from 1996 to 2001. General Quimica participated to this agreements in 1999 and 2000, the EC said.

TD
Bayer received the largest portion of the fine - Eur58.88-mil, although the company was granted a 20% reduction in the penalty. Crompton was fined Eur13.60-mil following a 50% reduction, while General Quimica (including Repsol Quimica and Repsol YPF) was fined Eur3.38-mil after a 10% reduction. Flexsys NV, who provided the original information of the cartel and co-operated fully with EC's Competition  Commission, was not fined.

Rubber chemicals are synthetic or organic chemicals that improve the production and the characteristics of rubber products, used in a wide range of application, the most important of which is tires for cars and other vehicles. In 2001, the EEA market value was estimated at about Eur200-mil and the world-wide value at Eur1.5-bil.
THE INVESTIGATION

The investigation into the  rubber chemicals sector began following an application for conditional immunity from fines by Flexsys in April 2002. Subsequently, the  Commission carried out inspections at the premises of Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica in September 2002.  Crompton, Bayer and General Quimica applied for leniency on Oct 8, 2002, Oct 24, 2002 and Jun 7, 2004, respectively, the EC said.
EXPLICIT STATEMENTS

The EC said that the essence of this infringement can be seen in the description made by one of the participants that "there was a contact among competitors from at least the mid 1990's, before, during and after every price increase for  rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact."

The EC also described that an employee of the same company, referring to the 1998 price increase, recalled it "as the most orchestrated and collusive 'agreement' he ever made."

The EC added that while there were a number of indications that collusive activities within the rubber chemicals industry were already taking place at least occasionally in the 1970s, the Commission only had sufficiently firm and convincing evidence of the existence of the  cartel for the period covering the years 1996-2001.

FINES



Page 23 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said that its regarded the  cartel as a "very serious infringement." In fixing the amount of the fines, the Commission took account of the size of the market in the countries affected by the cartel, the length of time the cartel had been operating, the relative weight of the firms involved and their global dimension.

The cooperation offered by Flexsys provided useful information for the exposure of the infringement and was rewarded in accordance with the  Commission's leniency notice. Flexsys was given full immunity, and the other firms had their  fines reduced in return for the information they provided.

"Repsol YPF SA and  Repsol Quimica SA, although they did not participate themselves in the arrangements in question, are nevertheless held responsible for the conduct of their wholly owned subsidiary General Quimica," the EC said.
"CARTELS ARE A SCOURGE"

The level of the  fines confirms the Commission?s determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels. This is the fifth Commission decision in 2005 against hard core cartels.

"Cartels are a scourge," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down, prosecuted and punished, With this latest decision, I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run."
ACTION FOR DAMAGES

Meanwhile, the EC announced that any person or firm affected by anti-competitive  cartel ran by these four companies "may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behavior took place and was illegal." Even though the  Commission has fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the Commission fine, the EC added.

Chemtura fined $16-mil in European antitrust probe

As a part of its  cartel investigation into the  rubber chemicals market, the European  Commission has fined US-based Chemtura Corp Euro13.6-mil ($16 million), according to a statement issued by the company, Wednesday.

TD
The investigation into the  rubber chemicals' sector began following an application for conditional immunity from  fines by another company involved in the EC's probe, Flexsys, in April 2002.

Subsequently, the  Commission carried out inspections at the premises of additional companies under investigation, including Germany's  Bayer and General Quimica in September 2002.

Chemtura's chairman and CEO, Robert Wood, said the company believes the  fine levied by the EC marks the end of coordinated investigations by the US, Canada and the European Union, first publicly announced in the fall of 2002. "We are pleased to see this lengthy and expensive legacy ordeal resolved," Wood said in Wednesday's press release.

Separately, Chemtura also said it has for a combined total of about $50-mil in so-called direct-purchaser antitrust claims from a group representing over half of Chemtura's relevant U.S.  rubber chemicals sales. The settlement also includes other antitrust-related civil matters, Chemtura said. Further details were not immediately available.

Chemtura will take a charge of around $16-mil for the EC  fine, and a charge of $11-mil in the fourth quarter this year, to increase its reserves for antitrust matters.

In 2004, the company had pro forma sales of $3.9-bil. Chemtura is a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals, crop protection and pool, spa and home care products.

In clear violation of EC Treaty competition rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices (Article 81), the EC has said Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the EEA and world-wide markets at least from 1996 to 2001. --Benjamin Morse, benjamin_morse@platts.com

The European Commission has fined four companies -- including Germany's  Bayer and General Quimica, a unit of Spain's Repsol -- a total of Eur75.86-mil (around $86.51-mil) for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market, the EC announced Wednesday. The other two companies are Flexsys and Crompton (now Chemtura) (including  Crompton Europe and Uniroyal Chemical Co).

In clear violation of EC Treaty competition rules, which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices (Article 81), the EC said that Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the EEA and world-wide markets at least from 1996 to 2001. General Quimica participated to this agreements in 1999 and 2000, the EC said.

TD
Bayer received the largest portion of the fine -- Eur58.88-mil, although the company was granted a 20% reduction in the penalty. Crompton was fined Eur13.60-mil following a 50% reduction, while General Quimica (including Repsol Quimica and Repsol YPF) was fined Eur3.38-mil after a 10% reduction. Flexsys NV, who provided the original information of the cartel and co-operated fully with EC's Competition  Commission, was not fined.

Rubber chemicals are synthetic or organic chemicals that improve the production and the characteristics of rubber products, used in a wide range of application, the most important of which is tires for cars and other vehicles. In 2001, the EEA market value was estimated at about Eur200-mil and the world-wide value at Eur1.5-bil.
THE INVESTIGATION

The investigation into the  rubber chemicals sector began following an application for conditional immunity from fines by Flexsys in April 2002. Subsequently, the  Commission carried out inspections at the premises of Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica in September 2002.  Crompton, Bayer and General Quimica applied for leniency on Oct 8, 2002, Oct 24, 2002 and Jun 7, 2004, respectively, the EC said.
EXPLICIT STATEMENTS

The EC said that the essence of this infringement can be seen in the description made by one of the participants that "there was a contact among competitors from at least the mid 1990's, before, during and after every price increase for  rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact."

The EC also described that an employee of the same company, referring to the 1998 price increase, recalled it "as the most orchestrated and collusive 'agreement' he ever made."

The EC added that while there were a number of indications that collusive activities within the rubber chemicals industry were already taking place at least occasionally in the 1970s, the Commission only had sufficiently firm and convincing evidence of the existence of the  cartel for the period covering the years 1996-2001.

FINES



Page 27 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said that its regarded the  cartel as a "very serious infringement." In fixing the amount of the fines, the Commission took account of the size of the market in the countries affected by the cartel, the length of time the cartel had been operating, the relative weight of the firms involved and their global dimension.

The cooperation offered by Flexsys provided useful information for the exposure of the infringement and was rewarded in accordance with the  Commission's leniency notice. Flexsys was given full immunity, and the other firms had their  fines reduced in return for the information they provided.

"Repsol YPF SA and  Repsol Quimica SA, although they did not participate themselves in the arrangements in question, are nevertheless held responsible for the conduct of their wholly owned subsidiary General Quimica," the EC said.
"CARTELS ARE A SCOURGE"

The level of the  fines confirms the Commission?s determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels. This is the fifth Commission decision in 2005 against hard core cartels.

"Cartels are a scourge," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down, prosecuted and punished, With this latest decision, I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run."
ACTION FOR DAMAGES

Meanwhile, the EC announced that any person or firm affected by anti-competitive  cartel ran by these four companies "may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behavior took place and was illegal." Even though the  Commission has fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the Commission fine, the EC added.

BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (AFP) -

The European Commission fined four chemicals makers 75.86 million euros (90.2 million dollars) Wednesday for operating a cartel in Europe's  rubber chemicals market.

TD
The commission, which polices cross-border competition issues in Europe, accused  Bayer, Crompton
-- now called Chemtura -- Flexsys and General Quimica of sharing price information and raising prices for
certain rubber chemicals.

"Cartels are a scourge. I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down, prosecuted and punished," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement.

"With this latest decision, I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run," she added.

Rubber chemicals enhance rubber products and are particularly used in car tyres. The  commission estimated the European market for rubber chemicals was worth 200 million euros in 2001 and 1.5 billion euros world-wide.

BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European
Commission on Wednesday:

ANNOUNCEMENTS There were no announcements. - - - -
EU-CHEMICALS
Spokesman Jonathan Todd said that the Commission had decided to fine four companies for a total of
75.86 million euros for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market, in clear violation of EC Treaty
competition rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices.

Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton (now Chemtura) (including  Crompton Europe and Uniroyal Chemical Company) agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain  rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the EEA and world-wide markets at least from
1996 to 2001.

Rubber chemicals are synthetic or organic chemicals that improve the production and the characteristics of  rubber products, used in a wide range of application, the most important of which is tyres for cars and other vehicles.

The level of the  fines confirms the Commission's determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels. This is the fifth Commission decision in 2005 against hard core cartels.

COMPETITION-MOL

Todd said that the  Commission had approved under the EU Merger Regulation the acquisition of MOL WMT and MOL Storage, two subsidiaries of MOL, the incumbent oil and gas company in Hungary, by E.ON Ruhrgas, a large integrated German energy supplier, subject to conditions and obligations.

"This has been possible because the parties have offered remedies, in particular as regards the unbundling of the gas production and transmission activities retained by MOL and the commercial activities acquired by E.ON. In addition, the remedies provide for the release of substantial quantities of gas on the market over a 10-year period and in the light of these remedies, the  Commission have concluded that effective competition will be preserved after this takeover," he added.
- - - -
REGIONAL-AID

Todd said that the  Commission had adopted new regional aid Guidelines under the EC Treaty state aid rules.
These Guidelines will apply from 2007-2013, the same period as for the next programming period for EU
structural funds.
Page 30 of 57 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Guidelines set out the rules for allowing state aid which promotes the development of poorer regions, covering aid such as direct investment grants and tax reductions for companies.

The Guidelines specify rules for the selection of regions which are eligible for regional aid, and define the maximum permitted levels of this aid.

In line with EU cohesion policy and European Council requests for less and better targeted state aid, the new Guidelines re-focus regional aid on the most deprived regions of the enlarged Union, while allowing for the need to improve competitiveness and to provide for a smooth transition.

Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has been  fined 58.88m euros for illegal  price fixing  for rubber chemicals by the European  Commission, which has described the illegal agreement as a particularly severe case.

The Brussels-based authority has indications that  Bayer started being involved in illegal  price fixing  in the 1970s, but has been able to prove the company's involvement only for the period between 1996 and
2001. Bayer illegally fixed the prices for  rubber chemicals together with its competitors Crompton and Flexsys. In 1999 and 2000, a Spanish chemicals company also took part in the price fixing.  The companies in question will be  fined a total of 75.86m euros. The European market for rubber chemicals was worth around 200m euros in 2001.

European Union regulators  fined three chemical companies 75.9 million euros ($90 million) for running a cartel to swap information and control the price of  rubber chemicals used to make car tires.  Bayer AG was fined 58.9 million euros,  Crompton Europe Ltd., now known as Chemtura Corp., 13.6 million
euros, and Repsol YPF SA's subsidiary General Quimica SA was ordered to pay 3.4 million euros. Flexsys NV, a Belgian joint venture between Akzo Nobel NV and Solutia Inc., was exempt from a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel in 2002. The  commission said the chemical companies broke EU antitrust rules by secretly agreeing to control both the European and global markets for rubber chemicals from at least 1996 to 2001. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice fined Bayer $66 million and Crompton $50 million for fixing the price of  rubber chemicals on the U.S. market.

Shares in Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, gained up to 2.5 per cent to 35.3 euros yesterday after it emerged that US authority FDA has licensed the group's Sorafenib drug, which the group regards as the pillar of its cancer research operations. The drug, which will be sold under the name Nexavar, has been licensed faster than market experts had expected.

The product, which will be used to treat advanced kidney cancer, has been developed together with US company Onyx Pharmaceuticals and is expected to generate annual turnover of up to 1bn euros. Meanwhile, it also emerged yesterday that Bayer has been fined 58.9m euros by the European Commission for illegal price fixing  for rubber chemicals. The group had already reserved 50m euros for these fines back in 2003.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Over 75 million in fines for rubber chemical  cartel

LP
Brussels, 21/12/2005 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the Commission decided to fine four companies 75.8 6 million EUR for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market. Between 1996 and
2001, Flexys,  Bayer and Crompton (now Chemtura), joined between 1999 and 2000 by General Quimica, agreed to exchange information on prices and/or to increase the prices of certain products (anti-oxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) on the markets of the European Economic Area
(EEA) and globally. "Cartels are a scourge", said Neelie Kroes, who has made the fight against this kind of infringement (article 81) a priority of her term of office. " I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look very carefully at how their companies are being run", the Commissioner for Competition states in a press release.

TD
Further to information provided in April 2002 by Flexys (EUROPE 8316), which was granted total community, the  Commission carried out checks on the premises of the three other companies involved in the cartel. As always in this kind of case, the evidence gathered by the  Commission was very strong. "There was a contact among competitors from at least the mid-1990s, before, during and after every price increase for rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact", said one person who took part in the cartel. Despite numerous indications about the existence of similar practices within this sector going back to the 1970s, the  Commission has sufficiently convincing evidence only for the period 1996 to 2001. Considering the size of the EEA market, put at 200 million EUR in 2001, and the weight of the companies involved, it  fined Bayer 58.88 million EUR,  Crompton 13.6 million and  Repsol YPF SA and  Repsol Quimica SA (which wholly owns General Quimica) 3.38 million.

In 2005, the  Commission already adopted five decisions on illegal cartels, fining 16 companies active on the industrial sack market over 290 million EUR (EUROPE 9079). It has just published a Green Paper on the application of anti-trust rules by individuals and companies, aiming to facilitate claims for damages in cases of infringement, via cartels and abuses of dominant position (see other article).

The European  Commission has imposed a fine of EUR 58.88 M on  Bayer for playing a leading role in a cartel which between 1996 and 2001 made illegal price arrangements in the area of  rubber chemicals. Also included in the  cartel were Compton (as a representative of Chemtura), General Quimica (daughter company of Repsol), and Flexsys (joint venture of Solutia and Akzo Nobel), Netherlands. Because it informed on the other companies, Flexsys was not  fined.

European Union regulators  fined three chemical companies 75.9 million euros ($90 million) for running a cartel to swap information and control the price of  rubber chemicals used to make car tires.  Bayer AG was fined 58.9 million euros,  Crompton Europe Ltd., now known as Chemtura Corp., 13.6 million euros, and Repsol YPF SA's subsidiary General Quimica SA was ordered to pay 3.4 million euros. Flexsys NV, a Belgian joint venture between Akzo Nobel NV and Solutia Inc., was exempt from a  fine
because it blew the whistle on the  cartel in 2002. The  commission said the chemical companies broke EU antitrust rules by secretly agreeing to control both the European and global markets for  rubber chemicals from at least 1996 to 2001.

The European Commission has fined three chemical firms euro 75.86 million for running a  cartel in the market for rubber chemicals. Bayer, Crompton (new Chemtura) and General Cuimica, along with Flexys, were found guilty of exchanging pricing information and raising the price of rubber chemicals between 1996 and 2001. Flexys escaped a  fine however by alerting the Commission to the cartel's existence, which prompted an in-depth investigation by EU competition authorities.

TD
Flexys first blew the whistle on the operation in April 2002, and subsequent inspections of the premises of the other three firms confirmed the existence of the  cartel. However, by cooperating with the Commission, all firms were rewarded with reductions in their  fines. The final amounts announced by the Commission on December 21 are as follows:  Bayer, euro 58.88 million;  Crompton (including Crompton Europe and Uniroyal Chemical) euro 13.6 million; General Quimica euro 3.38 million. The General
Quimica fine will be borne by the firm's parent companies  Repsol YPF and  Repsol Quimica.

This is the fifth  Commission decision this year to  fine cartels. Brussels has signalled its intention to take a tougher stance on collusive behaviour with the creation of a sixty-strong team dedicated exclusively to the detection and punishment of cartels. "Cartels are a scourge", said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, adding that "I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated".

Rubber chemicals are synthetic or organic chemicals used in the production of  rubber products, most notably car tyres. The EEA market value in 2001, the last year that the  cartel was in operation, was estimated at around euro 200 million. Under Article 81 of the EC Treaty, which outlaws restrictive business practices,  fines of up to 10% of worldwide turnover can be imposed on firms found guilty of
anti-competitive behaviour. However, leniency rules reward firms that provide the authorities with insider information.

HD         EC fines four firms, including Bayer, Repsol for rubber chemical  cartel

The European Commission has fined four companies - including Germany's  Bayer and General Quimica, a unit of Spain's Repsol - a total of Eur75.86-mil (around $86.51-mil) for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market, the EC said Dec 21. The other two companies are Flexsys and Crompton (now Chemtura), which includes  Crompton Europe and Uniroyal Chemical Co.

In violation of EC Treaty competition rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices (Article 81), the EC said that Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the EEA and world-wide markets at least from 1996 to 2001. General Quimica participated to this agreements in 1999 and 2000, the EC said.

TD
Bayer received the largest portion of the fine - Eur58.88-mil, although the company was granted a 20% reduction in the penalty. Crompton was fined Eur13.60-mil following a 50% reduction, while General Quimica (including Repsol Quimica and Repsol YPF) was fined Eur3.38-mil after a 10% reduction. Flexsys NV, who provided the original information of the cartel and co-operated fully with EC's Competition  Commission, was not fined.

The investigation into the  rubber chemicals sector began following an application for conditional immunity from fines by Flexsys in April 2002. Subsequently, the  Commission carried out inspections at the premises of Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica in September 2002.  Crompton, Bayer and General Quimica applied for leniency on Oct 8, 2002, Oct 24, 2002 and Jun 7, 2004, respectively, the EC said.

The EC said that the essence of this infringement can be seen in the description made by one of the participants that "there was a contact among competitors from at least the mid 1990's, before, during and after every price increase for  rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact."

The EC also described that an employee of the same company, referring to the 1998 price increase, recalled it "as the most orchestrated and collusive 'agreement' he ever made."

The EC added that while there were a number of indications that collusive activities within the rubber chemicals industry were already taking place at least occasionally in the 1970s, the Commission only had sufficiently firm and convincing evidence of the existence of the  cartel for the period covering the years 1996-2001.

The Commission said that it regarded the  cartel as a "very serious infringement." In fixing the amount of the fines, the Commission took into account the size of the market in the countries affected by the cartel, the length of time the cartel had been operating, the relative weight of the firms involved and their global dimension.

The cooperation offered by Flexsys provided useful information for the exposure of the infringement and was rewarded in accordance with the Commission's leniency notice. Flexsys was given full immunity, and the other firms had their fines reduced in return for the information they provided.

"Repsol YPF SA and  Repsol Quimica SA, although they did not participate themselves in the arrangements in question, are nevertheless held responsible for the conduct of their wholly owned subsidiary General Quimica," the EC said.

The level of the  fines confirms the Commission's determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels. This is the fifth Commission decision in 2005 against hard core cartels.

"Cartels are a scourge," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down, prosecuted and punished. With this latest decision, I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run."

Meanwhile, the EC said any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive  cartel run by the four companies "may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages,
submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behavior took place and was illegal." Even though the  Commission has fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the Commission fine, the EC added.

THE European  cartel police have hit at industrial plastic bag producers and at  rubber chemicals manufacturers. The European  Commission has fined 16 bag companies a total of 290.71 million [euro] and four rubber chemicals companies 75.86 million [euro] for  price fixing.

The bags investigation began after surprise inspections of producers in June 2002, and revealed that the companies had secretly agreed among themselves--some for more than 20 years--on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain. It was triggered by British Polythene Industries which admitted its part in the cartel, for which it was given full immunity under the  Commission's antitrust leniency arrangements. Fines for some of the other  cartel members were reduced because of their eventual co-operation.

TD
According to the  Commission, senior directors at the offending companies colluded, often at meetings of their professional association Valveplast, to co-ordinate price rises to customers and to allocate markets and prices.

Together, the companies concerned controlled most of the market in industrial bags in the countries covered by the cartel, which in 2001 was estimated at some 265 million [euro].

The guilty companies were: Bernay Film Plastique; Bischof + Klein and Bischof + Klein France; Bonar Technical Fabrics and Low & Bonar; British Polythene Industries and Combipac; Cofira-Sac; Fardem Packaging and Kendrion; Koninklijke Verpakkingsindustrie Stempher and Stempher BV; Nordenia International and Nordfolien; Plasticos Espanoles and Armando Alvarez; RKW Rheinische Kunststoffwerke and JM Gesellschaft fur industrielle Beteiligungen; Sachsa Verpackung and Groupe
Gascogne; Trioplast Wittenheim, Trioplast Industrier, FL Smidth & Co and FLS Plast; and UPM-Kymmene
Oyj.

The four rubber chemicals manufacturers  fined by the EC were  Bayer, Crompton (now Chemtura), Flexys and General Chimica with its parent companies  Repsol Quimica and Repsol YPF. All four companies had their  fines reduced because of their co-operation with the investigation. Flexsys was given immunity from  fines for providing information which started the investigation, which led to raids on the companies in 2002.

The fines related to a  cartel operated between 1996 and 2001--although the  Commission says it may have been operating as long ago as the 1970s--in which the four companies agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators.

The company receiving the largest  fine, Bayer, recently announced it was making provisions to pay  fines in North America for colluding over prices of some  rubber and polyester polyol products.  Bayer--and Lanxess which was part of  Bayer at the time of the offences--are between them preparing to pay 337 million [euro], and there could be more to come. Some  fines have already been paid, and  Bayer has now reached agreement on other actions for which it set aside a provision in the fourth quarter of last year of
275 million [euro].

Lanxess agreed to bear 30 per cent of the cost of Bayer's liabilities for antitrust actions related to its rubber business and set aside 61 million [euro]. Bayer says that it expects further governmental proceedings and civil actions to bring 'additional expenses that may also be of material importance to the company'.

Bayer, General Quimica and Crompton (now known as Chemtura) have been fined a total of EUR 75.86
M by the European Commission for their participation in a  rubber chemicals price-fixing cartel between
1996 and 2001. The existence of the  cartel was reported by Flexys which was not fined as a result. All
fines were reduced because the companies cooperated with the investigation. Bayer was fined EUR
58.88 M, General Quimica was  fined EUR 3.38 M and Crompton (including Crompton Europe and
Uniroyal Chemical) was fined EUR 13.6 M.  Repsol YPF and Repsol Quimica are parent companies for
General Quimica and will pay this  fine. In 2001, demand for rubber chemicals in the EEA was estimated
at some EUR 200 M/y.

HD                Fine time in Europe; Suppliers get $90 million in penalties  for price-fixing

LP
The European  Commission has levied fines totaling $90 million against  Bayer A.G., Chemtura Corp. and General Quimica for participating in an international  rubber chemicals price-fixing conspiracy.
The EC, which called cartels a ``scourge'' that will not be tolerated, did not levy  fines against
Flexsys N.V., however, because it blew the whistle on the case originally in 2002.

TD
The EC fined Bayer $70 million, Chemtura-formerly  Crompton Corp.-$16 million and General Quimica $4 million. The  commission said it imposed the penalties ``for operating a  cartel in the rubber chemicals market, in clear violation of EC Treaty competition rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices.''

These fines follow similar actions last year in the U.S. and Canada. In those cases,  Bayer agreed to pay $66 million in the U.S. and Chemtura agreed to pay  fines of $50 million in the U.S. and $7 million in Canada.

Bayer's fine reflects a 20-percent leniency reduction for its cooperation in investigating the case. Likewise, Chemtura's  fine was cut in half for its cooperation and General Quimica received a
10-percent leniency reduction.

The EU said  rubber chemicals suppliers Flexsys, Bayer and Crompton agreed to exchange information about prices and/or raise prices of certain rubber chemicals (antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators) in the European economic area and worldwide markets at least from
1996 to 2001.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said cartels will be tracked down, prosecuted and punished. ``With this latest decision, I am sending a very strong message to company boards that cartels will not be tolerated, and to shareholders that they should look carefully at how their companies are being run.''

In its public comment, the EC quoted one of the participants: ``There was a contact among competitors from at least the mid-1990s, before, during and after every price increase for  rubber chemicals or at least an attempt to have such contact.'' It also quotes another employee of the
same company as calling the 1998 price increase ``the most orchestrated and collusive `agreement' he ever made.''

The EC said it suspects this to have been a long-term practice in the rubber chemicals sector. Its investigators saw indications that ``collusive activities within the rubber chemicals industry were already taking place at least occasionally in the 1970s'' but said it could find sufficiently hard evidence of the  cartel's existence only for 1996-2001.
The EC estimated the value of  rubber chemicals sold in 2001 in the European markets was about
$240 million, out of a global market of about $1.8 billion.

General Quimica, a subsidiary of Spain's  Repsol YPF S.A. and  Repsol Quimica S.A., was held to have participated in this agreement in 1999 and 2000.

This investigation followed an application for conditional immunity by Flexsys in April 2002. In September 2002, the  commission inspected premises at  Bayer, Crompton Europe and General Quimica.

LP
You get hit with $90 million in fines and say, ``not bad, not bad at all. Could have been worse.'' Welcome to the world of price-fixing prosecution.

The European  Commission the other day slapped Chemtura,  Bayer and Spain's Quimica with that amount in penalties. Naughty people-some who now are cooling their heels in jail-once employed
by those companies colluded to raise prices for antioxidants, antiozonants and accelerators in
Europe and throughout the world in the mid-1990s to 2001.

TD
This follows  fines of $125 million in the U.S. and Canada for anti-trade practices involving  rubber chemicals. And this, of course, is separate from the various  price-fixing fines and litigation over EPDM rubber, carbon black and polyurethane.
Was there ANYTHING that wasn't the subject of  price-fixing back in the '90s?

Oh yeah, tires. While Rome (supplier materials being Rome) burned, the feds spent a decade trying to figure out if tire makers were colluding on prices. Their conclusion: Well, if selling a product below cost to get it on a new car, or cutting prices so low in the aftermarket that if you add in inflation, they were cheaper than they were 20 years earlier, yes, they were conspiring. Conspiring to go bankrupt.
Actual  price-fixing: You wonder what people were on when they came up with the idea.
``Everybody is doing it'' and ``no one is going to catch us'' aren't exactly good reasons to engage in
a conspiracy. Especially in such a competitive business as the  rubber industry, where even the
honest folk play it hard.
So now we're into the final stages of the big conspiracies.

The first stage is denial: ``OHMYGOD, the feds came to my home with a subpoena! This can't be happening to ME.''

Stage 2, of course, is anger. ``If I catch the !@/?*$**^^-+!! who blew the whistle on me, so help me...''
The third stage is bargaining. Usually, it involves a prosecutor. Stage 4-depression. ``Even if I get out of this, I'm ruined.''
Stage 5-acceptance. As what the various companies involved in the disgrace now are doing: Accept the fines, settle the lawsuits and make your mea culpa.
And be damn grateful if your customers forgive past sins. Noga is editor of  Rubber & Plastics News.

The European Commission has fined three companies a total of $90 M for entering into a  price fixing    cartel for rubber chemicals. Bayer AG will have to pay $70 M with Chemtura and General Quimica being fined $16 M and $4 M respectively. The EC did not  fine Flexsys NV which had revealed the  cartel in
2002. Bayer and Chemtura had been fined in similar cases in the US and Canada in 2005. Pricing information had been exchanged on rubber chemicals such as antioxidants, antiozonants and primary accelerators for at least the period 1996-2001. The European  Commission estimated that the European rubber chemical market was worth around $240 M in 2001 (world market around $1.8 bn).

The European Commission has fined Bayer, Crompton, and General Quimica a total of EUR 75.86 M for price fixing  in rubber chemicals "at least from 1996 to 2001." Flexsys was also part of the  cartel, but escaped the fines because it informed the  commission about the price-fixing. Bayer received much the largest fine of EUR 58.88 M.  Crompton and General Quimica were fined EUR 13.60 M and EUR 3.38 M respectively. The  cartel members fixed prices of antioxidants, antiozonants, and primary accelerators.
