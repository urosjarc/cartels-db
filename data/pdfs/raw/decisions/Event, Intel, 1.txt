* EU takes step toward sanctions against  Intel -source
* Formal decision could come within weeks (Adds comment from  European Commission)

TD
SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 (Reuters) - The European Commission, taking a major step toward fining and imposing sanctions on  Intel Corp for violating antitrust law, has sent a draft decision ruling against the chip maker to EU member states, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

That sets the stage for the Commission to deliver a formal decision within weeks, based on past practice. In the draft decision, the Commission said  Intel abused its market power in violation of EU antitrust law.

Intel declined comment.
"As far as we are concerned this is speculative at this stage and we have no comment," spokesman
Chuck Mulloy said.

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said, "I can confirm that the Commission does have an ongoing antitrust case concerning Intel but I can make no further comment."

Intel and its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc , make virtually all of the central processing chips at the heart of the world's one billion personal computers.
The Commission's draft decision was sent to the 27 European Union member states, the source told
Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Sending a draft decision is typically followed by a meeting within a week or two in which the individual members give their recommendations. Every draft decision of the Commission has been approved in the past.

Once a draft is approved, the members reconvene within days to approve a  fine. In order to prevent leaks, the Commission does not put the size of the  fine in a draft decision.

Equally important to an  Intel fine would be other sanctions, which could limit the activities of  Intel in giving rebates.

In July 2007, the Commission said  Intel designed its rebates to persuade computer makers to shut out AMD. One year later, the Commission said  Intel had also given money to retailers who agreed to sell only computers with  Intel chips. (Reporting by David Lawsky; Editing by Andre Grenon, Gary Hill)

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

The European Union appears close to formally sanctioning  Intel Corp. for anticompetitive business practices and levying a  fine against the chip maker, drawing a lengthy  antitrust case closer to conclusion.

TD
E.U. officials have prepared a draft decision calling for a  fine, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't clear whether the E.U. had settled on an amount.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

Under E.U. procedure,  antitrust officials typically share drafts of decisions with their counterparts in the individual E.U. countries, seeking their input before making a final decision. A final ruling, which could come as soon as next month, would require approval of the E.U.'s executive arm, the European Commission; a draft could well change as it moves through the process.

An Intel spokesman declined to comment, as did an E.U. spokesman. News of the draft decision and of the potential  fine were earlier reported by Bloomberg News.

Intel's tangle with E.U.  antitrust authorities dates to a 2000 complaint by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif.

In 2007, the E.U. sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging that  Intel boxed AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer manufacturers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down and by selling chips below cost to thwart AMD from swooping up key accounts.

Last year, the E.U. added more charges, alleging that  Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

The case is likely to be extremely complex, turning both on economic analyses of microprocessor pricing and on documentary evidence of  Intel's contacts with PC makers.  Intel has argued that any payments to manufacturers are part of a discount program that rewards high-volume purchasers, and that any payments to the retailer were incentives to get better display in stores.
Any decision is also almost certain to be appealed by  Intel to the European Court of First Instance in
Luxembourg.
The E.U.'s  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, has wide discretion to set the amount of a  fine
- the bloc's rules put a ceiling of 10% of a company's annual revenue.  Intel had revenue in 2008 of
almost $38 billion. Kroes has in the past employed hefty  fines in cases involving big companies; last
year, she issued a record $1.16 billion  fine against Microsoft Corp. for non-compliance in the E.U.'s
long-running antitrust fight with the software giant.


Page 6 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Fines are often lowered if a company cooperates, but  Intel has fought the E.U. hard - at one point taking it to court to try to gain access to AMD documents.

Intel dominates the world-wide market for the x86 variety of computer chip that powers
Windows-based PCs, and struggling AMD is its only significant rival.  Intel's marketing and sales
practices have been the subject of  antitrust scrutiny around the world for years.

Regulators in South Korea and Japan have brought  antitrust action against  Intel, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the New York State attorney general also have ongoing investigations. AMD has brought a civil  antitrust suit against  Intel in a Delaware court.

COAST IRB
Company Caught Approving

TD
Fake Medical Study to Close

A Colorado company that approved a fake medical study in a congressional sting operation said it will close.

Coast IRB LLC said the disclosure of the sting and an April 14 warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration describing the company's violations led several high-profile customers to pull their business.

Coast is one of many companies paid by drug and device makers to oversee clinical trials and independently ensure that patient safety is protected.

FDA officials met with Coast at its headquarters in Colorado Springs on Wednesday to discuss how to avoid disruption for patients and for companies conducting clinical trials with Coast-organized institutional review boards, or IRBs.
Coast's problems began in March when the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that
Coast had fallen for a sting operation.

Food and Beverage Titan
Reports 2.1% Sales Decline

Nestle SA posted a 2.1% drop in first-quarter sales as price increases failed to offset stagnating volumes and the effect of a strong Swiss franc.

Revenue at the world's largest food and beverages company by sales and market value fell to 25.17 billion Swiss francs ($21.54 billion) from 25.72 billion francs a year earlier.

Sales fell in five of Nestle's eight product categories, and the Swiss company said Wednesday the franc's strengthening against most currencies dented the top line by 5%. Price increases of more than
3% offset some of the negative currency effect.

Sales declined in Europe and Asia, Oceania and Africa, while revenue in the Americas region rose, boosted by the dollar's rise against the Swiss franc.

Nestle repeated its forecast for an organic growth rate this year "at least approaching 5%". The company didn't report quarterly earnings.

HENNES &MAURITZ Retailer Remains on Track To Expand Despite Slump
Hennes &Mauritz AB, the world's third-largest fashion chain by revenue, says it is on track to open
225 new stores this year, despite the global slowdown.

H&M has acquired several stores from bankrupt competitors, but spokesman Nils Vinge said, "We certainly have the resources and capacity to have 225 net openings, opening more than we are closing."

He was speaking on the eve of the opening Thursday of H&M's first Beijing store, which will be its 15th outlet in China. The Swedish company has added to its outlets at a pace of 10% to 15% a year. Last year, the company opened 234 stores while closing 18.

The retailer has been working to expand its global footprint to offset weakening sales in Europe and the U.S. China sales, while growing, account for less than 1% of total group sales.

PEPSI BOTTLING
Profit Rises 87% on Gains, As Company Raises Outlook
Pepsi Bottling Group Inc.'s first-quarter net income rose 87% on tax gains, while demand continued to decline.

The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast by five cents to between $2.20 and $2.30 a share.

Reversing a decade-long strategy of separating bottling from its main soft-drink business, PepsiCo Inc. said Monday it was offering to buy shares it doesn't already own in its two main bottlers, Pepsi Bottling and PepsiAmericas Inc., for a combined $6 billion. Pepsi Bottling said Wednesday it has appointed a special committee to evaluate the proposal.

Pepsi Bottling reported net income of $58 million, or 27 cents a share, up from $31 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier, when results included a net gain of 17 cents. Revenue fell 5.4% to $2.51
billion.

COCA-COLA
Shareholders Reject
Executive-Pay Limitations

Coca-Cola Co. shareholders rejected proposals calling for limits on executive compensation, an independent board chairman and the establishment of a board committee on human rights.

At the company's annual meeting in Duluth, Ga., corporate activists raised concerns about water use in India and pressed Coke to label its Dasani bottled water as originating from municipal sources, among other issues.

Chief Executive Muhtar Kent lauded the soft-drink giant's growth amid a global economic storm. He officially assumes the role of chairman on Thursday, and thanked outgoing Chairman E. Neville Isdell for his "vision, skills and talent" in rebuilding Coke's operations and optimistic outlook after taking over in 2004.

=WSJ:EU Close To Fining  Intel For Anticompetitive Practices-Sources By Charles Forelle and Peppi
Kiviniemi
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

TD
The European Union appears close to formally sanctioning  Intel Corp. for anticompetitive business practices and levying a  fine against the chip maker, drawing a lengthy  antitrust case closer to conclusion.

E.U. officials have prepared a draft decision calling for a  fine, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't clear whether the E.U. had settled on an amount.

Intel dominates the world-wide market for the x86 variety of computer chip that powers Windows-based PCs, and struggling AMD is its only significant rival.  Intel's marketing and sales practices have been the subject of  antitrust scrutiny around the world for years.

Regulators in South Korea and Japan have brought  antitrust action against  Intel, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the New York State attorney general also have ongoing investigations. AMD has brought a civil antitrust suit against  Intel in a Delaware court.

HD          EU Moves Close to Antitrust Fine Against  Intel

The European Union appears close to formally sanctioning  Intel Corp. for anticompetitive business practices and levying a  fine against the chip maker, drawing a lengthy  antitrust case closer to conclusion.

EU officials have prepared a draft decision calling for a  fine, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't clear whether the EU had settled on an amount. A final ruling, which could come as soon as next month, would require approval of the  European Commission; a draft can change as it goes through the process. An  Intel spokesman declined to comment, as did an EU spokesman.

TD
Intel's tangle with EU  antitrust authorities dates to a 2000 complaint by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif. In 2007, the EU sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging that  Intel boxed AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer manufacturers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down. Last year, the EU added more charges, alleging  Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

The case is likely to be extremely complex, turning both on economic analyses of microprocessor pricing and on documentary evidence of  Intel's contacts with PC makers.  Intel has argued that any payments to manufacturers are part of a discount program that rewards high-volume purchasers, and that any payments to the retailer were incentives to get better display in stores.

BRUSSELS -- European  antitrust regulators, which have been aggressively pursuing what they see as anticompetitive practices among technology companies, could impose their largest  fine ever in a market-dominance case against the chip maker  Intel.

The size of the penalty will be discussed by representatives from 27 European Union governments in early May. The decision would follow landmark rulings by the  European Commission against Microsoft, which also is being investigated over its Internet Explorer browser, and a settlement with I.B.M., which is again the subject of a complaint.

TD
The commission began investigating  Intel in 2000 after Advanced Micro Devices, its archrival, filed a complaint. Both chip makers are based in the United States.

In two sets of charges, in 2007 and 2008, the commission accused  Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers, by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost.

Intel has said that it has done nothing wrong and that European officials have investigated the case in a way that imperils its rights of defense.
''Over all,  Intel's conduct is lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,'' Robert Manetta, an
Intel spokesman in London, said Wednesday.

Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has faced the biggest financial penalties to date, accused of abusing its dominance. It paid a  fine in 2004 of 497 million euros, or $663 million at current exchange rates.

In the Intel case, ''I'd be surprised if the  fine isn't as high or higher than in the Microsoft case,'' said Howard Cartlidge, the head of the European Union and competition group at the law firm Olswang in London. ''Technology markets are where the European Commission has perceived particular problems due to dominant companies.''

Some legal experts speculate that  Intel's fine could reach about a billion euros, or $1.3 billion.  Intel's annual sales were $37.6 billion in 2008.

Michael Reynolds, a partner in the international  antitrust group in Brussels at the law firm Allen & Overy, said such a large  fine would be more likely in a case involving cartel behavior, which is not at issue with Intel.

European regulators have also  finedMicrosoft 279 million euros and 899 million euros on the grounds of failing to comply with European Union orders in  antitrust cases, but these were administrative penalties.

Page 14 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The market research firm International Data Corporation says  Intel had 81.9 percent of the global market for personal computer chips in December, compared with 17.7 percent for A.M.D.

The commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global worldwide sales for  antitrust abuses. But applying the formula strictly could put companies out of business rather than lead them to change their business practices.

A person with knowledge of the commission's deliberations said the agency was planning to highlight specific instances of suspected illegal discounting and order an end to those practices.
The European charges against  Intel are confidential. But A.M.D. laid out some of its concerns about
Intel's behavior in Europe in a civil case filed in Delaware in 2005.

In that case, A.M.D. said its share of business with the European computer maker Fujitsu-Siemens fell after Intel offered a ''special discount'' on chips. According to A.M.D., Fujitsu-Siemens accepted the discount in exchange for hiding references to A.M.D. computers on its Web site and in a retail catalog.

A.M.D. also said in the case that a leading retailer based in Germany, Media Markt, carried  Intel computers exclusively in exchange for annual payments by  Intel. In Britain, DSG, the parent company of the retailers Dixons and PC World, limits A.M.D.'s share of its business to less than 10 percent because of payments by  Intel, according to A.M.D.

Intel has been engaged in a lengthy, multifaceted battle with  antitrust authorities across the globe. In Japan, Intel agreed in a consent decree in 2005 to modify its practices, without admitting wrongdoing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is also investigating.

In June, the Korea Fair Trade Commission  fined Intel 26 billion won, or about $19.5 million at current exchange rates, for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market by offering rebates to South Korean computer makers in a way that unfairly harmed A.M.D.  Intel has appealed in that case, saying that the Korean commission failed to understand the workings of the microchip market and neglected to take into account important evidence.

HD        Intel is facing record fine as E.U. ponders  antitrust case Regulators make new bid to level the playing  field for technology companies

BRUSSELS-- European  antitrust regulators could levy their largest  fine ever in a market-dominance case against Intel, in what would be their latest shot at leveling the playing field in the global technology market.

The size of the penalty will be discussed by representatives from 27 E.U. governments in early May. The decision would follow landmark rulings by the  European Commission against Microsoft, which also faces a continuing inquiry over its Internet Explorer browser, and a settlement with International
Business Machines, which is also again the subject of a complaint.

TD
To date, Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has faced the largest financial penalties for abusing its dominance, paying a  fine in 2004 of â¬497 million, or $663 million at current exchange rates.

''I'd be surprised if the fine isn't as high or higher than in the Microsoft case,'' said Howard Cartlidge, the head of the E.U. and competition group at the law firm Olswang in London, referring to the  Intel case.
''Technology markets are where the  European Commission has perceived particular problems due to dominant companies.''
Some people in Brussels speculate that  Intel's fine could reach levels double that of Microsoft, or about
â¬1 billion, or $1.3 billion. A  fine on that scale still would be dwarfed by  Intel's annual sales, which were
$37.6 billion in 2008.

Michael Reynolds, a partner in the international  antitrust group in Brussels at the law firm Allen & Overy, said such a large fine would be more likely in a case involving cartel behavior, which is not at issue with Intel.
European regulators have also  finedMicrosoft â¬279 million and â¬899 million for failing to comply with
E.U. orders in  antitrust cases, but these were administrative levies.
The commission's investigation of Intel began in 2000 after a complaint by its archrival, Advanced Micro
Devices, or A.M.D., which like Intel is also based in the United States.

In two sets of charges, in 2007 and 2008, the commission, the E.U.'s executive arm, has accused  Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers, by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost.

Intel has said it has done nothing wrong and that the way E.U. officials had conducted aspects of the case imperiled its rights of defense.
''Over all,  Intel's conduct is lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,'' Robert Manetta, an
Intel spokesman in London, said Wednesday.

The market researcher International Data Corp. says that  Intel had 81.9 percent of global personal computer chip market in December, compared with 17.7 percent for A.M.D.

The commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global worldwide sales for  antitrust abuses. But applying the formula strictly could put companies out of business rather than lead them to change their business practices.

Stephen Kinsella, an antitrust partner with the law firm Sidley Austin in London and Brussels, said a record fine in the Intel case would signal that penalties against dominant companies were becoming tougher in the absence of a U.S.-style system of private litigation, which drastically raises costs for companies breaking antitrust laws in the United States. But Mr. Kinsella warned that such fining practices in Europe would do little to help the companies, or consumers, that were injured in the first place.

''Bigger and bigger  fines may well penalize the wrongdoer, but the money is sucked out of the industry and simply disappears into the E.U. budget with no obvious benefit to consumers,'' he said.

A person with knowledge of the commission's deliberations said it was planning to highlight specific instances of suspected illegal discounting and order an end to those practices, rather than outlaw  Intel's business practices entirely.

The European charges against  Intel are confidential. But A.M.D. laid out some of its concerns about Intel's behavior in Europe in a civil case filed in Delaware in 2005. In that case, A.M.D. said its share of business with the European computer maker Fujitsu-Siemens fell after  Intel offered a ''special discount'' on chips.

A.M.D. also said in the case that a leading retailer based in Germany, Media Markt, carried  Intel computers exclusively in exchange for annual payments by  Intel. In Britain, DSG, the parent company of the retailers Dixons and PC World, limits A.M.D.'s share of its business to less than 10 percent because of payments by  Intel, according to A.M.D.
The commission proposes  fines, but those proposals may be influenced by the advisory committee of 27
E.U. national competition regulators. In the  Intel case, the involvement of national regulators could be
significant because of Intel's investments in Europe.

Intel's manufacturing headquarters are in Leixlip, Ireland, where the company employs about 5,000 people. In the past, the Irish authorities have helped mitigate E.U. sanctions against U.S. employers doing business in Ireland.
Ireland's data protection office last year forestalled sanctions pushed by Germany and others against
Microsoft, Google and Yahoo for retaining data in search engines more than six months.

William Prasifka, the chairman of the Irish  Competition Authority, did not respond to a request for comment.

Intel also has design and marketing offices in Germany and a logistics center in Warsaw, Poland.

It has been engaged in a lengthy, multifaceted battle with  antitrust authorities across the globe. In Japan, Intel agreed in a consent decree in 2005 to modify its practices, without admitting wrongdoing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is also conducting an investigation.

In June, the Korea Fair Trade Commission  fined Intel 26 billion won, or about $19.5 million at current exchange rates, for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market by offering rebates to South Korean computer makers in a way that unfairly harmed its rival A.M.D.  Intel has appealed in that case, saying that the Korean commission failed to understand the workings of the microchip market and neglected to take into account important evidence.

Any E.U.  fine is likely to be so much higher than in Korea, partly because the authorities in Brussels oversee a much larger market. E.U.  antitrust authorities also have long opposed the use of rebates and discounts by dominant companies to knock competitors out of the market.

Another reason for a large  fine in Europe is that the commission revised its fining guidelines since penalizing Microsoft in 2004, meaning it can charge more than in the past. The commission also could take into account aggravating circumstances, leading it to impose a larger  fine than it would have done otherwise had the company followed the set timetable.

Intel angered the commission by letting a deadline to respond to the statement pass in October and by then bringing a case at the second-highest European tribunal, the Court of First Instance, asking for

Page 17 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
more time and for the commission to consider more evidence.  Intel lost that procedural appeal early this year.

Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the E.U.  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, said after the ruling that Intel had created ''an unprecedented situation'' by thumbing its nose at the process in Europe.
Experts say that a record  fine for Intel will signal little respite for the technology industry in years ahead. The commission charged Microsoft on Jan. 15 with new abuses concerning the way it packages its
browser, Internet Explorer, with the dominant Windows operating system. E.U. officials say that the way
Microsoft ties the browser to Windows cuts competing browsers out of the market.
I.B.M., which was the one of the first technology companies to be investigated by the Europeans in the
1980s, also could once again be in the firing line. The commission is looking at a complaint made in
January by T3 Technologies, which alleges that I.B.M. is abusing its dominant position in the market for
large mainframe computers mainly used for processing large amounts of data.
Even so, how much of a difference such investigations make is an open question.

''The  European Commission's decision, whatever the outcome of the case, is not going to have a structural effect on market,'' said Chris Ingle, an I.D.C. analyst in London. The main reason, he said, is that computer makers ''are going to continue to want to buy the best-performing products at the best prices. That is the reason why  Intel has the market position it has and will continue to have.''

Legal experts estimate figure could top â¬1bn

Analysts are forecasting that Intel could face the largest  fine in European history, if found guilty of anti-competitive practices by the European Union.

TD
The EU is  currently investigating the chip giant over anti-competitive practices, including offering discounts to manufacturers for using  Intel chips, as well as encouraging them to not use hardware from rival AMD.

"I would be surprised if the  fine isn't as high or higher than in the Microsoft case," Howard Cartlidge, head of the EU  competition group at law firm  Olswang in London, told The New York Times.

"Technology markets are where the  European Commission has perceived particular problems due to dominant companies."
Legal analysts estimate that the  fine could exceed â¬1bn, well above the  â¬497m fine levied against
Microsoft.

Intel has already been found guilty of anti-competitive practices in Japan and Korea, and now faces investigations by the EU and the US Federal Trade Commission.

In the EU case, the company insists that it has done nothing wrong and is confident of being proved innocent. "Overall,  Intel's conduct is lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," said  Intel spokesman Robert Manetta.

However, AMD begs to differ. Senior sources within the company say that  Intel has been conducting anti-competitive practices to maintain a dominant 80/20 split in market share that has not changed in years, despite modifications in technology.
AMD pointed out that, even when  Intel misjudged the market with the introduction of the poorly received
Itanium, and AMD's Xeon had a clear run at the server space, the relative market shares barely changed.
AMD contends that  Intel uses subsidies to make sure manufacturers use its chips and ignore the
competition.

The sources cited a comment by HP director Tom Perkins that came out during the  HP spying scandal. Perkins said that "Intel might be kicking the cr** out of us," which AMD takes to relate to HP's decision to use more AMD processors.

â¢ A Big Fine

Intel was slapped with a whopping $1.45 billion  fine by the European Commission for what the organization called âillegal anti-competitive practices to exclude essentially its only competitor (AMD), and thus reduce consumer choice in the worldwide market for x86 chips.â  Intel went beyond normal price competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from the company, according to the commission. The computer manufacturers involved are Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC.

TD
âIntel takes strong exception to this decision,â said  Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini. âWe believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace, characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices.â
â¢ Sun Is Not Enough

Oracle, already bolstering its share of the market with its $7.4 billion bid to buy Sun, added once again to its arsenal with a deal to buy Virtual Iron Software. The deal boosts Oracle's position in server virtualization and in the process its competitiveness vis-a-vis Microsoft.
â¢ The Worst Is Over

A report from the Global Technology Distribution Council says that for distributors' U.S. businesses, the economic downturn has leveled off and the worst of the recession's effect on sales may be past. In the first of what according to the GTDC will be quarterly reports on business trends facing IT distributors, GTDC CEO Tim Curran said numbers from The NPD Group indicate sales are trending better for distributors on the whole, and sales for the past few months suggest January 2009 was the figurative âbottom.â

The Month in Brief

As the new communications policy teams continue to take shape in Washington, important nominations to the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC" or "Commission"), National Telecommunications and Information Administration ("NTIA"), and Rural Utilities Service ("RUS") continued to advance.

TD
On the FCC nomination front, Democratic Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller
(D-W.Va.) expressed his desire to move on the nomination of Julius Genachowski as Chairman before the
Memorial Day recess. However, Senate Republicans prefer to move the Genachowski nomination in
tandem with that of a Republican nominee, but have not announced a candidate or confirmed that a
decision has been reached on one. The picture was further complicated on the evening of April 29, 2009,
when the White House announced the nomination to the FCC of Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat who
presently serves as a commissioner on the South Carolina Public Service Commission.

In the meantime, on March 31, 2009, the White house advised the Senate officially of the nomination of Larry Strickling to head NTIA. Jonathan Adelstein, the FCC commissioner who was picked to head the RUS, will reportedly remain at the Commission until his successor is appointed and confirmed.

Supreme Court Upholds FCC's "Fleeting Expletives" Indecency Rule On April 28, 2009, the Supreme
Court issued a plurality opinion in Federal Communications Commission v. Fox, reversing a decision of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that the FCC's policy of punishing broadcasters for airing "fleeting
expletives" violated the Administrative Procedures Act ("APA"). In a string of FCC enforcement actions
going back to around 2002, the Commission had begun levying forfeitures against broadcasters like CBS
and Fox for failing to "bleep out" fleeting utterances of certain obscenities during live, unscripted
broadcasts. The court below had concluded that the FCC failed adequately to explain the policy shift to
this new, stricter enforcement regime. The Supreme Court's decision reverses and remands the case to
the 2nd Circuit. According to the majority opinion, the FCC's decision to start cracking down on single
instances of profane language did not, in its view, violate the APA. Specifically, the Court reasoned that a
federal agency "need not demonstrate to a court's satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are
better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that
there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better." In other words, agencies are
not subject to a higher standard of justification (even where First Amendment issues are involved) when
they depart from prior precedent than when they create a new rule from whole cloth. The dissent
disagreed, arguing that although independent agencies like the FCC have broad policy-making authority,
they cannot "make policy choices for purely political reasons nor rest them primarily upon unexplained
policy preferences." The Court decided the case on the APA issue alone, and did not address whether the
FCC's "fleeting expletives" indecency rule runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution. This leaves the door open for
the 2nd Circuit to consider First Amendment issues on remand. The majority opinion notes, "[i]t is
conceivable that the Commission's orders may cause some broadcasters to avoid certain language that is
beyond the Commission's reach under the Constitution" and whether this is so "will be determined soon
enough, perhaps in this very case." A concurrence by Justice Thomas tees up the Constitutional
questions, noting that the technological justification (i.e., scarcity of spectrum suitable for analog
broadcasting) for the FCC's authority to regulate broadcast content is obsolete. Because most Americans
subscribe to cable and satellite service, rather than rely on over-the-air programming, broadcast television
is no longer the "uniquely pervasive" medium that it used to be. Acting FCC Chairman Michael Copps
lauded the Court's decision as a victory in the fight to protect children from indecent material. Contrary to

Justice Thomas' view, Copps maintains that broadcasters are subject to "enforceable public interest obligations" because they are "granted free and exclusive use of a valuable public resource." Progress on EU Regulatory Reforms The European Union ("EU") has taken another step toward finalizing a package of regulatory reforms that has the potential to reshape the communications market in the EU. The reforms were first proposed in November 2007 following a consultation process that started in June 2006. In the latest developments, the three main EU institutions have reached agreement on a number of key elements of the reform proposal, which has been hotly debated within the EU. In particular, if ratified, the recent agreement will: give the  European Commission ("EC") new powers to veto certain actions by national communications regulators. Under the scheme, veto recommendations by the EC would become binding if supported by a majority of members of a new pan-EU supervisory agency (the Body of European Regulators in Electronic Communications, or BEREC). This represents a step back from the original proposal to give the EC broader veto powers, which was been strongly criticised by a number of the larger EU member states; allow national regulators to enforce functional separation on incumbent integrated telecommunications providers where necessary as an "extraordinary measure" to promote  competition. Again, this is a step back from the original proposal, which would have given regulators far broader powers to enforce separation. The original proposal was opposed by key member states such as Germany and Spain who spoke out in support of their domestic communications giants. Other member states, such as Britain (where the former national operator has already been split into separate wholesale and operations businesses), were advocates for separation; empower companies that build new generation telecommunications networks to take the risk of their investment into account when setting the terms on which they allow other operators to access their new networks. As such, other operators wishing to access those networks may be required to pay a "risk premium." However, they will not need to contribute to the initial investment required to build the networks; and extend universal service obligations to cover broadband as well as existing fixed telephony services. The aim is to ensure EU-wide access to
high-speed Internet, which is seen as an essential service for the future. There are a number of live reform issues on which member states are yet to agree. These include: the reallocation of radio frequency that
has been freed up due to the efficient use of spectrum by new digital services (sometimes referred to as the "digital dividend"); and issues relating to net neutrality and Internet security and privacy concerns. The aim is to finalize the reform package and put it to a vote by the European Parliament by the middle of this year. We will continue to monitor and report on any further developments. Denial of Complaint Against MetroPCS Spells out CMRS Interconnection Rules On March 30, the Enforcement Bureau released a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying a complaint brought by North County Communications Corp. ("North County") against MetroPCS California, LLC ("MetroPCS") for failing to pay North County for its transport and termination of intrastate calls originated by MetroPCS customers. North County, a competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") primarily serving chat-line providers and telemarketers, alleged that MetroPCS, a commercial mobile radio service ("CMRS") carrier, refused to pay for the termination of intrastate traffic in violation of FCC Rule 20.11(b) and refused to negotiate an interconnection agreement with North County in violation of Section 251(b)(5) of the Communications Act and related FCC rules as well as Sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Act. In cataloguing the flaws in North County's allegations, the Bureau reviewed the interconnection regime governing CMRS providers. North County argued that, by failing to compensate North County, MetroPCS violated Rule 20.11(b), which requires CMRS carriers to "pay reasonable compensation" to local exchange carriers ("LECs") for terminating CMRS-originated traffic. The Bureau rejected this claim because the states have the authority to establish intrastate rates for the termination of CMRS-originated traffic, and the FCC has not preempted such authority. The Bureau accordingly dismissed the Rule 20.11(b) claim without prejudice in order to allow the California Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") to determine a reasonable intrastate termination rate, after which North County may seek whatever recovery is appropriate under that rate at the FCC. The Bureau also explained that allowing the PUC to establish a reasonable termination rate would not violate Section 332(c)(3)(A) of the Act, which preempts state regulation of CMRS rates, because North County's termination charge to MetroPCS is not a CMRS rate. The Bureau also rejected contentions that the 2005
T-Mobile Order precluded PUC establishment of a reasonable termination rate. It explained that the T-Mobile Order allows incumbent LECs ("ILECs"), but not CLECs, to invoke the state arbitration procedures of Section 252 of the Act to reach interconnection agreements with CMRS carriers but does
not address the states' authority to regulate intrastate rates. The Bureau rejected North County's claim that MetroPCS's failure to negotiate an interconnection agreement violated Section 251(b)(5) because that provision imposes a duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements only on LECs, not CMRS carriers. The Bureau also rejected North County's claim that MetroPCS's failure to negotiate an interconnection agreement, while continuing to send traffic to North County, constitutes an unjust and unreasonable practice under Section 201(b). The Bureau found that the parties' inability to reach an agreement stemmed from a good faith dispute over the reasonable rate, not "illegitimate posturing by MetroPCS." Finally, the Bureau rejected North County's claim that MetroPCS's refusal to enter into an interconnection agreement with North County, while entering into such agreements with other carriers, for the termination of its traffic, constitutes unreasonable discrimination under Section 202(a) of the Act. The Bureau explained that although Section 202(a) prohibits discrimination by a carrier between two
customers, North County complains that MetroPCS, as a customer, is treating one provider of service differently from others. The upshot of this order may be increased CLEC complaint activity at state

commissions to seek termination rate determinations. FCC Seeks Comment on Broadband Programs Under the Recovery Act and Seeks Comment on Broadband Mapping The FCC, NTIA, and RUS all began in earnest the planning and fact gathering needed to implement the various broadband-related sections of the stimulus package passed earlier in the year, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA" or "Recovery Act"). National Broadband Plan Under the Recovery Act At the April 8 Open Meeting, the FCC officially launched the process of developing the National Broadband Plan ("NBP"), required by the Recovery Act. The NBP's goal will be to ensure that every American has access to broadband capability. The NBP must be delivered to Congress by Feb. 17, 2010. It will provide a roadmap toward achieving the goal of ensuring that all Americans reap the benefits of broadband. The FCC's Notice of Inquiry on the NBP is very broad, and seeks input on, among other things: Establishing benchmarks
and goals in deploying broadband to all areas of the U.S. What mechanisms (i.e., Universal Service Fund, wireless service policies, open network rules) will best promote broadband build-out. Measures that will make broadband affordable to all U.S. consumer and other strategies that will increase broadband adoption in underserved populations. Current status of broadband availability and broadband mapping. Comments are due June 8 and replies are due July 7, respectively, in GN Docket No. 09-26. FCC's Consultative Role on the Recovery Act Broadband Programs In addition to Congress's directive to create
a National Broadband Plan, the FCC was also charged with a "consultative role" to NTIA and RUS in the two agencies' implementation of broadband loans and grants under the Recovery Act. In a March 24, 2009
Public Notice, the FCC sought comment on its specific recommendations to NTIA and RUS. The FCC was not given charge of any funds for broadband loans or grants, but is to offer expert, technical advice to
NTIA as it establishes the Broadband Technologies Opportunities Program ("BTOP"). Congress directed NTIA to consult with the FCC on five specific terms and concepts: the definition of "unserved area," the definition of "underserved area," the definition of "broadband," the non-discrimination obligations that will be contractual conditions of BTOP grants, and the network interconnection obligations that will be contractual conditions of BTOP grants. Comments were due April 13, after which the pleading cycle was closed. Approximately 100 formal comments were filed. In general, the proposed definitions of "unserved" and "underserved" areas tended to track the commenters' interests (i.e., wireless broadband providers wanted the definition of broadband to be flexible enough to reflect the fact that wireless transfers speeds are often slower than wireline). Many suggested that "broadband" be defined using the FCC's current speed and service tiers as used in its recently updated Form 477 Reports. Most commenters urged the FCC and NTIA not to adopt additional or new non-discrimination and interconnection obligations as contractual obligations for the Recovery Act funds, due to concerns about their chilling effect on participation in the various stimulus programs, but several parties supported a non-discrimination obligation. Also of interest to many parties was the importance of "middle mile" and backhaul facilities to the goal of bringing universal broadband coverage. Comment Cycle for Broadband Data Improvement Act Implementation In a March 31 Public Notice, the FCC sought comment on requirements for international broadband comparisons and consumer surveys in the Broadband Data Improvement Act ("BDIA"), which was enacted last year. The Commission sought comment on two specific areas: Congress instructed the FCC to examine "relevant similarities and differences in each community" in its analysis of international broadband service capabilities, which include the following criteria: population size, population density, topography, demographics, market structures, number of competitors, number of facilities-based
providers, types of technologies deployed by broadband providers, types of applications and services enabled by broadband, technologies deployed, regulatory models, types of applications and services used by customers, business versus residential use of services, and other media available to consumers. Congress also directed the FCC to make public periodic surveys of consumers in urban, suburban, and rural areas in the large business, small business, and residential consumer markets to determine the types of technology used to provide the broadband service capability to which consumers subscribe; the
amounts consumers pay per month for such capability; the actual data transmission speeds of such capability; the types of applications and services consumers most frequently used in conjunction with such capability; for consumers who have declined to subscribe to broadband service capability, the reasons given by such consumers for declining such capability; and other sources of broadband service capability which consumers regularly use or on which they rely. Comments were due April 10 and replies were due April 17, respectively. Responses to the BDIA Public Notice were slim, with a total of only 14 formal comments and reply comments. As the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors ("NATOA") noted on reply, the BDIA comment cycle overlapped with public comment timeframes for the Recovery Act broadband grants and loans programs. Of the few parties that filed, cable companies (including Comcast, NCTA, and Time Warner Cable) were the most represented sector. Several parties criticized the international data collected and reported by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"). All parties seem to agree that the FCC will require the assistance of expert third parties in order to conduct consumer surveys in sufficient numbers to come up with statistically significant data. Most parties argued that broadband providers already provide ample data through the FCC's
recently enhanced Form 477 reporting. Digital Television Transition Funds NTIA provided to the FCC
$65.7 million from its Recovery Act appropriation for Digital Television ("DTV") transition activities,
including consumer education. The Recovery Act provided about $90 million overall for DTV-related
expenditures. Legislative Developments: Congress's Universal Service Fund Investigation Returns;
Proposed Legislation on Wireless Spam and In-Flight Calling USF Investigation. In early April, House
Page 23 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commerce Committee Chairman Waxman (D.-Cal.) wrote to acting Chairman Michael Copps seeking an update on Congress's prior requests for data on Universal Service Fund ("USF") disbursements. The letter revives a USF investigation began during the last Congressional session. Rep. Waxman indicated that the Commerce Committee is considering USF reform legislation. The FCC must submit data that include an updated list of the top-ten USF recipients in the high-cost program for 2006, 2007, and 2008; a
state-by-state list of total disbursements to the top-ten recipients; an updated list of the ten largest per-line subsidies for each study area; a list of competitive eligible telecommunications carriers and the total support they receive in the study areas from 2006 to 2008; a state-by-state list of total USF high-cost support payments; and a state-by-state list of ETCs and the names of the carriers. The Commission was required to respond to the Waxman letter by April 23. Wireless SPAM. Also in early April, Senators Snowe (R.-Me.) and Nelson (D-Fla.) introduced the m-SPAM Act of 2009, a bill providing heightened authority for the FCC and Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") to regulate unsolicited text messaging, including a prohibition on sending commercial text messages to wireless numbers listed on the Do-Not-Call registry.
In-Flight Call Ban. In mid April, Rep. DeFazio (D.-Or.) added language buried in the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") reauthorization bill that would prohibit telephone calls over mobile devices by passengers on all U.S. domestic commercial flights. The bill must clear the Ways and Means Committee before going to the House floor for a vote. The ban would include not only conventional wireless calls over cell towers, but would also cover Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls made using Wi-Fi Internet access being installed by a number of U.S. airlines. Flight crews, flight attendants, and federal law enforcement officers acting in an official capacity would not be subject to the ban. DTV Coverage Bill: Senators Snowe and Collins, both Maine Republicans, introduced the DTV Cliff Effect Assistance Act on April 27, a bill to allocate new funding for DTV translators that will help boost coverage of digital signals. The proposed bill would provide $125 million for local governments to build digital translators that expand signal coverage to "dead spots." The funds would come from NTIA's Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. Digital translators are needed because some viewers who have always been able to receive a local station's analog signal are not able to receive the new digital signals. Digital broadcasts are more easily degraded when they pass through land masses and tall structures. White House
Memorandum Addresses Communications with Lobbyists On March 20, the White House issued a Memorandum for Ensuring Responsible Spending of the Recovery Act Funds. The Memorandum prohibits executive departments or agencies to consider the views of registered lobbyists concerning particular projects, applications, or applicants for funding under the Recovery Act unless those views are in writing. If an executive department or agency official communicates orally with a lobbyist on general Recovery Act policy issues, as opposed to particular projects, applications, or applicants, the official must document in writing: (1) the date and time of the contact; (2) the names of the registered lobbyists and officials among whom contacts took place; and (3) a short description of the substance of the communication. The FCC has posted, on its website, required written lobbyist submissions and staff summaries, along with links to
ex parte presentations related to lobbyists' communications. FCC Release NPRM to Promote Rural Radio Stations On April 20, 2009, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") opening a proceeding to consider rule changes affecting rural and tribal land radio broadcast licenses to ensure that such licenses are awarded in a fairer and more transparent manner. The NPRM seeks comment on procedures currently used to award commercial broadcast spectrum in the AM and FM broadcast bands. The NPRM suggests rule changes that would impose restrictions on stations to make it more difficult to leave less populated markets and would give licensing priority to new stations planning to serve such markets. Among other proposals, stations would not be able to change their town of license if the market would be left without at least one "reception service." Comments will be due 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, and replies will be due 30 days later. Recent Enforcement Activity Covers a Wide Range of Violations Since the last Bulletin, the FCC's enforcement activity has covered a wide range of alleged violations.  Intel Corp. Consent Decree On March 27, 2009, the Spectrum Enforcement Division of the Enforcement Bureau ("Bureau") released an order adopting a consent decree with  Intel Corp. settling
an investigation of Intel's compliance with the regulations governing possible interference caused by radio frequency devices. Intel voluntarily disclosed to the Bureau last year that it had discovered that it had marketed certain equipment not meeting the FCC's technical, administrative, and labeling requirements, and that it had undertaken corrective action. It also disclosed that it had recently discovered compliance issues regarding equipment marketed by a medical device company it acquired last year.  Intel reported
the matter to the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and worked with the FDA on a recall plan and instructions for healthcare providers for units already deployed. In order to settle the investigation,  Intel agreed to implement a two-year compliance plan supervised by a designated compliance official, under which Intel would establish and periodically review compliance procedures and file periodic certified compliance reports.  Intel also agreed to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Treasury of $25,000. Omniat International Telecom NAL On March 31, 2009, the FCC released a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Order ("NAL") against Omniat International Telecom, LLC d/b/a OMNIAT Telecom, for violating multiple FCC reporting, contribution, and regulatory fee obligations. In 2007, the Universal
Service Administrative Company ("USAC"), which administers the universal service fund and various telephone numbering administration programs, received an anonymous tip that Omniat had not filed its Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets ("TRWs"), upon which carriers' USF contribution obligations are based, or paid its USF contribution obligations, for the last five to ten years. Omniat ignored USAC's
Page 24 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
follow-up inquiry as well as the Bureau's letter of inquiry ("LOI") after USAC referred the matter to the Bureau. The NAL alleges that, for the past several years, Omniat apparently has been providing international service without a Section 214 authorization, has failed to file required TRWs, has failed to pay USF contribution obligations, regulatory fees and telecommunications relay service ("TRS") and
numbering administration contributions, and has also failed to respond to a Bureau directive to provide information. In the case of the failure to file TRWs, the FCC calculated a proposed forfeiture for only one year prior to the date of the NAL, consistent with its prior practice. In the case of Omniat's failure to make TRS and numbering administration contributions and regulatory payments, however, the FCC proposed a forfeiture based on the four-year period from 2005 to 2008. In calculating a proposed forfeiture for
Omniat's failure to respond to the LOI, the FCC noted that Omniat's "[m]isconduct" "warrants a substantial increase" to the base forfeiture of $3,000 for failure to file required forms and $4,000 for failure to respond to an FCC communication. Accordingly, the FCC proposed a forfeiture of $20,000 for failing to respond to the LOI, for a total proposed forfeiture of $330,000. The FCC also ordered Omniat, within 30 days, to submit a Section 214 authorization application, all TRWs that should have been filed to date, and a report supported by a sworn statement setting forth its plan to come into compliance with all of the obligations discussed in the NAL, and to respond fully to the LOI. The Omniat NAL is further confirmation of the importance of responding to USAC and FCC requests and keeping current on all FCC obligations. Hawking Technologies, Inc. Forfeiture Order On March 31, the FCC released a Forfeiture Order against Hawking Technologies, Inc., for its marketing of radio frequency power amplifiers in a manner inconsistent with its equipment authorization and FCC regulations. Because Hawking never responded to the FCC's
NAL alleging these violations, there was no discussion of the issues in the Forfeiture Order, which requires Hawking to pay a $50,000 penalty. Hughes Communications, Inc. Consent Decree Also on March 31, the Bureau's Investigations and Hearings Division released an order adopting a consent decree with Hughes Communications, Inc. terminating an investigation of the possible unauthorized transfer of control of
various licenses and authorizations held directly and indirectly by Hughes, in violation of Section 310(d) of the Act. In July 2007, as part of a multi-step transaction, control of Hughes and its indirectly held subsidiaries, which controlled 17 non-common carrier earth station licenses and four Experimental Radio Service authorizations, was transferred to BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. One week later, Hughes discovered that no application for FCC approval had been filed in connection with the transaction and disclosed this lapse to the FCC. Hughes and its indirectly held subsidiaries filed applications requesting approval of the license and authorization transfers, which were granted in 2008. In response to a Bureau LOI, Hughes provided information about the unauthorized transfer and requested the Bureau to resolve the matter with a consent decree. In the consent decree, Hughes agreed to develop an internal compliance plan regarding the assignment and transfer of FCC licenses and authorizations, including a training program for employees involved in transactions affecting assets subject to FCC regulation, coordination with all parent companies to ensure that Hughes management is involved in any transaction contemplating a change in control of Hughes companies, and an annual report to the Bureau verifying Hughes' compliance with the consent order. The compliance plan is to be in operation for two years. Hughes also agreed to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Treasury of $12,000. WorldNet, L.L.C. NAL On April 3, the Bureau's Spectrum Enforcement Division ("Division") released an NAL against WorldNet, L.L.C., for its failure to respond to an LOI from the Division. The LOI addressed WorldNet's compliance with the network outage reporting requirements. Although the base forfeiture for failure to respond to FCC communications is $4,000, the Division found that a significant increase was warranted in these circumstances. The Division stated that WorldNet's "[m]isconduct . . . exhibits contempt for the [FCC's] authority and threatens to compromise the [FCC's] ability to adequately investigate violations of its rules." The Division accordingly proposed a forfeiture of $20,000 and directed WorldNet to respond fully to the original LOI or face additional liability for further penalties. Hauppauge Computer Works, Inc. NAL On April 15, 2009, the FCC released an NAL against Hauppauge Computer Works, Inc. for its apparent interstate shipment of television-receiving devices that do not have the capability to receive DTV signals, in violation of the FCC's DTV reception capability requirement. In 2007, the Bureau received a complaint that Hauppauge was marketing TV broadcast receivers without associated viewing screens, to be used with personal computers, that were capable of receiving only analog broadcast signals. In response to a Bureau LOI, Hauppauge admitted
that it imports and sells TV boards for personal computers that include only an analog TV tuner, but
argued that such products should not be covered by the DTV tuner rules because they are not stand-alone
TV receivers with associated viewing screens and are designed to be used with personal computer
systems that may not have the capability to support DTV reception. The Bureau issued a follow-up LOI to
Hauppauge, notifying it that its response to the LOI was insufficient and directing it to respond fully to the
LOI. When Hauppauge failed to respond within the allotted time, the Division issued an NAL proposing an
$11,000 forfeiture for failing to respond to the LOI. Hauppauge has since paid that  fine and further
responded that it shipped seven models of analog-only TV tuner boards designed to be installed in
personal computers. The NAL rejected Hauppauge's contention that its products are not covered by the
DTV tuner rules, noting that those rules cover any device "designed to receive television pictures that are
broadcast simultaneously with sound" on over-the-air television channels. The listing of the types of
products covered by the regulations are intended only as examples of any "similar device" that includes
"the capability to receive TV programming" and are not exhaustive. In calculating a proposed forfeiture
amount, the FCC applied a per-model forfeiture of $25,000, based on proposed forfeitures in other
Page 25 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DTV-related equipment orders. The FCC did not, however, increase the proposed forfeiture based on the number of units shipped, as it does in the case of non-compliant stand-alone TV receivers, because receivers intended to be used with personal computers are not as likely as stand-alone TVs to be used as the customer's primary TV viewing device. Applying the per-model forfeiture amount of $25,000 to seven tuner models, the FCC proposed a total forfeiture of $175,000. Tip Box The FCC issued new fee filing guides for each of its bureaus. The new fees are effective on April 28, 2009. Links to the guides can be found at the Commission's Application Processing Fees website:  http://www.fcc.gov/fees/appfees.html . Wireless Developments DC Circuit Rejects Challenge to Designated Entity Rules A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected one of Council Tree Communications, Inc.'s ("Council Tree") pending challenges to the revised designated entity ("DE") rules the FCC adopted in 2006. The panel issued a two-page order, even before holding oral arguments, concluding that the appeal was not filed in a timely manner and that, therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction to consider it. Council Tree had technically appealed a 2007 FCC order applying the DE rules to the 700 MHz band auction. The court, however, found that the FCC had not reopened the DE issue in
2007 and, therefore, could not be challenged. A challenge to the DE rules brought by Council Tree, along with Bethel Native Corporation and the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council is still pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit case concerns the FCC's 2006 decision to apply the then new DE rules to the advanced wireless service auction. The Third Circuit is expected to schedule oral arguments soon. Four Largest U.S. Wireless Carriers Agree to Mobile Marketing "Best Practices" Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile have agreed to incorporate the Mobile Marketing Association's ("MMA") "best practices" into each of their mobile marketing guidelines. Each carrier is a member of the MMA. The carriers agreed that they would integrate their existing mobile marketing guidelines into one document, to be maintained by the MMA, that will represent a unified best-practices approach. According to the MMA, the unified guidelines will have five key benefits: (1) promoting a consistent consumer experience, including standardizing key consumer disclosures; (2) enhancing efficiencies of running short code programs; (3) accelerating the time-to-market for mobile campaigns; (4) ensuring monitoring programs and audit results are more consistent; and (5) reducing operational costs across the mobile marketing landscape. The MMA anticipates finalizing the guidelines by the end of June. FCC Revises Its 4.9 GHz Rules to Assist Public Safety Users The FCC issued a report and order ("R&O") and further notice of proposed rulemaking ("FNPRM") regarding the modification of its 4.9 GHz band rules to enhance public safety's use of broadband services in the band. Among other things, the new rules should make it easier for public safety entities to share time-sensitive data and streaming video. Specifically, the new rules adopted in the R&O grant primary status to: (1) 4.9 GHz stand-alone,
permanent fixed links that are used to deliver broadband service (such as a fixed video surveillance link used to monitor high-risk facilities or environments), and (2) permanent fixed links that connect 4.9 GHz base and mobile stations used to deliver broadband service (for such uses as supporting broadband communications at "hot-spots" and other fixed public safety broadband networks), as well as connect other public safety networks using spectrum designated for broadband use. In addition, the R&O retained
site-based licensing procedures for permanent fixed stations and revised the procedures for measuring output power to conform with the procedures for digital modulation devices. The FNPRM seeks comment on whether the FCC should reinstate a rule exempting 4.9 GHz band applications from certified frequency coordination requirements and other frequency coordination issues, as well as other technical proposals. Comments and replies on the FNPRM are due 60 and 90 days, respectively, after the FNPRM is published in the Federal Register. FCC Initiates High Cost USF Inquiry Following the 2005 "Qwest II" Remand The FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry ("NOI") to refresh the record on certain issues concerning the universal service high cost support mechanism that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit raised in its 2005
Qwest II remand. The Tenth Circuit had concluded in Qwest II that the FCC's rules regarding high cost support in non-rural areas were unlawful. The NOI could lead to wide-ranging modifications to the high cost support mechanism. The FCC stated its intent to release a final order by April 17, 2010. The NOI seeks comment on several high cost reform proposals that were previously submitted by Qwest Communications, Embarq Corporation, CostQuest Associates, and the Vermont Public Service Board as well as the Maine Public Utilities Commission. Qwest urges the FCC to target high cost support to the highest cost wire centers served by non-rural incumbent carriers and reduce the current non-rural high cost support benchmark. Embarq proposes that the FCC replace all non-rural high cost support in study areas subject to price cap regulation with a new support mechanism called "Broadband and
Carrier-of-Last Resort Support," which would be available in each area to the incumbent and one competitor. Embarq's plan would allocate to $1 billion annually, conditioned on recipients making broadband seervices available to at least 85 percent of consumers in a wire center. CostQuest suggests a new cost model by which all high cost support mechanisms would be funded. The Vermont and Maine regulators propose that the FCC "use 'net subscriber cost' as a proxy for rates in its reasonable comparability rate standard and in its support calculation." Vermont and Maine also support reducing the current non-rural high cost support benchmark. The NOI also asks commenters to address the definitions of "reasonably comparable" rates to satisfy Section 254 of the Communications Act, which requires the
FCC to ensure consumers in high cost areas have rates that are reasonably comparable to those available in urban areas. The NOI further asks how to define "sufficient" under Section 254's requirement that the FCC establish "specific, predictable and sufficient" support universal service support mechanisms. In
Page 26 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
addition, the NOI seeks comment on if and how its efforts to reform the high cost support mechanism may affect the government's broadband development and deployment plans. Comments and replies are due May 8 and June 8, respectively. Alabama and Tennessee Closer to Deregulating Basic Telephone Services A bill (SB 373) deregulating telephone services in Alabama is close to approval by the state legislature. AT&T, Inc., the largest telephone company in the state, has been lobbying strongly for the bill. Under the legislation, as of December 31, 2010, the Alabama Public Service Commission would no longer have oversight over basic residential telephone service and business services with four or fewer landline phones. In short, the bill would put traditional landline telephone services on the same regulatory footing
as mobile and voice-over-Internet-protocol services. The Alabama Senate approved the bill 19-8, and the House Government Operations Committee approved the bill 8-1. The full House must now vote on the bill. The legislature in Tennessee is facing similar pressure from AT&T to deregulate basic telephone services. The state senate passed a bill (SB 1954) 22-7 to deregulate services and will be considered next by the House Commerce Committee. To respond to rural concerns, the bill includes an amendment preventing AT&T from raising rates in most rural areas for one year. Thereafter, AT&T could only increase rates in those areas if the Tennessee Regulatory Authority makes a finding of sufficient  competition. Without such a finding, pricing flexibility in those areas would be delayed until no later than 2015. Orbital Collision Prompts U.S. Military to Track More Spacecraft The United States Air Force announced that the government will begin tracking all 800 maneuverable satellites and other spacecraft following a collision in February between a satellite owned by Iridium Satellite LLC and a defunct Russian military satellite. Currently, the government tracks approximately 300 spacecraft. The additional tracking measures should be implemented by October 1, 2009. According to government officials, the U.S. government will have to enter into legal arrangements with satellite companies to obtain expanded tracking data, but the exact
form and scope of the arrangements has not yet been determined. The Air Force is also examining the possibility of tracking 500 other non-maneuverable satellites. U.S. Eases Restrictions on Telecom Services to Cuba In mid-April, 2009, President Obama issued a press release outlining plans to ease existing restrictions on commerce and travel between the U.S. and Cuba. In particular, President Obama directed the Executive Branch agencies to begin authorizing U.S. companies to provide telephone, cable, and satellite services to and from Cuba. Among other things, this initiative hopes to encourage the establishment of fiber-optic cable and satellite links to Cuba, roaming agreements between U.S. and Cuban wireless companies, and the provision of satellite radio and television services to customers in Cuba. Cuba's response to this new policy, however, remains uncertain. If Cuba is not open to U.S. investment in its telecom infrastructure, the new policy might only result in direct exchange of traffic with Cuba's existing  monopoly (government-owned) telecom provider. If Cuba does open itself to foreign investment, Cuba's very low penetration rates for landline, wireless and Internet services could create
opportunities for U.S. companies. Free Press Urges Application of Internet Policy Statement to Wireless In a recent letter, Free Press urged the FCC to confirm that the Commission's Internet Policy Statement applies to wireless networks. Free Press alleged some instances of restrictions imposed by wireless carriers on certain applications, services or devices, and also raised concerns about relationships between carriers and equipment vendors that appear to hinder customer choice. In one example, Free Press noted reports that the Skype iPhone application works over Wi-Fi networks, but not over AT&T's 3G network. Free Press therefore asked the FCC to resolve any ambiguity regarding the application of the Internet Policy Statement to wireless providers that offer broadband Internet access service. In addition, Free
Press urged the FCC to request more information regarding such restrictions and the wireless providers' roles and justifications for such restrictions, and to investigate whether these practices violate the Internet Policy Statement.

BRUSSELS, May 7 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to rule next week that the world's largest chipmaker,  Intel Corp , breached antitrust rules and will fine it and order changes to how it provides rebates, sources said on Thursday.
Sources familiar with the case told Reuters the Commission was expected to make its decision on May
13 during the EU executive's weekly meeting, based on a recommendation by  Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"The Commission has an ongoing  antitrust case against Intel. I cannot comment on the timing of the decision," spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

Intel shares were down 3.9 percent to $15.51 by 1742 GMT, underperforming a 1.4 percent lower Dow
Jones industrial average <.DJI>.

"We are not part of that (European Commission) decision making process. Those reports are speculative and therefore we will not comment," Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said.

The EU executive charged  Intel in 2007 of giving illegal rebates to computer makers to limit their use of chips made by smaller rival AMD or avoid them completely.

In July last year, it filed additional charges against  Intel, saying it paid retailers not to sell PCs using AMD chips.  Intel has said repeatedly it has not done anything wrong. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and David Lawsky; Editing by Bate Felix; editing by Simon Jessop)

(Adds detail, background)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission will Wednesday fine the world's biggest computer chip maker,  Intel Corp. (INTC), for breaking European antitrust rules, said people familiar with the matter Friday.

TD
The commission will also tell  Intel to make changes to the way it provides rebates to computer manufacturers, the people said.
The commission officials have spent most of Friday discussing the  Intel fine with national
competition authorities, which according to E.U. procedure also have a say on the matter, the people
familiar with the case said.

They added that once all the stakeholders have had their say on the  fine, the final document will be presented to the college of commissioners Wednesday, which is then likely to adopt it.

An Intel spokesman declined to comment, only saying that at this point a pending decision still represents just rumors and speculation. A commission spokesman also declined to comment.

Intel's trouble with the commission dates from 2000, when rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD), of Sunnyvale, Calif. filed a complaint saying  Intel was blocking its access to the market.

In 2007, the E.U. sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging that  Intel kept AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer manufacturers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down and by selling chips below cost to thwart AMD from swooping on key accounts.

Last year, the E.U. added more charges, alleging that  Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

The commission's Wednesday decision is said to be extremely complex and lengthy, in order to safeguard the  antitrust enforcer against any possible legal challenges from  Intel, which is likely facing one of the highest  fines in Europe's  antitrust history, Brussels-based lawyers say.

The E.U.'s  competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, can under the commission's rules  fine Intel up to 10% of its annual revenue, which in 2008 was almost $38 billion.

Last year, the commission issued a record $1.16-billion  fine against Microsoft Corp. for non-compliance in the E.U.'s long-running  antitrust fight with the software giant.

HD           Chipmaker  Intel faces fine of up to &euro;1bn if found guilty  of trying  to alienate competition

LP
THE countryâs largest microchip maker,  Intel is facing massive fines of up to &euro;1 billion for allegedly trying to put its competitors out of business.

Intel Ireland employs over 5,500 people directly and indirectly at Leixlip, which is its largest manufacturing plant outside the US, and has over 80% of the world market for CPU computer chips.

TD
The European Commission has said that  Intel was trying to unfairly kill off  competition from AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) by offering rebates in exchange for using  Intel-only products, by selling at below-cost to strategic customers such as governments when bidding against AMD, and making payments to delay or cancel products using AMD chips.

About four years ago  competition officials from the  European Commission raided Intel offices in a number of European locations, though not in Ireland, and have been building a case against the US company.

Now competition commissioner Neelie Kroes is expected to bring her proposals to the weekly meeting of commissioners on Wednesday.

Charlie McCreevy, commissioner for the internal market, is expected to argue against massive  fines, pointing out that  Intel is a good employer in Ireland.

However, the German Commissioner Gunter Verhoygen, who is in charge of enterprise and industry, is expected to speak against  Intel as their main rival, AMD, is German based.
Ms Kroesâ cabinet, headed up by Irish lawyer Anthony Whelan, is likely to decide the size of the  fine
on Wednesday evening.

The commission said Intelâs abusive behaviour began in 2003 and continued for about three years. During that time AMD took market share from  Intel when their new generation of microprocessors outperformed  Intelâs chips.

Intel has said that its behaviour has been lawful, good for  competition and has benefited customers.

Microsoft was  fined around $500 million four years ago for unfair practices but the rules on  fines have changed since and the size can now be calculated on the size of the market affected, the duration of the offence and how severe its actions were on the  competition.
In this instance it looks likely that the commission will go for a significant sum like &euro;1bn. A look at
Intelâs balance sheet shows that it made a net profit of $647m for the first quarter this year and has
$14bn in cash.

AMSTERDAM, May 10 (Reuters) - EU  antitrust regulators are expected to say this week that  Intel Corp illegally paid computer makers to postpone or cancel the launch of products containing chips made by its main rival, sources familiar with the case said on Sunday.

The European Commission is set to decide on Wednesday to  fine the world's largest chipmaker and order changes to its business practices for what the EU executive sees as "naked restrictions" to competition, the sources said.

There was no indication of how big a  fine might be levied. The largest  fine levied by the EC for an abuse of market dominance was the 497 million euros ($655 million) demanded from Microsoft on March 24, 2004.

The sources said the Brussels-based Commission is expected to rule that  Intel committed two violations in which the firm abused its dominance of the market for central processing units, the chips at the heart of the world's 1 billion personal computers.

The EU executive will say  Intel gave rebates to computer makers to restrict or eliminate the use of chips made by its rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and provided other inducements to retailers to sell only machines with  Intel CPUs.

In its ruling the Commission will order  Intel to end by a specific date those rebates which it deems to be illegal, the sources said.

In its second finding, the Commission will say  Intel paid PC makers to delay or scrap the launch of products containing AMD chips. The Commission will characterise the payments as "naked restrictions" to  competition, the sources said.

The Commission will state that the violations occurred during a period stretching back eight years, they said.

In committing the first violation,  Intel set percentages of its own chips that it wanted PC makers to use, the sources said.
For example, NEC Corp was told that 20 percent of its desktop and notebook machines could have
AMD chips, the sources said.

All Lenovo notebooks had to use  Intel chips, as did relevant Dell products. The figure was 95 percent for Hewlett-Packard's business desktops, they said.

European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the commission had no comment.  Intel
spokesman Chuck Mulloy, speaking by telephone from California also declined to comment.

HD     EU antitrust ruling  against Intel due on Wednesday

The European Commission is expected to make one of the most significant antitrust decisions in its history on Wednesday when it punishes computer chip-maker  Intel for stifling competition from smaller rivals.

The official line is that the case is still ongoing, but one person close to the  competition department said on condition of anonymity on Friday that the 27 commissioners will conclude the case, which has been under investigation since 2000, at their next weekly meeting on Wednesday.

TD
Intel is the latest giant from the IT industry to be slapped down by Europe's top  competition regulator. Like Microsoft five years ago and IBM in the 1980s,  Intel claims it is simply doing what any company would, only better.

While IBM settled with the regulator, agreeing to change the way it competed in the market for mainframe computers, Microsoft and  Intel have stuck to their guns. The two have applied similar strategies to dealing with the pesky authorities based in Brussels.

Consequently Microsoft was  fined $663.4 million for abusing its dominant position in the software market, plus an additional  fine for failing to respect the  antitrust ruling.

Intel faces a fine of a similar order of magnitude for illegally handing out rebates to computer manufacturers in return for them buying the bulk of their x86 computer processing chips (CPUs) from Intel, the Commission is expected to say next week.

The company also stands accused of paying computer makers for scrapping or delaying the launch of machines fitted with chips made by its nearest rival AMD, and of selling its chips for server computers at below cost to large customers such as governments and universities.

Last year the Commission added fresh charges, accusing the chip giant of paying generous rebates to Media Markt, Europe's biggest chain of IT stores, in return for it de-listing all computers running AMD chips.

Intel dominates the personal-computer chip market by a mile. At the end of last year its market share stood at 81.9%, while AMD held 17.7%, according to IDC.

Technically, the Commission can fine a company up to 10% of its global sales the year before a monopoly abuse ruling. Last year Intel generated revenues of $37.6 billion, which means the ceiling for a fine would be $3.76 billion. But the regulator has never applied a maximum  fine to date.

The company has not been informed that a ruling is due next week. "We haven't heard anything officially, just rumors mostly coming from journalists," said  Intel spokesman Robert Manetta.

And he repeated the company's standard line that its conduct is lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers.

Europe isn't the only region where Intel has run into trouble with antitrust authorities. In 2005 the company settled with Japan's competition office. Last year it was fined nearly $20 million in South Korea. Meanwhile, the company is under investigation in the U.S. by the Federal Trade Commission.

HD        Intel braced for competition fine

Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, is bracing itself this week for one of the heaviest penalties ever levied in Europe for anti-competitive behaviour.

The European Union is expected to decide to take action against  Intel at a weekly meeting of commissioners on Wednesday - the climax of a decade-long investigation into the company's marketing practices.

TD
Some lawyers suggest that the record penalties heaped on Microsoft, which combined have topped the
â¬1bn mark during the course of its long battle with Brussels, could be approached or even exceeded,
although others are more cautious.

While the size of the  fine may dominate the headlines, many say the  European Commission's ability to order corrective measures could be more damaging to  Intel in the long run, forcing it to change the way
it does business.

Intel has consistently denied behaving illegally. "Our business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and good for consumers," it maintains.

In choosing how to enforce a "cease and desist" order, the EU regulator will have to confront the complex web of incentives and rebates offered by  Intel to customers that have helped it dominate the market for PC microprocessors.

The Intel investigation dates back to 2000, when its closest rival Advanced Micro Devices filed a complaint that it was being driven out of the market by  Intel's practices . But it only gathered steam some four years later, when officials requested fresh information from the chipmaker and other market players.
A year after that, commission officials carried out a series of raids to get more information, and, in July
2007, the chipmaker was formally charged with abusing its dominant market position and offering illegal
rebates to computer manufacturers, which allegedly shut AMD out of the market.

The complaint was then bolstered last year when, after more raids, the commission also accused the company of using rebates to persuade a leading European retailer to sell only  Intel-based personal computers.
In theory, if the commission's final decision does go against the company, the  fine could be as much as
10 per cent of  Intel's annual worldwide revenues.
These totalled $37.6bn in 2008, meaning the maximum level could approach $4bn.

But that 10 per cent level is rarely reached, with commission guidelines now trying to tie  fines much more closely to the scale of sales affected by the anti-competitive conduct and the length of time the offences persisted.

However, the betting is still on a heavy penalty, given the charges cover several years' behaviour in a very large market and competition officials' insistence that  fines need to both "deter and punish".


Page 45 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel, which has maintained a market share of around 80 per cent in sales of computer microprocessors worldwide, would have no problems finding the money - it had $10.3bn on hand in cash and securities at the end of the first quarter.

What will concern it more is any change to long-established business practices forced on it by a "cease and desist" order. Just how that might be structured by the commission is the subject of much debate in Brussels' legal circles - with views varying on how much detail theregulator will seek to lay out, and whether it might deploy a "monitoring trustee" to oversee compliance. This structure was used, but not to huge applause, in the Microsoft case.

Intel, for its part, refuses to discuss whether it would try to appeal an adverse decision. To date, its response to other regulators' action has varied: Japan's Fair Trade Commission ruled in 2005 that it had abused its monopoly power and the company accepted a "cease and desist" order but did not accept guilt or pay a fine.

Then in June last year, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission  fined Intel Won26bn for abusing its dominant market position in that country and offering discounts to two Korean PC makers in an attempt to drive AMD out of the market. This decision is under appeal.

But its response to any adverse finding could be heavily shaped by developments back in its home country. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission launched a formal  antitrust investigation, following a similar move by the New York attorney-general. And the company also faces a civil damages case brought by AMD in the Delaware courts, which is due to go to trial next year - not to mention a number of class-action lawsuits.

HD     Tech firms could see fallout  from antitrust shift

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - If the Obama administration is serious about more aggressively responding to antitrust complaints, some of technology's biggest companies could have to rethink their business strategies or expansion plans.

The administration said Monday it has abandoned Bush-era policies that it criticized as too friendly to companies that dominate their markets. The Justice Department didn't call out any companies by name, and its shift in approach will affect all industries. But it raises the stakes for tech heavyweights whose practices have been questioned elsewhere more than in the United States.

TD
For instance,  Intel Corp. could face a steep  fine in Europe this week over its behavior in the microprocessor industry. An IBM Corp. competitor is accusing the company in Europe of manipulating the market for mainframe computers. Microsoft Corp. -- a marquee  antitrust defendant during the Clinton administration -- has been battling other charges in Europe in this decade as well.

Tougher antitrust enforcement could also focus on Google Inc., whose leading market shares in online search and advertising markets were already drawing scrutiny in the waning days of the Bush administration.

It remains to be seen whether the Justice Department's different approach will lead to more court cases or more challenges to proposed business deals. But  antitrust lawyers say a more aggressive antitrust philosophy likely would make the Obama administration resemble the Clinton years far more than the
Bush years.

"This is back to the future," said Stephen Bomse, partner in the  antitrust group of the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm.

Under Clinton, the Justice Department brought 12 anti-monopoly cases that didn't involve mergers or acquisitions. That included the long-running case against Microsoft in which a judge at one point ordered Microsoft split into two. (The case eventually was settled with the Bush administration, though it lives on: The Justice Department recently extended its oversight of Microsoft's compliance with the settlement for another 18 months, into 2011).

Under Bush, the department brought three anti-monopoly cases, but none outside of mergers and acquisitions. The targets in those cases were Chicago-based industrial component supplier Amsted Industries Inc., newspaper publishers Daily Gazette Co. and MediaNews Group Inc., and chip maker Microsemi Corp.

Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission from 1995 until 2001 and now an attorney with the Arnold & Porter law firm, said he doesn't think the U.S. will entirely match Europe's zeal for antitrust cases.

One reason is that the U.S. is still more likely to have a free-market bent than Europe, he said. And it can be tricky to regulate technology from an  antitrust perspective. Technological innovations can create

Page 47 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
monopolists very quickly by cornering or creating specific parts of a market. If regulators are too aggressive, they run the risk of stifling innovation.

"The vast majority of activity in Silicon Valley is innovation, trying to make a better product -- that was not viewed as anticompetitive under Bush or Clinton," said Jonathan Jacobson, a partner in the  antitrust practice at the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati law firm. "Technological innovation is supposed to keep you out of trouble."

But the standard that tech companies are judged by -- whether they are engaging in "exclusionary" or "predatory" conduct against competitors -- is the same as everyone else. Viewed through that lens, tech companies can be at a disadvantage because they grow so fast and can get on regulators' radars much more quickly.

Already fears of a tougher  antitrust regime under Obama might have played out in Silicon Valley. When IBM was discussing a proposed $7 billion takeover of rival Sun Microsystems Inc. this spring, Sun sought detailed assurances that IBM would see the deal through an  antitrust review. When the talks collapsed, Sun ended up agreeing to be acquired by Oracle Corp., a company with less overlap with Sun, meaning the deal is perceived as less likely to generate  antitrust questions.

Intel's antitrust challenges arose from complaints by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. According to AMD,  Intel boxed AMD out of certain accounts by paying computer makers and retailers to avoid AMD's products. AMD claims that  Intel would drop this hammer when AMD's market share would get too big.

Intel, which owns about 80 percent of the worldwide PC microprocessor market, argues that the rebates it offered were legal, and are a common way to reward buying in very high volumes.

European regulators don't buy  Intel's argument. They have charged  Intel with engaging in a coordinated strategy to limit AMD's reach, including by selling server chips below the cost of making them. The European Commission is expected to formally  fine Intel this week. The  fines can be up to 10 percent of a company's annual revenue, and in 2008,  Intel had $37.6 billion in worldwide sales.

The U.S. initially stayed on the sidelines while  Intel and AMD began duking it out overseas in 2003. Last year U.S. regulators stepped up their inquiries, with the Federal Trade Commission opening a formal probe into Intel's sales tactics. The FTC's two-year investigation had been considered "informal" until that point. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has not taken action.

EU antitrust regulators are expected to find Intel guilty of anti-competitive practices by offering discounts to computer manufacturers for using Intel chips as well as encouraging them not to use hardware from rival AMD.

The European Commission has been investigating the chip giant since the year 2000 for illegally paying off manufacturers to postpone and, in some cases, even cancel the launch of products made with its rivalâs chips.

TD
Now sources familiar with the case told Reuters

that regulators are expected to announce on May 13th that  Intel Corp has been found guilty and will be slapped with a fine for violating  antitrust policies.

Intel is said to have offered rebates to computer makers to restrict or do away with the use of AMD chips and provided retailers with incentives to sell only machines with  Intel CPUs. In its upcoming ruling, the Commission will order the company to end those rebates, which it deems to be illegal, by a specific date.

As an example, sources said that NEC Corp was told only 20% of its desktop and notebook products could have AMD chips. Additionally, all Lenovo notebooks and about 95% of all Hewlett-Packard's business had to use only chips from  Intel.

The highest  fine ever levied by the EU for such behaviour was the 2004 ruling against Microsoft, where the tech giant was  fined $655 million

after being found guilty of abusing its market dominance. Many predict that  Intel will be hit with a much higher fine with speculation that it could exceed $1 billion.

HD      EU to rule in Intel antitrust case on Wednesday:  source

The European Commission is to rule Wednesday on whether US computer chip giant  Intel has abused its market power to crush rivals unfairly, a source close to the matter said.
A commission spokesman declined to comment on the matter on Monday.

TD
If found guilty of trying to thwart competitors illegally, the Santa Clara, California-based company could face fines running of 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue, which stood at 37.6 billion dollars (51 billion dollars) in 2008.
The Financial Times newspaper reported Monday that the fine could top the record penalties that
Brussels has slapped on Microsoft in its long-running antitrust battle with the US software giant.

The commission originally  finedMicrosoft 497 million euros (674 million dollars) for abusing its dominating grip on the market for personal computer operating systems.

However, five years of legal battles and an unsuccessful appeal later, the  fines have reached 1.676 billion euros, although Microsoft has appealed against part of the sum.

The European Commission filed antitrust charges against Intel in July 2007 accusing the company of offering "substantial" rebates to computer makers that mostly used its chips.
In July 2008, it lodged a fresh complaint, charging  Intel of offering discounts to a major European
personal computer distributor to favour its products, paid a PC maker to delay marketing a model line with
a rival's chips, and also paid it to use  Intel's own microprocessors in preference.

Intel's chief competitor Advanced Micro Devices has long accused Intel of using its grip on the market for microchips -- the brains of personal computers -- to choke off competition.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Wednesday will  fine the world's biggest computer-chip maker, Intel Corp., for breaking European antitrust rules, people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, will also tell  Intel to make changes to the way it provides rebates to computer makers, the people said.

TD
Commission officials spent most of Friday discussing the  Intel fine with national  competition authorities, which according to EU procedure also have a say on the matter, the people familiar with the case said.

They added that once all the stakeholders have had their say on the  fine, the final document will be presented to the college of commissioners Wednesday, which is then likely to adopt it.

An Intel spokesman declined to comment, except to say that word of the pending decision amounts to rumors and speculation. A commission spokesman declined to comment.

Intel's trouble with the commission dates from 2000, when chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., filed a complaint saying Intel was blocking its access to the market. In 2007, the EU sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging Intel kept AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer makers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down and by selling chips below cost to thwart AMD from swooping on key accounts. Last year, the EU added more charges, alleging  Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

The commission's decision set for Wednesday is said to be extremely complex and lengthy, in order to safeguard the antitrust enforcer against any possible legal challenges from  Intel, which is likely facing one of the highest fines in Europe's  antitrust history, according to Brussels-based lawyers.
EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes can, under commission's rules,  fine Intel as much as
10% of its annual revenue, which in 2008 was almost $38 billion. Last year, the commission issued a
record $1.16 billion  fine against Microsoft Corp. for noncompliance in the EU's long-running  antitrust
fight with the software giant.

For a Timeline on the Commission's case against  Intel, click on [ID:nLB111652]

TD
Following are five facts on the rivalry between the two:
MARKET SHARE

Last year Intel made 80.5 percent of the microprocessors that power personal computers, gaining share each quarter, helped by the success of its Atom chip in the emerging netbook sector and by the continued strength of its brands and products in the desktop, notebook and server segments.
AMD had 12 percent of the market.

The firms' combined market share rose last year for the third year in a row to 92.5 percent, compared with 90.9 percent in 2006, according to research firm iSuppli.
RELATIVE SIZE

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, made revenues of $37.6 billion in 2008. It employed 83,900 staff at the end of 2008, more than half in the United States. Its market value is $85.4 billion and it is the world's biggest chip maker.

AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, made revenues of $5.8 billion in 2008. It employs about 11,000 people and has a market value of $2.6 billion.
CASE IN BRUSSELS

The European Commission has already said Intel's pricing practices -- in particular rebates to computer makers and retailers -- were aimed at driving AMD out of the market.

In two formal charge sheets laid out in July 2007 and July 2008, the Commission said  Intel gave rebates to computer makers so long as they agreed to obtain most or all of their processor-chips from  Intel and made payments to induce computer makers either to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips.

The U.S. tech group has denied the charges that it was abusing its market dominance, arguing its conduct had been lawful and beneficial to clients and consumers.
CASES ELSEWHERE

In December 2008 Intel filed a formal complaint to overturn an earlier South Korean  antitrust ruling that it had abused its dominant market position. [ID:nSEO42148]

Intel said in a statement its filing to the Seoul High Court asserted that the Korea Fair Trade Commission
(KFTC) made substantial factual and legal errors in formulating its final opinion.
Page 73 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The KFTC said in June 2008 that  Intel offered rebates to South Korean personal computer makers in return for their not buying microprocessors from AMD.  Intel was also fined.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into  Intel after South Korean authorities  fined it for offering rebates in return for not buying AMD products.

The group faces more legal woes as a U.S. lawsuit brought by AMD is set to go to court in 2010.  Intel also faces dozens of separate class actions, filed in various U.S. courts, modelled on the AMD complaint.
U.S. LICENCE BATTLE

In March 2009 Intel accused AMD of breaching the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two, a charge that AMD denied. [ID:nN16422958]

Intel alleged its rival ran foul of a 2001 patent agreement when it created the Globalfoundries joint venture, the $4.3 billion semiconductor manufacturer spun off from AMD. (Compiled by Tarmo Virki, editing by Will Waterman)

TD
The Commission, tasked with ensuring companies do not  abuse any market dominance or make agreements that restrict  competition in the 27-country European Union, is expected to  fine Intel and order a halt to some of the rebates it gives to computer makers.

U.S.-based  Intel's central processing units power four out of five of the world's 1 billion personal computers and servers.
Here are the key events in  Intel's antitrust battle with the Brussels-based Commission.

2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that  Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors.

July 2007 - The Commission accuses  Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws.
January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections". February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at  Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive.
July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers.

October 2008 -  Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission that it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defence.
January 2009 - The court rejects  Intel's appeal.
February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks  Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details.

May 11 (Reuters) - EU  antitrust regulators are expected to say this week that  Intel Corp illegally paid computer makers to postpone or cancel the launch of PCs containing chips made by rival Advanced Micro Devices . [ID:nLA487575]

TD
Following are five facts on the rivalry between the two:
MARKET SHARE

Last year Intel made 80.5 percent of the microprocessors that power personal computers, gaining share each quarter, helped by the success of its Atom chip in the emerging netbook sector and by the continued strength of its brands and products in the desktop, notebook and server segments.
AMD had 12 percent of the market.

The firms' combined market share rose last year for the third year in a row to 92.5 percent, compared with 90.9 percent in 2006, according to research firm iSuppli.
RELATIVE SIZE

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, made revenues of $37.6 billion in 2008. It employed 83,900 staff at the end of 2008, more than half in the United States. Its market value is $85.4 billion and it is the world's biggest chip maker.

AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, made revenues of $5.8 billion in 2008. It employs about 11,000 people and has a market value of $2.6 billion.
CASE IN BRUSSELS

The European Commission has already said Intel's pricing practices -- in particular rebates to computer makers and retailers -- were aimed at driving AMD out of the market.

In two formal charge sheets laid out in July 2007 and July 2008, the Commission said  Intel gave rebates to computer makers so long as they agreed to obtain most or all of their processor-chips from  Intel and made payments to induce computer makers either to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips.

The U.S. tech group has denied the charges that it was abusing its market dominance, arguing its conduct had been lawful and beneficial to clients and consumers.
CASES ELSEWHERE

In December 2008 Intel filed a formal complaint to overturn an earlier South Korean  antitrust ruling that it had abused its dominant market position. [ID:nSEO42148]

Intel said in a statement its filing to the Seoul High Court asserted that the Korea Fair Trade Commission
(KFTC) made substantial factual and legal errors in formulating its final opinion.
Page 77 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The KFTC said in June 2008 that  Intel offered rebates to South Korean personal computer makers in return for their not buying microprocessors from AMD.  Intel was also fined.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into  Intel after South Korean authorities  fined it for offering rebates in return for not buying AMD products.

The group faces more legal woes as a U.S. lawsuit brought by AMD is set to go to court in 2010.  Intel also faces dozens of separate class actions, filed in various U.S. courts, modelled on the AMD complaint.
U.S. LICENCE BATTLE

In March 2009 Intel accused AMD of breaching the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two, a charge that AMD denied. [ID:nN16422958]

Intel alleged its rival ran foul of a 2001 patent agreement when it created the Globalfoundries joint venture, the $4.3 billion semiconductor manufacturer spun off from AMD. (Compiled by Tarmo Virki, editing by Will Waterman)

May 11 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to rule on Wednesday that  Intel , the world's largest microchip maker, illegally paid computer manufacturers to restrict their use of chips made by rival AMD . [ID:nLA487575]

TD
The Commission, tasked with ensuring companies do not  abuse any market dominance or make agreements that restrict  competition in the 27-country European Union, is expected to  fine Intel and order a halt to some of the rebates it gives to computer makers.

U.S.-based  Intel's central processing units power four out of five of the world's 1 billion personal computers and servers.
Here are the key events in  Intel's antitrust battle with the Brussels-based Commission.

2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that  Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors.

July 2007 - The Commission accuses  Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws.
January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections". February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at  Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive.
July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers.

October 2008 -  Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission that it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defence.
January 2009 - The court rejects  Intel's appeal.
February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks  Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details.

The European Commission will fine Intel for breaking European competition rules, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The commission will also tell Intel to make changes to the way it provides rebates to computer makers, the paper's sources said. Commission officials spent most of 8 May discussing the Intel fine with national  competition authorities, which according to EU procedure also
have a say on the matter. Once all the stakeholders have had their say on the  fine, the final document will be presented to the college of commissioners 13 May, which is then likely to adopt it. Spokesmen for  Intel and the EC declined to comment.  Intel's trouble with the commission dates from 2000, when AMD filed a complaint saying Intel was blocking its access to the market.

TD
In 2007, the EU sent preliminary charges to  Intel, alleging Intel kept AMD out of the microprocessor market by paying computer makers rebates to keep their usage of AMD chips down and by selling chips below cost to thwart AMD from swooping on key accounts. Last year, the EU added more charges, alleging Intel paid a major retailer to keep computers that use AMD chips off its shelves.

HD        US signals  tougher  line on dominant firms

US companies will face much more  antitrust scrutiny from the Department of Justice, reversing an eight-year period in which the Bush administration drew back from tackling alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Christine Varney, head of the Department of Justice's  antitrust division, on Monday said she was revoking a Bush administration anti-trust doctrine that advocated "extreme hesitancy in the face of potential abuses by  monopoly firms.

TD
"In a free society government must intervene when  competition is threatened," she said, adding that continuing a minimal approach to tackling monopolistic behaviour was the wrong path, even in a financial crisis.

"It's clear we have a new sheriff in town," said Ed Black, a lawyer and head of the Computer & Communications Industry Association. "There's so much that was left ignored by the last administration, so a main job will be catching up."

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

A former lawyer specialising in the internet, Ms Varney's appointment and apparent willingness to scrutinise large technology companies could concern Google,  Intel, Microsoft and IBM, all of which have faced previous antitrust action.
The European Commission is expected on Wednesday to levy a  fine for anti-competitive behaviour on
Intel, the chipmaker, that could top â¬1bn ($1.36bn, Â£897m).

With complainants focusing on Europe as a more active venue for  antitrust cases, Ms Varney said she would "discourage any company from forum shopping" as the DoJ would now be "co-operating closely" with the Commission.

Lawyers said Ms Varney's change of approach would see more alignment between the US and Europe after eight years in which the Commission continued to attack perceived anti-competitive behaviour with large fines while the Bush administration did not follow suit.
"The EU and US in the 1990s were operating in parallel," said Mr Black. "The US took a detour [under
George W. Bush] whereas the EU has really stayed on the mainline track."

In a speech to the liberal Center for American Progress, Ms Varney said the financial crisis was a reason to step up  antitrust activity not to pull back. She raised the question as to whether companies perceived as "too big to fail", which present risk to the financial system, could have had their growth blocked by antitrust action.
She said her team would examine the use of government stimulus funds to try to prevent fraud.

"In the event that preventive efforts fail, we will be there to investigate and swiftly prosecute individuals and entities responsible for criminal  antitrust violations." Sean Heather, a lawyer at the US Chamber of

Commerce, the largest US business group, said he was against "inappropriate"  antitrust action but saw no reason to believe Ms Varney would pursue a "radical" agenda.

He said the biggest danger in international  antitrust law was European Union and US disagreement opening the door to a "third way" approach from countries such as China, whose developing business law could threaten overseas companies trying to make acquisitions.

While the Bush administration did not pursue companies alleged to have over-extended themselves with vertical integration - buying up parts of their own supply chain - the former Department of Justice did
take a hard line on cartel activity, which was judged to be more clear-cut  abuse of the law.

But in a key report published in September and revoked on Monday by Ms Varney, the administration had said there should be no interference in "the rough and tumble of beneficial  competition."

The US is to take a more interventionist approach to  competition issues, reversing the stance of
George W. Bush's administration and moving closer to the way that European regulators operate.

Ms Varney said her team would examine the use of government stimulus funds to try to prevent fraud. "In the event that preventive efforts fail, we will be there to investigate and swiftly prosecute individuals
and entities responsible for criminal  antitrust violations."

She said there would be no impediment to the DoJ tackling  competition abuses at companies that had received government equity stakes in the wake of the financial crisis. Those direct equity stakes are expected to grow as the government converts preferred equity stakes in banks into common stock.

Although Ms Varney was keen to stress that she saw her appointment as a break with the past she also indicated that there would be no witch-hunt of companies. "We need to be careful not to swing back too far the other way," she said.

Some lawyers said the impact of tougher enforcement from the Department of Justice could be mitigated in court where most complaints about monopolies were brought by private companies rather than the government.

"Since roughly the late 1970s, courts have adopted rules that have appeared to make it difficult for plaintiffs to win their monopolisation claims against dominant firms," said Keith Hylton of the Boston University School of Law.
"That has nothing to do with the Bush people."

While the Bush administration did not pursue companies alleged to have over-extended themselves with vertical integration - buying up their own supply chain - the DoJ did take a hard line on cartel activity, which was judged to be a more clear-cut  abuse of the law.

EU commissioners to approve action

Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker by sales, is bracing itself for one of the heaviest penalties levied in Europe for anti-competitive behaviour. The European Union is expected formally to approve action against Intel at its weekly meeting of commissioners on Wednesday.

TD
It will be the climax of a near-decade-long investigation into the group's marketing practices. Lawyers say the fine could top those heaped on Microsoft, which, combined, exceeded â¬1bn ($1.36bn).

The Intel investigation dates back to 2000, when its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, filed a complaint that it was being driven out of the market by  Intel's practices.
Four years later, the case gathered steam and, after a series of raids,  Intel was formally charged in July
2007. It had allegedly abused its dominant market position and offered illegal rebates to computer
manufacturers, which had shut AMD out of the market.

After further raids last year, the European Commission accused Intel of using rebates to persuade a leading European retailer to sell only Intel-based personal computers. Intel has consistently denied behaving illegally. "Our business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and good for consumers," it says.

In deciding how to shape and enforce a "cease-and-desist" order, the EU regulator will confront a web of incentives and rebates offered by  Intel to customers that have helped it dominate the market for PC microprocessor chips.

Opinions are divided on how specific the Commission will be. In theory, if its final decision goes against the company, the  fine could be as much as 10 per cent of  Intel's annual worldwide revenues. These totalled $37.6bn in 2008, meaning the maximum level could approach $4bn. However, that 10 per cent level is rarely reached.

Intel has refused to discuss whether it would appeal against an adverse decision.

After Japan's fair trade commission ruled in 2005 that  Intel had abused its monopoly power, the company heeded a cease-and-desist order, but did not accept guilt or pay a fine.

Last June, South Korea's fair trade commission  fined Intel Won26bn ($21m) for abusing its dominant market position there and offering discounts to two Korean PC makers to drive AMD out of the market. This decision is under appeal.  Intel had $10.3bn in cash and securities at the end of the first quarter.

Intel faces fine over payments EU  antitrust regulators are expected to say this week that  Intel Corp illegally paid computer makers to postpone or cancel the launch of products containing chips made by its main rival. The  European Commission is set to decide this week to  fine the world's largest chipmaker and order changes to its business practices for what the EU executive sees as ``naked

Capital One Financial, fresh off a clean bill of health after the release of the governmentâs stress test last week, headed a quartet of financial companies on Monday that said they would sell shares to repay funds borrowed from the Treasury Departmentâs Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The McLean, Va.-based credit-card lender said it would issue 56 million shares, priced at $27.75, in an effort to raise about $1.6 billion. Shares dropped 10% during early trading on the expectation of shareholder dilution.

"Net proceeds of the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and, subject to regulatory approval, for the repurchase of the preferred stock and warrants issued and sold, in each case, to the U.S. Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program," the company said.

TD
Principal Financial Group, US Bancorp and BB&T Corp also announced share sales.

Analysts have been waiting for a time when the company could put the stress test behind it and investors would start to evaluate the firm on more traditional metrics. Now that it's happened, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Stilmar, writing last week before the official results were known (but after numerous leaks found their way to news outlets), said these developments make Capital One a more attractive prospect "as few market participants believed COF would sail through the stress test unscathed."

Bottom Line: Hold The financial sector is too shaky even after the stress tests to be a comfortable space for small investors.
Court Ruling Boosts AMD

One of Silicon Valley's biggest battles ended on Monday in Brussels when the  European Commission said it would fine chip maker Intel for antitrust violations, nine years after competitor Advanced Micro Devices brought suit.

Shares of AMD popped Monday on the news.  Intel didn't immediately comment on the announcement, though it waged a long legal battle with the commission.  Intel last issued a statement in January objecting to the commission's refusal to seek documents from AMD that  Intel claimed could help its case.

"Certain AMD documents were made part of the record in the European proceeding and Intel sought to demonstrate that those documents indicated that other highly relevant documents existed. Intel asked the Commission to order AMD to provide those documents and the Commission refused," the company said on Jan. 27.

Intel could face fines of up to 10% of its revenue for allegedly blocking access to the European market. The company had revenue of $38 billion last year. Such a  fine could top the record $1.2 billion  fine issued in 2008 to Microsoft.

The legal boost comes after AMD posted solid quarterly results and investor opinion is swinging around to the idea that its Foundry chip-making spinoff has succeeded.
Page 99 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Analyst and head of Kintisheff Research Tsvetan Kintisheff on Friday upgraded the stock to Buy from
Hold based on its strong quarterly results and improving market conditions.
"The demand environment clearly is stabilizing and signs of this stability are abounding," he said.

Bottom Line: Buy AMD may still be second fiddle to  Intel, but the chip cycle and legal triumph make it an attractive option right now.
Virgin Mobile Rings Up Earnings
Investors bought shares of Virgin Mobile USA when the wireless carrier beat Wall Street estimates. While first quarter revenue of $337.3 million was short of Street consensus at $358 million, Virginâs
profits of 24 cents a share easily beat estimates of 10 cents a share. It also raised guidance for the full
year, putting its expected profit at $127 million to $142 million, up from $117 million to $132 million.

Virgin has been trying to keep customers amid a downturn in consumer spending. It has found some success with turning on customers to flat-rate, contract-free wireless service. "As budgets tightened and consumers continued to optimize their minutes of use, it became readily apparent that our traditional lower-end prepaid customer lifetime value was increasingly marginal,â said CEO Dan Schulman on a Monday conference call. âThe good news is the economic environment highlighted to our prepaid customers the inherent value and flexibility we provide and their churn rate stabilized and even begun to improve.â

Churn, or the total loss of customers, was at 4.8% for the quarter, in line with Thomas Weisel Partners analyst James Breen's estimate. "Despite the low gross additions this quarter, management saw an uptick in March and expects gross additions to improve in [the second half of 2009]," he wrote Monday.

Bottom Line: Hold Virgin doesnât have to maintain a mobile network, which keeps its costs down, but its customer base could be vulnerable if the recession continues.

HD     Tech firms could see fallout  from antitrust shift

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - If the Obama administration is serious about more aggressively responding to antitrust complaints, some of technology's biggest companies may have to rethink their business strategies or expansion plans.

The administration said Monday it has abandoned policies of former President George W. Bush that it criticized as too friendly to companies that dominate their markets.

TD
The Justice Department didn't call out any companies by name, and its shift in approach will affect all industries. But it raises the stakes for tech heavyweights whose practices have been questioned elsewhere more than in the United States.

For instance,  Intel Corp. could face a steep  fine in Europe this week over its behavior in the microprocessor industry. An IBM Corp. competitor is accusing the company in Europe of manipulating the market for mainframe computers. Microsoft Corp. -- a marquee  antitrust defendant during the administration of President Bill Clinton -- has been battling other charges in Europe in this decade as well.

Tougher antitrust enforcement could also focus on Google Inc., whose leading market shares in online search and advertising markets were already drawing scrutiny in the waning days of the Bush administration.
It remains to be seen whether the Justice Department's different approach under President Barack
Obama will lead to more court cases or more challenges to proposed business deals.

But antitrust lawyers say a more aggressive antitrust philosophy likely would make the Obama administration resemble the Clinton years far more than the Bush years.

"This is back to the future," said Stephen Bomse, partner in the  antitrust group of the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm.

Under Clinton, the Justice Department brought 12 anti-monopoly cases that didn't involve mergers or acquisitions. That included the long-running case against Microsoft in which a judge at one point ordered Microsoft split into two. (The case eventually was settled with the Bush administration, though it lives on: The Justice Department recently extended its oversight of Microsoft's compliance with the settlement for another 18 months, into 2011).

Under Bush, the department brought three anti-monopoly cases, but none outside of mergers and acquisitions. The targets in those cases were Chicago-based industrial component supplier Amsted Industries Inc., newspaper publishers Daily Gazette Co. and MediaNews Group Inc., and chip maker Microsemi Corp.

Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission from 1995 until 2001 and now an attorney with the Arnold & Porter law firm, said he doesn't think the U.S. will entirely match Europe's zeal for antitrust cases.

One reason is that the U.S. is still more likely to have a free-market bent than Europe, he said. And it can be tricky to regulate technology from an  antitrust perspective. Technological innovations can create monopolists very quickly by cornering or creating specific parts of a market. If regulators are too aggressive, they run the risk of stifling innovation.

"The vast majority of activity in Silicon Valley is innovation, trying to make a better product -- that was not viewed as anticompetitive under Bush or Clinton," said Jonathan Jacobson, a partner in the  antitrust practice at the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati law firm. "Technological innovation is supposed to keep you out of trouble."

But the standard that tech companies are judged by -- whether they are engaging in "exclusionary" or "predatory" conduct against competitors -- is the same as everyone else. Viewed through that lens, tech companies can be at a disadvantage because they grow so fast and can get on regulators' radars much more quickly.
Already fears of a tougher  antitrust regime under Obama might have played out in Silicon Valley.

When IBM was discussing a proposed $7 billion takeover of rival Sun Microsystems Inc. this spring, Sun sought detailed assurances that IBM would see the deal through an  antitrust review. When the talks collapsed, Sun ended up agreeing to be acquired by Oracle Corp., a company with less overlap with Sun, meaning the deal is perceived as less likely to generate  antitrust questions.

Intel's antitrust challenges arose from complaints by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. According to AMD,  Intel boxed AMD out of certain accounts by paying computer makers and retailers to avoid AMD's products. AMD claims that  Intel would drop this hammer when AMD's market share would get too big.

Intel, which owns about 80 percent of the worldwide PC microprocessor market, argues that the rebates it offered were legal, and are a common way to reward buying in very high volumes.

European regulators don't buy  Intel's argument. They have charged  Intel with engaging in a coordinated strategy to limit AMD's reach, including by selling server chips below the cost of making them. The European Commission is expected to formally  fine Intel this week. The  fines can be up to 10 percent of a company's annual revenue, and in 2008,  Intel had $37.6 billion in worldwide sales.

The U.S. initially stayed on the sidelines while  Intel and AMD began duking it out overseas in 2003. Last year U.S. regulators stepped up their inquiries, with the Federal Trade Commission opening a formal probe into Intel's sales tactics. The FTC's two-year investigation had been considered "informal" until that point. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has not taken action.

According to the 11 May issue of the British daily newspaper The Financial Times, the European Commission is set to impose a record  fine on US semiconductor giant  Intel for abuse of dominant position on the computer chip market. According to lawyers quoted by the newspaper, the bill could reach that of Microsoft, which was - and still is - the subject of an investigation for  abuse of dominant position, which - based on all fines combined - totals some â¬1.6 billion. The spokesperson for  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes did not, however, confirm the news, specifying that "the anti-trust
investigation is continuing". "It is not customary for the Commission to say anything before notifying the company," she added. The  Intel case dates back to the beginning of 2000. The Commission sent  Intel two complaints, in July 2007 and July 2008, in which it suspected the company of "abuse of dominant position" in order to exclude AMD - its main competitor - from the European market.

Intel owns 80% of the market, compared with AMD's 20% (see Europolitics 3576 and 3489). The EU Court of First Instance recently rejected a request for respite submitted by  Intel (Case T 457/08 R), which gave the Commission free rein to make its decision (3682). (NVA)

HD         U.S. Clears the Way for Antitrust Crackdown; Justice  Dept. to Reverse Looser Policy of Bush

The Obama administration signaled yesterday that it would take an aggressive stand against companies that engage in anti-competitive behavior, reversing looser policies of the past eight years that critics called friendly toward big firms.

Christine Varney, head of the  antitrust division at the Justice Department, announced that the agency would revoke a 2008 report that made it difficult to pursue  antitrust cases against corporations. She said the guidelines and lax enforcement over the past decade helped contribute to the economic crisis.

TD
"The recent developments in the marketplace should make it clear that we can no longer rely upon the marketplace alone to ensure that  competition and consumers will be protected," Varney said in a speech at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank.

But doing so may prove difficult, observers said. The president's desire to clamp down on big corporate mergers and to guard against anti-competitive behaviors will be challenged by an economic recession that some analysts predict could lead to more pressure for corporations to consolidate, further cutting competition.

"Now more than ever, there is a confluence of challenges for the administration from an  antitrust standpoint to stabilize sectors with cash-flow challenges," said Jessica Zufolo, an analyst at Medley Advisors.

While the administration's new enforcement would affect all industries, many  antitrust experts said some of the more controversial cases are expected to arise from the fast-evolving high-tech and telecom worlds. Google, for example, has businesses in online video, mapping and mobile services even though its business is still mostly made up of online searches. AT&T provides wireless, video, phone and mobile entertainment services.
Varney, who served as the lead Internet lobbyist for the law firm Hogan & Hartson and was a member
of the Federal Trade Commission, already is leading a review of Google's settlement with book authors
and publishing companies that would allow the search giant to digitize millions of books.
The FTC is conducting a separate review of whether the boards of Google and Apple violate  antitrust
laws by having Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, sit on both boards.

By evoking an obscure rule on directors of a company,  antitrust experts said, the administration is clearly signaling its intent to step up scrutiny.

During the Bush administration, nearly every high-tech and telecommunications merger before the antitrust division at the Justice Department was approved, including last year's controversial union of the nation's two sole satellite radio service providers, Sirius and XM. After a lengthy battle with the Justice Department, the software giant Oracle won approval in 2005 for its merger with PeopleSoft.
Page 104 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Also that year, AT&T and Verizon Communications snapped up dominant market shares after mergers with BellSouth and MCI, respectively.
Verizon became the biggest wireless services provider last year with its acquisition of Alltel.

Tom Barnett, head of the  antitrust division under President George W. Bush, challenged 30 mergers during his tenure and denied Google's request to join Yahoo in an advertising deal. He said the agency under Obama will face the same complex questions regarding  competition on the Web that his staff did over the past four years.

"If a company is going to fail and leave the market, it may be more difficult for the agency to challenge the merger," Barnett said.
Critics said that under Bush the enforcement of  antitrust violations shifted overseas to European and
Asian nations that were said to be more aggressive in investigating allegations.

As early as this week, the  European Commission is expected to decide whether to  fine Intel over allegations that it used its dominant position in the semiconductor market to deter customers from buying chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The European  antitrust regulatory body will next month also look into allegations that Microsoft tied its Web browser to its dominant operating system software, edging out rivals.

Public interest groups said consolidation in the high-tech and telecom industry has left consumers with fewer choices for cellphones and service providers, less innovation, and higher prices for broadband Internet and wireless services than in many other nations.

U.S. cellphone users pay an average of $506 a year, while users in the developed nations belonging to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development pay $439, Chris Murray, senior counsel for Consumers Union, said in a House hearing last week on  competition in the wireless industry.

"Considering that the very same companies who this industry was supposed to compete against, telephone monopolies, have now purchased and merged their way to be the two dominant wireless companies, some serious oversight is warranted," Murray said in his testimony.

Analysts said investors are closely watching the fates of Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless operators, which each quarter lose subscribers to Verizon and AT&T. Rumors of a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile's parent firm, Deutsche Telecom, abound for similar reasons.

Last month, Oracle announced that it planned to acquire Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, a transaction that would have to be approved by the Justice Department. A merger between concert services giants Live Nation and Ticketmaster is also under review.

HD     'Stay Tuned' for DoJ Antitrust Action  on Internet Companies,  Varney Says

Successful Internet companies must "pay attention to the rules" of antitrust the same as those in any other industry, said Christine Varney, assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division. She spoke publicly Monday, at a Center for American Progress event in Washington, for the first time since winning Senate confirmation. Audience members pressed Varney, a former FTC commissioner and founder of one of the country's first Internet law practices, for clues on how the department will treat Google's growing market power in several fields.

TD
Varney's major action Monday was making clear that the DoJ is becoming much more active in  antitrust enforcement. She withdrew the department's report on "monopolization offenses" under section 2 of the Sherman Act, issued in September. The report raised "too many hurdles" to  antitrust enforcement of single-firm conduct, she said. The department assumed that it was too difficult to distinguish anti- competitive from lawful conduct, that vigorous enforcement would lead to "over-deterrence," and that market "self- correction" was a preferable path to  competition. "These views, held in good faith, have not borne out" as the U.S. economy has plummeted, Varney said.

DoJ will analyze the "overall state of  competition" in the industries it reviews, not act on a "case-by-case basis" as in the last administration, Varney said. The department's pursuit of Microsoft in the Clinton administration is a good indicator of DoJ's new approach, she said. "As  antitrust enforcers we can no longer sit on the sidelines." One big change: DoJ will file "quite frequently" as a friend of the court in antitrust cases, Varney said.  Antitrust defendants have put a "fair amount of potential reliance" on the section 2 report, and the department wants to discourage that, she said.

Consider the "hypothetical" example of an Internet company that dominated search, advertising, e-mail, photo- sharing, online video and maps, and was expanding its reach to browsers and online payments, Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Varney. "Hypothetically, is there anything that the Department of Justice might do in this situation?" Varney
refused to take the bait. "In America we reward success and I applaud the companies that have been very successful in the past decade," but they "need to pay attention to the rules" under section 2, she said.

The Internet has created "radically new economic models," Varney said. DoJ's new chief economist, former economics Prof. Carl Shapiro of the University of California, Berkeley, has written extensively about "networked industries" and he's in a good position to evaluate  competition in them, she said. Shapiro recently testified that the newspaper industry shouldn't get further protection from  antitrust enforcement because of the classified and other ad revenue it has lost to the Internet (WID April 22 p7). "Stay tuned," Varney said. "I think we'll have a lot to say about it over the next several years."

Asked whether she could reverse the trend of U.S. companies going to Europe to file antitrust claims that wouldn't interest DoJ, Varney said she has often heard of the practice. The European Commission is pursuing cases including against Microsoft over browser tying and  Intel over payments to computer makers not to use AMD chips. The Wall Street Journal said Monday that the EC will  fine Intel in the case Wednesday. DoJ will coordinate more closely with European counterparts than it has, Varney said. "I would discourage any company from forum-shopping" in hopes of finding more assertive  antitrust authorities, she said. -- Greg Piper

Bush antitrust doctrine revoked
Move towards European approach

TD
The US is to take a more interventionist approach to  competition issues, reversing the stance of
George W. Bush's administration and moving closer to the way that European regulators operate.
Christine Varney, head of the Department of Justice's  antitrust division, said yesterday she was
revoking a Bush administration antitrust doctrine that she said advocated "extreme hesitancy in the face
of potential abuses by monopoly firms".

"In a free society government must intervene when  competition is threatened," she said, adding that continuing a minimal approach to tackling monopolistic behaviour was the wrong path, even in a financial crisis.

"It's clear we have a new sheriff in town," said Ed Black, a lawyer and head of the Computer & Communications Industry Association. "There's so much that was left ignored by the last administration, so a main job will be catching up."

A former lawyer specialising in the internet, Ms Varney's appointment and apparent willingness to scrutinise large technology companies may concern Google,  Intel, Microsoft and IBM, all of which have faced antitrust action. The European Commission is expected tomorrow to levy a  fine for
anti-competitive behaviour on Intel, the chipmaker, that could top â¬1bn ($1.36bn).

With complainants focusing on Europe for  antitrust cases, Ms Varney said she would "discourage any company from forum shopping" as the DoJ would now be "co-operating closely" with the commission.

In a speech to the liberal Center for American Progress, Ms Varney said the financial crisis was a reason to step up  antitrust activity and not to pull back.
She asked whether companies regarded as "too big to fail" could have had their growth blocked by
antitrust action.
Ms Varney said her team would examine the use of government stimulus funds to try to prevent fraud. "In the event that preventive efforts fail, we will be there to investigate and swiftly prosecute individuals
and entities responsible for criminal  antitrust violations."

She said there would be no impediment to the DoJ tackling  competition abuses at companies that had received government equity stakes in the wake of the financial crisis. Those direct equity stakes are expected to grow as the government converts preferred equity stakes in banks into common stock.

Although Ms Varney was keen to stress that she saw her appointment as a break with the past she also indicated that there would be no witch-hunt of companies. "We need to be careful not to swing back too far the other way," she said.

Some lawyers said the impact of tougher enforcement from the Department of Justice could be mitigated in court where most complaints about monopolies were brought by private companies rather than the government.

"Since roughly the late 1970s, courts have adopted rules that have appeared to make it difficult for plaintiffs to win their monopolisation claims against dominant firms," said Keith Hylton of the Boston University School of Law.
"That has nothing to do with the Bush people."

While the Bush administration did not pursue companies alleged to have over-extended themselves with vertical integration - buying up their own supply chain - the DoJ did take a hard line on cartel activity, which was judged to be a more clear-cut  abuse of the law.

But in a key report published in September and revoked yesterday by Ms Varney, the administration had said there should be no interference in "the rough and tumble of beneficial  competition".

But in a key report published in September and revoked yesterday by Ms Varney, the administration had said there should be no interference in "the rough and tumble of beneficial  competition".

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) --  Intel Corp. kicked off a two-day meeting with investors and analysts on Tuesday amid lingering uncertainty in the chip market and disappointing news related to its rivalry with Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Shares of  Intel (INTC, US) closed 1% lower at $15.21 as the company prepared for the conference at its headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and as International Data Corp. reported a sharp drop in personal-computer chip shipments in the first quarter.

TD
On the other hand, shares of AMD (AMD, US) rose 3% by the close after IDC also said that, while Intel remains the dominant PC chip vendor, its market share nonetheless fell 4.7% to 77.3%. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD tightened its grip on the No. 2 spot as its market share rose 4.6% to
22.3%, IDC said.

Meanwhile, media reports said the European Union is expected to announce this week a ruling against Intel in connection with allegations that it abused its dominant position in competing with AMD.

On Monday,  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the company "has not been informed by the Commission or anyone in authority that a decision has been made. Therefore we have nothing to say." A European Union spokesman also said Monday that there has been no announcement in connection with the ongoing  antitrust investigation.

But in a Tuesday note, JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna said, "The EU is likely to add to the headwinds on Wednesday, May 13, when it is expected to issue  fines against Intel for rebate programs that are said to have impeded fair  competition."

Stifel Nicolaus analyst Cody Acree also said the issue will likely come up during the conference, telling clients in a note, "Unfortunately,  Intel will also likely have to deal with the issues of a ruling from the European Commission, which is expected to be released as early as tomorrow."

Still, Acree added, "While a negative ruling and any penalty would likely have a short-term trading impact on its shares, we believe the firm's competitive structural issues have already been largely addressed."

In fact, analysts and investors will likely zero in on other matters. An important one is  Intel's seemingly puzzling statements during its last earnings call.

During the call,  Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini declared that the PC market decline has reached bottom. But the company disappointed analysts by again not issuing a formal outlook.

In a way, Intel's reluctance to offer more color was not surprising given the uncertainty in the chip market and the tech industry as a whole.

In its report, the IDC described the PC chip market as "still in weak condition," saying the recent pickup in demand was due to restocking by manufacturers.

"IDC is wary that the demand was due to [manufacturers] replenishing their inventories rather than reflecting a return of solid end demand and return to market normalcy," the report said.

In his note, Gauna of JMP Securities said that while  Intel "will be justifiably upbeat about its manufacturing execution, broadening and winning platform strategies, and cloud computing opportunities, we believe the company can do little during its analyst event to dispel the uncertainty that still exists in end markets."

HD           Obama Takes Tougher Antitrust Line

LP
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's top  antitrust official announced on Monday that the administration would restore an aggressive enforcement policy against corporations that use their market dominance to elbow out competitors or to keep them from gaining market share.

The new enforcement policy reverses the Bush administration's approach, which strongly favored defendants against antitrust claims. It returns to a policy that led to the landmark  antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft and Intel in the 1990s.

TD
The head of the Justice Department's  antitrust division, Christine A. Varney, announced the policy reversal in a speech on Monday before the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy research organization. She will deliver the same speech on Tuesday to the United States Chamber of Commerce.

Ms. Varney said that the Bush administration policy ''lost sight of an ultimate goal of  antitrust laws -- the protection of consumer welfare.''

''The failing of this approach is that it effectively straitjackets  antitrust enforcers and courts from redressing monopolistic abuses, thereby allowing all but the most bold and predatory conduct to go unpunished and undeterred,'' she said. ''We must change course and take a new tack,''

The administration is hoping to encourage smaller companies in an array of industries to bring their complaints to the Justice Department about potentially improper business practices by their larger rivals. Some of the biggest  antitrust cases were initiated by complaints taken to the Justice Department.

Ms. Varney said that the administration rejected the impulse to go easy on  antitrust enforcement during weak economic times.

Instead, she said, severe recessions can provide dangerous incentives for large and dominating companies to engage in predatory behavior that harms consumers and weakens  competition.

''There is no adequate substitute for a competitive market, particularly during times of economic distress,'' she said. ''Vigorous  antitrust enforcement must play a significant role in the government's response to economic crises to ensure that markets remain competitive.''

The announcement is aimed at making sure that no court or party to a lawsuit can cite the Bush administration policy as the government's official view in any pending cases. Ms. Varney warned judges and litigants in  antitrust lawsuits not involving the government to ignore the Bush administration's policies, which were formally outlined in a report by the Justice Department last year.

The report applied legal standards that made it difficult to bring new cases involving  monopoly and predatory practices.



Page 114 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As a result of the Bush administration's interpretation of  antitrust laws, the enforcement pipeline for major monopoly cases -- which can take years for prosecutors to develop -- is thin. During the Bush administration, the Justice Department did not file a single case against a dominant firm for violating the antimonopoly law.

Many smaller companies complaining of abusive practices by their larger rivals were so frustrated by the Bush administration's  antitrust policy that they went to the  European Commission and to Asian authorities.

Later this week, for instance, antitrust regulators at the  European Commission are expected to announce its fine against Intel over charges that the company unlawfully provided rebates and price reductions to customers while pressuring them to avoid doing business with a smaller rival. Lawyers following the case say the  fine could be as large as 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), the largest penalty ever invoked by the Europeans in a  monopoly case.

Ms. Varney's new policy more closely aligns American antitrust policy on monopolies and predatory practices with the views of  antitrust regulators at the European Commission.

Herbert Hovenkamp, a leading  antitrust scholar regarded as a centrist between those seeking more aggressive enforcement and those who generally argue for restraint, said the guidelines by the Bush administration were ''a brief for defendants.''

He said that the repudiation of those guidelines by the Obama administration ''will almost certainly have a greater impact than the guidelines themselves had.''
''This will be bad news for heavyweights in the tech industries -- companies like Google and
Microsoft,'' said Professor Hovenkamp, who teaches at the University of Iowa College of Law.

''People aligned with plaintiffs will rejoice. Those aligned with defendants will wring their hands. A lot of law firms will be indifferent because they take money from both sides.''

Ms. Varney said that the Obama administration was guided by the view that it was a major mistake during the outset of the Great Depression to relax  antitrust enforcement, only to try to catch up and become more vigorous later. She said the mistake enabled many large companies to engage in pricing, wage and collusive practices that harmed consumers and took years to reverse.

While Ms. Varney did not mention any specific companies or industries vulnerable under the new policy, those who have talked to her about the speech say she is aiming at agriculture, energy, health care, technology and telecommunications companies. She may also be reviewing the conduct of some in the financial services industry, which is now undergoing a wave of consolidation as a result of the financial crisis.

Ms. Varney, who headed the Internet practice group of the Washington-based Hogan & Hartson law firm, served as a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission in the 1990s after working in the White House during the early years of the Clinton administration.

Signaling her intent to revive a moribund antitrust program, she has recruited a collection of senior aides, many of whom are seasoned antitrust litigators or worked in the Clinton administration and the Federal Trade Commission and were involved in many prominent cases, including the one against Microsoft. They include Molly S. Boast, William Cavanaugh, Gene Kimmelman, Carl Shapiro and
Philip J. Weiser.

Antitrust policy is set by Washington in two ways: by the interpretation of laws announced by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission through guidelines for the courts and private litigants, and by the enforcement cases that those agencies decide to bring. The government's guidelines are often cited by lawyers and given considerable weight by judges in  antitrust cases, including those lawsuits that the government does not participate in.

It is not unlawful for a company to gain control of a market. It becomes unlawful if the company engages in conduct to exclude or harm competitors with no business justification.

Conservative antitrust experts, some judges and defendants in such cases have said that the line is too difficult to draw and that it is better to let rivalries play out in the marketplace than in the courts.

After more than a year of hearings and studies, the Justice Department in 2008 published a 215-page report analyzing Section 2 of the Sherman  Antitrust Act, explaining the government's approach to the monopolistic and predatory practices of companies.


Page 115 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Reflecting skepticism of the role of government in the marketplace, the 2008 report made formal a set of policies that had largely been followed by the Justice Department, but not by the Federal Trade Commission, during the Bush administration.

When the report was issued, Thomas Barnett, then the head of the  antitrust division and the architect of the guidelines, said that they were meant to articulate ''clear standards'' for determining whether certain types of conduct by large companies would harm  competition.

In a rare split with the Justice Department, three of the four commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission denounced the guidelines, calling them ''a blueprint for radically weakened enforcement'' against anticompetitive practices.

EU antitrust regulators said on Wednesday they had  fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars) for using its grip on the microchip market to thwart rivals illegally.

The European Commission accused Intel of using rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units -- the brains inside personal computers.

The fine topped the previous record 899 million euros which Microsoft was ordered to pay last year for failing to cooperate with the  European Commission in its antitrust battles with the US software giant.

Intel dominates the 22-billion-euro (30-billion-dollar) market for so-called x86 CPUs with a 70-percent share during the five years it was accused of breaking EU  antitrust rules.
It said that  Intel had used wholly or partially hidden rebates to get PC makers to buy all or almost all their
CPU supply from the Santa Clara, California-based company.

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competiting with  Intel's x86.

Intel also allegedly paid a major electronic retailer to stock computers with its chips.
The commission ordered  Intel to cease any of the ongoing practices that it deemed to break EU rules. The fine topped a record 899 million euros Microsoft was ordered to pay last year for failing to cooperate
with the European Commission in its antitrust battles with the US software giant.

However, Microsoft has accumulated a total  fines of 1.676 billion euros in  fines and its antitrust saga with Brussels is still ongoing.
EU regulators have been investigating  Intel since it received complaints from rival Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD) first in 2000.

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said AMD president for Europe, Middle East and Africa Giuliano Meroni.

Intel said on Wednesday it would appeal against a  European Commission decision to fine the US
computer chip giant 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars) for abusing its dominant market power.

"Intel takes strong exception to this decision,"  Intel president and chief executive Paul Otellini said in a statement after the commission ordered the Santa Clara, California-based company to pay the record fine.

TD
"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace -- characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices."
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

The European Commission accused Intel of using rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units -- the brains inside personal computers.

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competiting with  Intel's x86.

Intel also allegedly paid a major electronic retailer to stock computers with its chips.

"Intel never sells products below cost. We have however, consistently invested in innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology," Otellini said.

"The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers everywhere the efficiencies of being the world's leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors," he added.

The Intel boss said that, despite the appeal, the company would work with the commission to ensure that it complies with its decision, pending a final judgment on the appeal.

EU antitrust regulators fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars) on Wednesday, claiming it uses its stranglehold on the microchip market to crush its main rival illegally.

The company hit back promising to fight the ruling with an appeal in EU courts, raising the spectre of a new antitrust saga between Brussels and a US technology giant after Microsoft's years of European legal battles.

The European Commission, Europe's top  competition watchdog, accused  Intel of using illegal loyalty rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units -- the brains inside personal computers.

The Santa Clara, California-based company dominates the 22-billion-euro (30-billion-dollar) market for so-called x86 CPUs with a 70-percent share during the more than five years it was accused of breaking EU antitrust rules.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," she added. The commission said that  Intel had used wholly or partially hidden rebates to get PC makers such as
Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC to buy all or almost all their CPU supply from  Intel instead of rival
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

"Naturally, the Commission favours strong, vigorous price  competition, including by dominant firms," Kroes told journalists in Brussels.

"However,  Intel went beyond normal price  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from  Intel."

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competiting with  Intel's x86.

In addition,  Intel allegedly paid a major electronic retailer, chain store MediaMarkt, to stock computers with its chips.
The commission ordered  Intel to cease any of the ongoing practices that it deemed to break EU rules.

Intel did not hesitate to contest the commission's ruling.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,"  Intel president and chief executive Paul Otellini said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

However, Microsoft has accumulated a total  fines of 1.676 billion euros in  fines and its antitrust struggle with Brussels is still ongoing.

EU regulators have been investigating  Intel since it received complaints from AMD back in 2000 and filed formal antitrust charges against the company in July 2007 and then again in July 2008.

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said AMD president for Europe, Middle East and Africa Giuliano Meroni.

The commission fines could be only the beginning of  Intel's woes, with the BEUC European consumer-protection association calling for a class action suit against the company to seek compensation.

"For BEUC,  Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices," its director general Monique Goyens said. "Consumers have been paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated."

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

"Naturally, the Commission favours strong, vigorous price  competition, including by dominant firms," Kroes told journalists in Brussels.

"However,  Intel went beyond normal price  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from  Intel."

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competiting with  Intel's x86.

In addition,  Intel allegedly paid a major electronic retailer, chain store MediaMarkt, to stock computers with its chips.
The commission ordered  Intel to cease any of the ongoing practices that it deemed to break EU rules.

Intel did not hesitate to contest the commission's ruling.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,"  Intel president and chief executive Paul Otellini said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

Intel's fine topped the previous record 899 million euros Microsoft was ordered to pay last year for failing to cooperate with the  European Commission in its antitrust battles with the US software giant.

However, Microsoft has accumulated a total  fines of 1.676 billion euros in  fines and its antitrust struggle with Brussels is still ongoing.

EU regulators have been investigating  Intel since it received complaints from AMD back in 2000 and filed formal antitrust charges against the company in July 2007 and then again in July 2008.

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said AMD president for Europe, Middle East and Africa Giuliano Meroni.

The commission fines could be only the beginning of  Intel's woes, with the BEUC European consumer-protection association calling for a class action suit against the company to seek compensation.

"For BEUC,  Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices," its director general Monique Goyens said. "Consumers have been paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated."

EU antitrust regulators fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars) on Wednesday, claiming it uses its stranglehold on the microchip market to crush its main rival illegally.

The company hit back promising to fight the ruling with an appeal in EU courts, raising the spectre of a new antitrust saga between Brussels and a US technology giant after Microsoft's years of European legal battles.

TD
The European Commission, Europe's top  competition watchdog, accused  Intel of using illegal loyalty rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units -- the brains inside personal computers.

The Santa Clara, California-based company dominates the 22-billion-euro (30-billion-dollar) market for so-called x86 CPUs with a 70-percent share during the more than five years it was accused of breaking EU antitrust rules.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," she added. The commission said that  Intel had used wholly or partially hidden rebates to get PC makers such as
Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC to buy all or almost all their CPU supply from  Intel instead of rival
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

"Naturally, the commission favours strong, vigorous price  competition, including by dominant firms," Kroes told journalists in Brussels.

"However,  Intel went beyond normal price  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from  Intel."

Intel general counsel Bruce Sewell defended the rebates, arguing that computer makers appoach the company seeking reductions and stressing that "there is no evidence that we were pricing below cost."

Sewell said: "We're making a profit on every product we sell, but because of the  competition, we're reducing the price of every product that we sell, so consumers benefit."

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competing with  Intel's x86.

In addition,  Intel allegedly paid a major electronic retailer, chain store MediaMarkt, to stock computers with its chips.

US computer chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Wednesday welcomed the decision by EU
antitrust regulators to  fine rival Intel a record 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars).

"Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," AMD president and chief executive Dirk Meyer said in a statement.

TD
"AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers."

"After an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion --  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt," added Tom McCoy, AMD's executive vice president for legal affairs.

"With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation," McCoy said.

The US Chamber of Commerce meanwhile expressed concern that the EU move against  Intel, which follows similar actions against US software giant Microsoft, was "part of a larger, troubling pattern."

"Fines by the commission have escalated in size in recent years, raising serious concerns about due process and the method for determining these huge  fines," said Myron Brilliant, senior vice president for international affairs.

"Huge fines demand greater due process protections," he said. "The current EU guidelines for determining fine amounts are too vague."

The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said the ruling against  Intel was "not a great surprise since it follows similar decisions by Japanese and Korean  competition authorities in recent years."

The CCIA added that the  Intel decision in Europe "has many in Washington wondering whether US action may soon follow," especially after the Obama administration this week pledged to step up  antitrust enforcement.

"A convincing picture has emerged revealing that  Intel's actions were unquestionably strategically premeditated to be anti-competitive and willfully illegal," said CCIA president Ed Black.

"A vigorous US investigation focused on the evidence in the case leaves us believing  Intel will have its day of reckoning in the US as well," he added.

The European Commission, Europe's top  competition watchdog, accused  Intel of using illegal loyalty rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units -- the brains inside personal computers.

Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC to buy all or almost all their CPU supply from  Intel instead of AMD.

Intel rejected the charges and said it will appeal the EU ruling.

Intel's share price was holding steady in New York on Wednesday, trading unchanged from the opening at 15.21 dollars at 1600 GMT.

Europe's main  competition watchdog has fined Intel a record $1.45bn, claiming the computer chip maker used illegal sales tactics in an effort to crush its main rival.

The European Commission accused Intel of breaking competition law by employing a strategy to keep Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) out of the market, limiting consumer choice.

TD
"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," Neelie Kroes, European Union  Competition commissioner, said on Wednesday.

The commission has ordered  Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still on going".

But Intel described the ruling as "wrong", and vowed to fight it with an appeal in European Union courts.
Computer monopoly
The antitrust fine is the biggest imposed on a single company, exceeding last year's $1,223m
monopoly abuse penalty against Microsoft.

The commission said Intel had paid rebates to computer manufacturers for buying all or most of their x86 computer processing units (CPUs), and also paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

Regulators also accused the company, whose microprocessors power 80 per cent of the world's personal computers, of paying a major electronic retailer to stock computers with its chips.

Paul Otellini,  Intel's chief executive officer, said: "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace".
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he said.

But Giuliano Meroni, AMD's Europe president, said the EU order would "shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers".

EU regulators have been investigating  Intel since it received complaints from AMD in 2001, and filed formal antitrust charges against the company in July 2007 and in July 2008.

HD      Intel hit with $1.45B fine in Europe

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -  Intel Corp. was fined a record $1.45 billion by the European Union on Wednesday for using strong-arm sales tactics in the computer chip market -- a penalty that could turn up the pressure on U.S. regulators to go after the company, too.

The fine against the world's biggest chip maker represents a huge victory for  Intel's Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, the No. 2 supplier of microprocessors to PC makers.

TD
AMD has sued Intel and lobbied regulators around the world for the past five years, complaining that  Intel
was penalizing PC makers in the U.S. and abroad for doing business with AMD.

Although the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also investigating, AMD seems to have found its most sympathetic ear in Europe.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by
"deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market."

"Intel did not compete fairly, frustrating innovation and reducing consumer welfare in the process," she said.

The commission told Intel to immediately stop some sales practices in Europe, though it wouldn't say what those were. Intel said it was "mystified" about what it was supposed to change but would comply while it appeals the fine.
The Santa Clara, California, company also defended its sales practices -- which include rebates to big
Intel customers -- as legitimate.

"This is really just a matter of  competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious,"  Intel CEO Paul Otellini said in a conference call with reporters.

AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer said the decision was "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market."

"We are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Meyer said in a statement.

The biggest previous  fine levied by the European Union for anticompetitive behavior was $1.3 billion, brought against Microsoft Corp. last year.

Whether  Intel could face punishment in the U.S. remains to be seen. But the EU's  fine against Intel could push the issue to the forefront for the Obama administration.

"If there was ever a time not to appear to be a large firm behaving badly, this would be it, as the financial collapse has the U.S. and EU competing for which government is the most proactively protecting
consumer rights," warned Rob Enderle, a technology industry analyst. "This judgment makes  Intel the ball in what is likely an international game of one-upmanship."

The Obama administration signaled this week that  antitrust enforcement would be pursued more vigorously than in the Bush administration, whose Justice Department filed only three anti-monopoly cases, all involving mergers. Yet the Justice Department has been silent on whether it is investigating Intel.
The Federal Trade Commission investigation of  Intel could result in the agency asking a court to order
Intel to alter its practices. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment.

Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer specializing on European  antitrust law, cautioned that Europe is known for its aggressive antitrust enforcement and that a case brought against  Intel in the U.S. or elsewhere might be milder.

The EU fine is "hugely significant because it's  Intel, and the amounts at stake are enormous," he said. But "it is known that the commission takes a very hard line on this type of behavior."

The Intel-vs.-AMD fight exposes an ugly part of the business for microprocessors, which essentially are the brains of personal computers.

Unlike other parts of the PC industry that have lots of competitors, microprocessors come from only two sources. Intel has about 80 percent of the market, and AMD -- headquartered a few miles away in Sunnyvale -- has the rest. That means a victory for one is a defeat for the other.

The process of getting a chip into a computer and onto the shelves has two main steps, and AMD has cried foul about  Intel's behavior at both stages.

First, a computer maker has to agree to buy the chips. In that stage, AMD has alleged,  Intel has illegally used its dominant position by offering huge rebates to PC makers that promise to buy lots of  Intel's chips. AMD argues that the discounts can effectively make some chip orders free, and that it would have to lose money on sales in order to keep up.

The case before the  European Commission alleges that  Intel illegally undermined AMD with computer makers Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC.

In AMD's U.S. lawsuit against  Intel, set to go to trial next year in Delaware, executives from Gateway complained that  Intel's threats of retaliation for working with AMD beat them "into guacamole." The lawsuit also quotes Toshiba officials saying  Intel's financial incentives amounted to "cocaine."

Second, chip makers help persuade stores to carry PCs with their processors inside, and pay the retailers to help promote the machines. In the case before the EU, regulators said  Intel paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer to stock only  Intel-based computers at its MediaMarkt superstores -- even in Dresden, where many AMD chips are made.

Kinsella, the specialist on European  antitrust law, said "loyalty rebate" programs are common, but become a problem when dominant companies use them. In a similar European case, tire maker Michelin was fined in 2001 over its rebate program in France.

Kinsella said the accusation that  Intel paid companies specifically not to use AMD's products would set this case apart from others.
"If that's true," he said, "that would be pretty far out there in terms of examples of  abuse."

Investors were expecting the  Intel fine and seemed unfazed.  Intel stock lost 8 cents to close at $15.13. AMD was up 3 cents at $4.38.

The U.S. company, which controls more than 70 percent of the global market for central processing units, offered rebates to computer makers and retailers to prevent rivals from eating into its share between October 2002 and December 2007, according to the EU's administrative arm.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years."
The commissioner added that such a serious and sustained violation of the European Union's  antitrust
rules "cannot be tolerated."

The previous record fine for abuse of dominant power in the European Union was 899 million euros, slapped on U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. in February last year.

Intel President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini said in a statement that the decision is "wrong" and there had been "absolutely zero harm to consumers."
Otellini said the company will appeal the decision.

The European Commission has slapped Intel with a record $1.45 billion  fine, the highest ever imposed on an individual company, for violating  antitrust rules and indulging in practices that hinder fair competition.

Speculation surrounding the decision reached a crescendo over the last few days with many predicting that Intel would face a harsh fine

TD
for its anti-competitive practices over the years. From October 2002 till December 2007,  Intel used its dominant market position to offer wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their x86 CPUs from the company.

They also made direct payments to a âmajor retailerâ for stocking only computers with  Intel CPUs. The Commission added that it "does not object to the rebates in themselves but to the conditions that  Intel attached to those rebates."

Additionally,  Intel paid manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific AMD products and the sales channels made available to them.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said in an official statement, adding that they would closely monitor Intelâs compliance with this decision.

Paul Otellini,  Intelâs president and CEO, has lashed out in response to the recent ruling stating that the company will appeal.

"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace...There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers. Intel will appeal," an official statement from Otellini reads.

"We do not believe our practices violated European law. The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not. The Directorate General for  Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision," he added.

Intelâs $1.45 billion  fine is the largest imposed on any individual company, exceeding even the 2004 EU
ruling against Microsoft which involved a $655 million  fine. While it might seem like a hefty price to pay,
it does reflect the current worth of the global x86 CPU market which amounts to $30 billion per year,
with Europe accounting for nearly 30%.

"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

The European Commission fined Intel a record E1.06 billion today and ordered it to halt illegal rebates to computer makers aimed at restricting their use of chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The fine is the biggest the Commission has imposed on a company for an  abuse of market dominance.

Intel promises to comply with the ruling, but says it will appeal.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has about 80 per cent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market -- and faces just one real rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

TD
The European Commission says Intel broke E-U competition law by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to keep A-M-D out of the market, limiting customer choice.

It says Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, H-P, Lenovo and NEC for buying all or almost all their x86 computer processing units, or CPUs, from  Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on A-M-D chips.

E-U regulators are not the only ones chasing  Intel _ South Korea  fined the company 21 (m) million dollars U-S last year.

The U-S Federal Trade Commission upgraded a probe into  Intel last year _ and the Obama administration is set to take a more aggressive approach against  monopoly abuse by reversing a strict interpretation of  antitrust law that saw regulators shun such cases.

SUNNYVALE, Calif. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - The  European Commission today found Intel guilty of abusing its dominant position in the global x86 microprocessor market, saying that âIntel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EUâs  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated.â The Commission also stated that âthere is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.â The EC decision requires Intel to change its business practices immediately and fines Intel a record EUR 1.06 billion (US $1.45 billion).

âTodayâs ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market,â said Dirk Meyer, AMD president and CEO. âAMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers.â

TD
âAfter an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion â  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt,â said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president for legal affairs. âWith this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intelâs monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation.â
The EC decision stated specifically that:

* âIntel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel.â

* âIntel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active."

* Intel âinterfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.  Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products.â

Intel has so far failed to convince any  antitrust enforcement agency that its business practices are lawful and pro-consumer.

In 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) issued a 26 billion won  fine (approximately $25.4 million USD) saying that  Intelâs abuse of its dominant position included coercing and paying customers millions of dollars on the condition that they use only  Intel chips, delay launches of AMD products, and/or not develop any new products with AMD chips. The KFTC also found that, âSouth Korean consumers had to buy PCs at higher prices as domestic PC makers were forced to buy  Intelâs pricier CPU.â In addition to a fine, the KFTC ordered  Intel to stop the practice of offering payments to PC makers conditioned upon them not doing business with AMD.  Intel is in the process of appealing the ruling.
In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) ruled that  Intel had violated the countryâs
anti-monopoly laws by illegally forcing full or partial exclusivity with five Japanese PC makers.  Intel did
not appeal the ruling.

In the United States, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and New York Attorney Generalâs office are investigating  Intel for abuse of its monopoly position. In 2005, AMD filed private litigation in the US District Court of Delaware, which is scheduled for trial in spring 2010.

HD       European Commission Fines Intel $1.45 Billion for Abuse of Dominant  Position; Orders Intel to
Cease Illegal Practices

WASHINGTON - (BUSINESS WIRE) - The European Commission has imposed a fine of $1.45 billion (1.06 billion euros) on  Intel Corporation for violating EC Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position (Article 82) by engaging in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units (CPUs). The Commission has ordered Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing.

TD
Throughout the period October 2002-December 2007,  Intel had a dominant position in the worldwide x86
CPU market (at least 70% market share). The Commission found that  Intel engaged in two specific forms
of illegal practice. First,  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on
condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel. Intel also made direct payments to
a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs. Such rebates and payments
effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products.

Second,  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitorsâ x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products. The Commission found that these practices constituted abuses of  Intelâs dominant position on the x86
CPU market that harmed consumers throughout the EEA. By undermining its competitorsâ ability to compete on the merits of their products,  Intelâs actions undermined  competition and innovation. The Commission will actively monitor  Intelâs compliance with this decision. The world market for x86 CPUs is currently worth approximately 22 billion euros (US$ 30 billion) per year, with Europe accounting for approximately 30% of that.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."

The computer manufacturers concerned by  Intel's conduct in the Commissionâs decision are: Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the Media-Markt chain.
Conditional rebates and payments

Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies, at least in certain defined segments, from  Intel:

* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer A from December 2002 to December 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing exclusively  Intel CPUs

* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer B from November 2002 to May 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel (the remaining 5% that computer manufacturer B could purchase from rival chip maker AMD was then subject to further restrictive conditions set out below)
* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer C from October 2002 to November 2005 conditional on
this manufacturer purchasing no less than 80% of its CPU needs for its desktop and notebook computers
from Intel

Page 144 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer D in 2007 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing its
CPU needs for its notebook computers exclusively from  Intel.

Furthermore,  Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.

Certain rebates can lead to lower prices for consumers. However, where a company is in a dominant position on a market, rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival's products, or not buying them at all, are abusive according to settled case-law of the Community Courts unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify their application in the individual case.

In its decision, the Commission does not object to rebates in themselves but to the conditions  Intel attached to those rebates. Because computer manufacturers are dependent on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies, only a limited part of a computer manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements is open to competition at any given time.

Intel structured its pricing policy to ensure that a computer manufacturer which opted to buy AMD CPUs for that part of its needs that was open to  competition would consequently lose the rebate (or a large part of it) that  Intel provided for the much greater part of its needs for which the computer manufacturer had no choice but to buy from  Intel. The computer manufacturer would therefore have to pay  Intel a higher price for each of the units supplied for which the computer manufacturer had no alternative but to buy from Intel. In other words, should a computer manufacturer fail to purchase virtually all its x86 CPU requirements from Intel, it would forego the possibility of obtaining a significant rebate on any of its very high volumes of Intel purchases.

Moreover, in order to be able to compete with the  Intel rebates, for the part of the computer manufacturers' supplies that was up for grabs, a competitor that was just as efficient as  Intel would have had to offer a price for its CPUs lower than its costs of producing those CPUs, even if the average price of its CPUs was lower than that of  Intel.

For example, rival chip manufacturer AMD offered one million free CPUs to one particular computer manufacturer. If the computer manufacturer had accepted all of these, it would have lost  Intel's rebate on its many millions of remaining CPU purchases, and would have been worse off overall simply for having accepted this highly competitive offer. In the end, the computer manufacturer took only 160,000 CPUs for free.

As a result of  Intel's rebates, the ability of rival manufacturers to compete and innovate was impaired, and this led to reduced choice for consumers. Rebates such as those applied by  Intel are recognised in many jurisdictions around the world as anti-competitive and unlawful because the effect in practice is to deny consumers a choice of products.
Payments to prevent sales of specific rival products

Intel also interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.  Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products and/or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD-based products. The Commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market. The Commission found the following specific cases:
* For the 5% of computer manufacturer Bâs business that was not subject to the conditional rebate
outlined above,  Intel made further payments to computer manufacturer B provided that this manufacturer:
* sold AMD-based business desktops only to small and medium enterprises

* sold AMD-based business desktops only via direct distribution channels (as opposed to through distributors) and
* postponed the launch of its first AMD-based business desktop in Europe by 6 months.

* Intel made payments to computer manufacturer E provided that this manufacturer postponed the launch of an AMD-based notebook from September 2003 to January 2004.

* Before the conditional rebate to computer manufacturer D outlined above,  Intel made payments to this manufacturer provided that it postponed the launch of AMD-based notebooks from September 2006 to the end of 2006.

The Commission obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in  Intelâs contracts. Such proof is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence such as e-mails obtained inter alia from unannounced on-site inspections, in responses to formal requests for information and in a number of formal statements made
to the Commission by the other companies concerned. In addition, there is evidence that  Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.

x86 CPUs are the main hardware component of a computer. The decision contains a broad range of contemporaneous evidence that shows that AMD, essentially  Intel's only competitor in the market, was generally perceived, by computer manufacturers and by  Intel itself, to have improved its product range, to be a viable competitor, and to be a growing competitive threat. The decision finds that  Intel's practices did not constitute  competition on the merits of the respective  Intel and AMD products, but rather were part
of a strategy designed to exploit  Intel's existing entrenched position in the market.

Intelâs worldwide turnover in 2007 was 27.972 million euros (US$ 38.834 million). The  fine in this case takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement. In accordance with the Commission's 2006
Guidelines on Fines the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of  Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area (EEA). The duration of the infringement established in the decision is five years and three months.

The Commissionâs investigation followed complaints from AMD in 2000, 2003 and 2006 (the last having been sent to the German  competition authority and subsequently examined by the  European                 Commission). The Commission's decision follows a Statement of Objections sent in July 2007, a Supplementary Statement of Objections sent in July 2008 and a letter sent to  Intel in December 2008 setting out additional factual elements relevant to the final decision.  Intel's rights of defence have been fully respected in this case.

At the time, many auto-industry observers wondered whether "cultural differences" would torpedo the merger. After all, the bosses were Germans who also spoke English, whereas the bossed were Americans, almost all of whom spoke no German.

TD
In the event, the merger didn't succeed, though a good case can be made that it was doomed, not by cultural differences between the partners but by Chrysler's poor performance.

Two years ago Thursday - on May 14, 2007 - Daimler agreed to unload Chrysler to a group of venture capitalists called Cerberus Capital Management.

That deal also turned out to be a bomb, but not because everyone involved didn't employ English as a first language.
Those who don't remember the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.
It seems inconceivable but, as I write this, an Italian company, Fiat SpA, is dotting the i's and crossing
the t's in the documents that will give it control of Chrysler. More inconceivably, Fiat paid not one dime for
this control, but rather agreed to share with Chrysler its technology in compact-car development and
manufacturing.

I've been thinking of what we should call the new company. My choice is Fiatler because Fiat's the boss, but I have no objection to Chrysleriat because it hardly matters. This new entity isn't going to last for
long, in my humble opinion.

Fiat gets to market Chrysler's Jeep, which everyone around the world wants; Chrysler gets to make and market the Fiat Mouserino or some such car that few Americans want and even fewer Americans will want as fuel-efficiency and gasoline-substitution technology progress.

Thursday, to give you some idea of who's the dog in this new arrangement and who's the tail, Chrysler is going to announce the identities of 800 of its total 3,200 U.S. dealerships it is shutting down. According
to several news reports, Fiat selected the dealerships that will disappear.

Last year, when both Chrysler and General Motors began to receive the first installments of billions of dollars of U.S. government bailout money, I wrote that none of it would ever be paid back. That's more certain now than it's ever been. Or do you believe that Fiat, which is taking over Chrysler for nothing, is going to step up and pay the U.S. government the billions of dollars that U.S. taxpayers have unwittingly lent the company?

I don't believe the domestic elements of Chrysler USA are going to get along any better with their Italian bosses than they got along with their German bosses. What a stupid move this is. Officials of the Obama administration know it, but they're strutting around in public and patting themselves on the back as if they had saved Chrysler.

There is also this: Chrysler has filed for bankruptcy protection. Depending on which analyst you read, the company will be under the aegis of the bankruptcy court for a period that could be as brief as two months to as long as two years. No one will want to buy a vehicle from a bankrupt company, this despite the U.S. government's assurances that it will back the warranties on such vehicle.

QUESTION: Why is that? ANSWER: Why would consumers take a chance on the sanctity of the warranty and the availability of parts? They'll simply buy a Ford or Toyota or Honda instead.



What Did
Intel Do?

The European Union on Wednesday upheld its reputation for socking U.S. companies with huge  fines
for alleged antitrust violations.

The EU Commission has finedIntel Corp. $1.45 billion for giving rebates to computer manufacturers that bought its chips.

The EU's  competition commissioner ruled the rebates meant that  Intel was selling the chips for less than what it cost the company to produce them and that the rebates were aimed at dealing a body blow to its main chip rival in Europe, Advanced Micro Devices.  Intel is said to hold 80% of the European chip market.

It seems to me a ruling that outlaws manufacturer rebates extends the  antitrust umbrella to areas where it does not belong. American manufacturers offer rebates all the time. In many cases, consumers - by taking advantage of a rebate - can purchase a product for less than its cost of production. If rebates are
A-OK for microwave ovens, why aren't they A-OK for computer chips?
What the European Commission's ruling does is to penalize  Intel for excellence, just as in 2004 the EU
penalized Microsoft for thwarting competition.

Advanced Micro Devices should spend its time improving its products and marketing efforts, not in whining to the EU about the unfair advantage  Intel is taking of AMD.
The EU has proved once again it doesn't know the difference between honest  competition and
antitrust violations and that, furthermore, it doesn't care.



I've Heard This Song Before

"They would not listen/They did not know how/Perhaps they'll listen now" - "Vincent," Don McLean, 1971

As I get older and older, most reporters are getting younger and younger. It seems to me that five years ago most of them were in college.

Perhaps that is why I read and heard numerous stories Tuesday about "new concerns" and "fresh doubts" being raised about the survival of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. Officials of the Obama administration said that, absent legislative and executive action, Medicare would run out of money in 2017 and the Social Security trust fund will go bust by 2037.
In fact, there is nothing new or fresh about such concerns, doubts and worries. In 2004, the
then-chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, went up to Capitol Hill, where he told a
congressional committee that both Medicare and Social Security were in mortal danger and something
had to be done about it post haste.

"Greenspan, in remarks to the House Budget Committee, noted the recent surge in the deficit is particularly dangerous, coming less than a decade before Baby Boomers begin drawing on federal retirement benefits," CNN/Money reported on Feb. 26, 2004. "Greenspan said that, if the demographic shift is permanent - and rising longevity makes that a realistic prediction - then 'significant structural adjustments' to Social Security and Medicare would be needed, particularly since Medicare benefits could skyrocket as medical technology advances. He proposed some solutions that would reduce future Social Security benefits to retirees, including raising the ages at which retirement benefits are paid and changing the inflation measure used to index the payments."

Misty Macaroni Memories

Like me, Tom the Bomb at Wachovia also used to dine regally at a Horn & Hardart automat in New York
City. He emailed me:
"Jim: Born and raised in Manhattan, I remember the 'automats' well.

"You could not beat the coffee, and the mac and cheese was unbelievable. I also remember them as being very clean and civil.

"Other memories include Chock full o'Nuts' date nut and cream cheese sandwich and the Nedick's hotdogs. Almost as good as Papaya King, which unfortunately for a short time I lived across the street from."
Tom, I never did Nedick's, but I do remember many times having a sandwich of date nut bread with
cream cheese at a Chock full o'Nuts. Cream cheese and date nut bread is a slice of paradise. My mother
used to buy a loaf of Thomas's date nut bread and make it for me all the time at home. If I weren't a
diabetic, I'd have had it for breakfast this morning.

HD        Antitrust fine doesn't  change Intel-AMD balance

There's no question that the European Commission's $1.45 billion antitrust fine  against Intel is a lot of money. But don't expect Wednesday's antitrust enforcement move to radically change what you see when it's time to buy your next PC.

Antitrust actions can have a dramatic effect when a decision breaks a company into pieces, but the biggest factors in the rivalry between Intel and AMD--and increasingly Nvidia, too--is technology. So while AMD can be pleased with the European Commission's conclusion, it's got bigger worries.

TD
"They have a marketing problem. They need to increase size of their voice," said Technology Business Research analyst John Spooner. "And they've got to run faster than  Intel. They've got to have products that really are better and provide more value."

AMD has been tirelessly agitating for  antitrust actions against its larger rival, and it's made some headway. Japan and South Korea have come down against  Intel, and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States is involved in its own  Intel investigation--not its first. AMD also has its own private antitrust suit under way in Delaware.

But when it comes to taking on  Intel, a far bigger factor has been technology--not just processor designs, but also manufacturing skill and capacity that means chips can be priced competitively while still being profitable.

Market share changes Indeed,  AMD made its biggest recent inroads against Intel when AMD's Opteron and Athlon processors could outgun  Intel's Xeon and Pentium models, which used an outdated architecture. But Intel reclaimed that share once it modernized its designs at the same time AMD stumbled with its own manufacturing problems.

AMD's troubles continued into 2008, when it  installed Dirk Meyer as the new CEO and undertook a plan to spin off its manufacturing business.

But Wednesday's decision gave AMD a new cause for optimism, including the hope it will materially improve sales.

"We are hopeful that it will. When we have products people want to buy we won't be in position that's artificially constrained by payments competitors are making to exclude us," said Harry Wolin, AMD's senior vice president of legal affairs. He did add, though, that technology and business practices remain important: "We still have to deliver  fine products to our customers and treat our customers and partners well. We have to manufacture products with our partners."

Antitrust actions can change behavior, to be sure. Microsoft was largely unscathed by the U.S. Justice Department's  antitrust suit that began in the 1990s. But its legacy arguably lives on: the company is exercising some self-restraint when it comes to how strongly it promotes its online services through dominant widely used products such as Windows and Internet Explorer, and it's not because Microsoft doesn't fiercely want a stronger online presence.

But in a conference call with reporters,  Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini argued that the overall market dynamic isn't changing: technology still is king when computer makers decide whether to buy AMD or Intel chips.

Page 150 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Most customers buy from both suppliers today. Most customers buy more or less from each supplier depending on the quality of the product, the competitiveness of the product, and the pricing...that dynamic hasn't changed in my career at  Intel, which is 35 years. I don't expect it to change," Otellini said. "I don't think a customer is going to put him or herself at a disadvantage by buying an inferior or more costly products, just to try to walk a line that may be artificial."

Antitrust headaches The European Commission's Wednesday conclusions and  fine certainly didn't make life any easier for Intel's sales force, though. It concluded that  Intel used partially or completely hidden rebates to ensure computer makers would use  Intel chips exclusively or nearly so. It also concluded Intel paid computer makers to cancel or delay the introduction of products using rival chips.

"My experience with salespeople is they'll say anything to get a sale.  Intel now has to put some constraints on sales reps that would not be there if they had less than 70 percent market share in the European Union," said Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds. But that won't be enough to hobble  Intel. "Intel's biggest challenge is not getting rid of  competition, it's making sure of market growth."
The European Commission's move could further other actions against  Intel, too, Reynolds said.

AMD's private  antitrust case also alleges Intel rebates conditioned on exclusivity or near exclusivity and Intel payments conditioned on delaying AMD-based products, Wolin said--and any settlement awards or damages that  Intel might end up paying in that case would go to AMD, not wronged taxpayers. That
case is scheduled to go to trial in March 2010.
Though AMD's Wolin wouldn't comment on it, the Justice Department's new  antitrust leader, Christine
Varney, promised  tougher enforcement of antitrust regulations, too.

Intel strongly denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the  European Commission ruling. Otellini said the EU wouldn't accept some contrary evidence and suggested that its lack of written proof was lack of evidence, not of  Intel operating in secret.

Overall, though, just as  Intel's successes won't be erased by the  fine and ruling, AMD's problems won't be fixed by it. The lawyers may be paid well, but engineers still are at the heart of the microprocessor market.

North American markets opened lower Wednesday after disappointing U.S. retail sales figures, sending Canada's main index back below the 10,000 mark.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark, the S&P/TSX composite index, opened down 153.77 points, or 1.53 per cent, to 9,923.93.

TD
The Canadian dollar was down to 85.68 cents US after closing at 86.06 cents US Tuesday.
Oil prices fell to $58.46 US a barrel from its previous finish at $58.85 US Tuesday. Gold was down to
$921.10 US an ounce after closing at $923.90 US on Tuesday.

Sales of new vehicles in Canada jumped in March by the largest amount in 14 months, led mainly by truck purchases, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday. Sales were up 6.3 per cent to 122,194 units during the month, which was the biggest increase since January 2008.

Ian Pollick, economics strategist at TD Securities, called the report ``positive'' and, following Tuesday's better-than-expected trade surplus numbers, ``raises the tentative possibility of an outright positive
print for March GDP.

``During a recession, large ticket asset purchases are not a top priority,'' he said. ``However, deep discounts seem to be attracting would-be buyers into the market.''
Meanwhile, shares in ING Canada - one of Canada's biggest home and auto insurers - were down
$1.06, or 2.9 per cent, to $35.26 in early trading. It reported a first-quarter loss of $36.3 million on
Wednesday due to losses on investment hedges. The loss, which works out to 30 cents a share, is in
contrast to a profit of $23 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.

Chicago-based R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it would buy bankrupt commercial printer Quebecor World Inc.'s assets and properties for roughly $1.35 billion US in cash and stock. Montreal-based Quebecor filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2008. R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it would pay about $957 million US in cash, plus 30 million of its shares, which closed at $12.99 on Tuesday in New York.

In the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average was down 127.12 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 8,341.76, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 19.08 points, or 1.11 per cent, to 1,696.75 early Wednesday.

U.S. retail sales declined for the second straight month in April, falling by a worse-than-expected 0.4 per cent over the previous month. The decline follows a 1.3 per cent drop in March. Total retail sales have declined by 10.1 per cent compared to April 2008.

``Indeed, despite the resurgence in the level of consumer confidence over the past few months, U.S. consumer spending seems to be buckling under the weight of the worsening labour market conditions and weakening economy,''Millan Mulraine, economics strategist at TD Securities wrote in a report. However, he said the rising equity markets and the massive fiscal stimulus package, which is likely to start kicking in this quarter, will breathe new life into personal expenditures.

Overseas markets were mostly down Wednesday.  Intel Corp. was fined 1.06 billion euros ($1.68 billion Cdn) by the  European Commission on Wednesday, making it the biggest  antitrust fine imposed on an individual company. The company was also ordered it to halt illegal rebates to computer makers which has squeezed out  competition in Europe.  Intel's stocks were up one per cent to $15.42
US early Wednesday.

London's FTSE 100 index was down 83.90 points, or 1.90 per cent, to 4,341.64 at midday. In Frankfurt, Germany's DAX was down 131.80 points, or 2.72 per cent to 4,722.31, and the Paris CAC was down

CANADA:
Siemens division considers buying Nortel units

TD
MUNICH, Germany - Siemens Enterprise Communications, a joint venture between Siemens and U.S. financial investor Gores Group, is looking into buying parts of bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp., its chief executive said.

"The enterprise-client unit is interesting. We are looking into that," said chief executive James O'Neill, adding that the Nortel unit's business with the U.S. government was particularly appealing.

Germany-based Siemens Enterprise Communications, which is present in Europe and Asia, is trying to gain a foothold in U.S. markets even if the Nortel deal does not work out, O'Neill added.

Toronto-based Nortel, once the largest North American maker of telecommunications gear, filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the U.S. in January.
Quebecor Inc. reports lower quarterly profit

TORONTO - Media and telecom group Quebecor Inc. posted a lower quarterly profit on Wednesday because of a large one-time gain a year earlier, but said its strong cable business is helping it weather the recession.

Quebecor, which controls the Videotron cable company and the Sun Media chain of newspapers, said it earned $57.7 million, or 90 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31.

That was down from a profit of $428.4 million, or $6.66 a share, a year earlier. However, in the year-ago quarter, Quebecor recorded a one-time gain of $399.7 million from deconsolidating the results of insolvent commercial printer Quebecor World.

The deconsolidation - which essentially means Quebecor treats Quebecor World as "discontinued operations" on its books - took place after Quebecor World filed for bankruptcy protection in January
2008.
Sun Life expects more writedowns

TORONTO - Sun Life Financial Inc. will likely have more credit impairment writedowns through 2009, but the insurer is still well-positioned for growth, chief executive Donald Stewart said on Wednesday.

Speaking to a conference in New York, Stewart said charges such as those recorded in the company's first-quarter results last week will be seen again, though their magnitude is hard to gauge.

"We will take some pain. It's hard to know whether the credit impairment experienced in the first quarter are a run rate, but we would expect to see some degree of credit impairment in each quarter for the balance of 2009, and probably beyond that," Stewart said.
Brick takes a hit in first-quarter results



Page 154 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
EDMONTON - The Brick Group Income Fund lost $29.3 million in the first quarter as same store sales plunged 21 per cent.

The loss, worth eight cents a unit, came on $271.6 million in revenue, compared with a $4.4 million profit, or 20 cents a unit, on $327 million revenue in 2008.

CEO Kim Yost said management is preparing for continued adversity this year and taking appropriate measures to reduce the pressure on liquidity and pricing caused by volatile financial markets.

``While we don't expect any significant recovery in 2009, we do believe that The Brick will be positioned to demonstrate its relative strengths as consumer confidence returns,'' he said.

The fund's recent recapitalization during difficult financial times speaks to the strength of its underlying business, he said.
Leon's earnings down in Q1

OTTAWA - Leon's Furniture Ltd. reported a slight decline in revenue for the first quarter of 2008, which also contributed to lower earnings.

The Toronto-based furniture retailer reported a profit of $8.6 million, or 12 cents a share, for the first three months of the year. That was down from earnings of $11.1 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. That included a tax gain related to a land sale. Without the one-time item, earnings a year ago were $9.9 million, or 14 cents a share.
Revenue in the first quarter was $195.2 million, down 0.6 per cent from a year before. The company said the results were expected, given the economic downturn. Vancouver airport eliminated from Gatwick bidding
LONDON - Vancouver airport Services' bidding team was eliminated from the auction for BAA Ltd.'s
London Gatwick airport, a decision it called "bizarre in the extreme."

The Citi Infrastructure Investors' team, which includes Vancouver airport and John Hancock Life Insurance Co., made an uncompetitive offer with no assurances on deliverability, BAA said in a statement Wednesday.

The bid group, known as Lysander, said separately that it's still interested in buying Gatwick and has full funding for a purchase that would improve the site's passenger facilities.
UNITED STATES:
U.S. retail sales down for second month

WASHINGTON - Retail sales in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in April for a second month, indicating that rising unemployment is prompting consumers to conserve cash.

The 0.4 per cent decrease followed a revised 1.3 per cent drop in March that was larger than previously estimated, the U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday.

``It looks like consumers are losing momentum heading into the second quarter, and that is a very worrisome development,'' said Carl Riccadonna, an economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York. ``They have very significant headwinds, and No. 1 among them is that the labour market is far from turning the corner.''
U.S. foreclosure filings hit another record

SAN FRANCISCO - Foreclosure filings in the U.S. rose to a record for the second consecutive month in April as banks increased efforts to seize homes from delinquent borrowers.
A total of 342,038 properties received a default or auction notice or were seized last month, RealtyTrac
Inc. of Irvine, Calif., said Wednesday. One in 374 households got a filing, the highest monthly rate
since the property data service began issuing such reports in 2005.

``What you're seeing is the inevitable result of severe job losses,'' said Nicolas Retsinas, director of housing studies at Harvard University. ``Until we stem the job losses, we can expect to see continuing foreclosures.''
Foreclosure filings jumped 32 per cent from the year-earlier period, RealtyTrac said.

Dr Pepper profit beats analysts' estimates

ATLANTA - Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., the beverage maker spun off by Cadbury PLC last year, reported first-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates and raised its 2009 forecast after increasing prices and cutting expenses.

Earnings will be $1.70 to $1.78 US a share this year, excluding some items, the Plano, Texas-based company, which makes Hawaiian Punch and Mott's juice drinks among other things, said Wednesday. The company predicted earnings of as much as $1.67 a share in March.

``Markets and consumer sentiment appear to be on the mend,'' said CEO Larry Young said during a conference call.
Former Kmart CEO misled investors: SEC

SOUTHFIELD, Mich. - Former Kmart Corp. CEO Charles Conaway misled investors about the company's ability to pay its bills before its bankruptcy filing in 2002, a government lawyer told a jury.
The case is about ``deception, misrepresentation, half truths and omissions made to the public'' in a
2001 quarterly filing, Alan Lieberman, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, said
Wednesday at the start of a trial in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Conaway was responsible for the misstatements, Lieberman said.
``He was the top guy, hands-on,'' the lawyer told a jury of five men and five women. INTERNATIONAL:

Intel hit with record  antitrust fine

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Commission finedIntel Corp. a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.69 billion Cdn) on Wednesday and ordered it to halt illegal rebates and other practices used to squeeze out rival AMD.

"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for over five years, the size of the  fine should come as no surprise," said European Union  Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The EU executive said  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely  Intel chips, and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
Paul Otellini, CEO of Santa Clara, Calif.-based  Intel, said the company plans to appeal. OPEC cuts 2009 forecast for oil demand
LONDON - The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its 2009 forecast for oil demand for a ninth straight month as consumption shrinks in the U.S., the world's biggest energy consumer.

OPEC's estimate for global demand this year was lowered by 150,000 barrels a day to 84.03 million barrels a day, the producer group said. Demand will contract by 1.57 million barrels a day this year, or
1.8 per cent, compared to last year, it said.

While there may be a "slow recovery" in the global economy in the fourth quarter, U.S. demand continues to shrink, OPEC said. U.S. consumption dropped by 1.5 million barrels a day in April compared with the previous year, it said.
France comes down hard on Internet pirates

PARIS - France has passed one of the world's harshest laws against Internet piracy, giving the government the right to disconnect users who illegally download music and film.

The French Senate on Wednesday passed President Nicolas Sarkozy's bill with an overwhelming majority, after it was adopted Tuesday by parliament's lower house.

Under the law, users who download content without paying for it will get three warnings - an e-mail from a state agency, a letter and a third alert - before their Internet access is cut off for up to a year.

European Union  antitrust regulators have fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros, after finding the US
chipmaker guilty of illegal practices to squeeze its main rival out of European markets.

The European Commission has accused Intel of using illegal rebates to push rivals out of the computer processing unit (CPU) market. The CPU serves as the brain of a personal computer.

TD
The California-based company holds a dominant position in the market for x86 CPUs, a market that is worth around 22-billion-euros.  Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, held a 70-percent market share during the five years in which it stands accused of breaking EU  antitrust regulations.

"The commission found that  Intel abused its dominant position in the computer chips market," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said at a press conference in Brussels.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," she added.

Kroes said that  Intel had gone beyond normal price  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from  Intel.

EU antitrust regulators also accused  Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competing with  Intel's x86.

In addition,  Intel allegedly paid MediaMarkt, a major German electronics chain store, to stock computers with its chips.

The European Union's executive branch formally launched its anti-trust probe into  Intel in 2001, after rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices filed a complaint.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated,â Kroes said.

Intel has announced its intention to challenge the decision in EU courts.

The fine is the largest of its kind in EU history, topping the 899 million Microsoft was ordered to pay last year, for failing to cooperate with the  European Commission in its antitrust investigation.

HD            WSJ UPDATE:EU Hits Intel With EUR1.06B Antitrust Fine

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

European Union regulators hit Intel Corp. (INTC) with a EUR1.06 billion ($1.44 billion)  fine - the largest every assessed for monopoly abuse - and called for changes in the way the U.S. company sells the microprocessors at the heart of most of the world's PCs.

TD
Intel said it would appeal the  fine, but Wednesday's decision confirmed the EU's role as jurisdiction of choice for U.S. tech companies seeking redress from larger competitors, even as the new U.S. administration says it plans to get tougher in pursuing  monopoly practices.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said  Intel broke EU rules by using the threat of withdrawing rebates it offered to large computer manufacturers, its customers, to pressure them to
buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD).

Intel also paid manufacturers to delay the launch of AMD-based computers and paid a retailer, Media Saturn Holding, to sell only  Intel-based machines, the EU said. Media Saturn operates the Media Markt chain in Germany.

Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years, said Neelie Kroes, the EU's top  antitrust regulator. "If we smell that there is something rotten in the state, we act."

Besides the fine, which amounts to almost a fifth of the $7.792 billion in cash on the company's balance sheet, Intel was ordered not to offer the conditional rebates that the Commission deemed problematic. But the regulator left vague how it would police that order.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company had revenue of $37.6 billion in 2008.

The Intel decision in Europe comes as U.S. regulators jettison Bush-era legal guidance that led to narrow scrutiny of monopolists. In a speech Monday, Department of Justice  antitrust chief Christine Varney said regulators "cannot sit on the sidelines any longer." That could mean greater convergence with European regulators, who have been more willing to bring anti-monopoly actions, including a marathon case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Varney knows the field well: She represented
browser-maker Netscape in the U.S.  antitrust prosecution of Microsoft in the 1990s.

Kroes said the DoJ stance gave her a "huge positive feeling. The more  competition authorities joining us in our competition philosophy, the better it is," she said.

At its heart, the EU's case against  Intel is a classic monopoly prosecution:  Intel, the EU alleges, used its muscle - particularly with rebates - to push smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to the margins of the market.

Page 160 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In one case, the EU said,  Intel for two and a half years made rebates to one manufacturer conditional on that manufacturer "purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from  Intel." The EU said  Intel gave conditioned rebates to computer manufacturers Acer Inc. (ACEIY), Dell Inc. (DELL), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) and NEC Corp. (NIPNF).

Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement that the company takes "strong exception to this decision," which he called "wrong." He also stressed a point that  Intel has made regularly: that prices over the years have fallen for computers and chips. There has been "absolutely zero harm to consumers," he said.

Otellini didn't directly address rebates, but said thanks to investments in manufacturing facilities, "we can discount our products." He denied that  Intel sells below cost.

Intel said it would challenge the decision at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which hears appeals of the actions of the EU  antitrust regulator and other branches of EU's executive arm. The court process is likely to take years.

Getting this far hasn't been easy. Nearly nine years in the making, the case required even more gestation than the EU's seminal 2004 decision condemning Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for monopoly violations. Some career regulators inside the tech-industry unit of the EU's competition directorate have spent a decade on the two cases. Microsoft's  fine of EUR 497 million in 2004 was a record at the time for a  monopoly case; last year the EU added EUR 899 million to Microsoft's tab for not complying with the 2004 decision.

Intel's run-in with the EU began with a complaint from AMD in 2000, four years before Kroes, took up her post. The case nearly outlasted her: Kroes' term is scheduled to end this year.

Intel won't have to shell out cash for the  fine immediately; it can provide a bank guarantee for the amount, an  Intel spokesman said.

Monopoly-abuse cases are relatively rare in the EU system, and the appeal sets up the Court of First Instance for a significant ruling on the scope of  antitrust jurisprudence in Europe. In a series of cases earlier this decade, the court sharply rebuked the EU's merger-control procedures; the result has been a years-long dearth of challenges to mergers by the bloc.

But the court has given the EU regulator a far wider berth in  monopoly cases; In a critical 2007 ruling, it backed the EU's 2004 Microsoft decision. In that judgment, the court was disinclined to second-guess the EU's findings of law or fact, and endorsed a view that the regulator has broad authority to bring  monopoly cases so long as its reasoning is careful and thorough.
The legal issues in  Intel's appeal will be different, but the specter of Microsoft's loss will loom large.

Intel is likely to press its appeal on at least two fronts: One focus is likely to be the EU's economic analysis of the market. In closed-door proceedings,  Intel has laid out an alternate analysis that gets to a higher cost for its chips - an attempt to undermine the EU's argument that  Intel has effectively dumped low-cost chips on the market to thwart AMD.

Intel has also argued that the market functions well-when the company has technological advances, it gains share; when AMD surges ahead technologically, as it did with a move to so-called 64-bit chips, AMD reaps better sales.

Another focus will be the nature of any arrangements between  Intel and its customers.  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy says Intel will argue that deals weren't exclusive. Documents and other evidence not cited in the EU's decision, he says, cast the deals in a different light - in October,  Intel went to the Luxembourg court to seek to compel the EU to include these and other documents in its ruling. (The court declined to do so.)

Outwardly,  Intel has maintained a more cordial relationship with the EU than had Microsoft, which was quicker to express its frustration. But the two sides have nonetheless been tense and distant. While Microsoft's top executives shuttled to Brussels in a last-ditch attempt to work out a settlement, Intel hasn't had any settlement discussions. Otellini, has had only one, brief meeting with Kroes.

EU officials were frustrated that Intel went to court to seek inclusion of the additional documents, which they saw as a delaying tactic. Intel, for its part, has chafed at the less-adversarial way Europe polices companies: antitrust regulators at the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, have the authority to issue fines and order changes in behavior directly. In the U.S.,  antitrust enforcers bring actions before a judge or jury, and the two sides fight it out.

Intel's position in the market for microprocessor chips expanded after  Intel technology was selected by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) for its first line of personal computers, which came out in 1981. IBM, wary of relying on a single supplier for such a key component, required that  Intel license its so-called x86 technology to other manufacturers.

Intel and AMD, one of the licensees, have fought a series of legal battles since that relationship broke down in the late 1980s.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission began investigating  Intel's conduct in the next decade; in 1999
Intel settled allegations that it cut computer manufacturers with whom it had other disputes out of
patent licenses needed to build  Intel-based systems.

More recently, regulators around the world have been zeroing in on  Intel's system of discounts and incentives to manufacturers who build PCs and computer servers.

In 2005, regulators in Japan ruled that  Intel made illegal payments to manufacturers to induce them to limit purchases of AMD chips. Last year, South Korean regulators found that  Intel gave unfair discounts to manufacturers; Korea  fined Intel $25 million.

The FTC is also renewing its scrutiny. Last year it upgraded a long simmering probe to formal status, and FTC officials have been coordinating with their European counterparts. A private  antitrust suit filed by AMD, which dates to 2005, is in a Delaware federal court. Trial is scheduled for next year.

Intel said it would appeal the  fine, but Wednesday's decision confirmed the EU's role as jurisdiction of choice for U.S. tech companies seeking redress from larger competitors, even as the new U.S. administration says it plans to get tougher in pursuing  monopoly practices.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said  Intel broke EU rules by using the threat of withdrawing rebates it offered to large computer manufacturers, its customers, to pressure them to
buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD).

Intel also paid manufacturers to delay the launch of AMD-based computers and paid a retailer, Media Saturn Holding, to sell only  Intel-based machines, the EU said. Media Saturn operates the Media Markt chain in Germany.

Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years, said Neelie Kroes, the EU's top  antitrust regulator. "If we smell that there is something rotten in the state, we act."

Besides the fine, which amounts to almost a fifth of the $7.792 billion in cash on the company's balance sheet, Intel was ordered not to offer the conditional rebates that the Commission deemed problematic. But the regulator left vague how it would police that order.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company had revenue of $37.6 billion in 2008.

The Intel decision in Europe comes as U.S. regulators jettison Bush-era legal guidance that led to narrow scrutiny of monopolists. In a speech Monday, Department of Justice  antitrust chief Christine Varney said regulators "cannot sit on the sidelines any longer." That could mean greater convergence with European regulators, who have been more willing to bring anti-monopoly actions, including a marathon case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Varney knows the field well: She represented
browser-maker Netscape in the U.S.  antitrust prosecution of Microsoft in the 1990s.

Kroes said the DoJ stance gave her a "huge positive feeling. The more  competition authorities joining us in our competition philosophy, the better it is," she said.

At its heart, the EU's case against  Intel is a classic monopoly prosecution:  Intel, the EU alleges, used its muscle - particularly with rebates - to push smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to the margins of the market.

In one case, the EU said,  Intel for two and a half years made rebates to one manufacturer conditional on that manufacturer "purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from  Intel." The EU said  Intel gave conditioned rebates to computer manufacturers Acer Inc. (ACEIY), Dell Inc. (DELL), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) and NEC Corp. (NIPNF).

Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement that the company takes "strong exception to this decision," which he called "wrong." He also stressed a point that  Intel has made regularly: that prices over the years have fallen for computers and chips. There has been "absolutely zero harm to consumers," he said.

Otellini didn't directly address rebates, but said thanks to investments in manufacturing facilities, "we can discount our products." He denied that  Intel sells below cost.

Intel said it would challenge the decision at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which hears appeals of the actions of the EU  antitrust regulator and other branches of EU's executive arm. The court process is likely to take years.

"Intel is one of our suppliers, and we don't comment on a supplier," said Sven Jacobsen, a spokesman for Media Saturn Holding.

Getting this far hasn't been easy. Nearly nine years in the making, the case required even more gestation than the EU's seminal 2004 decision condemning Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for monopoly violations. Some career regulators inside the tech-industry unit of the EU's competition directorate have spent a decade on the two cases. Microsoft's  fine of EUR 497 million in 2004 was a record at the time for a  monopoly case; last year the EU added EUR 899 million to Microsoft's tab for not complying with the 2004 decision.

Intel's run-in with the EU began with a complaint from AMD in 2000, four years before Kroes, took up her post. The case nearly outlasted her: Kroes' term is scheduled to end this year.

Intel won't have to shell out cash for the  fine immediately; it can provide a bank guarantee for the amount, an  Intel spokesman said.

Monopoly-abuse cases are relatively rare in the EU system, and the appeal sets up the Court of First Instance for a significant ruling on the scope of  antitrust jurisprudence in Europe. In a series of cases earlier this decade, the court sharply rebuked the EU's merger-control procedures; the result has been a years-long dearth of challenges to mergers by the bloc.

But the court has given the EU regulator a far wider berth in  monopoly cases; In a critical 2007 ruling, it backed the EU's 2004 Microsoft decision. In that judgment, the court was disinclined to second-guess the EU's findings of law or fact, and endorsed a view that the regulator has broad authority to bring  monopoly cases so long as its reasoning is careful and thorough.
The legal issues in  Intel's appeal will be different, but the specter of Microsoft's loss will loom large.

Intel is likely to press its appeal on at least two fronts: One focus is likely to be the EU's economic analysis of the market. In closed-door proceedings,  Intel has laid out an alternate analysis that gets to a higher cost for its chips - an attempt to undermine the EU's argument that  Intel has effectively dumped low-cost chips on the market to thwart AMD.

Intel has also argued that the market functions well-when the company has technological advances, it gains share; when AMD surges ahead technologically, as it did with a move to so-called 64-bit chips, AMD reaps better sales.

Another focus will be the nature of any arrangements between  Intel and its customers.  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy says Intel will argue that deals weren't exclusive. Documents and other evidence not cited in the EU's decision, he says, cast the deals in a different light - in October,  Intel went to the Luxembourg court to seek to compel the EU to include these and other documents in its ruling. (The court declined to do so.)

Outwardly,  Intel has maintained a more cordial relationship with the EU than had Microsoft, which was quicker to express its frustration. But the two sides have nonetheless been tense and distant.


Page 168 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
While Microsoft's top executives shuttled to Brussels in a last-ditch attempt to work out a settlement,
Intel hasn't had any settlement discussions. Otellini, has had only one, brief meeting with Kroes.

EU officials were frustrated that Intel went to court to seek inclusion of the additional documents, which they saw as a delaying tactic. Intel, for its part, has chafed at the less-adversarial way Europe polices companies: antitrust regulators at the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, have the authority to issue fines and order changes in behavior directly. In the U.S.,  antitrust enforcers bring actions before a judge or jury, and the two sides fight it out.

Intel's position in the market for microprocessor chips expanded after  Intel technology was selected by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) for its first line of personal computers, which came out in 1981. IBM, wary of relying on a single supplier for such a key component, required that  Intel license its so-called x86 technology to other manufacturers.

Intel and AMD, one of the licensees, have fought a series of legal battles since that relationship broke down in the late 1980s.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission began investigating  Intel's conduct in the next decade; in 1999
Intel settled allegations that it cut computer manufacturers with whom it had other disputes out of
patent licenses needed to build  Intel-based systems.

More recently, regulators around the world have been zeroing in on  Intel's system of discounts and incentives to manufacturers who build PCs and computer servers.

In 2005, regulators in Japan ruled that  Intel made illegal payments to manufacturers to induce them to limit purchases of AMD chips. Last year, South Korean regulators found that  Intel gave unfair discounts to manufacturers; Korea  fined Intel $25 million.

The FTC is also renewing its scrutiny. Last year it upgraded a long simmering probe to formal status, and FTC officials have been coordinating with their European counterparts. A private  antitrust suit filed by AMD, which dates to 2005, is in a Delaware federal court. Trial is scheduled for next year.

On Wednesday, the European Commission finedIntel Corp. (INTC) EUR1.06 billion ($1.44 billion) for anti-competitive behavior.

The Commission charged that  Intel made illegal payments to manufacturers and retailers to gain preferential treatment for computers using its chips.

TD
The text of the  European Commission's statement Wednesday regarding its  fine of Intel for anti-competitive behavior follows:

Antitrust: Commission imposes fine of 1.06 bn on  Intel for abuse of dominant position; orders  Intel to cease illegal practices

The European Commission has imposed a fine of 1 060 000 000 on  Intel Corporation for violating EC Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position (Article 82) by engaging in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units (CPUs). The Commission has also ordered  Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing. Throughout the period October 2002-December
2007, Intel had a dominant position in the worldwide x86 CPU market (at least 70% market share). The Commission found that  Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice. First,  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from Intel. Intel also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs. Such rebates and payments effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products. Second,  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86
CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products. The Commission found that these practices constituted abuses of  Intel's dominant position on the x86 CPU market that harmed consumers throughout the EEA. By undermining its competitors' ability to compete on the merits of their products, Intel's actions undermined  competition and innovation. The Commission will actively monitor  Intel's compliance with this decision. The world market for x86 CPUs is currently worth approximately 22 billion (US$ 30 billion) per year, with Europe accounting for approximately 30% of that.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated".

The computer manufacturers concerned by  Intel's conduct in the Commission's decision are: Acer , Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), Lenovo (LNVGY) and NEC (NELTY). The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain.
Conditional rebates and payments

Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies, at least in certain defined segments, from  Intel:

- Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer A from December 2002 to December 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing exclusively  Intel CPUs

Page 170 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer B from November 2002 to May 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel (the remaining 5% that computer manufacturer B could purchase from rival chip maker AMD was then subject to further restrictive conditions set out below)
- Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer C from October 2002 to November 2005 conditional on
this manufacturer purchasing no less than 80% of its CPU needs for its desktop and notebook computers
from Intel
- Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer D in 2007 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing its
CPU needs for its notebook computers exclusively from  Intel.

Furthermore,  Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.

Certain rebates can lead to lower prices for consumers. However, where a company is in a dominant position on a market, rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival's products, or not buying them at all, are abusive according to settled case-law of the Community Courts unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify their application in the individual case.

In its decision, the Commission does not object to rebates in themselves but to the conditions  Intel attached to those rebates. Because computer manufacturers are dependent on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies, only a limited part of a computer manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements is open to competition at any given time.

Intel structured its pricing policy to ensure that a computer manufacturer which opted to buy AMD CPUs for that part of its needs that was open to  competition would consequently lose the rebate (or a large part of it) that  Intel provided for the much greater part of its needs for which the computer manufacturer had no choice but to buy from  Intel. The computer manufacturer would therefore have to pay  Intel a higher price for each of the units supplied for which the computer manufacturer had no alternative but to buy from Intel. In other words, should a computer manufacturer fail to purchase virtually all its x86 CPU requirements from Intel, it would forego the possibility of obtaining a significant rebate on any of its very high volumes of Intel purchases.

Moreover, in order to be able to compete with the  Intel rebates, for the part of the computer manufacturers' supplies that was up for grabs, a competitor that was just as efficient as  Intel would have had to offer a price for its CPUs lower than its costs of producing those CPUs, even if the average price of its CPUs was lower than that of  Intel.

For example, rival chip manufacturer AMD (AMD) offered one million free CPUs to one particular computer manufacturer. If the computer manufacturer had accepted all of these, it would have lost  Intel's rebate on its many millions of remaining CPU purchases, and would have been worse off overall simply for having accepted this highly competitive offer. In the end, the computer manufacturer took only
160,000 CPUs for free.

As a result of  Intel's rebates, the ability of rival manufacturers to compete and innovate was impaired, and this led to reduced choice for consumers.
Rebates such as those applied by  Intel are recognised in many jurisdictions around the world as
anti-competitive and unlawful because the effect in practice is to deny consumers a choice of products.
Payments to prevent sales of specific rival products

Intel also interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.  Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products and/or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD-based products. The Commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market. The Commission found the following specific cases:
- For the 5% of computer manufacturer B's business that was not subject to the conditional rebate
outlined above,  Intel made further payments to computer manufacturer B provided that this manufacturer
:
- sold AMD-based business desktops only to small and medium enterprises



Page 171 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- sold AMD-based business desktops only via direct distribution channels (as opposed to through distributors) and
- postponed the launch of its first AMD-based business desktop in Europe by 6 months.

- Intel made payments to computer manufacturer E provided that this manufacturer postponed the launch of an AMD-based notebook from September 2003 to January 2004.

- Before the conditional rebate to computer manufacturer D outlined above,  Intel made payments to this manufacturer provided that it postponed the launch of AMD-based notebooks from September 2006 to the end of 2006.

The Commission obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in  Intel's contracts. Such proof is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence such as e-mails obtained inter alia from unannounced on-site inspections, in responses to formal requests for information and in a number of formal statements made to the Commission by the other companies concerned. In addition, there is evidence that  Intel had
sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.

x86 CPUs are the main hardware component of a computer. The decision contains a broad range of contemporaneous evidence that shows that AMD, essentially  Intel's only competitor in the market, was generally perceived, by computer manufacturers and by  Intel itself, to have improved its product range,
to be a viable competitor, and to be a growing competitive threat. The decision finds that  Intel's practices did not constitute  competition on the merits of the respective  Intel and AMD products, but rather were part of a strategy designed to exploit  Intel's existing entrenched position in the market. [ 05-13-09
0816ET ]

Intel's worldwide turnover in 2007 was 27 972 million (US$ 38 834 million). The  fine in this case takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement. In accordance with the Commission's 2006
Guidelines on Fines (see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256) the  fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area (EEA). The duration of the infringement established in the decision is five years and three months.

The Commission's investigation followed complaints from AMD in 2000, 2003 and 2006 (the last having been sent to the German  competition authority and subsequently examined by the  European                Commission). The Commission's decision follows a Statement of Objections sent in July 2007 (see MEMO/07/314), a Supplementary Statement of Objections sent in July 2008 (see MEMO/08/517) and a letter sent to  Intel in December 2008 setting out additional factual elements relevant to the final decision. Intel's rights of defence have been fully respected in this case.

HD            3rd UPDATE: EU Hits Intel With EUR1.06B Antitrust Fine

(updates sixth paragraph to reflect the  fine in relation to the amount of cash and investments on the balance sheet)



By Charles Forelle
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

TD
European Union regulators hit Intel Corp. (INTC) with a EUR1.06 billion ($1.44 billion)  fine - the largest every assessed for monopoly abuse - and called for changes in the way the U.S. company sells the microprocessors at the heart of most of the world's PCs.

Intel said it would appeal the  fine, but Wednesday's decision confirmed the EU's role as jurisdiction of choice for U.S. tech companies seeking redress from larger competitors, even as the new U.S. administration says it plans to get tougher in pursuing  monopoly practices.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said  Intel broke EU rules by using the threat of withdrawing rebates it offered to large computer manufacturers, its customers, to pressure them to
buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD).

Intel also paid manufacturers to delay the launch of AMD-based computers and paid a retailer, Media Saturn Holding, to sell only  Intel-based machines, the EU said. Media Saturn operates the Media Markt chain in Germany.

Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years, said Neelie Kroes, the EU's top  antitrust regulator. "If we smell that there is something rotten in the state, we act."

Besides the  fine, which amounts to about one-seventh of the $10.6 billion in cash and investments on the company's balance sheet,  Intel was ordered not to offer the conditional rebates that the Commission deemed problematic. But the regulator left vague how it would police that order.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company had revenue of $37.6 billion in 2008.

The Intel decision in Europe comes as U.S. regulators jettison Bush-era legal guidance that led to narrow scrutiny of monopolists. In a speech Monday, Department of Justice  antitrust chief Christine Varney said regulators "cannot sit on the sidelines any longer." That could mean greater convergence with European regulators, who have been more willing to bring anti-monopoly actions, including a marathon case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Varney knows the field well: She represented
browser-maker Netscape in the U.S.  antitrust prosecution of Microsoft in the 1990s.

Kroes said the DoJ stance gave her a "huge positive feeling. The more  competition authorities joining us in our competition philosophy, the better it is," she said.

At its heart, the EU's case against  Intel is a classic monopoly prosecution:  Intel, the EU alleges, used its muscle - particularly with rebates - to push smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to the margins of the market.
Page 185 of 226 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In one case, the EU said,  Intel for two and a half years made rebates to one manufacturer conditional on that manufacturer "purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from  Intel." The EU said  Intel gave conditioned rebates to computer manufacturers Acer Inc. (ACEIY), Dell Inc. (DELL), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) and NEC Corp. (NIPNF).

Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement that the company takes "strong exception to this decision," which he called "wrong." He also stressed a point that  Intel has made regularly: that prices over the years have fallen for computers and chips. There has been "absolutely zero harm to consumers," he said.

Otellini didn't directly address rebates, but said thanks to investments in manufacturing facilities, "we can discount our products." He denied that  Intel sells below cost.

Intel said it would challenge the decision at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which hears appeals of the actions of the EU  antitrust regulator and other branches of EU's executive arm. The court process is likely to take years.

"Intel is one of our suppliers, and we don't comment on a supplier," said Sven Jacobsen, a spokesman for Media Saturn Holding.

Getting this far hasn't been easy. Nearly nine years in the making, the case required even more gestation than the EU's seminal 2004 decision condemning Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for monopoly violations. Some career regulators inside the tech-industry unit of the EU's competition directorate have spent a decade on the two cases. Microsoft's  fine of EUR 497 million in 2004 was a record at the time for a  monopoly case; last year the EU added EUR 899 million to Microsoft's tab for not complying with the 2004 decision.

Intel's run-in with the EU began with a complaint from AMD in 2000, four years before Kroes, took up her post. The case nearly outlasted her: Kroes' term is scheduled to end this year.

Intel won't have to shell out cash for the  fine immediately; it can provide a bank guarantee for the amount, an  Intel spokesman said.

Monopoly-abuse cases are relatively rare in the EU system, and the appeal sets up the Court of First Instance for a significant ruling on the scope of  antitrust jurisprudence in Europe. In a series of cases earlier this decade, the court sharply rebuked the EU's merger-control procedures; the result has been a years-long dearth of challenges to mergers by the bloc.

But the court has given the EU regulator a far wider berth in  monopoly cases; In a critical 2007 ruling, it backed the EU's 2004 Microsoft decision. In that judgment, the court was disinclined to second-guess the EU's findings of law or fact, and endorsed a view that the regulator has broad authority to bring  monopoly cases so long as its reasoning is careful and thorough.
The legal issues in  Intel's appeal will be different, but the specter of Microsoft's loss will loom large.

Intel is likely to press its appeal on at least two fronts: One focus is likely to be the EU's economic analysis of the market. In closed-door proceedings,  Intel has laid out an alternate analysis that gets to a higher cost for its chips - an attempt to undermine the EU's argument that  Intel has effectively dumped low-cost chips on the market to thwart AMD.

Intel has also argued that the market functions well-when the company has technological advances, it gains share; when AMD surges ahead technologically, as it did with a move to so-called 64-bit chips, AMD reaps better sales.

Another focus will be the nature of any arrangements between  Intel and its customers.  Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy says Intel will argue that deals weren't exclusive. Documents and other evidence not cited in the EU's decision, he says, cast the deals in a different light - in October,  Intel went to the Luxembourg court to seek to compel the EU to include these and other documents in its ruling. (The court declined to do so.)

Outwardly,  Intel has maintained a more cordial relationship with the EU than had Microsoft, which was quicker to express its frustration. But the two sides have nonetheless been tense and distant. While Microsoft's top executives shuttled to Brussels in a last-ditch attempt to work out a settlement, Intel hasn't had any settlement discussions. Otellini, has had only one, brief meeting with Kroes.

EU officials were frustrated that Intel went to court to seek inclusion of the additional documents, which they saw as a delaying tactic. Intel, for its part, has chafed at the less-adversarial way Europe

polices companies: antitrust regulators at the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, have the authority to issue fines and order changes in behavior directly. In the U.S.,  antitrust enforcers bring actions before a judge or jury, and the two sides fight it out.

Intel's position in the market for microprocessor chips expanded after  Intel technology was selected by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) for its first line of personal computers, which came out in 1981. IBM, wary of relying on a single supplier for such a key component, required that  Intel license its so-called x86 technology to other manufacturers.

Intel and AMD, one of the licensees, have fought a series of legal battles since that relationship broke down in the late 1980s.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission began investigating  Intel's conduct in the next decade; in 1999
Intel settled allegations that it cut computer manufacturers with whom it had other disputes out of
patent licenses needed to build  Intel-based systems.

More recently, regulators around the world have been zeroing in on  Intel's system of discounts and incentives to manufacturers who build PCs and computer servers.

In 2005, regulators in Japan ruled that  Intel made illegal payments to manufacturers to induce them to limit purchases of AMD chips. Last year, South Korean regulators found that  Intel gave unfair discounts to manufacturers; Korea  fined Intel $25 million.

The FTC is also renewing its scrutiny. Last year it upgraded a long simmering probe to formal status, and FTC officials have been coordinating with their European counterparts. A private  antitrust suit filed by AMD, which dates to 2005, is in a Delaware federal court. Trial is scheduled for next year.

European Union  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is seeking to fineIntel  Corp. (INTC) more than EUR1 billion ($1.36 billion) for breaking European  antitrust rules, Bloomberg News reported on its Web site Tuesday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the case.

TD
The fine, which would be a record, could be reduced, Bloomberg reported the person as saying. The  fine
could be changed because of its size and the nature of rebate-related  antitrust cases, it said.
The European Commission is due to make the ruling known Wednesday, Bloomberg said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Intel Corp. (INTC) will have to pay a record  fine of EUR1.06 billion for breaking European antitrust laws, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

The executive arm of the European Union, found the world's largest computer chip maker illegally kept its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), of Sunnyvale, Calif. out of  competition by paying computer manufacturers and retailers not to use AMD's products.

TD
The commission found  Intel provided rebates to computer makers on condition they bought most - often up to 95% - of their computer chips from  Intel. Intel also made direct payments to major retail chain MediaMarkt so it would only sell computers with Intel's chips, the commission said.

Intel also paid computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of the residual number of computers which contained AMD's chips in order to even further reduce customer choice, the commission said.
The commission has ordered  Intel to stop these practices immediately, and said it would actively monitor
Intel's compliance with its decision.

The computer manufacturers which  Intel used to give payments to are: Acer (2353.TW), Dell (DELL), Hewlet Packard (HPQ), Lenovo (0992.HK) and NEC Corp.(6701.TO).

'Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the E.U.'s  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated,' said  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The commission estimates the world market in the specific chip set in question, namely the x86 CPUs, to be worth about EUR22 billion (or $30 billion) a year, with Europe accounting for approximately 30% of that.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: Stock futures indicate a flat to slightly lower start Wednesday, with investors expecting another busy session amid a raft of economic data.

"The major focus will be the retail sales numbers," said Ian Griffiths, dealer at spreadbettor CMC Markets. With Wal Mart results due Thursday, retailers will be in focus over the next couple of days, he said.

TD
Mortgage applications, import prices and oil inventory data are also due for release Wednesday.

"Investors will be looking for the Dow to push back through 8,500 and continue to rally up towards the highs of the year but after such a strong run it seems that the markets are running low on fuel," Griffiths said. "Opinion is beginning to change about the near-term future of global equity markets with many believing we have now hit the top of the rally," he said.

At 1035 GMT, S&P 500 futures were down 2.7 points at 904.1, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 9 points at 1376 and Dow industrial futures were down 21 points at 8415.

EUROPEAN MARKETS: European markets are lower around midday. Cyclical stocks, such as financials, weigh on the indexes, with ING Groep down 6.7%, Fortis 4.9% lower and BNP Paribas down
4.3%.
London's FTSE 100 is down 0.6% at 4399.04, as the market assesses the Bank of England's Inflation
Report. Rob Carnell, economist at ING Bank said the BOE's prediction of a return to modest growth in
2010 and above-trend growth in 2011-2012 is a little optimistic.
In Frankfurt, the DAX is down 0.8% at 4815.9, while in Paris, the CAC 40 is down 0.3% at 3220.3. Bunds and gilts are higher as European equities retreat. At 1029 GMT, June bunds were up 0.21 at
120.83 and June gilts were up 0.70 at 119.78.
Credit rating worries have hit the dollar, leaving it lower against most other majors in Europe. At 1029
GMT, the dollar was down at Y96.15, the euro was up at $1.3650, and the pound was down at
$1.5180.
