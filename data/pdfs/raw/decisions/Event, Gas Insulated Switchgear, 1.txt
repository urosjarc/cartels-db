PARIS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission is investigating an alleged  cartel in some electrical equipment and parts, according to the Web site of French business daily La Tribune.

According to the newspaper, at least three French firms are involved in the probe -  Alstom  SA (1022047.FR), Schneider Electric SA (12197.FR) and nuclear giant Areva (427583.FR).

TD
In its article, published Tuesday, La Tribune said the investigation also involves other big industrial groups, including  ABB Electric Industries,  Siemens AG (SI), Hitachi  Capital Corp. (8586.TO), Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), Japan AE Power and Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO).

La Tribune said the E.U. is thought to have questioned the firms on pricing practices and market share for isolation gas switchers and parts for electrical sub-stations outside the U.S.
Firms involved in the enquiry could face  fines if found guilty, the newspaper reported. Newspaper Web site:  http://www.latribune.fr

SUMMARY

The legal system is highly effective in dealing with business disputes, reaching decisions quickly. No favouritism is shown to domestic companies on legal matters, and contracts are easily enforceable. There is virtually no risk that foreign assets will be expropriated. The government will continue to promote competition generally, although the existence of powerful government-linked-companies in many sectors will distort matters. Intellectual property rights are reasonably well protected, although the penalties for infringement may be too light. Private property rights are well respected. Companies' financial statements are reasonably revealing, particularly in the financial sector. There is no risk of a large number of price controls being imposed at a time of economic stress.
SCENARIOS
The courts' political decisions provoke international condemnation, and calls for business boycotts (Low
Risk)

In dealing with business issues, Singapore's courts are effective, fair-minded and responsible. But when they move into the political arena--in punishing opposition members of parliament (MPs) for defamation, for example--they appear less impressive to liberal Western eyes. In the latter part of 2002 a leading opposition politician, Chee Soon Juan, was  fined. In January 2005 he was told to pay over $S500,000 in damages: he has been unable to pay. The defamation suits and the related  fines and costs have resulted in Mr Chee's bankruptcy (a court case in September, where the damages Mr Chee must pay were to be reviewed, ruled against him). Moreover, in April he failed to get the bankruptcy order annulled. He was therefore banned from standing as an MP in the May 2006 parliamentary elections. There are also signs
that the government is considering tightening laws relating to the use of the Internet and public gatherings. In November it released proposals that would give the authorities greater powers to prosecute offenders who violated these laws. Of particular concern is that the definition of what constitutes an offence will become more ambiguous. Nevertheless, there is a low risk that a heavy-handed response to political dissent forces would push Western governments into a condemnation of the Singaporean political system, and that some Western groups demand a boycott of business with Singapore. Foreign businesses should be able to demonstrate to such groups that they do not pander to the Singaporean government on operational matters.
Slower economic growth holds back the deregulation process (Low Risk)

Slower economic growth than presently forecast could hold back government efforts to deregulate the economy. The stock-market has been showing signs of life in recent quarters, but remains vulnerable to swings in investor confidence towards regional currencies and economies. Until the government is sure that it will receive what it considers fair valuations it will proceed cautiously with the partial flotation of
state-owned companies. The government may also face domestic political concerns (probably unfounded)
that deregulation will lead to higher utilities prices. Foreign firms should be prepared for delays or partial

reverses to the previously promised deregulation, but the overall direction of government policy is not likely to change.
BACKGROUND
(Updated: September 8th, 2006) Enforceability of Contracts
Contractual arrangements in Singapore are secure, and the professionalism and efficiency of key agencies are widely acknowledged. Singapore’s judicial system comprises the Supreme Court (which consists of the High Court and the Court of Appeals) and the subordinate courts. The High Court has both original and appellate jurisdiction for civil and criminal matters. The subordinate courts comprise the
district courts, the magistrates’ courts, the coroners’ court, the juvenile court and the small-claims tribunal. Singapore is known for its tough laws, strict enforcement and stiff penalties for offenders, and it exercises expedient and efficient procedures.

Singapore is well recognised for having one of the best business environments in the world. It ranked fifth in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2005–06 and second in the World Competitiveness Index 2005 of the International Institute for Management Development, based in Switzerland. A.T. Kearney and Foreign Policy magazine’s Globalisation Index 2005 gave Singapore its top ranking, and the Economist Intelligence Unit’s business environment rankings for 2006–10 rate it the “second-best business location in Asia” (after Hong Kong).
Independence of the Judiciary

According to the 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International, based in Berlin, Singapore retained its ranking as the least-corrupt country in Asia and the fifth-least-corrupt country in the world (behind Finland, New Zealand, Denmark and Iceland). In comparison, Malaysia ranked 39th and Indonesia 137th. Cases of corruption are dealt with harshly, swiftly and publicly. Singaporean companies have some of the highest levels of corporate transparency and disclosure in the Asia–Pacific region, according to Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Transparency and Disclosure Standards Survey. The
survey compares the transparency and disclosure levels of companies in the S&P Asia Pacific 100 index, based on corporate reporting for 2000.

The judiciary is experienced, well-qualified and independent, especially in commercial and business matters. Singapore’s ruling political party, however, is not very tolerant of dissent, and will often file defamation charges against opposition political figures. The courts, in this limited sphere, may feel political pressure to rule in the government’s favour.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

All industries are open to foreign investment in Singapore’s free-enterprise economy. The government has long realised that Singapore’s economic interests are best served by welcoming multinational companies and allowing them to operate with a minimum of constraint. There are few restrictions on equity, licensing and joint ventures. Local business, the media and the general public strongly welcome foreign investment. By promoting its location and world-class transportation, telecommunications and financial infrastructures, Singapore has successfully marketed itself to foreign investors as a regional entrepot and is campaigning to replace Hong Kong as the main business hub in East Asia outside Japan.

According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s 2005 Economic Survey of Singapore, fixed-asset investment commitments in manufacturing (which has the most foreign direct investment) were S$8.5bn in
2005, up from S$8.3bn in 2004. Foreign investment accounted for 75% of that; local investors accounted for the remaining 25%. The top foreign investors in terms of net investment commitments in manufacturing were the United States (25%),  Europe (24%) and Japan (15%). In services, Singapore attracted S$2.5bn in total business spending in 2005. Major contributors to total business spending were headquarters and business services (38%), communication and media industries (29%), and logistics and
supply-chain-management companies (17%). International confidence in Singapore as an investment destination continues to be strong, and there is growing investment interest from emerging economies in Asia–Pacific (particularly from China and India).

As at mid-2006 more than 4,000 multinational companies had chosen Singapore as their global or regional headquarters bases. Since its inauguration in 1986 by the Economic Development Board (EDB), the Headquarters (HQ) Programme has welcomed more than 350 companies from a wide spectrum of industries. The EDB unveiled a new and enhanced HQ programme in January 2003: the International Headquarters Award, to attract more company HQ operations to Singapore. The following five companies were awarded Regional HQ status in the first few months of 2006: The GMP Group, Hardware Zone, iNETest Resources, Ntegrator (all local) and LAI Games International (Australia).

The government sees life sciences as a crucial pillar of manufacturing. Singapore plans to be home to 15 global life-sciences manufacturing plants by 2010, and the new target for the biomedical sciences industry is S$25bn in manufacturing output and employment of 15,000 by 2015. Bio*One Capital (Singapore), a subsidiary of Singapore EDB Investments, continues to boost the industry through its co-investment activities. Bio*One Capital’s investment arm committed a total of S$95m in 2004 (latest available data) to
16 projects, including both investments and follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies. Almost all the investments were made in companies based in Singapore and in overseas projects with links to and activities in Singapore. Biopolis, Singapore’s state-of-the-art biomedical centre, began operations in October 2003. When fully operational, Biopolis is expected to house nearly 2,000 researchers. Occupancy at Biopolis, is now almost full. Construction of Phase 2 of Biopolis, which will provide an additional 300,000 sq feet of space, is targeted to be completed by end-2006.

Many world-class pharmaceuticals firms have set up operations in Singapore: AstraZeneca (UK), Aventis (France), GlaxoSmithKline (UK), Kaneka (Japan), Novo Nordisk (Denmark), Pfizer (US), Pharmacia (acquired by Pfizer in April 2003) and Sanofi-Synthelabo (France). Pfizer opened a multi-purpose manufacturing facility in July 2004, making Singapore home to the company’s first large-scale active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant in Asia. Leading medical-technology companies include Applied Biosystems, Baxter, BD (Becton Dickinson), Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Ciba Vision, Johnson & Johnson Medical, Tyco Healthcare (all US), Japan Medical Supply and  Siemens Medical Instruments (Germany). MDS Sciex, a subsidiary of Canada’s MDS, announced in September 2004 that it would set up a facility in Singapore to produce its industry-leading mass spectrometers—its first facility outside Canada. In April 2006 Abbott, a healthcare company based in the US, announced that it would build a state-of-the-art nutritional-powder manufacturing plant in Singapore with an investment of S$450m.

Singapore also aims to become a world-class medical hub. The National University Hospital (NUH) and Johns Hopkins Singapore (the local branch of a US university) joined in November 2000 to establish the Johns Hopkins–NUH International Medical Centre. To attract more patients and healthcare providers, specialist centres have been developed, including the Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Heart Centre and National Skin Centre. The National University of Singapore (NUS) signed an agreement in April 2005 with Duke University in the US to establish the NUS Graduate Medical School.

International investor confidence in Singapore as a location for investments in electronics and precision engineering remains strong. The electronics sector attracted fixed-asset investment of S$4.4bn in 2005, and the precision-engineering sector attracted investments of S$4.2m, according to the Economic Development Board.

Singapore’s venture-capital (VC) industry continued to expand in 2005. A total of S$17.5bn in VC funds was managed out of Singapore, up from S$16.1bn in 2004. The number of VC firms increased to 165 in
2005, from 157 in 2004. VC firms made 38 new investments in companies based in Singapore during
2005, increasing to 894 the total number of Singapore’s VC-backed companies.

Logistics and supply-chain management is another of the so-called clusters that Singapore is promoting. Its well-equipped and efficient airport and seaport have been instrumental in transforming the country into a logistics hub. The city-state’s strategic location has helped develop a community of more than 3,000 international and local logistics companies. Nevertheless, Singapore’s pre-eminence as the regional logistics hub is under threat by Malaysia’s ambitions to position itself in a similar role. The government announced plans in 2004 to invest S$50m to develop an integrated information technology (IT) platform for the trade and logistics industry.
In the 2005 budget, released in February 2005, the government announced that, beginning January 1st
2006, it would expand the Bonded Warehouse Scheme (BWS) and lift the requirement that 80% of goods
be exported from bonded warehouses. This will provide logistics companies with more flexibility in storing
and moving goods between pre-approved warehouses.

Singapore also has ambitions to become a world-class science and technology centre, and IT companies are being encouraged to use Singapore as a springboard to the region. iN2015, a new blueprint for the industry, was unveiled in March 2005. The ten-year master plan maps out key technology areas that will best benefit Singapore’s industries, economy and society (see Growth of e-commerce for details).

Singapore also aims to become a premier wealth-management centre. In the 2005 budget, the government announced new incentives for specific areas. Start-up fund managers will benefit from a
12-month grace period before they have to meet the requirement that 80% of the value of their funds must come from foreign investors, and qualifying philanthropic trusts will be exempt from tax on specific income. Singapore is already an attractive site for support centres hosting higher-end activities, particularly for financial institutions. Ten banks centralised their regional and global processing operations in Singapore in
2003.

Goh Chok Tong, former prime minister and now chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, noted in March 2005 that Singapore’s position as an international financial centre cannot be deemed certain unless the country offers some Islamic banking products. To make Singapore’s tax system more conducive to Islamic transactions, the 2005 budget removed the stamp duties incurred in Islamic-finance transactions that involve real property. In addition, payouts from Islamic bonds have been accorded the same concessionary tax treatment since January 2005 that was granted to interest arising from conventional financing.

Singapore aims to enhance its position as a total business centre by developing business parks. Its efforts to develop the surrounding Riau Archipelago of Indonesia have included the opening of a 500-hectare, S$600m industrial park on Batam Island in 1991 by Batamindo Investment, a joint venture between
state-owned Singapore Technologies and the Salim Group of Indonesia. The park is equipped with its own power station and microwave tower. Another joint venture was established between Tata Industries
(India), the international arm of the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) and the Karnataka state government
(in India) to form the International Tech Park Bangalore.

Singapore’s progress as a regional media hub has seen some positive developments. The media industry was given a boost with the formation on January 1st 2003 of the Media Development Authority (MDA) and the rollout of the Media 21 Plan, a blueprint to develop Singapore into a global media city. A slew of
foreign production companies had already established bases in Singapore in 2003. These included Pilot Film & TV Productions (UK), MidiTech and UTV (both India) and Bang Productions, which relocated from Hong Kong. The Korean Broadcasting  Commission (KBC) signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2005 with the MDA to co-operate in the field of broadcasting.

In the 2005 budget, the government reaffirmed the importance of rejuvenating tourism and retail trade to take advantage of the booming Asia–Pacific travel markets—especially those of China and India. In April
2005 the government approved the country’s long-awaited proposed casino, ending a 40-year ban on casino gambling. Two massive casino resorts (one at Marina Bay and one at Sentosa Island) will be developed and will become fully operational in 2009. Total investment could reach S$3bn, and up to
38,000 jobs could be created, according to the government.
The 2006 budget did not include any major investment-promotion incentives.
According to the US Department of Commerce, US investments in Singapore saw a return on assets of
13.8% in 2004, up from 11.9% in 2003.

There are no local-content requirements, but the government has introduced schemes to upgrade local industries to encourage greater use of local supplies by multinational companies. For example, in awarding licences for new cellular and paging services, multinationals were required to tie up with a local partner.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Singapore has no antitrust or other laws at present to regulate competition. But under its free-trade agreement obligations with the United States, Singapore enacted, with force from January 1st 2005, a competition law that would require its government-linked companies (GLCs) to refrain from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The law will be implemented in three phases. Provisions establishing the Competition  Commission of Singapore, a new statutory board, came into force on January 1st 2005. Provisions on the following areas came into force on January 1st 2006: anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices; abuse of dominance; enforcement; appeal processes; and other miscellaneous areas. The remaining provisions, on mergers and acquisitions, will come into force on an unspecified date no sooner than January 2007. Many local firms argue that GLCs have an unfair advantage in the
marketplace, even if they do not have an actual monopoly. For example, Singapore Food Industries, which is owned by the military, started as a supplier of military provisions and now competes with private-sector food suppliers. Singapore Automotive Engineering, formerly the army’s vehicle-repair depot, now sells forklifts and Opel cars and competes with the private sector.

Although there is no competition law, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the de facto central bank, imposes restrictions on foreign banks establishing additional sub-branches and off-premise automated teller machines. This is because the MAS considers Singapore over-banked, and foreign banks account for more than half of domestic banking business.

For many years, Singapore was known for its oligopolistic environment: a few state-linked firms dominated many important sectors. But with the emergence of the new knowledge-based economy, the government has been removing these barriers and encouraging liberalisation. Singapore recently liberalised the media, telecommunications and electricity sectors (see State role in the economy).

In February 2005 the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) amended the Telecoms Competition Code to enhance competition by removing unnecessary regulations in competitive market segments, and by strengthening regulatory provisions in segments with limited competition. The IDA also issued advisory guidelines on procedures for dispute resolution and assessment of proposed changes in ownership and consolidations. In market segments where there is effective competition, the IDA plans to scale back its regulatory role. But it will still monitor developments and maintain regulatory oversight in segments lacking effective competition.

The government does not tolerate any hint of price gouging or monopoly practices by the private sector. It reserves the right to step in when it deems a situation contrary to the public interest, but this seldom affects multinational companies. For example, to reform a  cartel among local firms, the Ministry of National Development in 1990 introduced an auction system for supplies of fresh pork.

The relevant provisions of the Competition Act have been in force since January 1st 2006; the Competition Commission of Singapore enforces the provisions. The act prohibits agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices that lead to the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. Any conduct by one or more undertakings that constitutes the abuse of a dominant position in any market also is prohibited. This includes predatory behaviour towards competitors; limiting production, markets or technical development to the disadvantage of consumers; applying
dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; and making the conclusion of contracts subject to the acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations that have no connection with the subject of the contracts.
Intellectual Property Rights

Singapore already offered relatively good protection of intellectual property (IP), and its record improved further under the free-trade agreement (FTA) it signed with the United States in May 2003. An IP
Task-force was set up in June 2003 to provide a platform for open dialogue on the effect of new legislation resulting from the FTA. Significant changes to Singapore’s IP laws were implemented in January 2005, including the extension of authors’ copyright protection by 20 years, the introduction of a mechanism to trademark scents and sounds, and the imposition of stiffer penalties for copyright infringement and piracy.

The city-state is known for its strong legal system, and several institutions deal specifically with IP: the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), Singapore International Arbitration Centre, the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore, the Recording Industry Association (Singapore) and the Singapore Mediation Centre. The IP Task-force was established in June 2003 as a platform for open dialogue on new legislation resulting from the US–Singapore FTA. The task-force comprises seven leading business associations and five statutory boards.

The government stepped up enforcement and raids on sellers of counterfeit items during the late 1980s. Although counterfeit goods are still sold, they are increasingly hard to find. In the past, Singapore left enforcement to the private sector: companies employed lawyers and private investigators to go after counterfeiters and called in the authorities during the final stages. Industry associations such as the Business Software Alliance have joined the fight against infringement by actively seeking injunctions against violators. Many of these groups felt that the government should be more active in carrying out raids rather than just sanctioning searches. In response, the government established an IP rights unit under the commercial crime unit. The IPOS has been a full-fledged statutory board since April 2001. The IPOS signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2003 on bilateral co-operation with the European Patent Office to raise IP awareness and to train and develop IP expertise.

The government’s approach to protecting intellectual property combines comprehensive laws, strict enforcement and stiff penalties. Under the Copyright Act, persons found guilty of manufacturing, distributing or selling infringing articles of any work in which copyright exists are liable for a  fine of S$10,000 per copy of pirated merchandise (up to S$100,000), a prison term of up to five years, or both. A civil action may not be enacted more than six years after the date of infringement. The law eases the copyright owner’s burden of proof in infringement cases through a series of presumptions of ownership and subsistence of copyright. With the implementation of the Copyright (Amendment) 1998 Act, the law now permits copyright owners to ask the Customs and Excise Department to restrict the import of pirated articles. Individuals advertising or trading in pirated goods face prosecution, and the police have
search-and-seizure powers in certain situations. Under the provisions of the US–Singapore FTA and with effect from January 1st 2005, criminal penalties for wilful infringement were extended to apply to infringement that is not necessarily related to trade. This includes distribution via the Internet and significant infringement by companies using pirated software.

The Intellectual Property Rights Branch of the Singapore Police Force assures owners of IP rights assistance in prosecuting syndicate ringleaders whenever specific information is received from the owners. Combining resources of law-enforcement agencies and the copyright industry is the most

Page 9 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
effective way to enforce IP rights. In January 2003 police broke up a piracy syndicate and recovered S$1m worth of pirated goods (mainly software); in March authorities dismantled a group that was distributing and selling pirated Nintendo and PlayStation products worth S$1.5m. In April 2004 Singapore police participated in a co-ordinated raid involving law-enforcement agencies in 13 countries and targeting piracy networks that distribute copyrighted music, films and software over the Internet. Enforcement of IP laws is also carried out on a smaller scale: the Association of American Publishers took legal action in January
2004 against two photocopying shops in Singapore where university students were copying entire textbooks. In September 2005 the police raided a company suspected of using illegal software, confiscating 11 computers and five CD-ROMs. The company’s computers contained pirated computer-aided-design software worth an estimated S$50,000.

According to the Business Software Alliance’s 2005 Global Software Piracy Study (written in conjunction with IDC), Singapore’s software piracy rate was 40% in 2005 (down from 42% in 2004). Estimated losses due to piracy in the city-state came in at US$86m in 2005 (compared with US$96m in 2004), according to the survey.

The issue of parallel imports was clarified with a 1994 court decision and a subsequent amendment to the Copyright Act. The 1994 case dealt with the importing of goods manufactured outside Singapore without the consent of the Singaporean copyright owner. The chief justice held that such imports require the consent of the Singaporean owner. However, where goods have been manufactured in another country with the consent of the owner of the copyright in that country, they can be imported without restriction. Therefore, all legitimate reproductions of copyright products are allowed to be imported. The only prohibited imports are those that are made in a country where copyright protection does not exist, in countries where the copyright has expired or for articles made under compulsory licence. This reaffirms the traditional notion of parallel imports.

The Copyright Tribunal determines compensation for compulsory licensing (such as when material is not available at “ordinary” prices for educational use or when a fee for government use cannot be negotiated). The tribunal can also investigate royalties paid, determine royalty payments and their distribution, and consider cases related to the licensing of copyright works for performing, recording and broadcasting. For example, the tribunal received a case on royalties between the Performing Rights Society and Singapore Broadcasting. By virtue of a 1996 amendment to the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations, protection now extends to works first published in or made by authors who are citizens of 130 countries
(all World Trade Organisation signatories).

Foreign businesses with substantial dealings in Singapore are allowed to protect their trademarks even if they do not advertise locally or attempt to publicise their trademark locally.
The Patents (Amendment) Act, which took force on January 2nd 2002, aims to provide a regulatory
regime for patent agents and improve their accessibility in order to serve better the needs of inventors and
patent owners. It includes changes to the provisions in the Patents Act on the regulation of patent agents,
introduction of prescribed patent forms to comply with the Patents Act and the general streamlining of
patent processes.

The patent application system was modified in July 2004 to create a dual-track system with two different deadlines for which applicants can opt: within 42 months (“fast track”), or within 60 months (“slow track”). If no preference is specified, the “fast track” is the default track. If the applicant opts for the slow track, only one fee must be paid to extend all deadlines. Previously, applicants had a deadline of 54 months to
request a patent.

The US–Singapore FTA introduced a number of changes related to pharmaceutical patent protection. Under the new legislation, the 20-year patent-protection period was extended for up to five years for delays in marketing approvals caused by the Health Sciences Authority. The Medicines Act provides for a five-year data-protection period, which protects confidential supporting information supplied to the Health Sciences Authority by companies applying for licences. Since July 2004 the protection period can commence from the date of marketing approval instead of the date of application for licence.

In 2004 the Health Science Authority changed its requirements for granting marketing approval of pharmaceuticals by taking into consideration whether a medicinal product up for approval is subject to any patents and whether the proper consent has been given for its use. Legislation introduced in July 2004
also allows for action against unauthorised importation of patented pharmaceuticals if the importer knows that the product was distributed to him outside of Singapore in breach of contract between the patent holder and the licensee.

The Trade Marks Rules were amended by the Trade Marks (Amendment) Rules 2001. The amendment to the Third Schedule took force on January 1st 2002; the others on January 15th 2002. These changes put into effect new class headings listed under the eighth edition of the Nice International Classification of

Page 10 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Goods and Services, provide electronic filing for six types of application forms and streamline the procedures for trademark examination.

Marks that are not visually perceptible, such as sounds and scents, have been registrable since July 2004. Prior to that, only marks that were visually perceptible could be registered, such as logos, names, shapes, colours and aspects of packaging.

Under the US–Singapore Free-Trade Agreement (FTA), the Trade Marks Act was amended in June 2004 (and took force in July 2005) to give effect to the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Joint Recommendation on Well-Known Marks in order to improve protection of such well-known marks. The amendment allows the owner of a well-known mark to take action against third parties for use of his mark that dilutes its distinctive character, specifically allowing the owner of the well-known mark to apply for a court injunction against third parties. Under another amendment to the Trade Marks Act in force since July
2004, registration is no longer required before a licence is binding on successors and before a licensee can take action against infringers.

In order to build a strong intellectual-property regime to pave the way for developing local knowledge-based industries, parliament passed several amendments to the relevant legislation in
1997–98. It passed the Copyright (Amendment) Act in February 1998, which came into force in April 1998. The amendments targeted domestic and border enforcement, rental rights, fair use, performers’ rights, remedies against infringements and protection for designs. Significant changes allow for the seizure of documents if there is evidence of copyright offences and widened the provision on possessing equipment used for infringing copies of sound recordings and audiovisual productions to include equipment used to copy any copyrighted materials.

The US–Singapore FTA introduced additional copyright legislation as from January 1st 2005. The new legislation makes it illegal to circumvent effective technological protection measures that control access to copyrighted works. It is also illegal to manufacture, provide or deal in technologies primarily designed or marketed for the purpose of circumvention. Furthermore, knowingly removing or altering
rights-management information (such as digital watermarks) is now a criminal offence, as is distributing, importing for distribution, broadcasting, communicating or making available works with altered
rights-management information without approval. The law provides legal incentives to Internet service providers (ISPs) to remove or block access to infringing content on their networks. ISPs no longer require a statutory declaration to remove or block such material; instead, they need only a notification lodged by
the copyright holder that infringement has taken place on the network. There is also improved recourse for the providers of the removed or blocked content, who can lodge a counter-notification to reinstate the content, unless the one copyright holder who requested the takedown takes a civil action against the content provider. There are limits on the liability for monetary and court ordered relief for ISPs as long as they are willing to comply with the right holder’s request to take down infringing material when notified.

Controls are imposed on local optical-disc (OD) manufacturers and the import of OD-manufacturing equipment under the Control of Manufacture Act and the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations. All manufacturers of optical discs (like CDs, VCDs, CD-ROMs, DVDs and DVD-ROMs) must apply for a Certificate of Registration from the Economic Development Board (the Controller of Manufacturing) before operating and importing such equipment into Singapore. The OD-manufacturing industry has committed itself to a code of conduct to support the government’s efforts to protect intellectual property.

Under the Films Act, landlords can be  fined up to S$40,000 and/or imprisoned for up to one year for allowing an unlicensed operation to be conducted on their premises. In implementing the legal initiatives necessary, Singapore achieved full compliance under the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) one year ahead of the January 1st 2000 deadline set by the WTO. The
TRIPs agreement is the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on trade and intellectual property (IP); it sets out a high standard of compliance for the protection, enforcement and dispute settlement of trade-related IP rights matters for WTO members. Under the Bern Convention (of which Singapore is a member), all works first published in Singapore, and also those created by Singaporean citizens and residents (published or not), enjoy copyright protection in more than 100 member countries, including the United States and Japan.

SurfIP, powered by BIGontheNet, is a one-stop IP portal for simultaneous custom and aggregated searches across multiple patent databases and other technical business sources. On January 30th 2004 the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore launched an online service called eTrademarks Search, which lets individuals search for detailed information on a wide range of marks (including those that are registered, pending, certified, expired, refused and abandoned). These initiatives will augment the government’s efforts to establish an effective IP management and protection value chain in Singapore.
Price Controls

The Ministry of Trade and Industry can impose controls as it deems necessary. The Price Control Act also empowers the ministry to regulate the import and export of any items on which price controls are deemed necessary. Extensive use of price controls is highly unlikely.

BRUSSELS, Jan 19, 2007 (AFP) -

The European Commission is expected on Wednesday to slap  fines on companies involved in a suspected cartel in power generation equipment, sources said on Friday.

TD
Although the amount of the total  fine to be lodged against the firms involved is not to be decided until the last minute, it could in theory reach 10 percent of annual sales.

Among the companies facing possible action are French groups Schneider,  Alstom,  and Areva, German conglomerate Siemens, Swiss-Swedish engineering group  ABB, Austrian group VA Tech and Japanese companies Mitsubishi, Hitachi  and Toshiba.

Acting on a tip-off, regulators conducted raids on the groups' premises in May 2004. Two years later, the EU competition watch-dog took the final step before official sanctions against them by issuing statements of objections.
The European Commission suspects that the companies may have jointly fixed prices and carved up
the market among themselves for gas-insulated switchgear, used to control the flow of electricity at power
sub-stations.

Originally, the EU competition watchdog was to impose  fines before Christmas holidays but ended up postponing its action.

SUMMARY

Legal and regulatory risk is moderate. The judicial system will be scrupulous in enforcing property and contractual rights, but the courts are slow and the procedures not conducive to litigating business disputes, most of which will, as a result, continue to be settled out of court. There is little risk of expropriation. However, the continuation of some informal and formal practices, such as regulations that restrict the establishment of business facilities, will obstruct the operations of foreign investors. Although formal price controls only exist on rice, indirect regulations continue to influence prices on a wide range of products.
SCENARIOS
The use of informal barriers to impede foreign investment rises (Moderate Risk)

The attitude of the Japanese government to inward foreign investment is ambivalent. Although officially the government welcomes foreign investors, in practice there remain a complex array of informal restrictions maintained by government and business alike designed to protect existing players. Although the government is unlikely to reverse policies already implemented to facilitate inward foreign investment, the slowing impetus for reform suggests that little leeway can be expected in dismantling informal barriers. One recent example of this has been the active consideration by some of Japan's largest companies of
so-called poison pill mechanisms with the specific aim of fending off foreign takeover bids. The government's decision in early 2005 to delay by one year to 2007 implementation of legislation that would allow foreigners to take over Japanese companies using indirect stock swaps further underscores this concern. A more nationalistic political environment could see greater active use of such barriers as a means of limiting the entry of foreign capital into Japan, forcing foreign companies to ally more closely with local companies in order to gain access to the domestic market.
Foreign investors fall foul of cumbersome legal procedures (High Risk)

Japan’s legal procedures are notoriously complex and cumbersome. Although the courts do not actively discriminate against foreign investors, they are also ill suited for litigation of investment and business disputes. Moreover, Japanese courts are also slow: there are almost no discovery procedures to compel disclosure of evidence from an opposing party; the courts lack contempt powers to compel a witness to testify or a party to comply with an injunction; and preliminary injunctions are almost impossible to obtain. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient numbers of judges to deal with caseloads can mean that trials become very prolonged. There are also no class actions or jury trials and punitive damages are almost unknown. In the event that legal action is required, foreign companies should be aware that the associated processes could take considerably longer than in their home countries.
BACKGROUND

(Updated: September 4th, 2006)
Page 14 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Enforceability of Contracts

Unlike most of their Western counterparts, the Japanese tend to write their contractual agreements in general terms, entrusting the details to the presumably fair judgment of the parties involved. Contracts are highly respected despite this lack of precision, and it is unusual for a business dispute to be settled through litigation. Even so, Japanese multinational companies have become familiar with the US and  European legal systems and with Western-style contracts. Waves of industrial and business restructuring and economic liberalisation and deregulation have cleared the way for international mergers and acquisitions that involve intricate legal manoeuvrings. Shareholder activism is on the rise, along with potential lawsuits. On balance, business practices in Japan are changing towards global standards, with greater emphasis on Western-style legal specifics.
Japan has civil courts for enforcing property and contractual rights. These courts do not discriminate
against foreign investors, but they are ill suited for litigation of investment and business disputes. Moreover,
Japanese courts are slow; there are virtually no discovery procedures to compel disclosure of evidence
from the opposing party; the courts lack contempt powers to compel a witness to testify or a party to comply
with an injunction; and preliminary injunctions are almost impossible to obtain. Since there are not enough
judges, the courts have high caseloads. Trials can last 2–5 years in district courts, and it can take 5–10
years to settle all appeals. The practices of class actions, jury trials and punitive damages are not
established.

Foreign companies have complained that legal cases they have brought in Japanese courts to protect their products and services from illegal copying and distribution become useless because, by the time courts reach decisions, counterfeiters have closed their operations, or the products and services in question have become obsolete.

Foreign investors are usually better off settling out of court (though this still requires considerable local legal expertise). Foreign companies find it harder to resolve civil disputes outside of courts in Japan than in the United States and Western  Europe. Nevertheless, alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms, such as mediation and arbitration, are considered more cost and time efficient than court procedures.
Independence of the Judiciary

The government is trying to make the legal system more efficient and professional, but changes come slowly. Foreign lawyers have been permitted to represent parties in international arbitration proceedings since 1996. But strict limitations on legal practice by foreign lawyers in Japan and the small number of Japanese lawyers capable of handling international business transactions makes it difficult for foreign investors to obtain proper legal advice on doing business in Japan. Foreign lawyers must belong to
foreign-Japanese joint ventures that have both foreign and local lawyers. They must register with the Japan
Federation of Bar Associations and obtain approval from the government to practice foreign law in Japan.

There has been progress in judicial-reform legislation. An amendment to the Code of Civil Procedures was passed into law in July 2003 and went into force on April 1st 2004. The legislation, which covers both criminal and civil trials, calls for more judges, prosecutors and lawyers to ease the crunch in the justice system. It aims to shorten district-court proceedings to two years or less.

The Diet approved another judicial-reform law in May 2004, paving the way for the launch of Japan’s first quasi-jury system in 2009. Under the system, six randomly selected senior citizens will sit alongside three professional judges as lay judges to deliver joint verdicts in trials involving serious crimes. Further
judicial-reform legislation was passed into law in June 2004, including a measure to set up a patent court as a branch of the Tokyo High Court in April 2005.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

The Japanese government imposes few formal restrictions on inward foreign direct investment (FDI). Moreover, it has removed or liberalised most legal restrictions on specific economic sectors. Investment risks present in some other nations, such as expropriation and nationalisation, are not issues in Japan. The government does not impose export-balancing or other trade-related requirements on foreign firms seeking to establish or increase their presence in Japan. Officially, the government now welcomes mergers and acquisitions (M&As) of Japanese companies by foreign firms. Nevertheless, obstacles such as
cross-shareholdings usually lead foreign investors to opt for strategic partnerships with equity participation or co-operation agreements.

The volume of FDI as a percentage of gross domestic product is very low in Japan compared with many other countries. In fact, the World Investment Report 2004 published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ranked Japan as the least “transnationalised” among the world’s developed economies in terms of FDI contribution to GDP and job creation by foreign companies. Nevertheless, the

Page 15 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
gap between incoming and outgoing investment has been narrowing in recent years, amid a general trend of increasing FDI inflows and declining Japanese investment abroad.

Inward FDI totalled ¥4.03trn in fiscal year 2004/05 (ending in March 2005), almost twice the ¥2.12trn registered in the year before, and topping the record of ¥3.13trn set in 2000/01, according to the Ministry of Finance. FDI growth was flat for the three years preceding 2004/05, and the upsurge in the latest tally was fuelled by aggressive investment by US companies, investment banks and private-equity funds in
Japanese assets including real estate. FDI through acquisitions of shares in Japanese firms rose 23.7% to
¥2.01trn. Foreign loans to Japanese companies jumped to ¥2.01trn, a more than four-fold increase from a
year ago.

During the same period, the United States remained the largest source of direct investment, with combined investment surging 650% to ¥2.62trn and accounting for 65.1% of the total. European direct investment in Japan increased by 4.6% to ¥724.9bn, or 18% of the total. The single largest European source of investment was the Netherlands, with ¥512.8bn, or 12.7%. The geographical breakdown of FDI is losing some of its relevance, however, since billions of dollars in FDI go through tax-haven jurisdictions, including some European countries with a liberal tax policy towards foreign companies. The financial-services industry attracted the greatest investment, accounting for ¥2.98trn, or 73.9% of the total FDI in Japan in
2004/05. The proportion of FDI in banking, insurance and the rest of the financial sector was 48.1% in the previous fiscal year. FDI in manufacturing was only ¥102.3bn, or 2.5% of the total. Meanwhile, FDI
overseas by Japanese companies fell by 6.3% to ¥3.82trn in 2004/05 from the year before. China, including Hong Kong, became the top destination for Japanese FDI, replacing the United States for the first time ever and signifying the rise of the Chinese market.

Since the 1990s, Japan has been actively promoting incoming FDI with various inducement programmes for foreign companies. The Japan Investment Council (JIC), established with the cabinet in July 1994 and chaired by the prime minister, has been setting the direction of FDI promotion efforts. In June 1995 the JIC issued a communique rolling out the official welcome mat to foreign investors. It made a policy statement in April 1996 that encouraged M&As as a vehicle for FDI.

The JIC announced a plan in January 2003 to double inward FDI within the next five years by making Japan a more attractive investment destination. It expanded on the pledge in March 2003 and identified 74 measures in five areas for improvement. These call for the following: streamlining administrative procedures; promoting crossborder M&As; making it easier for foreign engineers, researchers and other skilled professionals to migrate to Japan; working closely with local governments in bringing FDI to outlying regions; and improving public relations with the foreign business community at home and abroad.

Tapping domestic demand is the key to the success of foreign-owned subsidiaries in Japan. Foreign companies have aggressively pushed into the market in recent years, encouraged by the country’s continuing progress in economic liberalisation and deregulation. The accelerating pace of industrial restructuring has also boosted FDI. For example, GE Capital (US), the world’s largest non-bank financial institution, has established a sizeable market share in the local leasing sector through a series of acquisitions. Global automotive giants like General Motors (US) and Renault (France) have dramatically increased their presence in Japan.

The latest annual survey conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on the economic presence of foreign companies in Japan showed that foreign companies doing business in Japan and at least one-third capitalised by foreign capital had combined operating income of ¥1.6trn in fiscal 2002/03, up by 28.6% from the year before, on combined sales of ¥27trn, up by 1.2%. According to the survey released in July 2004, their combined sales accounted for 2% of the Japanese industry total; their combined operating income captured 2.3% of the total. The findings were based on replies from 574 manufacturing and 1,287 non-manufacturing companies.
None.
Unfair Competitive Practices
The Japan Fair Trade  Commission (JFTC) acts as the watchdog for enforcing the Anti-Monopoly Law of
1947, which remains the backbone of Japan’s competition and price policies. The status of the JFTC
changed in April 2003 from an external organ of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to an
agency of the Cabinet Office, a move that should increase the independent power of the JFTC.

The latest amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law, enacted in April 2005, gives the JFTC more power to enforce the law. The amendment, scheduled to go into force some time before April 2006, introduced criminal accusation and investigation procedures with penalties for interfering with investigations; streamlined hearing procedures; and a corporate-leniency programme for some economic crimes.


Page 16 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The stated purpose of the Anti-Monopoly Law is to prevent the excessive concentration of business power and to encourage fair and free competition. It prohibits private monopolies, unreasonable trade restraints and other unfair business practices. It also regulates international agreements and contracts that restrict competition. Under the law, the JFTC requires certain share acquisitions, mergers, business transfers and spin-offs to be reported within 30 days. Non-compliance with these notification requirements incurs hefty fines.

The Anti-Monopoly Law authorises the JFTC to impose restrictions on international contracts. For example, if such contracts contain clauses stipulating unfair trade practices, they can be subject to an order for abatement measures or surcharges. The JFTC can prohibit firms from entering into agreements or
contracts if unfair trade practices are not rectified. The  commission also prepares and publishes guidelines in each business sector.
The JFTC has the power to take the following actions:

restrict mergers and acquisitions if the acquisition of domestic shares by any company (foreign or domestic) is deemed to limit competition. Thus, if a foreign company holds shares in a domestic firm, it must report its shareholdings within three months of the end of each business year (as must domestic companies);
prohibit any limitation of competition through the interlocking of executives or other employees;

prohibit unfair trade practices, such as unreasonable rejection of transactions, discriminatory trade terms, unreasonable bargains or purchases at unreasonably high prices.

In Japan, unlike the United States, private parties do not have the legal standing to bring civil actions under antitrust law. Thus, the JFTC institutes virtually all such suits in Japan.

The JFTC and the US Federal Trade  Commission are bound by a bilateral antitrust agreement that allows the two countries to strengthen co-operation over enforcement. The agreement, signed in 1999, formalises antitrust consultations between the two countries held annually since 1976. Under it, the agencies help each other in antitrust enforcement activities and consider co-ordinating investigations involving the
markets of both countries. Similar agreements were entered into with the  European Commission in 2003 and Canada’s Competition Bureau in 2005. The JFTC is seeking to make more bilateral co-operation arrangements, particularly with Asian nations, as the need for antitrust co-operation across borders grows.

The interests of the JFTC often differ from those of the more entrenched regulators in Japan’s various ministries. For example, foreign firms new to sectors regulated by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or other ministries, often find themselves attempting to prove to a group of their competitors that they will have no adverse effect on them. The ministries call such meetings of “concerned parties” if they see the need to review the competitive conditions of the sector. This non-tariff barrier goes by the euphemism of “demand-supply adjustment” in market-entry regulation and price regulation. This is particularly true in financial services, one of the most heavily regulated industries.

Japan first passed a Product Liability Law in July 1994. Prior to this, it was the only industrialised country that did not have legislation protecting consumers from accident or injury caused by defective products. Under the law, the consumer has to prove only that a defect in the product caused an accident or injury. The burden of proof continues to lie with the injured person. Awards are limited to compensatory damages. The law is extremely inclusive, covering nearly everything but real estate and pre-fabricated housing.

The Anti-Monopoly Law empowers the Japan Fair Trade  Commission (JFTC) to break up companies it defines as monopolistic. But this power is limited, since such action requires consultation with the powerful, pro-business Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). The JFTC enforces various reporting and notification requirements on large business organisations under the Anti-Monopoly Law. They are broadly divided into two categories: one for going concerns and the other for new companies.

Accordingly, a company and its subsidiaries with combined assets of ¥2trn (¥600bn for holding companies and ¥8trn for banks, insurers and securities companies) must file reports on business operations with the JFTC within three months of the closing of books every year. A newly established company that meets the same asset-size tests must declare to the JFTC the nature of its business operations, including any subsidiaries, within 30 days from the date of establishment.

The JFTC polices collusion in pricing. If the top three companies in an industry account for more than 70% of the market and the total annual value of goods they supply to Japan exceeds ¥30bn, the JFTC can investigate if the companies practise parallel pricing (that is, when they raise prices by the same or similar margins within three months of one another). Firms found to have formed illegal cartels or to have raised prices in concert are assessed a surcharge on the amount of sales generated during the illegal action period: 6% for manufacturers, 2% for retailers and 1% for wholesalers. Smaller surcharges apply to small and medium-size enterprises.
Page 17 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The latest amendment of the Anti-Monopoly Law, enacted in April 2005 and expected to go into force in January 2006, will bring substantial increases to the administrative  fines, raising the standard surcharge rates for manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers to 10%, 3% and 2%, respectively. The JFTC may increase or decrease these penalties by 20%, depending on the circumstances surrounding a violation.

Under the Anti-Monopoly Law, the following business practices are also judged unfair: concerted refusal to deal; discriminatory pricing; discriminatory treatment on transaction terms; unjust low-price sales; unjust high-price purchasing; deceptive customer inducement; customer inducement by unjust benefits; tie-in sales; dealing on exclusive terms; resale price restriction; dealing on restrictive terms; abuse of dominant bargaining position; interference with a competitor’s transactions; and interference with the international operation of a competing company.

With a view to opening Japan’s markets to both domestic and foreign business, the JFTC is tightening rules on practices that block entry into markets. These include the imposition of trade-association membership requirements and the use of government regulations to fend off competition.

The JFTC has undertaken a major reform against cartels under an omnibus Anti-Cartel Law, which was put into practice in July 1999. The legislation abolished all legal cartels that existed outside the Anti-Monopoly Law. These included “recession” cartels intended to help an industry suffering from adverse operating conditions and “rationalisation” cartels meant to promote industry restructuring through concerted efforts to pare down capacity and reduce costs.

Japan’s large industrial groups, known as keiretsu, constitute de facto cartels. Based on tight networks of companies that share capital, research and development, customers, vendors, and distributors around large banks and trading houses, they play a powerful role in the economy and are deeply rooted in the country’s economic history.

There are two types of keiretsu, horizontal and vertical. Horizontal keiretsu often consist of a bank at the core and many companies from related and unrelated industries clustered around it. Member companies may be major manufacturers, large service providers (like life insurance companies) and other important companies. General trading companies also set up operations at the core of major horizontal keiretsu. They function primarily in wholesale trade, handling large volumes, especially in commodity items.

Vertical keiretsu centre on a major manufacturer that is not part of a horizontal keiretsu. Unlike in a horizontal keiretsu, with its member companies in diverse industries, the members of a vertical keiretsu are usually drawn from a single industry. They consist primarily of supplier and distributor relationships that service the large manufacturer at the core of the group.

There are signs, however, that these unofficial conglomerates may be heading for extinction—or at least for break-ups. A spate of financial mergers and a trend of termination in corporate cross-shareholdings are the two powerful forces driving this change. A series of mega-bank mergers that have created giant banking groups across keiretsu lines in recent years are weakening the solidarity among member companies. The proportion of cross-shareholdings also is falling dramatically, eliminating much of the bond holding one firm to another.

The decline of the keiretsu culture coincides with an effort to reform the Japanese system of corporate governance. Most notably, a new holding-company system is changing the picture of big business. A
post-war ban on holding companies aimed to prevent the revival of the pre-war zaibatsu industrial groups (which were even tighter versions of keiretsu). This ban was lifted in December 1997 under an amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law. The JFTC’s guidelines on holding companies have the following stipulations:
A holding company is defined as a company with more than 50% of its assets in shares of its subsidiaries;
a subsidiary is a company with more than 50% of its outstanding shares held by its parent company.
Any holding company with more than ¥300bn in total assets in its group must report its formation to the
JFTC.

A holding company with a financial component and having more than ¥15trn in assets will be banned for excessive concentration of business, as will one with a non-financial component and more than ¥300bn in assets.

These asset ceilings seem too low, given the size of many single Japanese companies. Nevertheless, some conglomerates have embraced the opportunity to regroup their operations under holding-company structures.

Banks, securities companies and insurers have been allowed since March 1998 to organise groups under the Financial Holding Company Law. A bank-led holding company is supposed to hold stakes of more than
50% in each of its subsidiaries in banking, securities, trust banking, insurance and investment-trust
Page 18 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
advisory services. But it may not have non-financial companies under its control. The recent banking mergers in Japan, which created several of the world’s largest financial institutions, were formulated under this law.

Securities and insurance holding companies are supposed to have securities and insurance subsidiaries, respectively, but the distinction among bank, securities and insurance holding companies is gradually disappearing with continued deregulation and a trend towards universal banking.

The Anti-Monopoly Law now prohibits financial institutions—if not part of a financial holding company—from holding 5% or more of the outstanding shares in a domestic company (but insurance companies may own up to 10%). These restrictions were introduced to prevent a concentration of economic power in the hands
of banks at the centre of a keiretsu business group. Banks and other financial institutions can obtain JFTC
permission for exceptions to these rules. The JFTC guidelines set 10%, 25% and 50% as important
share-purchase thresholds at which the effects on competition must be examined.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents in Japan are granted to the first person to file an application for a particular invention, rather than to the first person to invent it. The patent is valid for 20 years from the date an application is filed (a five-year limit applies for pharmaceutical products and agricultural chemicals, but it can be extended). Japan’s
Patent Law covers products or methods characterised by highly creative technological ideas; items characterised by a longer lifecycle than a new utility model; hardware and related computer programs; and plants, animals and micro-organisms. A separate Design Law allows the protection of designs for 15 years.

International pressure for standardisation of intellectual property laws and the self-interest of Japanese companies (whose products are increasingly being pirated in Asia) are forcing the government and industries to improve intellectual property protection and to align Japanese legislation closer to international practice. Domestic piracy is not a major problem, particularly compared with other countries in East Asia,
but many counterfeit items from abroad are sold in Japan, particularly from China, Hong Kong and South
Korea.

Ministry of Finance data showed that import denials on grounds of infringement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) increased 23.4% to 9,143 in 2004 from the previous year. Of these, 8,922, or 97.4%, involved trademark infringement. Bags, clothes, watches and cell-phone accessories were among the most commonly counterfeited items. By country of origin, South Korea topped the list, followed by China and Hong Kong.

Legal proceedings for establishing patent infringements are complex and time-consuming. Under the present IPR system, the lead time between initial legal procedures and dispute settlement can take as long as two years—more than twice as long as in the United States. Court-awarded damages or out-of-court settlements are typically small compared with those in other developed countries. By the time rulings appear, patent and other IPR violators, notably importers of counterfeit products, have pocketed their
profits and are forced to pay only nominal  fines and compensation to plaintiffs. Moreover, high legal fees discourage small companies from pursuing legal compensation.

A specialised court may ease the problem by handling patent and other IPR-related lawsuits exclusively and delivering speedier rulings. Such a court was established in April 2005 at the Tokyo High Court under judicial-reform legislation passed in June 2004. The Intellectual Property High Court, a special division of the Tokyo High Court with a nationwide jurisdiction, has 18 judges and specialised investigators as well as outside experts advising judges. The law authorising the new court states that the court shall handle disputes involving patents, utility models, trademarks, integrated-circuit layouts and use, copyrights, publishing rights, neighbouring rights and related rights. The court may order parties concerned not to divulge trade secrets in a pending case. The Law on the Establishment of the Intellectual Property High
Court also allows the court to conduct proceedings in a closed session for better protection of trade secrets.

An amendment to the Patent Attorney Law, which took effect in January 2003, allows patent attorneys (benrishi) to carry out a number of tasks that used to be the exclusive domain of attorneys at law (bengoshi). Among these are conducting negotiations in some contract matters on intellectual property and representing clients in mediation and arbitration proceedings.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) completed three major amendments to Japan’s intellectual property laws, putting them into practice on January 1st 1999:

The revised laws allow the infringed to claim punitive damages regardless of the licence fee between the bona fide contractors. The maximum penalty for patent infringement increased to ¥150m.



Page 19 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Design Law was expanded to cover system designs used for such items as kitchens and personal computers, and to eliminate a provision for mandatory registration for the design of component parts of an article.
Examination and trial procedures were streamlined, and the use of electronic filing expanded.

The Patent Law was further revised to make it easier to claim indirect or contributory infringement as from January 2003. In the past, indirect infringement was asserted only for exclusive or designated products. Hence, indirect infringement occurred only when a person sold an unpatented component exclusively used for manufacturing a patented part; consequently, no indirect infringement occurred if the unpatented component was used for applications other than those relating to the patented part. The amended law stipulates that indirect infringement occurs when the potential infringer produces, uses and/or sells an unpatented component indispensable for a patented invention with intent to cause infringement. The same amendment introduced substantial reductions in patent-related fees beginning in April 2004.

The Patent Law was amended again in May 2003 with another reshuffle of patent-related fees and refunds. More importantly, it also aims to make it easier to obtain international patents by allowing applicants to obtain an automatic designation from all contracting states of the Patent Co-operation Treaty. Effective
from April 1st 2004 application filing fees and patent annuity fees were decreased, and examination fees were increased. The revised law permits an examination fee refund if the application is withdrawn or abandoned before substantive examination has commenced. The fee changes are useful to applicants seeking to realise long-term cost advantages in patent matters. The same amendment abolished the
post-grant opposition system and expanded the scope of invalidation appeal procedures at the JPO as from January 1st 2004.

The JPO’s mid- to long-term goal for expediting patent examination calls for reducing the average patent examination period to 20 months by 2008 and 11 months by 2018, from about 27 months in 2005. The mandate for faster patent examination has been enshrined in the latest amendment of the Patent Law in June 2004, which took effect in April 2005.

The JPO is seeking to achieve greater harmony between the Japanese patent system and those of the United States and  Europe. Meanwhile, World Trade Organisation participation and bilateral agreements with the US have led to some amendments to patent and other intellectual property laws, focused on faster examination and better enforcement, to align Japanese patent law with the TRIPs (Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property) agreement. International harmonisation efforts under the World Intellectual Property Organisation are also helping to improve Japan’s intellectual property systems. These include changes to patent terms, patentable subject matter, expansion of the exclusive right to a patent and an end to compulsory licensing.

One of the key issues involving industrial research and development in a corporate setting has been how to resolve conflicts of interests between employees and employers. In the past, when lifetime employment
and other paternalistic features of corporate employment were strong, the inventions of employees were widely considered the property of the company. The Patent Law provides that employees of inventions have the right to receive “reasonable” compensation and that the sum of that remuneration must relate to the value the employer gains from such inventions.

There have recently been a number of cases of employees suing their companies over compensation for groundbreaking inventions. The Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in April 2002 in response to a lawsuit filed by a former employee of Olympus Optical. In the case, the plaintiff had developed an invention related to devices for optical discs and sued his former company, seeking compensation of ¥200m, far higher than the remuneration offered by the company. The Supreme Court upheld two rulings by lower courts ordering Olympus to pay about ¥2.3m. The decision marked the first time that the highest court had upheld workers’ rights to make claims to patents, trademarks and other intellectual properties that are developed during their employment. It overturned decades-old practices empowering an employer alone to decide if any additional payments are due to invention-developing employees.

The Supreme Court judgment opened the way for similar rulings at lower courts. In January 2004 the Tokyo High Court ordered electronics maker  Hitachi  to pay ¥163m to a former employee for the transfer of patent rights related to optical discs, quadrupling the award set by a lower court. The Tokyo High Court concluded that the company had benefited by ¥1.2bn from royalties paid by other companies for the patents in
question and cross-licensing contracts.

In the same month, the Tokyo District Court ordered chemicals maker Nichia to pay a record ¥20bn to the inventor of a key semiconductor device for the transfer of patent rights to the firm. The court ruled that at least 50% of the patent earnings worth ¥120.8bn was attributable to a direct contribution by the former employee-inventor, who had received only ¥20,000 from Nichia for his invention. In January 2005 the final settlement mediated by the Tokyo High Court awarded the inventor ¥843m, far lower than the sum ordered

Page 20 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
by the district court but still a record. In February 2004 the Tokyo District Court ordered Ajinomoto, which makes seasonings, to pay ¥189.4m to a former employee for the transfer of patents on a production method for an artificial sweetener. Ajinomoto obtained ten patents on the method in Japan, North America and Europe. There are other similar cases of employee inventor litigation now pending.

The latest amendment of the Patent Law, which was enacted in June 2004 and put into force in April 2005, specifically addresses the issue of fair compensation for employee inventions by encouraging employers and employees to work out consensus on how to reward employee-inventors. Such agreements will take precedence over arbitrary rulings at court, thereby reducing employers’ risks of paying large sums as compulsory compensation.

Utility models. The Utility Model Law allows registration of utility models, a minor form of patent with ten years of protection from the filing date. The law provides protection for items having a short lifecycle, characterised by potential for early implementation and embodying creative ideas relating to the shape of products, their structure and other technological aspects.

Inventions subject to protection under the Utility Model Law are of the same nature as inventions protected under the Patent Law, but utility-model rights are granted more expeditiously. The requirements for patent applications generally apply to utility-model applications. Exercise of utility-model rights against
infringement must be preceded by a warning supported by a technical evaluation document prepared by an examiner at the JPO.

The June 2004 amendment of the Patent Law in conjunction with a revision of the Utility Model Law made utility models more attractive alternatives to patents. Specifically, the changes increased the duration of a utility model right to ten years from six years as from April 1st 2005 and introduced provisions making registered utility models convertible to patents. (A utility model registration can be converted to a patent application within three years of the filing date.)

Trademarks. The Trademark Law protects trademarks and service marks. The Unfair Competition Prevention Law, which the METI enforces, provides additional trademark protection. Trademarks must be registered in Japan to ensure enforcement. Often, an identical or similar trademark has already been registered or applied for before a foreign individual or company begins using it in Japan. Hence, a foreign entity intending to enter the Japanese market must first investigate the prior registration or application of the trademark.

The first comprehensive revision of the Trademark Law in 40 years came into force on April 1st 1997. The updated law better accommodates problems peculiar to the Japanese trademark system and is more compatible with foreign laws. Amendments to the law include (1) simpler trademark registration and trademark renewal procedures; (2) a multi-class application system, allowing several goods and/or services to be designated in one application; (3) introduction of a post-grant opposition system; (4) completion of a renewal after paying the renewal fee; (5) abolition of the mandatory public notice of transfers of trademark rights; (6) abolition of the associated trademark system, meaning that as long as they are registered by the same person, similar trademarks may be filed as “normal” trademarks; and (7) heavier  fines for violating
the Trademark Law.

Legislation passed in preparation for Japan’s ratification of the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks, or the Madrid Protocol, in March 2000 introduced several useful provisions. Effective January 1st 2000, Japan started implementing a system to notify the public of trademark applications received. Databases of trademarks are available from the Industrial Property Digital Library at the JPO. From March 2000 trademark holders have been entitled to compensation for damages for the period from application to registration of the trademark.

Trade secrets. The only trademark protection available in Japan prior to registration comes under the Unfair Competition Prevention Law. The law defines trade secrets as technical or business information useful in commercial activities, such as manufacturing or marketing methods, which is kept secret and not publicly known. The law covers various types of unfair competition such as unauthorised imitation of merchandise and false indications of origin of goods. It also protects trade secrets against unauthorised disclosure or misappropriation.

A 1991 revision of the law provided more protection from theft of trade secrets, but it failed to restrict reverse engineering (where a competitor’s product is purchased, disassembled to determine its design and components, reconstructed and manufactured in a slightly different way and then sold on the market). It also did not introduce discovery procedures (by which a patent owner can obtain information about processes suspected of infringement).

An amendment of the law, proposed by the Ministry of Economy and Trade in February 2005, would substantially improve trade-secret protection by expanding criminal penalties against taking trade secrets

Page 21 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
out of the country for commercial use or disclosure as part of unfair competition. It would also make it easier to prosecute former employees and executives using or disclosing the trade secrets of their former employers. The amendment would provide increased penalties against trade-secret infringement across the board, while giving trade secret holders a new option to seek civil compensation from infringers.

Copyrights. The Agency for Cultural Affairs oversees the country’s copyright system under the Copyright Law, which was frequently amended over the past decade to align the law with the international copyright regime. Japan is a member state of the two conventions for international protection of copyrights: the Bern Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention. Any work that is first published in a member state of either convention is protected in Japan under the Copyright Law. This law provides limitations on copyrights to permit fair exploitation of works, such as reproduction for personal use and for educational purposes,
and recognises neighbouring rights.

The Copyright Law was amended in 1991 to prohibit unauthorised duplication and distribution of foreign recordings produced after 1971. Pressure from the United States and  Europe led to another revision of the law in 1996: copyrights for sound recordings were retroactively given protection for 50 years. The latest amendment in 2003 extended the term of copyright protection for cinematographic works, animation and video games to 70 years, to bring the term of protection closer to international norms.

An earlier amendment, in effect since 2001, raised substantially the maximum  fine for copyright violations (from ¥3m to ¥100m) and relaxed conditions for establishing proof of damages. It authorises courts to demand the submission of classified corporate documents to establish violations of the law and empowers courts to set reasonable sums based on the results of investigations.

The Japanese copyright licensing market, estimated at ¥100bn annually, has long been dominated by a few industry organisations authorised by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The Japan Association for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (JASRAC), a non-profit organisation established in 1939 under the Law on Intermediary Business Concerning Copyrights (the Copyright Brokers Act), is the biggest and most powerful. The JASRAC manages domestic and international music copyrights and derivative copyrights under agreements with copyright societies of foreign countries. It collects royalties from users of music in Japan and from foreign copyright societies and allocates them to rightful copyright owners or foreign copyright societies.

There are two minor organisations with similar functions: the Japan Council of Performers’ Organisation and the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Both are authorised to collect secondary-use fees from broadcasters and other distributors of commercial phonographs. The JASRAC’s virtual monopoly over the copyright industry is waning, however, under a revision to the Copyright Brokers Act that took force on October 1st 2001. The law replaces the approval required from the Agency for Cultural Affairs with notification requirements, allowing any private firm to become a licensing agent. Increased competition should help drive down licence fees for copyrighted products.
Price Controls
Japan has no formal price controls except on rice (for which there are import quotas as well; see the
section on Foreign trade, import restrictions). But indirect regulation continues to influence prices on a wide
range of products. For decades, major producers, backed by regulators ostensibly concerned with stability,
have been able to dictate retail as well as wholesale prices. However, weak economic conditions and
deregulation programmes have enabled discounters to demolish much of this structure.

Prices for many imported consumer goods have fallen sharply in recent years, but they are still substantially higher than international prices. The present government policy is to encourage lower prices by eliminating regulations, rationalising the distribution system and increasing anti-monopoly efforts, while easing deflationary pressure on real estate.

Power companies have free rein to set retail charges for customers using at least 2,000 kw a year, a privilege also accorded gas utilities for contracts of 1m cubic metres or more. These companies must report charges to smaller users to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; the ministry plans to liberalise these charges in stages. The government has given airlines more leeway in setting airfares since 1995.

A new food law was passed in June 2003, paving the way for price deregulation in the rice market. The legislation, put into effect in April 2004, calls for a gradual shift away from government control over rice production and distribution. The law allows the private sector to decide how much rice to produce and to set the price of rice based on consumer demand.

HD     EU to fine suspected cartel in power generation equipment - sources

- The European Commission is expected on Wednesday to  fine companies involved in a suspected
cartel in power generation equipment, sources told Agence France-Presse on Friday.

Although the amount of the total  fine to be lodged against the firms involved is not to be decided until the last minute, it could in theory reach 10 pct of annual sales.

TD
Among the companies facing possible action are French groups Schneider Electric,  Alstom,  and Areva, German conglomerate  Siemens AG, Swiss-Swedish engineering group  ABB, Austrian group VA Tech and Japanese companies Mitsubishi Corp,  Hitachi  and Toshiba Corp.

Acting on a tip-off, regulators conducted raids on the groups' premises in May 2004. Two years later, the EU competition watchdog took the final step before official sanctions against them by issuing statements of objections.
The European Commission suspects that the companies may have jointly fixed prices and carved up
the market among themselves for gas-insulated switchgear, used to control the flow of electricity at power
sub-stations.

Originally, the EU competition watchdog was to impose  fines before Christmas holidays but ended up postponing its action.

The European Commission is expected to condemn (on 24 January) a  cartel of approximately half a dozen companies in the electrical equipment sector, confirmed sources close to the dossier on 19
January. One of them is T&D, a subsidiary of the French company  Alstom,  sold to Areva at the end of
2003. The market concerned is that of gas insulated switchgear (GIS), switches found at the exit point of
power stations which convert medium tension into high tension to enable the transmission of electricity.

The case dates back to the end of the eighties. According to the  Commission, this secret  cartel has allowed its partners to maintain artificially high prices for GIS and to control the world market for the last
17 years.

TD
In addition to  Alstom  and Areva, the companies involved are Mitsubishi,  Hitachi  and Toshiba (Japanese). Other companies that have drawn the  Commission's ire are Schneider (French),  ABB (Swiss-Swedish) and  Siemens (German), who have each in turn been owners of the Austrian company VA Tech.
After surprise inspections in May 2004, the  Commission duly sent them notice of its decision in May
2006. It will now impose  fines for an as yet undetermined (it will be decided at the last minute) sum.

(Adds Commission comment, background, by-line)

BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission will impose its second-highest  cartel fine of about 750 million  euros ($976 million) on Wednesday for price-fixing by electrical power system switchgear makers, a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.

TD
In the case, covering gas insulated switchgear, Germany's Siemens will face the second-highest individual EC cartel fine on record, nearly 400 million euros.
Mitsubishi will be  fined over 100 million euros, Toshiba more than 80 million  euros and Hitachi  nearly
50 million euros, the source said.
The source did not specify which companies within these Japanese groups were affected.

No one at Mitsubishi Electric Corp ,  Toshiba Corp or Hitachi  Ltd could be reached immediately for comment.

Alstom  had sold off the unit which participated in the  cartel but will face a  fine of more than 60 million
euros, the source said.

Areva, which bought the  Alstom  unit without knowing about the  cartel, will face a smaller  fine. Others in the cartel of around 20 members will also face smaller  fines, the source said.

ABB , which blew the whistle on the  cartel, faces no fine at all, the source said.

The overall fine for the sector is behind the record 790.5 million  euros imposed by the EC on a vitamin cartel in 2001. As for individual company  fines, the biggest was Hoffman-La Roche's 462-million-euro fine for the vitamin  cartel, now followed by the  Siemens fine.

Gas insulated switchgear is heavy, expensive equipment that controls the flow of energy in electrical power systems. It is sold as a distinct product, and as part of fully functional power sub-stations.

The cartel lasted for 16 years, another source familiar with the situation told Reuters last month, which under EU rules makes the  fines harsher than they would have been had the  cartel not lasted so long.
The Commission declined to comment.

BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The  European Commission shocked an intercontinental cartel of electric power switchgear makers on Wednesday with its toughest  fine yet for a single price-fixing offence, 750.7 million  euros ($977 million).

TD
More than half the  fine, 396.6 million  euros, was levelled against Siemens because of the German company's size and role as a ringleader. Japanese and European firms shared the rest.

Siemens, whose stock fell on an early Reuters report of the  fine, will appeal to  European Union courts.

"The fines are completely exaggerated and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts," said Udo Niehage, president of  Siemens' Power Transmission and Distribution unit.

Siemens said the fine would impact its profits, adding no provision had been made for such a  fine. It reports first-quarter results on Thursday.

The cartel accounted for all  European sales of gas insulated switchgear, which is needed at sub-stations used to carry electricity to homes, offices and factories.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The cartel used encrypted emails sent to anonymous addresses to help coordinate global  cartel quotas. European companies agreed not to sell in Japan and Japanese companies stayed out of Europe, the Commission said.
SHAM TENDERS

Cartel members arranged sham tenders to maintain their global  cartel quotas, spelled out in two written agreements, the  Commission said.

Japan's Mitsubishi Electric was  fined 118.6 million euros and Toshiba Corp. 91 million euros, of which 4.7 million  euros was an overlap to be sorted out by the two firms.

France's  Alstom  was fined 65 million. A few months before the cartel ended Alstom  sold the unit involved to Areva , which knew nothing of the  cartel. It and Alstom  have joint liability for 53.6 million, which they must decide how to split.

Hitachi  Ltd. was fined 51.8 million euros and Fuji of Japan 3.8 million. Their joint venture Japan AE Power Systems was fined 1.4 million, which overlaps with the two big  fines. The companies must figure out how to divide liability.
Schneider Electric of France was  fined 8.1 million euros and Siemens of Austria 22.1 million  euros.


Page 29 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ABB of Switzerland had its  fine reduced to zero from 215 million  euros because it blew the whistle on the cartel and turned over extensive evidence.

"ABB companies and employees are not permitted under any circumstances to engage in any anti-competitive practices," the company said in a statement after the  fines were announced.
The companies may face problems yet in other countries for their actions.

Gas insulated switchgear is heavy, expensive equipment that controls the flow of energy in electrical power systems. It is sold as a distinct product, and as part of fully functional power sub-stations.

Although it is the highest  fine for an individual violation by companies, the overall  fine for the sector is behind the record 790.5 million  euros imposed by the EC on a vitamin  cartel in 2001.

As for individual company  fines, the biggest was Hoffman-La Roche's 462 million  euro fine, for multiple violations.

HD     EU fines 10 companies $978 million for power gear cartel

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined 10 companies a combined $978 million on Wednesday for running a cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, with  Siemens AG ordered to pay more than half the total.

Several of the other companies penalized in what the EU called the largest set of fines on a single cartel were Japanese businesses that struck a deal to stay out of  Europe, while the Europeans  steered clear of Japan's market.

TD
The European Commission said the companies rigged bids for contracts to supply power plants, fixed prices, shared projects between themselves, carved up markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information from 1988 and 2004.

It increased  Siemens' fine by half to €396.5 million ($517 million) -- making this the second-highest  cartel fine it has ever levied -- because the company played a leadership role in fixing prices.

Siemens immediately said it would appeal the "exaggerated"  fine, claiming the EU had made a "blanket accusation" when  price fixing  had occurred only in isolated cases.
But EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said regulators were "extremely sure" their decision was legal. Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. had the next biggest  fine of €118.5 million ($154.5 million), followed by
Toshiba Corp.'s €90.9 million ($118.5 million).

Mitsubishi said it was considering its response, while  Toshiba denied any wrongdoing. "Our own investigations show that we have not engaged in any actions that violate  European competition laws, and we plan to fight this decision in  European courts,"  Toshiba said in a statement.

France's Alstom  SA must pay €65 million ($84.7 million). Areva was  fined €53.5 million ($69.7 million) for the actions of a subsidiary it bought from  Alstom  just four months before investigators launched surprise raids. Both  fines were increased by 50 percent for the companies helping organize the  cartel.

Hitachi  Ltd. must pay €51.75 million ($67.5 million). It had no immediate comment.

Siemens is also responsible for its Austrian unit VA Technologie AG's €22 million ($28.7 million)  fine. It bought the company after the end of the  cartel.

The Commission said the parent company was responsible for the  fine if it had "decisive influence over commercial behavior of its subsidiaries."
Schneider Electric SA must pay €8.1 million ($10.56 million),  Fuji Electric Holdings Co. Ltd. must pay
€3.75 million ($4.9 million) and Japan AE Power Systems -- a joint venture between  Fuji, Hitachi  and
Meidensha Corp. -- was  fined €1.35 million ($1.76 million).
"These companies accounted for virtually all the supply of these products on the  European market," said
Todd.

"The Commission regards this cartel as totally unacceptable behavior on behalf of the companies concerned and we sincerely hope that companies will see the large  fines imposed as what awaits them if they were inclined to follow this bad example," he said.
The basic fines are calculated on the companies' share of the  European market but the Japanese  fines
were based on total worldwide turnover.

ABB Ltd. received full immunity for blowing the whistle, escaping a potential €215 million fine. The Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering company said in 2004 that it discovered price-fixing during an internal audit and had dismissed two managers.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The companies all handled gas-insulated switchgear, heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids that is an important part of auxiliary power stations where electrical current is converted from high to low voltage or the reverse.

The equipment is usually sold to utilities at public tenders where companies pitch bids and the lowest is chosen.

Regulators said the suppliers coordinated their bids to allow each company to get a certain quota of contracts or keep to a minimum bidding price. The deal to keep Japanese companies out of  Europe ultimately hurt  European consumers, the Commission said, fining several Japanese companies even though they sold no power gear in Europe.

Officials said management met regularly to discuss strategic issues while lower-level executives divided projects and prepared sham bids by companies who were not supposed to win the tender "in order to leave an impression of genuine competition."

The cartel tried very hard to cover its traces, using code names for rival companies and communicating via anonymous and encrypted e-mail, the  Commission said. It published a message from one unidentified  cartel organizer to another, forbidding e-mail from home and company computers and urging the use of anonymous e-mail addresses.

Reuters reported that The European Commission shocked an intercontinental  cartel of electric
power switchgear makers with its toughest fine yet for a single  price-fixing offence, EUR750.7 million
($977 million). More than half the fine, EUR396.6 million, was levelled against  Siemens. Japanese
and European firms shared the rest. Siemens said that the  fine would impact its profits, adding no
provision had been made for such a fine. Siemens said that it would appeal to  European Union
courts.

The European Commission has fined 11 companies a total of Eur750.7 million ($976 million) for participating in an illegal cartel for gas-insulated switchgear projects, the EC said Wednesday.

Gas-insulated switchgear is heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids, and is the major component of turnkey power substations. The EC said it had found that the 11 companies had "rigged bids forprocurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information" between 1988 and
2004. The companies concerned are  ABB, Alstom,  Areva, Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech.

But the EC said ABB had received full immunity from the  fines for alerting the EC to the existence of the cartel. "The Commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years. The Commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business," said compeition commmissioner Neelie Kroes.

"This is the largest single  fine the EC has ever imposed on a single  cartel," The EC's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd told journalists in Brussels Wednesday. He said the  fine on Germany's Siemens alone of Eur396 million was the largest ever imposed on a single company for participating in a single cartel.

"The Commission regards cartels as totally unacceptable behavior... this is a warning to other companies if they follow this bad example," Todd said. The  cartel was brought to an end in May 2004 when the EC launched surprise inspections after  ABB alerted it to the  cartel, requesting immunity from any fines. The EC found documents including detailed written agreements concluded in 1988 between members of the  cartel where they agreed to inform each other of calls for tender and coordinated their bids to secure contracts in line with their quotas in the cartel, The EC said. They also agreed that Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe and European compaies would stay out of the Japanese market.

The EC said the members of the  cartel had taken "sophisticated measures to keep their communications secret" including anonymous and encrypted emails and that "code names were used for both companies and individuals."

The European Commission announced on Wednesday its second-biggest  fine against cartels, demanding 750 million euros from 11 companies making power generation equipment for  price fixing.

TD
The companies targeted were ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi
Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech.
For its leading role,  Siemens was told to pay 418 million  euros (543 million dollars), the biggest  fine EU
regulators have ever slapped on a single company for participating in a  cartel.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

EU regulators found that between 1988 and 1994 the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, divied up projects among each other and shared sensitive information in the market for insulated switchgear.

Insulated switchgear is used to control the flow of energy in electricity grids and is a major part of power substations.

Acting on a tip-off from  ABB, regulators conducted raids on the groups' premises in May 2004. Two years later, the EU competition watch-dog took the final step before official sanctions against them by issuing statements of objections.
The fine of 215 million euros on ABB was waived because the company came forward first to reveal the
cartel.

The overall fine was second only to a penalty imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 for running eight cartels on eight different vitamins.

The commission told them to pay 855 million  euros, although the  European Court of Justice later reduced the fine to 790 million euros.
Kroes has made cracking down on cartels a top priority and last year imposed  fines totalling 1.8 billion
euros against the illegal clubs, a new annual record for EU regulators.

"The Commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business," Kroes said.

"The case also demonstrates that the  Commission can and will bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks," she added.

Siemens was told to pay 418 million  euros (543 million dollars), the biggest  fine EU regulators have ever slapped on a single company for participating in a  cartel.

"We consider the  fines to be completely exaggerated and cannot understand them at all," the chairman of Siemens Power Transmissions and Distribution unit, Udo Niehage, said in a statement.

The Commission imposed 396 million euros in fines against the German headquarters of the company and 22 million euros against Siemens Austria.

Siemens denied the charges and said it would appeal to the  European Court of Justice.

BERLIN, Jan 24, 2007 (AFP) -
German engineering giant Siemens said on Wednesday that it would appeal to the European Court of
Justice against a huge fine by the European Commission over alleged price-fixing.

The commission imposed the fine for practices by  Siemens' power generation unit PTD.

"Siemens intends to go to the  European Court of Justice to take legal action against anti-trust  fines of around 396 million euros (515 million dollars) charged by the EU  Commission," the German group said in a statement.
"We deny the blanket accusation of the EU  Commission that Siemens participated in a  cartel" in the
European market for gas-isolated switch-gear systems between 1988 and 2004, the statement said.

"Price fixing  in the GIS segment took place only in a few projects in the  European economic area and only in the period between October 2002 and Apriil 2004."

Siemens was responding to the announcement in Brussels that the EU Commission was fining 11 companies that make power generation equipment a total 750 million euros, the biggest ever  fine in the commission's history.

Siemens alone was told to pay 418 million  euros in all, including the 396 million euros against Siemens' Power Transmission and Distribution (PTD) divsion and a 22-million-euro fine against Siemens Austria.

"The fines are completely exaggerated and we cannot understand how the  commission arrived at these amounts," said PTD chief Udo Niehage.

Since the investigations had begun, PTD had fully cooperated with the EU  Commission and made available the results of its own internal investigations, Niehage said.

"The accusation that  Siemens participated in a  cartel in the market for gas-isolated switchgear systems from 1988 to 2004 goes far beyond the findings of our own internal investigation," the company said.
The internal investigation indicated that three  Siemens PTD employees fixed prices between October
2002 and April 2004,  Siemens said.

"These employees were suspended immediately after the accusations became known and no longer work for Siemens," it noted.
"We have repeatedly made clear in statements to the EU  Commission that we consider the
Commission's opinion unjustified for the most part. We will therefore take legal action."

Siemens is currently being swamped by different corruption charges.
In November, the prosecutors launched a massive probe, raiding the offices and homes of a number of
Siemens employees amid suspicions of embezzlement, bribery and tax evasion.

BRUSSELS, Jan 24, 2007 (AFP) -

The European Commission announced on Wednesday its second-biggest  fine against cartels, demanding 750 million euros from 11 European and Japanese companies making power-generation equipment.

TD
The EU competition watchdog targeted ABB, Alstom,  Areva, Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech for  price fixing  and illegally carving up the market.

Siemens was told to pay 418 million  euros (543 million dollars) for its leading role, the biggest  fine EU
regulators have ever slapped on a single company for participating in a  cartel.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
Kroes has made cracking down on cartels a top priority and last year imposed  fines totalling 1.8 billion
euros against the illegal clubs, a new annual record for EU regulators.

"The Commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business," Kroes said.

"The case also demonstrates that the  Commission can and will bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks," she added.

EU regulators found that between 1988 and 2004 the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, divied up projects among each other and shared sensitive information in the market for insulated switchgear.

Insulated switchgear is used to control the flow of energy in electricity grids and is a major part of power substations.

Acting on a tip-off from  ABB, regulators conducted raids on the groups' premises in May 2004. Two years later, the EU competition watch-dog took the final step before official sanctions against them by issuing statements of objections.

The fine of 215 million euros on ABB was waived because the company revealed the  cartel to regulators.

The overall fine was second only to a penalty imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 for running eight cartels on eight different vitamins.

The commission told them to pay 855 million  euros, although the  European Court of Justice later reduced the fine to 790 million euros.

Denying the charges lodged against it, Siemens was shocked by what it described as the "completely exaggerated"  fines and vowed to appeal at the European Court of Justice.

"We consider the  fines to be completely exaggerated and cannot understand them at all," the chairman of Siemens Power Transmissions and Distribution unit, Udo Niehage, said in a statement.

Of the 418 million  euro total imposed on Siemens, 396 million was slapped on the German parent company and 22 million euros on Siemens Austria.  Siemens bought Austrian group VA Tech in 2005.

Mitsubishi Electric was fined 119 million euros, Toshiba 91 million euros, Hitachi  52 million euros, Alstom  65 million euros and Areva 53 million euros, Schneider 8.1 million euros, Fuji 3.7 million euros and Japan AE Power Systems 1.35 million euros.

Commission officials said that some of the individual  fines could vary slightly because of joint ventures between some firms, but that it expected the total to be 750 million  euros.

German engineering giant Siemens said on Wednesday that it would appeal against a record  fine

The German giant conceded that three former PTD employees had indeed been involved in  price-fixing, but not to the extent that the EU  Commission had claimed.

Page 56 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"With the acquisition of VA Tech in 2005 and the integration of VA Tech into the PTD group,  Siemens assumed financial responsibility for VA Tech. This responsibility also involved accepting any legal consequences resulting from past anti-trust violations on the part of VA Tech," Siemen said.

Nevertheless, the VA Tech  fines "also seem disproportionately large and legal action will be taken against any unjustified accusations,"  Siemens said.
"We have repeatedly made clear in statements to the EU  Commission that we consider the
Commission's opinion unjustified for the most part. We will therefore take legal action."

Siemens is currently mired in a swamp of different corruption allegations.

In mid-afternoon trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange,  Siemens shares were little changed, showing a fraction loss of 0.02  euros or 0.03 percent at 76.53  euros in a generally firmer market.

"We will closely examine the case and consider our counteraction including an appeal to the  European
Court of First Instance."

Mitsubushi Electric said it had received the notice from the  European Commission on the fine. "Our company will make a detailed study of the contents of the notice and consider our counteraction including an appeal to the court."

PARIS, Jan 24, 2007 (AFP) -
The French group Schneider Electric said Wednesday it was carefully studying the terms of the
8.1-million-euro (10.5-million-dollar)  fine imposed by the European Commission over an alleged
price-fixing cartel in the power-generation equipment sector.

"We are attentively analysing the terms of the decision," a spokesman said when asked by AFP if the company was considering apppealing the  fine.

Schneider added in a statement that it had in Ocotber 2000 disposed of two of its former subsidiaries that are accused of being involved in the  cartel. The European Commission on Wednesday announced its second-biggest fine against cartels, demanding 750 million euros from 11 European and Japanese companies making power-generation equipment.

The EU competition watchdog targeted ABB, Alstom,  Areva, Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech for  price fixing  and illegally carving up the market.

EU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes stepped up her anti-cartel crusade on Wednesday, hitting 11 companies with a record fine for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.

After bumper  fines in 2006, the EU competition watchdog demanded ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech pay 750 million euros (972 million dollars) for running a  cartel.

The total fine was the second biggest EU regulators have imposed in a  cartel case after slapping 855 million euros in penalties on eight vitamin makers in 2001. That  fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.

Siemens was told to pay 418 million  euros (543 million dollars) for its leading role, the biggest  fine EU

The fine of 215 million euros on ABB was waived because the company revealed the  cartel to regulators.
Contesting the charges lodged against it,  Siemens said it was shocked by what it described as the
"completely exaggerated"  fines and vowed to appeal at the  European Court of Justice.

"We consider the  fines to be completely exaggerated and cannot understand them at all," the chairman of Siemens Power Transmissions and Distribution unit, Udo Niehage, said in a statement.

Of the 418 million  euro total imposed on Siemens, 396 million was slapped on the German parent company and 22 million euros on Siemens Austria.  Siemens bought Austrian group VA Tech in 2005.

Toshiba denied breaking EU law and said that it would appeal while  Hitachi  and Mitsubishi Electric said they would consider challenging the ruling.

Although the Japanese firms play a negligible role in the  European market, EU regulators accused them of agreeing with their  European rivals to stay off each other's turf.

Mitsubishi Electric was fined 119 million euros, Toshiba 91 million euros, Hitachi  52 million euros, Alstom  65 million euros and Areva 53 million euros, Schneider 8.1 million euros, Fuji 3.7 million euros and Japan AE Power Systems 1.35 million euros.

Commission officials said that some of the individual  fines could vary slightly because of joint ventures between some firms, but that it expected the total to be 750 million  euros.

TD
The companies involved are  Siemens AG,  ABB Ltd, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji Co, Hitachi  Japan AE Power
Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Toshiba Corp and VA Tech.

The commission said the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

The largest  fine, of 418.7 mln eur, was imposed on Siemens -- the amount included 22.1 mln following the group's acquisition of VA Tech. This is the largest fine ever imposed by the EU executive on a single company for a single cartel infringement.

HD          EU Fines Gas-Insulated Switchgear Cartel Cos EUR750 Mln

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 12 multinationals, headed up by Germany's  Siemens AG (SI), a total of almost EUR751 million for taking part in a  cartel for
gas-insulated switchgear products which operated for 19 years.
The fine imposed on Siemens, a total of EUR419 million, was the second-largest ever levied by the
European regulators.

TD
Three of the companies -  Siemens, France's Alstom  SA (1022047.FR), which was  fined EUR65 million, and Areva SA (427583.FR), which was fined EUR53.6 million - were identified as having played leadership roles in the  cartel and therefore had their  fines increased by 50%.
In contrast, Switzerland's  ABB Electrical Industries Co. escaped a potential EUR215 million  fine
because it blew the whistle on the illegal  price-fixing. It isn't required to pay any penalty. [ 24-01-07
1104GMT ]

Major Japanese companies also were targeted for their participation. Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO) will have to pay EUR118.6 million,  Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) EUR90 million,  Hitachi  Ltd. (HIT) EUR51.8 million, and  Fuji Electric Systems Co. (3515.TO) EUR3.7 million.
Corrected Jan. 24, 2007 20:21 ET (01:21 GMT) [ 24-01-07 1105GMT ] The companies can appeal the  fines to the European Court of Justice.
In a statement, the  commission said that starting in 1988 companies "fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."
Suppliers informed each other of calls for tender and coordinated their bids, the  commission said. Alternatively, they would agree to respect minimum bidding prices.
The companies agreed that the Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe, and the  European companies would not sell in Japan, it added. European tenders were usually allocated according to the cartel rules and the European projects won by cartel members outside their home countries were counted into agreed global cartel quotas.

For this reason, the commission said that it was fining Japanese companies, "despite their nearly total absence from the market" in Europe "because their agreement to abstain from bidding contributed directly to the restriction of competition on the E.U. market." [ 24-01-07 1157GMT ]

Top managers of the companies met regularly to discuss what the  commission called "strategic issues." Lower level employees met "to divide projects and to prepare sham bids by the companies not supposed to win the tender, in order to leave an impression of genuine competition."

Members of the  cartel adopted code names to keep their communications secret. In the last years of the cartel, they relied on anonymous e-mail addresses for communication and used encryption for sending messages, the  commission added.

Evidence was provided in numerous documents and corporate statements provided by  ABB, the
commission said. This included "two detailed written agreements concluded in 1988). In addition,
Page 68 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
commission regulators conducted raids on company offices. All told, the  commission said its file includes some 25 000 pages of documents.
The large amount of the  fines result from the large size of the rigged market, the length of the  cartel
operation and the size of the firms, the  commission added.
E.U. Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made ending  price fixing  and market sharing  of her mandate. "The commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and
consumers for more than 16 years," she said: "The  commission has once more shown that it will not
tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business."
Other companies  fined include Japan's AE Power Systems and Schneider Electric SA (12197.FR).

HD          Siemens To Take Legal Action  Against  Antitrust Fine

Edited Press Release

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Germany's  Siemens AG (SI) said Wednesday it intends to go to the European Court of Justice to take legal action against antitrust  fines of round about EUR396 million charged by the EU  Commission.

TD
The company denies the blanket accusation of the EU  Commission that it participated in a  cartel in the European market for 72 kilo volt and higher gas-isolated switchgear systems, or GIS, between
1988 and 2004.

Price fixing  in the GIS segment took place only in a few projects in the  European economic area and only in the period between October 2002 and April 2004.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts," said Udo Niehage, President of the Power Transmission and Distribution, PTD, the Siemens Group that manufactures GIS systems.

Since investigations began, PTD has fully cooperated with the EU  Commission and made available the results of internal investigations.

The accusation that  Siemens participated in a cartel in the market for gas-isolated switchgear systems from 1988 to 2004 goes far beyond the findings of Siemens' internal investigation.
The company has repeatedly made clear in statements to the EU  Commission that it considers the
Commission's opinion unjustified for the most part. The company will therefore take legal action.
With the acquisition of VA Tech in 2005 and the integration of VA Tech T&D in the PTD Group,
Siemens assumed financial responsibility for VA Tech.

This responsibility also involves accepting any legal consequences resulting from past antitrust violations on the part of VA Tech. VA Tech companies in Italy, France, Great Britain and Austria were served with antitrust  fines totaling round EUR22 million at the same time  Siemens was charged antitrust  fines. In the VA Tech cases, the  fines seem disproportionately large as well, and legal action will be taken against any unjustified accusations.

Siemens has clear, binding rules that define ethical and legal business conduct. The internal investigations indicate that three  Siemens PTD employees fixed prices between October 2002 und April 2004. These employees were suspended immediately after accusations became known and no longer work for Siemens. "We do not tolerate conduct on the part of individuals that does massive damage to the company," said Udo Niehage. [ 24-01-07 1107GMT ]

LP
Several big engineering companies are expected to be hit with heavy  fines today after the
European Commission found they were involved in a  cartel in power generation equipment.

Among the companies facing possible action are Siemens, ABB and Alstom  from Europe, and the Japanese companies Mitsubishi, Hitachi  and Toshiba. There has been speculation that Siemens is expecting a fine of between euro250m and euro500m ( pounds 164m to pounds 328m).

TD
Under European law, the maximum  fine for price fixing  is 10pc of a company's annual sales. Experts in competition law are watching the case closely because the  cartel may have stretched back to the 1980s, so EC regulators are expected to take a tough line.

The claim was that some or all the companies jointly fixed prices and carved up the market for gas-insulated switchgear - used to control the flow of electricity at power sub-stations - among themselves.
Acting on a tip-off, regulators raided companies' premises in 2004.
Schneider Electric and Areva were also named as part of Brussels's investigation.

The European Commission is expected to condemn (on 24 January) a  cartel of approximately half a dozen companies in the electrical equipment sector, confirmed sources close to the dossier on 19
January. One of them is T&D, a subsidiary of the French company  Alstom,  sold to Areva at the end of
2003. The market concerned is that of gas insulated switchgear (GIS), switches found at the exit point of
power stations which convert medium tension into high tension to enable the transmission of electricity.

The case dates back to the end of the eighties. According to the  Commission, this secret  cartel has allowed its partners to maintain artificially high prices for GIS and to control the world market for the last
17 years.

TD
In addition to  Alstom  and Areva, the companies involved are Mitsubishi,  Hitachi  and Toshiba (Japanese). Other companies that have drawn the  Commission's ire are Schneider (French),  ABB (Swiss-Swedish) and  Siemens (German), who have each in turn been owners of the Austrian company VA Tech.
After surprise inspections in May 2004, the  Commission duly sent them notice of its decision in May
2006. It will now impose  fines for an as yet undetermined (it will be decided at the last minute) sum.

The European Commission has fined eleven companies a total of EUR 750.7 million for participating in a cartel for gas insulated switchgear (GIS) projects.
Used to control energy flows in electricity grids, GIS form part of power substations, and the EC’s  fine
represents the largest set of  fines imposed on a single cartel.

TD
The companies include Switzerland’s ABB, France’s Alstom,  Areva and Schneider, Japan’s Fuji Heavy, Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, and Toshiba, and both the Austrian and German units of Siemens, the latter of which was  fined a record EUR 396.5 million.

“The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years,” said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. “The case also demonstrates that the Commission can and will bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks.”

According to a  Commission statement, the firms informed each other of calls for tender for GIS and co-ordinated their bids to secure projects for the  cartel members according to their respective quotas.
“The companies agreed that the Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe and the European
companies would not sell in Japan,” it continued.
The announcement comes two years after Brussels carried out surprise inspections in May 2004.

ABB, which stood to be  fined EUR 215 million, had its penalty quashed after it provided information about the other firms involved. MS

Siemens suffered a fresh blow to its reputation and finances on Wednesday, when the European Commission ordered the German engineering group to pay a record 397m ($514m) fine for its "leadership role" in a long-running  price-fixing cartel.

The ruling by the  commission came ahead of Siemens's annual meeting in Munich on Friday, at which management is expected to face harsh investor criticism over a recent corruption scandal.

TD
Allegations that managers bribed customers to win contracts have already tarnished  Siemens', and Wednesday's ruling offers fresh embarrassment to a group that was until recently one of Germany's most admired businesses.

The Commission said it had punished  Siemens more severely than the other groups involved because of its size, market clout and the elevated role it performed in a  cartel that carved up the market for gas insulated switchgear - a type of heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in the power grid.
The 11 groups involved in the  cartel were fined a total 751m - the largest-ever  fine for a single cartel. Japan's Mitsubishi Electric was ordered to pay 119m,  Toshiba 91m and Hitachi  52m. Alstom,  the
French engineering group, received a  fine of 65m, but it may end up escaping at least a part of the  fine
because it sold the subsidiary involved in the price-fixing to Areva in 2004. The French nuclear power
group was jointly liable for 54m of  Alstom's  fine, the Commission said.

ABB, the Swiss group, was also part of the cartel but escaped punishment because it blew the whistle on its co-conspirators. Brussels said  ABB's fine would have amounted to 215m.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said: "The  Commission has put an end to a cartel that has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years. The Commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business."

Siemens said it would appeal the decision in front of the  European courts, and that it denied the Commission's "blanket accusation". The Munich-based group said in a statement that  price fixing  only took place in a "few projects" and only between October 2002 and April 2004.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts," said Udo Niehage, president of  Siemens' power transmission and distribution businesses.

But the  Commission insisted it had amassed 25,000 pages of evidence to back up its charges. It said that "members of the  cartel took sophisticated measures to keep their communications secret", including the use of code names for companies and individuals, anonymous email addresses and encrypted messages.

HD        FT.com site : Siemens plans to buy UGS for $3.5bn.

Siemens, Europe's largest engineering group, on Thursday said it planned an initial public offering of its VDO division, one of the world's largest car parts suppliers with annual sales of about 10bn, and confirmed it would buy UGS, the privately-held US industrial design software group, for $3.5bn.

Details of the plan were announced as  Siemens, which has been beset by bribery allegations, reported a 16 per cent fall in first-quarter net profit to 788m, which included the costs of a record 397m  fine from the European Commission for its "leadership role" in a long-running  price-fixing cartel.

TD
Operating profit rose 51 per cent to 1.63bn, above analysts' forecasts, as orders rose 4 per cent to
24.6bn.

The moves highlight the determination of Klaus Kleinfeld,  Siemens' chief executive, to push ahead with strengthening and restructuring his businesses despite being enmeshed in harmful corruption allegations.

UGS, a US company specialising in product lifecycle management, is currently owned by US private equity groups Silver Lake, Bain Capital and Warburg Pincus.
The private equity consortium bought UGS from Electronic Data Systems in a $2.1bn deal in March
2004. This marks one of the first exits from the latest cycle of software investments by private equity
firms. Before agreeing to a sale, Warburg, Bain and Silver Lake had been considering an IPO of UGS.

However, the news is likely to be overshadowed on Thursday by a torrent of criticism from investors over a 420m corruption scandal and under-performing businesses at the conglomerate's annual meeting in Munich.

Several foreign shareholders will abstain from giving approval to the actions of the entire management board and some non-executive directors, including chairman Heinrich von Pierer.

"They should postpone the votes and really it would have been better to have delayed the entire meeting to clear things up," one large Anglo-Saxon shareholder said.

Allegations of knowledge of bribery have been made against several former and current top managers, all of whom strenuously deny it.Other large shareholders, particularly from Germany, will urge a quick clean-up of the corruption allegations but will back executives.

Siemens intends to appeal the European Commission fines, calling them "totally exaggerated". The
11 groups - including Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba, Hitachi  and Alstom  - involved in the cartel were
fined a total 751m, the largest-ever  fine for a single cartel.
The Munich-based group denied the  Commission's "blanket accusation", saying in a statement that
price-fixing only took place in a "few projects" and only between October 2002 and April 2004.

ABB, the Swiss group, was also part of the cartel but escaped punishment because it blew the whistle on its co-conspirators. Brussels said  ABB's fine would have amounted to 215m.

The European Commission said it had punished Siemens more severely than others because of its size, market clout and the elevated role it performed in a cartel that carved up the market for gas insulated switchgear - a type of heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in the power grid. Siemens intends to appeal in the  European courts calling the  fines "totally exaggerated".

The European Commission (EC) has imposed a 396.6 mln  euro ($516 mln) fine on German engineering giant Siemens AG for participating in a  cartel that fixed prices for gas-isolated switchgear systems (GIS), the EC said on January 24, 2007.

In addition, Siemens Austria will be  fined 22.1 mln euro ($28.8 mln) because its subsidiary VA Tech also took part in the cartel.

TD
Overall the Commission has fined 10 European and Japanese electric equipment makers with a total
750 mln euro ($975.8 mln) for participating in the  cartel.

The EC said the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, shared projects between themselves, carved up markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information from
1988 to 2004.

Apart from  Siemens, French Alstom  and Areva were fined with 65 mln euro ($84.6 mln) and 53.6 mln euro ($69.7 mln), respectively, French Schneider with 8.1 mln  euro ($10.5 mln), Japanese Mitsubishi with 119 mln euro ($154.8 mln), Toshiba with 91 mln euro ($118.4 mln) and Hitachi  with 52 mln euro ($67.7 mln). Furthermore, Japanese Fuji will have to pay 3.8 mln  euro ($4.9 mln), Japan AE Power Systems 1.4 mln  euro ($1.8 mln), while Swiss  ABB received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency programme, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel.

Following the announcement of the EC decision,  Siemens said it would appeal with the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the  fine. The company rejected having been a part of the cartel between 1988 and 2004. There were talks in the GIS segment only on a few projects in the European economic area and only between October 2002 and April 2004,  Siemens said.

HD           EU Fines Japanese, European Firms 750 M. Euros over Cartel

LP
Brussels, Jan. 24 (Jiji Press)--The European Commission said Wednesday it has  fined 10 Japanese and European firms a total of 750.7 million euros for allegedly participating in an international  cartel for gas insulated switchgear.

It is "the largest set of  fines ever imposed on a single cartel" by the commission, according to a statement issued by the executive body of the European Union.

TD
Among the 10 companies are Germany's  Siemens AG, France's Alstom  SA and France's Areva SA, as well as five Japanese firms including Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Toshiba Corp. .

The commission alleged that the companies "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information" between 1988 and 2004.

The Japanese companies were  fined despite their nearly total absence from the  European market for the heavy equipment used at power plants, because their agreement to abstain from bidding "contributed directly to the restriction of competition" in the market, the  commission said.

Of the punished firms,  Siemens received the heaviest  fines, totaling 396.5 million  euros, the largest ever levied on a single company in a single  cartel case.

Mitsubishi was fined 118.5 million euros, Toshiba 90.9 million euros, Hitachi  Ltd. 51.7 million  euros, the Fuji Electric Holdings Co. group 3.7 million euros and Japan AE Power Systems Corp. 1.3 million euros.

Switzerland's ABB received full immunity from the  fines under the commission's leniency program by being the first cartel participant to report the wrongdoing to the commission.

Gas insulated switchgear is used to control energy flows in electricity grids and is a major component of turnkey power substations.
In Tokyo, Toshiba issued a statement that the firm will file a complaint against the  fines with the
European Court of Justice because it did not conduct the illegal activities alleged by the  commission.

''The  commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for over 16 years,'' Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said.

The cartel was formed between 1988 and 2004 for equipment called gas insulated switchgear, which is used to control energy flows in electricity grids at power stations.
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan was  fined the second largest amount of 118.5 million  euros.

''The  fines for the Japanese companies are so high because the amount is based on their share in the worldwide market,'' EU spokesman Jonathan Todd told reporters.
The combined amount of the  fines is the highest ever imposed by the  commission.
Documents proving the existence of the  cartel have been found dating back to 1988, the  commission
said.

To keep the  cartel hidden, the companies used code names for individuals and companies as well as anonymous e-mail addresses, it said.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 24 -- The European Commission said Wednesday it has fined 10 companies, including Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi  Ltd. of Japan, a combined 750 million euros, or about 120 billion yen, for running a  cartel to fix prices for electric power transmission equipment used at power generation facilities.

Of the 10,  Siemens AG of Germany was ordered to pay the largest  fine of 396 million euros, the executive body of the  European Union said.

''The  commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for over 16 years,'' Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said. ''The  commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business.''

The cartel was formed between 1988 and 2004 for equipment called gas insulated switchgear, which is used to control energy flows in electricity grids at power stations.

Under the cartel, Japanese firms agreed with  European firms to stay out of the  European market while the European counterparts agreed to refrain from receiving orders in Japan, according to the commission.
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan was  fined the second largest amount of 118.5 million  euros.

''The  fines for the Japanese companies are so high because the amount is based on their share in the worldwide market,'' EU spokesman Jonathan Todd told reporters. ''Japanese companies sold virtually nothing on the  European market, but by participating in the  cartel, they influenced the price for the EU as well.''

In Tokyo, Toshiba said its internal investigations showed that it had not been engaged in any practices violating European competition rules. It said it plans to appeal the case with the  European Court of Justice.
The combined amount of the  fines is the highest ever imposed in a  cartel case by the commission. Documents proving the existence of the  cartel have been found dating back to 1988, the  commission
said.

To keep the  cartel hidden, the companies used code names for individuals and companies as well as anonymous e-mail addresses, it said.

FRANKFURT, Jan 24 (Reuters) - German industrial conglomerate Siemens said on Wednesday a 397 million-euro ($516-million) cartel fine imposed on it by the European Commission would have a direct impact on its profits.

A manager at the Siemens division involved, Power Transmission and Distribution, said no provisions had been made for such a fine.

Earlier, the  Commission confirmed a Reuters report that it would impose its toughest  cartel fine for a single offence: a total of 751 million  euros against makers of electrical power system switchgear, after finding they had fixed prices.

Siemens will report its first-quarter results on Thursday.

(Adds details, quotes from  Siemens)

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Siemens AG said it plans to appeal against a multi-million  euro antitrust  fine imposed by the European Commission over alleged cartel activity in the market for gas-isolated switchgear systems (GIS), calling it "completely exaggerated."

TD
"Siemens intends to go to the  European Court of Justice," the German conglomerate said in a statement.

Siemens said it "denies the blanket accusation" that it was part of a  cartel in the European GIS market between 1988 and 2004.

The EU Commission announced earlier it had  fined 11 companies a total of 750.7 mln eur for participation in the cartel.

Siemens was given the largest  fine at 418.7 mln eur, which includes 22.1 mln for its VA Tech subsidiary that it acquired in 2005.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  commission arrived at these amounts," said Udo Niehage, president of Power Transmission and Distribution (PTD), the  Siemens unit that makes GIS systems.

Siemens said the EU  Commission's accusation that it participated in the cartel goes "far beyond the findings of  Siemens' internal investigation" and described the commission's findings as "unjustified for the most part."

It said an internal investigation showed that three employees of the  Siemens PTD business were involved in price-fixing between Oct 2002 and April 2004. They were suspended immediately after accusations became known, and no longer work for  Siemens, the company said.

"We do not tolerate conduct on the part of individuals that does massive damage to the company," Niehage said. newsdesk@afxnews.com jfb/jsa/har/jfb/tw

HD     EU fines 11 companies 750.7 mln eur for switchgear cartel activity UPDATE WC     667 words

(Updates with further detail)

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said it has fined 11 companies a total of 750.7 mln eur for participation in a cartel for gas insulated switchgear projects between 1988 and 2004.

TD
The set of  fines is the largest ever imposed on a single  cartel.
The companies involved are  Siemens AG,  ABB Ltd, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji Co, Hitachi  Japan AE Power
Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Toshiba Corp and VA Tech.

The commission said the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

The largest  fine, of 418.7 mln eur, was imposed on Siemens -- the amount included 22.1 mln following the group's acquisition of VA Tech. This is the largest fine ever imposed by the EU executive on a single company for a single cartel infringement.

ABB was fined 215.2 mln eur,  Alstom  65.0 mln, Areva 53.6 mln,  Fuji 3.8 mln, Hitachi  51.2 mln, Japan AE Power Systems 1.4 mln, Mitsubishi Electric Corp 118.5 mln, Schneider 8.1 mln, and  Toshiba 90.9 mln.

ABB, whose fine was increased by 50 pct for being a repeat offender, was however eventually granted full immunity by acting as  cartel whistleblower.

The commission increased the fines by 50 pct for  Siemens, Alstom  and Areva for their "leadership role" in the cartel.

Areva is liable for the four-month period after its purchase of an  Alstom  unit in January 2004 until the end of the cartel.

"There is a presumption that a parent company exercises decisive influence over its wholly owned subsidiary," it said.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "The  commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years."

Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids, and is the major component of turnkey power substations.

Substations are auxiliary power stations where electrical current is converted from high to low voltage or the reverse.

GIS is sold both as an item of equipment to be integrated into a turnkey power substation and as an integral part of turnkey power substations.

From at least 1988, when a written agreement between the members was adopted, suppliers informed each other of calls for tender for GIS and co-ordinated their bids in order to secure projects for the  cartel members or to agree minimum bidding prices.

Page 96 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The companies agreed that the Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe, and the  European
companies would not sell in Japan.

European tenders were usually allocated according to the  cartel rules and the European projects won by
cartel members outside their home countries were counted into the agreed global cartel quotas.

The commission therefore said that the Japanese companies have also been  fined, despite "their nearly total absence" from the market for GIS in  Europe, because their agreement to abstain from bidding "contributed directly to the restriction of competition" on the EU market.

It added that the companies met regularly at the management level to discuss strategic issues, and at a lower level to divide projects and to prepare "sham bids" by the companies not supposed to win tenders.

It also said the companies took "sophisticated measures" to keep their communications secret. Code names were used for both companies and individuals. In the last years of the  cartel they relied on anonymous e-mail addresses for communication and used encryption for sending messages, said the commission.

HD     EU fines 10 companies €750 million for power gear cartel

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators  fined 10 companies a combined €750 million (US$978 million)
on Wednesday for running a  cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, with
Siemens AG ordered to pay more than half the total.

Several of the other companies penalized in what the EU called the largest set of fines on a single cartel were Japanese businesses that struck a deal to stay out of  Europe, while the Europeans  steered clear of Japan's market.

TD
The European Commission said the companies rigged bids for contracts to supply power plants, fixed prices, shared projects between themselves, carved up markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information from 1988 and 2004.
It increased  Siemens' fine by half to €396.5 million (US$517 million) -- making this the second-highest
cartel fine it has ever levied -- because the company played a leadership role in fixing prices.

Siemens immediately said it would appeal the "exaggerated"  fine, claiming the EU had made a "blanket accusation" when  price fixing  had occurred only in isolated cases.
But EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said regulators were "extremely sure" their decision was legal. Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. had the next biggest  fine of €118.5 million (US$154.5 million), followed
by Toshiba Corp.'s €90.9 million (US$118.5 million).

Mitsubishi said it was considering its response, while  Toshiba denied any wrongdoing. "Our own investigations show that we have not engaged in any actions that violate  European competition laws, and we plan to fight this decision in  European courts,"  Toshiba said in a statement.

France's  Alstom  SA must pay €65 million (US$84.7 million). Areva was  fined €53.5 million (US$69.7 million) for the actions of a subsidiary it bought from  Alstom  just four months before investigators launched surprise raids. Both  fines were increased by 50 percent for the companies helping organize the cartel.

Hitachi  Ltd. must pay €51.75 million (US$67.5 million). It had no immediate comment.

Siemens is also responsible for its Austrian unit VA Technologie AG's €22 million (US$28.7 million)  fine. It bought the company after the end of the  cartel.

The Commission said the parent company was responsible for the  fine if it had "decisive influence over commercial behavior of its subsidiaries."
Schneider Electric SA must pay €8.1 million (US$10.56 million),  Fuji Electric Holdings Co. Ltd. must pay
€3.75 million (US$4.9 million) and Japan AE Power Systems -- a joint venture between  Fuji, Hitachi  and
Meidensha Corp. -- was  fined €1.35 million (US$1.76 million).

"These companies accounted for virtually all the supply of these products on the  European market," said
Todd.

"The Commission regards this cartel as totally unacceptable behavior on behalf of the companies concerned and we sincerely hope that companies will see the large  fines imposed as what awaits them if they were inclined to follow this bad example," he said.
The basic fines are calculated on the companies' share of the  European market but the Japanese  fines
were based on total worldwide turnover.

ABB Ltd. received full immunity for blowing the whistle, escaping a potential €215 million fine. The Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering company said in 2004 that it discovered price-fixing during an internal audit and had dismissed two managers.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The companies all handled gas-insulated switchgear, heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids that is an important part of auxiliary power stations where electrical current is converted from high to low voltage or the reverse.

The equipment is usually sold to utilities at public tenders where companies pitch bids and the lowest is chosen.

Regulators said the suppliers coordinated their bids to allow each company to get a certain quota of contracts or keep to a minimum bidding price. The deal to keep Japanese companies out of  Europe ultimately hurt  European consumers, the Commission said, fining several Japanese companies even though they sold no power gear in Europe.

Officials said management met regularly to discuss strategic issues while lower-level executives divided projects and prepared sham bids by companies who were not supposed to win the tender "in order to leave an impression of genuine competition."

The cartel tried very hard to cover its traces, using code names for rival companies and communicating via anonymous and encrypted e-mail, the  Commission said. It published a message from one unidentified  cartel organizer to another, forbidding e-mail from home and company computers and urging the use of anonymous e-mail addresses.

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (CIA) - The  European Commission has fined ten companies producing equipment for the energy industry a total of EUR 750.7 mln. More than one half of the fine, EUR 396.56 mln, will be paid by the concern  Siemens. The concern  ABB received full immunity from fines under the Commissionĺs leniency programme, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, EC press department said.
The European Commission has found out that the ten  fined companies formed a cartel in years 1988 -
2004, which rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared
markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information. The  cartel applied to the
production and supplies of gas insulated switchgear. The  cartel affected operators of transmission and
distribution grids in different  European countries.

TD
CEPS spokeswoman Jana Jaburkova told CIA that CEPS had not recorded existence of such  cartel
during its public tenders.

Besides Siemens, EC fined also Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (EUR 118.6 mln),  Toshiba (EUR 90.9 mln), Alstom  (over EUR 65 mln), Areva (EUR 53.55mln),  Hitachi  (EUR 51.75 mln), VA Tech (EUR
22.05 mln), Schneider (EUR 8.1 mln),  Fuji (EUR 3.75 mln), and Japan AE Power Systems (EUR 1.35 mln).

The EU has  fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme. It's the largest fine ever imposed on a single cartel and German engineering giant Siemens will take the brunt of the penalty.

The fines imposed by the European Commission for breaking antitrust rules on 10 companies based in the EU, Switzerland and Japan amount to more than 750 million  euros ($975 million), the commission said.

TD
German firm Siemens will be punished with a  fine of 396.6 million  euros ($513 million). According to the commission, it is the largest  fine ever imposed on a single company for a single  cartel infringement.
The 10 companies penalized are: Alstom,  Areva, Fuji, Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi
Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech.

The heavy equipment in question is gas-insulated switchgear, which is used to control energy flows in electricity grids and is the major component of turnkey power substations. Substations are auxiliary power stations where electrical current is converted from high to low voltage or the reverse.

"Between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the  commission said.

The investigation began back in May 2004 when EU and national antitrust officials conducted surprise inspections on company premises. The firms then received official notification of the charges in May last year.

An 11th firm,  ABB Ltd., the globe's largest builder of electricity networks, tipped off the EU and escaped any fine.
"ABB has been the whistleblower and has been cooperating with the  commission," Wolfram
Eberhardt, a spokesman for the Zurich-based company, told Bloomberg News.
Appeal

Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering company, responded to the announcement of  fines saying it plans to appeal.

"Siemens intends to go to the European Court of Justice to take legal action against antitrust  fines … charged by the EU Commission," the company said in a statement. It added that it "denies the blanket accusation" that it was part of a cartel between 1988 and 2004.
"Agreements about gas-isolated switchgear systems only took place between October 2002 and April
2004 with just a few projects in  Europe," the company said.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that the EU executive had ended a  cartel "which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years."

The commission was poised "to bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks," she added.

HD          UPDATE: Siemens To Take Legal Action  Against  EU Fines

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Germany's Siemens AG (SI) said Wednesday it will go to the  European Court of Justice to contest  fines levied by the European Commission for price fixing  in high-voltage gas insulated switchgear.

Shortly before  Siemens issued its statement, the  European Commission had said it will fine the company a total of around EUR419 million.

TD
Of that, Siemens Austria is being  fined EUR22 million for antitrust violations regarding related to VA Tech, which Siemens acquired in 2005. The larger  fine of nearly EUR397 million is for  Siemens AG.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts,"  Siemens said a statement.

Despite the size of the  fines, an analyst said  Siemens isn't likely to be negatively affected, since payment would be same way off and the company has likely taken provisions in recent years.

At 1154 GMT,  Siemens shares were almost flat, trading down EUR0.02 at EUR76.50 in an overall higher market.

Siemens denies it participated in a  cartel for gas-isolated switchgear systems from 1988 to 2004, as the EU contends. That goes far beyond the findings of  Siemens' internal investigation, the company said, which show three employees in  Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution Group had fixed prices between October 2002 and April 2004 only.
The same applies to the  European Commission's fine for VA Tech, said  Siemens.

"In the VA Tech cases, the  fines seem disproportionately large as well, and legal action will be taken against any unjustified accusations,"  Siemens said.

Siemens, along with France's Alstom  SA (10022047.FR) and Areva SA (427583.FR), were singled
out for their leading roles in the cartel and had their penalties increased by 50%, the European          
Commission said.
In total, the European Commission has imposed a cartel fine of nearly EUR751 million on
Wednesday for price fixing  by electric equipment makers.

Siemens will hold a press conference later Wednesday at 1400 GMT.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 12 multinationals, headed up by Germany's  Siemens AG (SI), a total of almost EUR751 million for taking part in a  cartel for
gas-insulated switchgear products which operated for 19 years.

TD
The fine imposed on Siemens, a total of EUR419 million, was the second-largest ever levied by the
European regulators.

Three of the companies -  Siemens, France's Alstom  SA (10022047.FR), which was  fined EUR65 million, and Areva SA (427583.FR), which was fined EUR53.6 million - were identified as having played leadership roles in the  cartel and therefore had their  fines increased by 50%.
In contrast, Switzerland's  ABB Electrical Industries Co. escaped a potential EUR215 million  fine
because it blew the whistle on the illegal  price-fixing. It isn't required to pay any penalty.

Major Japanese companies also were targeted for their participation. Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO) will have to pay EUR118.6 million,  Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) EUR90 million,  Hitachi  Ltd. (HIT) EUR51.8 million, and  Fuji Electric Systems Co. (3515.TO) EUR3.7 million.
The companies can appeal the  fines to the European Court of Justice.

In a statement, the  commission said that starting in 1988 companies "fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."
Suppliers informed each other of calls for tender and coordinated their bids, the  commission said. Alternatively, they would agree to respect minimum bidding prices.
The companies agreed that the Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe, and the  European companies would not sell in Japan, it added. European tenders were usually allocated according to the cartel rules and the European projects won by cartel members outside their home countries were counted into agreed global cartel quotas.

For this reason, the commission said that it was fining Japanese companies, "despite their nearly total absence from the market" in Europe "because their agreement to abstain from bidding contributed directly to the restriction of competition on the E.U. market."

Top managers of the companies met regularly to discuss what the  commission called "strategic issues." Lower level employees met "to divide projects and to prepare sham bids by the companies not supposed to win the tender, in order to leave an impression of genuine competition."

Members of the  cartel adopted code names to keep their communications secret. In the last years of the cartel, they relied on anonymous e-mail addresses for communication and used encryption for sending messages, the  commission added.
Evidence was provided in numerous documents and corporate statements provided by  ABB, the
commission said. This included "two detailed written agreements concluded in 1988). In addition,

commission regulators conducted raids on company offices. All told, the  commission said its file includes some 25 000 pages of documents.
The large amount of the  fines result from the large size of the rigged market, the length of the  cartel
operation and the size of the firms, the  commission added.
E.U. Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made ending  price fixing  and market sharing  of her mandate. "The commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and
consumers for more than 16 years," she said: "The  commission has once more shown that it will not
tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business."
Other companies  fined include Japan's AE Power Systems and Schneider Electric SA (12197.FR).

Siemens said it would contest the  fines, calling them "completely exaggerated."

Alstom  will take a decision on whether to contest the  fines only after it has received the text of the decision and has had time to examine it, a spokesman said.
Areva and Schneider Electric weren't immediately available to comment.

HD           Siemens: Legal Action  Will Aim To Reduce EU Fine

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German technology company Siemens AG (SI) said Wednesday said it plans to take legal action against the European Commission's hefty antitrust  fine in a bid to reduce the amount.
The company didn't specify by how much it aims to reduce the charge.
At a press conference Wednesday,  Siemens also said the fine will be booked retroactively in its
October-December period, which is the company's fiscal first quarter.

Siemens will report first-quarter figures Thursday.
The company added the payment will have to be made within three months.

Earlier Wednesday  European Commission had said it will fine Siemens and its Austrian subsidiary nearly EUR417 million.
The fine is related to its participation in a  price-fixing cartel for gas insulated switchgear systems, or
GIS.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts,"  Siemens said a statement.

Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz said the  fine doesn't come as a surprise and the amount is in line with what the market expected.

"Of course its negative in general," he said, adding that it shouldn't hurt the company's share price. He rates the company at buy with an EUR84 price target.

At 1535 GMT,  Siemens shares were trading up EUR1.07, or 1.4%, at EUR77.62 in an overall higher market.

Siemens denies it participated in a  cartel for gas-isolated switchgear systems from 1988 to 2004, as the EU contends. That goes far beyond the findings of  Siemens' internal investigation, the company said, which show three employees in  Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution Group had fixed prices between October 2002 and April 2004 only.
The same applies to the  European Commission's fine for VA Tech, said  Siemens.

"In the VA Tech cases, the  fines seem disproportionately large as well, and legal action will be taken against any unjustified accusations,"  Siemens said.

Siemens, along with France's Alstom  SA (10022047.FR) and Areva SA (427583.FR), were singled
out for their leading roles in the cartel and had their penalties increased by 50%, the European          
Commission said.
In total, the European Commission has imposed a cartel fine of nearly EUR751 million on
Wednesday for price fixing  by 11 electric equipment makers.

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Japan's  Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) said Thursday that it won't change its earnings outlook for the fiscal year ending March after being hit by a huge antitrust  fine by the European Commission.

The European Commission Wednesday fined 12 multinationals, headed up by Germany's  Siemens AG (SI), a total of almost EUR751 million for taking part in a  cartel for gas-insulated switchgear products which operated for 19 years.

MUNICH, Germany (AP) - Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG saw net profit fall 16 percent in its most recent quarter due to a  European Union fine for price-fixing, but the stock rose Thursday as earnings otherwise improved and investors responded to the acquisition of a U.S. software company.

Net profit in the three months through Dec. 31, the company's fiscal first quarter, fell to €788 million (US$1.02 billion) from €939 million in the same period the year before, due to a €423 million (US$550 million) charge for the EU  fine.

TD
First-quarter sales gained 6 percent to €19.07 billion (US$24.8 billion), and operating earnings -- which exclude one-time expenses such as the  fine -- jumped 51 percent to €1.63 billion (US$2.1 billion). Company shares rose 5.9 percent to €82.60 (US$107.38) in afternoon trading in Frankfurt.

Investors were also responding to overnight word that  Siemens had agreed to buy U.S. business software maker UGS for US$2.1 billion (€1.6 billion) and planned an IPO for a minority stake in its Siemens VDO Automotive auto parts maker.
The positive market response was a bright spot on a difficult day for management as it sought to reassure
13,000 shareholders at the annual meeting that  Siemens was on track despite the  fine and a corruption
investigation into alleged illegal payments to win telecommunications business overseas.

Six current and former employees, including top executives, were detained in November. They have been released, but the investigation continues and the company says it has identified €420 million (US$546 million) in suspect payments.

A number of investors voted not to approve the work of Kleinfield and board chairman Heinrich von Pierer. The vote is mostly a formality but gives unhappy investors a chance to vent their anger, and some did: Kleinfield got 71.4 percent and von Pierer 65.9 percent, according to company spokesman Marc Langendorf.

"The business year 2005-2006 had two faces, one beaming and the other gloomy" CEO Klaus Kleinfeld said in a speech to the subdued crowd in Munich's Olympia Hall.

"I suspect you feel the same way I do when you open the newspaper -- dumbfounded," he said. "Dumbfounded because  Siemens is associated with something else -- integrity, honesty and exemplary behavior."

"I would like to say once again ... there is no place for unclean business practices in our company, and that principle is nonnegotiable," he said to applause.

Later, shareholders were to vote on approving the work of the board of directors and the top management team. Though a formality, it gives them a chance to register displeasure by voting no.

Excluding the EU  fine, Siemens' net profit was above the €962 million (US$1.3 billion) forecast by analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. The  fine arose from a European Commission antitrust

investigation, which penalized  Siemens for price-fixing among providers of a gas-insulated switchgear in the power transmission and distribution industry.

The company's stronger performance was helped by improved earnings from its information technology services, medical equipment and transportation systems divisions.  Siemens makes a wide range of equipment and machines -- industrial lighting, power turbines, railway and streetcar equipment, diagnostic machines, and auto parts.

"In terms of the underlying performance of our business, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," Kleinfeld said in a statement on the earnings. "Order growth was particularly satisfying, considering that the prior-year basis of comparison was already quite high."

Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said  Siemens' rating would not drop despite the agreement to buy UGS, a deal amounting to US$3.5 billion including the UGS debt  Siemens would take over. The company's "financial risk profile will not materially deteriorate," the agency said, thanks to revenue from the anticipated automotive IPO.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Nikkei)--The  European Union on Wednesday issued  fines totaling 750 million euros, or about 120 billion yen, against Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) and nine other Japanese and European firms for fixing prices on switchgears used by power utilities.

This is the biggest  fine assessed by the EU's European Commission for a single cartel. While the Japanese companies have done very little business in the EU, the commission says they colluded with the  European firms to distort price competition by staying out of one another's markets. The cartel was allegedly run for around 16 years.

TD
Mitsubishi Electric was  fined about 118 million  euros, with Hitachi  Ltd. (6501),  Toshiba Corp. (6502),
Fuji Electric Systems Co. and Japan AE Power Systems Corp. also facing financial penalties.

Germany's Siemens AG received the largest  fine of roughly 396 million  euros, while Alstom  SA and other European companies were penalized as well. Also implicated was Swiss firm ABB Ltd., but its fine was waived for providing information concerning the  cartel.

"We will consider our response, including filing an appeal in  European court, after reviewing (the order)", Mitsubishi Electric said.
Objecting to the  commission's decision,  Siemens plans to appeal. (The Nikkei Thursday morning edition)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Toshiba Corp. (6502) plans to appeal a  European Union fine for price-fixing, while the other implicated Japanese firms are still weighing their responses.

The EU's  European Commission issued fines Wednesday against five  European and five Japanese companies for fixing prices on switchgears used by power utilities. Mitsubishi Electric Corp.'s (6503) fine of 118.5 million  euros, or about 19 billion yen, is the largest among the Japanese contingent. Toshiba faces the second-highest  fine of 90.9 million  euros, with Hitachi  Ltd. (6501),  Fuji Electric Systems Co. and Japan AE Power Systems Corp. penalized as well.

TD
"We have not engaged in illegal activity, so we will fight this in  European court,"  Toshiba said.

Hitachi  is also considering an appeal, arguing that it does not sell the equipment at issue in  Europe. The firm's power equipment operations were transferred to Japan AE Power Systems in 2002.

Fuji Electric Systems says it will formulate a response after reviewing the order.

With such firms as Germany's Siemens AG, which received the largest  fine of roughly 396 million euros, dominating the European market for utility infrastructure, Japanese companies have made almost no inroads there. But the commission says they colluded with the  European businesses to stay out of one another's markets, thereby distorting price competition.

European Union regulators fined 10 companies a total of $978 million for running a  cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by utilities. Siemens was ordered to pay more than half the total. Several of the other companies penalized in what the European Union called the largest set of fines on a single cartel, were Japanese businesses that struck a deal to stay out of  Europe, while the Europeans steered clear of Japan's market. The  European Commission said the companies rigged bids for contracts to supply power plants, fixed prices, shared projects among themselves, carved up markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information from 1988 to 2004. It increased the Siemens fine by half, to 396.5 million  euros ($517 million). Siemens said it would appeal the  fine.

LONDON

LONDON - Siemens has been hit with the  European Commission's biggest single  fine for helping to lead a cartel that used secret codes and encrypted e-mails to conceal its efforts to rig the market in electrical switchgear.

TD
The Commission has levied a record fine equalling $972 million U.S. against 11 power equipment firms, of which Siemens will suffer the biggest penalty. The German electronics group is fined the equivalent of
$513 million, a penalty increased by 50 per cent for its role as a ringleader in the cartel for gas-insulated switchgear (GIS).

The penalty's size caused shares in  Siemens to dip on the Frankfurt exchange, but the company said that it would appeal against the sum, which will hit its first-quarter profits. The company had made no provision for the fine.

However, ABB, of Switzerland, another conspirator, has escaped a  fine altogether for blowing the whistle on the cartel to the Commission in 2004.

The Commission's competition directorate said that between 1988 and 2004, the  cartel carved up markets and rigged tender prices for GIS -- equipment to control energy flows in electricity grids.

In addition to  Siemens and ABB, the conspirators were  Alstom,  Areva and Schneider, the French groups, and five Japanese companies:  Fuji, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric,  Toshiba and Japan AE Power Systems.

The switchgear suppliers informed each other of tender offers by customers, and co-ordinated bids to ensure that business was won in line with a quota for each  cartel member. In addition, markets were sliced up geographically.

MUNICH, Germany, Jan 25, 2007 (AFP) -

German electronics giant  Siemens booked Thursday a positive set of results for the first quarter of its current business year, even if bottom-line profits were hit by a record fine by the European Commission.

TD
Siemens, which runs its business from October to September, said in a statement that net profit amounted to 788 million  euros (one billion dollars) in the three months to December, down 16 percent from the year-earlier period.

Analysts had been pencilling in net profit of around 973 million  euros for the three-month period, but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 423 million  euros booked at the last minute.

On Wednesday, the EU Commission in Brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on Siemens and its Austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing in its power generation division.

Siemens is appealing the  fine, but must nevertheless pay it initially.
Underlying earnings improved in the October-December period, however, with operating profit jumping by
51 percent to 1.631 billion eruos, boosted by strong performances of the medical technology and
automation divisions.

First-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion  euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion  euros.

MUNICH, Germany, Jan 25, 2007 (AFP) -

German electronics giant Siemens reported on Thursday first-quarter profits set back at the last minute by a record fine by the European Commission.

TD
Siemens, which runs its business from October to September, said in a statement that net profit amounted to 788 million  euros (one billion dollars) in the three months to December, down 16 percent from the year-earlier period.

Analysts had been pencilling in net profit of around 973 million  euros for the three-month period, but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 423 million  euros booked at the last minute.

On Wednesday, the EU Commission in Brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on Siemens and its Austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division.

Siemens is appealing against the  fine, but must nevertheless pay it initially.
Underlying earnings improved in the October-December period, however, with operating profit jumping by
51 percent to 1.631 billion  euros, boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and
automation divisions.

First-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion  euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion  euros.

"In terms of our underlying performance, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," said chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld.

"While it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past, we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year."

Overnight,  Siemens announced that it had agreed to buy US software maker UGS for 3.5 billion dollars including debt.

In addition,  Siemens would float its automotive supply business,  Siemens VDO Automotive (SV), on the stock exchange, with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake.

"This move will give SV the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth,"  Siemens said.

Looking ahead, the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter, after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter.

The publication of  Siemens' first-quarter results coincided with the group's annual shareholders meeting later on Thursday where management was expected to face angry questions about the current corruption probe and the collapse of the group's former mobile phones business.

Some shareholder groups have threatened to withhold a vote of confidence in management in what would be more a symbolic move that would further tarnish  Siemens' image.

"The commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the statement.
The total penalty is the second-highest imposed by the  commission for a cartel, following a record
790.5 million euros for fixing vitamin prices in 2001. The companies have a right to appeal the
decision to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Ms Kroes has made fighting cartels
a priority in her five-year term. The  commission fined seven companies a record 1.84 billion  euros
last year.

"The commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business," Ms Kroes said in the statement.

ABB, the world's largest builder of electricity networks, tipped off the EU and wasn't  fined. The company escaped a 215.2-million  euro fine, the commission said.

The investigation began when  European and national antitrust officials conducted surprise inspections of companies' premises on May 11 and 12, 2004. The probe focuses on the market for gas-insulated high-tension electric switchgear, used to control flow in electricity grids. Customers include state-owned public utilities, municipalities and private companies. The  commission sent official charge sheets to companies in May 2006.
Spokespeople for Rueil-Malmaison, France-based Schneider Electric,  Alstom,  based near Paris, and
Siemens declined to comment before the EU announced the  fines.

Siemens, based in Munich, completed the purchase of VA Technologie in September 2005 for 728.5 million euros.

An Areva spokesman, who didn't want to be identified, said the Paris-based company bought the transmission and distribution division in January 2004 from  Alstom.  The EU told Areva that it was under investigation four months later. During takeover negotiations, there was no mention of the alleged cartel, he said. The  commission fined Areva 53.6 million  euros.

"For most of the duration of the infringement, a former  Alstom  subsidiary, bought by Areva four months before the end of the cartel, is jointly and severally liable with  Alstom  for the infringement," the commission said. If the price-fixing fine covered a period when Areva wasn't the owner, Areva reserves the right to sue Alstom,  the spokesman said. The EU levied a 65 million  euro fine against Alstom.

"ABB has been the whistleblower and has been cooperating with the  commission," said Wolfram Eberhardt, a spokesman for Zurich-based  ABB. Chief executive officer Fred Kindle said in an interview May 4, 2006, that  ABB "took the initiative because of our informal discoveries within the company."

Czech and Hungarian authorities also probed the  cartel. Czech regulators said January 8 that they sent statements of objections to unidentified companies last month.

On December 23, 2005, the Hungarian Competition Authority  fined Alstom,  Siemens, VA Tech and two Areva units 702 million forint ($3.7 million) for committing a "serious infringement" of competition law. The companies were found to have shared markets in the gas-insulated switchgear market involving projects in Hungary, the authority said.
The worldwide cartel began in 1988 and lasted until 2004, the  commission said.

HD     COMPETITION : 750.7 MILLION EURO FINE FOR GAS INSULATED SWITCHGEAR CARTEL WC    664 words

An enquiry that lasted three years, produced twenty-five thousand pages of documentation and with eleven internationally renowned companies implicated, the gas insulated switchgear (GIS)  cartel will surely go down in the  European Commission's history as one of the most serious infringements' ever to have been uncovered, both because of the length of time (the  cartel lasted more than 16 years) and the sophistication of the methods used to conceal the  cartel. The penalty imposed on 24 January mirrors the case itself: huge. The  European Commission delivered a verdict imposing a (total) record  fine of
€750,712,500.

TD
Judged to be the leading instigator of an almost worldwide (North America was not involved)  price fixing, which the Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, recalled "has cheated public utility companies and consumers,"  Siemens Germany received the largest  fine of €396,562,500 (its Austrian subsidiary was fined €22 million). As soon as the verdict was announced, Siemens retorted by saying it would appeal against the "totally exaggerated"  fine. The two French companies, Alstom  and Areva, also considered as instigators, were  fined €65 million between the two of them (€53.55 million for  Alstom  and €11.5 million for Areva). The Japanese group Mitsubishi Electric, despite only having taken advantage of the  cartel outside of  Europe, was also hit with a particularly heavy  fine (€118.75 million). Four other Japanese groups were also targeted (Toshiba was fined €90.9 million,  Hitachi  €51.75 million, Fuji €3.7 million and Japan AE Power Systems €1.35 million). And, finally, the French group Schneider was fined €8.1 million.
The Commission was originally alerted to the  cartel in 2004 when the Swiss-Swedish group,  ABB, also
a member of the cartel, came forward with information about the  cartel. Because of its cooperation,  ABB
received full immunity from fines under the Commission's leniency programme and was therefore
exempted from paying a fine of €215 million.

The Commission's enquiry revealed that the  cartel had been in operation since 1988 at least, when a written agreement between the members was adopted, by which GIS suppliers informed each other of calls for tender that concerned them and coordinated their bids in order to secure projects for the  cartel members. The companies also agreed that the Japanese companies would not sell in  Europe, and the European companies would not sell in Japan (hence the reason for fining the Japanese companies).

When the  Commission, at the end of the 1990s, started cracking down on cartels and introducing stricter penalties for offending companies, the  cartel developed increasingly sophisticated measures to keep their communications secret - single-use code names for both companies and individuals, encrypted telephone lines (registered in other member states) and even a website. The companies stopped at nothing to keep operating, not to mention the regularly organised secret meetings in Switzerland to oversee the  cartel's policy.
Areva a victim of joint liability?

Exactly how much does the French group Areva (nuclear energy) have to pay? On paper, the Commission condemned it, together with Alstom,  to pay €65 million. Not fair, said Areva, because the company only acquired TND SA (a subsidiary of Alstom)  in January 2004 (four months before the Commission found out about the  cartel). Areva also argued that when buying TND SA, Alstom  had provided a written guarantee that it was not violating  European law. But the Commission cut the argument in the bud, claiming that a mother company should ensure that its subsidiaries are not members of any cartels. Nevertheless, it would appear that the Commission did take note of the objections, andEuropolitics has been informed that Areva will only be fined €11.5 million and the remainder will fall to

Alstom  to pay. The directors of Areva not long ago informed  Europolitics that they would go to court against Alstom  regardless of the amount of the  fine, in order to save the group's honour.

Siemens, Europe's largest engineering group, is to strengthen its core automation division by paying about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.8bn) to buy private equity-owned UGS as it seeks to show it has not been paralysed by bribery allegations.

Details of the plan emerged as  Siemens suffered a fresh blowto its reputation yesterday,when the European Commission ordered the German engineering group to pay a record  Euros 397m fine for its "leadership role" in a long-running  price-fixing cartel.

TD
In addition to the UGS deal, the German conglomerate was last night also considering whether to float its VDO division, one of the world's largest car parts suppliers with annual sales of about  Euros 10bn, according to people close to the situation.

The moves highlight the determination of Klaus Kleinfeld,Siemens' chief executive, to push ahead with strengthening and restructuring his businesses in spite of being enmeshed in harmful corruption allegations in its telecoms division.

UGS, a US company specialising in product lifecycle management, is owned by the US private equity groups Silver Lake, Bain Capital and Warburg Pincus.

However, the news of the deal is likely to be overshadowed today by a torrent of criticism from investors over the Euros 420m corruption scandal and also underperforming businesses at the company's annual meeting.

Several foreign shareholders will abstain from giving approval to the actions of the management board and some non-executive directors, including the chairman Heinrich von Pierer. "They should postpone the votes and really it would have been better to have delayed the entire meeting to clear things up," one large shareholder said. Allegations of knowledge of bribery have been made against several former and current top managers, all of whom strenuously deny it.

Other large shareholders, particularly from Germany, will urge a quick clean-up of the allegations but will back executives.

The Commission said it had punished  Siemens more severely because of its size, market clout and the elevated role it performed in a  cartel that carved up the market for gas-insulated switchgear.

Siemens intends to appeal in the  European courts.
The 11 groups involved were  fined a total Euros 751m, the largest-ever  fine for a single cartel. Japan's Mitsubishi Electric was ordered to pay  Euros 119m, Toshiba Euros 91m and Hitachi Euros
52m. Alstom,  the French engineering group, received a  fine of Euros 65m, but may end up escaping
part of the fine because it sold the subsidiary involved to Areva in 2004.

HD       Siemens in Dollars 3.5bn acquisition as cartel fine deals fresh blow. BY       By TOBIAS BUCK, RICHARD MILNE, JAMES POLITI and LINA SAIGOL

Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering group, last night signed a Dollars 3.5bn deal including debt to buy UGS, the private equity-owned US software company.

The move reflects an effort by the German group to strengthen its core automation division as it seeks to show it has not been paralysed by bribery allegations.

TD
News of the purchase, reported on FT.com yesterday afternoon, emerged as  Siemens suffered a fresh blow when the European Commission ordered the German conglomerate to pay a record  Euros 397m (Dollars 522m) fine for its "leadership role" in a  price-fixing cartel.

Siemens last night also approved an initial public offering of its VDO unit, a car-parts supplier. Both measures were discussed last night at a supervisory board meeting.

The moves highlight the determination of Klaus Kleinfeld,  Siemens' chief executive, to push ahead with strengthening and restructuring his businesses in spite of being enmeshed in corruption allegations.

UGS - a Texas-based company specialising in software for product lifecycle management - is owned by Bain Capital, Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus. The private equity groups are expected to make about 2.5 times their money, said one person close to the talks.

They bought UGS from Electronic Data Systems for Dollars 2.1bn in 2004 - at the time one of the biggest technology buy-outs. The private equity owners then made a handful of small acquisitions and expanded the management team, making UGS profitable enough to consider an initial public offering. While UGS was preparing the listing last year,  Siemens made an unsolicited takeover approach, ushering in the round of discussions that ended in yesterday's deal. News of  Siemens' plan to buy UGS is likely to be overshadowed at its annual meeting today by criticism from investors over a  Euros 420m corruption scandal and under-performing businesses.
The Munich-based group intends to appeal against the  European Commission fines, calling them
"totally exaggerated".

Siemens denied the Commission's "blanket accusation", saying in a statement that  price-fixing only took place in a "few projects" and only between October 2002 and April 2004. The 11 groups involved were fined a total Euros 751m, the biggest fine for a single cartel. The groups fined included Mitsubishi Electric, told to pay Euros 119m; Toshiba, Euros 91m; and Hitachi, Euros 52m. Alstom  was fined Euros 65m but may escape part of the penalty because it sold the subsidiary involved in the price-fixing to Areva in 2004. The French nuclear power group was jointly liable for  Euros 54m of Alstom's  fine, Brussels said.

The shareholders of German engineering group  Siemens AG confronted the group's management at the annual general shareholders' meeting held on January 25, 2007, not in the last place, due to the recent corruption and dubious transaction scandals within the group, it was reported on January 25,
2007.

The corruption scandal is an evidence of incapacity and the management's response to the events has been too slow, Daniela Bergdolt, a spokesperson of German shareholders' association DSW said in front of 12,000 shareholders at the company's headquarters in Munich.

TD
Henning Gebhardt from DWS Investment GmbH, Deutsche Bank's fund management unit, expressed his surprise that the sum of between 200 mln  euro ($259.52 mln) and 420 mln  euro ($544.99 mln), involved in shady transactions, had not been detected as missing for a long time. The group's structure seemed to be too complex and it was "extremely difficult" to probe into or to control such a large enterprise, Gebhardt added.

Siemens management has not taken steps to prevent the dubious transactions and have provided an explanation too late, according to Hans-Christof Hirt from UK fund managing firm Hermes.
The unfounded 30 pct self-appointed pay rise of the management's was also subjected to criticism.

Siemens CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and supervisory board head Heinrich von Pierer promised the shareholders they will come up with extensive explanations regarding the scandal. Heinrich von Pierer defended the 30 pct management wage increase, but added the group would avoid such big pay increase in the future. He also stressed that he had initiated serious steps against corruption during the time he was CEO at  Siemens ( www.siemens.com ).

The group plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) of its car component subsidiary VDO, and has announced plans to buy U.S. software provider UGS for more than $3.5 bln (2.7 bln  euro), a move aimed at strengthening  Siemens automation technology division.

The group also announced the results of the otherwise positive first quarter of fiscal 2006/07, ending September 30, 2007. The net profit reached 788 mln  euro ($1.022 bln), up 16 pct year-on-year. The figure stood considerably under the initial projections due to one-off charge of 423 mln  euro ($548,88 mln), following a record-high  fine the European Commission (EC) imposed on the group due to  cartel participation allegations.
The operating profit rose 51 pct to 1.6 bln  euro ($2.076 bln). Turnover increased 6.0 pct to 19 bln  euro
($24.654 bln), while order intake amounted to 24.6 bln  euro ($31.921 bln), up 4.0 pct year-on-year.

HD        Scandal-hit Siemens slapped with euros 400m record fine: Market-fixing penalty follows bribery allegations Shareholders up in arms for annual meeting today

The crisis at  Siemens deepened yesterday when the European commission fined the scandal-hit German industrial group a record  euros 396.5m (pounds 261m) for leading a cartel over 16 years that fixed the market for equipment used in electricity sub-stations.

It is the biggest  fine the commission has levied on a single company for taking part in a  cartel and accounts for more than half the record  euros 750m imposed on 11 groups found guilty of rigging virtually the entire market for gas-insulated switchgear.

TD
The swingeing penalty was imposed on the eve of today's annual meeting of Siemens in Munich, where shareholders are up in arms over German prosecutors' allegations that the group lost euros 420m in bribes paid to fix contracts for its struggling communications division.  Commission officials insisted the timing of the  fine was a "pure coincidence".

Siemens immediately said it would take legal action at the  European Court of Justice over the
"completely exaggerated"  fine, denying the "blanket" accusation it had taken part in a  cartel between
1988 and 2004 and insisting that only three - subsequently dismissed - employees had been found
internally to have fixed prices in a few cases over 18 months. Other companies in the alleged  cartel
said they would appeal.

But the commission said it was "extremely sure" its decision was legal. Its action was prompted early in 2004 when ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering company, blew the whistle on the  cartel and triggered a series of dawn raids in May that year. These uncovered 25,000 pages of documentary evidence covering the entire period of the  price-fixing.

Siemens, which had by far the largest market share and was the biggest company involved in the cartel, saw its fine increased by a half. It also had to shoulder a  euros 22m fine on its newly acquired Austrian unit, VA Tech.

"The commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. "It has shown once more that it will not tolerate cartels in Europe and the damage they do in any area of business. The case also demonstrates that the commission can and will bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks."

The commission, which fined cartels euros 1.8bn last year, found that the 11 companies, including five Japanese groups, rigged bids, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially confidential information. The Japanese, including  Fuji, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Toshiba, kept out of the EU while the  Europeans  kept out of the Japanese market. Senior managers were found to have met regularly to discuss strategic issues. Lower-ranking officials divided projects
and prepared sham bids "in order to leave an impression of genuine competition".

The commission said it had uncovered the extraordinary lengths used by  cartel members to conceal their roles, including the use of code names and the use of encrypted, anonymous email.

Siemens is also embroiled in a corruption scandal that has threatened to involve senior executives at the group. Pressure grew on Tuesday with reports that its chief financial officer, Joe Kaeser, confidant of Klaus Kleinfeld, the chief executive, knew about alleged bribery payments several years ago, according to two key suspects.

HD        Financial: Scandal-hit Siemens slapped with euros 400m record fine: Market-fixing penalty follows bribery  allegations: Shareholders up in arms for annual meeting today

The crisis at  Siemens deepened yesterday when the European commission fined the scandal-hit German industrial group a record  euros 396.5m (pounds 261m) for leading a cartel over 16 years that fixed the market for equipment used in electricity sub-stations.

It is the biggest  fine the commission has levied on a single company for taking part in a  cartel and accounts for more than half the record  euros 750m imposed on 11 groups found guilty of rigging virtually the entire market for gas-insulated switchgear.

TD
The swingeing penalty was imposed on the eve of today's annual meeting of Siemens in Munich, where shareholders are up in arms over German prosecutors' allegations that the group lost euros 420m in bribes paid to fix contracts for its struggling communications division.  Commission officials insisted the timing of the  fine was a "pure coincidence".

Siemens immediately said it would take legal action at the  European Court of Justice over the
"completely exaggerated"  fine, denying the "blanket" accusation it had taken part in a  cartel between
1988 and 2004 and insisting that only three - subsequently dismissed - employees had been found
internally to have fixed prices in a few cases over 18 months. Other companies in the alleged  cartel
said they would appeal.

But the commission said it was "extremely sure" its decision was legal. Its action was prompted early in 2004 when ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering company, blew the whistle on the  cartel and triggered a series of dawn raids in May that year. These uncovered 25,000 pages of documentary evidence covering the entire period of the  price-fixing.

Siemens, which had by far the largest market share and was the biggest company involved in the cartel, saw its fine increased by a half. It also had to shoulder a  euros 22m fine on its newly acquired Austrian unit, VA Tech.

"The commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. "It has shown once more that it will not tolerate cartels in Europe and the damage they do in any area of business. The case also demonstrates that the commission can and will bring down such cartels even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks."

The commission, which fined cartels euros 1.8bn last year, found that the 11 companies, including five Japanese groups, rigged bids, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially confidential information. The Japanese, including  Fuji, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Toshiba, kept out of the EU while the  Europeans  kept out of the Japanese market. Senior managers were found to have met regularly to discuss strategic issues. Lower-ranking officials divided projects
and prepared sham bids "in order to leave an impression of genuine competition".

The commission said it had uncovered the extraordinary lengths used by  cartel members to conceal their roles, including the use of code names and the use of encrypted, anonymous email.

Siemens is also embroiled in a corruption scandal that has threatened to involve senior executives at the group. Pressure grew on Tuesday with reports that its chief financial officer, Joe Kaeser, confidant of Klaus Kleinfeld, the chief executive, knew about alleged bribery payments several years ago, according to two key suspects. One suspect also told prosecutors that the director Rudi Lamprecht and the former telecoms unit head, Lothar Pauly, knew about the alleged scheme in early 2005.  Siemens has asked a former Watergate investigator to look into the scandal.

HD         Siemens tries to head off shareholder revolt

6.30pm update: Scandal-hit German industrial group announces 51% jump in operational earnings at its
AGM. By David Gow in Munich.

Senior Siemens executives today faced down a shareholder revolt over a €420m (£276m) bribery scandal by pledging to restore the German technology group's reputation for good corporate governance and by promising a stellar financial performance.

TD
More than 10,000 investors turned up at the city's Olympiahalle to assail the group's executive and supervisory boards for doing too little too late to investigate allegations that senior managers created secret slush funds to bribe overseas officials to award telecoms contrtacts - and for the poor showing of Siemens shares.
But the group's stock rose more than 6% after  Siemens announced, just before the annual meeting, a
51% jump in operating profits in the first quarter, the $3.5bn (£1.77bn) acquisition of Texan digital
automation company UGS and plans to float off a minority stake in its profitable VDO car components
business.
"These figures and the scale of the transactions indicate clearly that  Siemens has reached a
turning-point," Henning Gebhardt, head of equities at Germany's biggest fund manager, DWS, told the
Guardian. "The planned IPO (initial public offering) of VDO is a rare sign that it is properly managing its
portfolio and floating off a division when it is making money and not in crisis."

Mr Gebhardt, whose DWS has €1bn invested in  Siemens, had been one of several disgruntled institutional and small investors to criticise the board for failing to deal with the strategic growth of the group and appearing to reel from one crisis to another.

Daniela Bergdolt, head of small shareholders group DSW, asked how a company renowned for its solid reliability had been forced to react belatedly to a spate of bad headlines, leaving the impression the board was incapable of running the business. Mr Gebhardt said  Siemens had become so complex the executive board could no longer control the whole business.

But concerted moves to refuse to approve the two boards' actions in the past year evaporated after Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, announced he had withdrawn from the audit committee investigating the bribery scandal to avoid any conflict of interest over events which took place when he was chief executive. Visibly contrite, he expressed "deep distress" that efforts he had instigated to ensure full compliance with corporate governance codes had failed but demanded that all suspects be considered innocent before being found guilty.

Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, promised to restore  Siemens' exemplary reputation as a world leader in corporate governance and regain investor trust. "There is no place for crooked business practice in
our company and that principle is non-negotiable," he said to loud applause while admitting that some of the allegations would prove to be true.

Gerhard Cromme, audit committee chairman and architect of Germany's corporate governance code, also assuaged investor anxiety by promising that  Siemens' own inquiries would go far beyond the investigations begun by state prosecutors in mid-November. "Our goal is clear: to have in place a system that will prevent and detect unethical and illegal conduct and serve as a benchmark for other companies," he said.

Shareholder ire turned instead to auditors KPMG for failing to detect the holes in  Siemens' accounts caused by the alleged use of slush funds to win overseas contracts through bribery, with several questioning how much longer one of the Big Four firms could continue to be appointed.

Siemens had earlier regained shareholder confidence by announcing that its first-quarter operating profit soared to €1.63bn on sales up 6% to €19bn and orders up 4% to €25.6bn.

The company, also assailed over executive pay rises and the abortive disposal of its now-bankrupt mobile phones business to Taiwan's BenQ, said net income fell 16% to €788m because of the €433m impact of fines imposed by the European commission on Wednesday for leading a  cartel in equipment for electricity sub-stations.

Mr Kleinfeld, hailing a "good start" to the financial year, said  Siemens plannd to float off more than 25% of VDO and insisted that the group's divisions would hit his April deadline for reaching his tough profit margins.

HD       Brussels fines cartel a record €750m

Siemens was hit yesterday with the largest  fine ever imposed by the European Commission on an individual company for a single  cartel offence as Brussels cracked down on 16 years of price-rigging by
11 firms in Europe and Japan.

TD
The European regulator fined 10 companies €750m (£490m) in total for fixing prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, with  Siemens ordered to pay more than half. The ruling came as an acute embarrassment to the German engineering giant, which holds its annual shareholders’ meeting in Munich today, and which promised to appeal against its €396.5m  fine. Yesterday’s decision was taken after an inquiry that studied 25,000 pages of documents dating back to 1988 and covering gas insulated switchgear projects used in power substations.

Under the scam, the companies would co-ordinate their bids to secure projects for the members of the cartel according to a pre-ordained quota. Competitors would either be informed about the details of tenders submitted, or the companies would agree to adhere to a minimum bidding price.

A central element of the carve-up was an agreement that  European firms would not sell in Japan and vice versa. Thus  Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and  Toshiba were fined “because their agreement to abstain from bidding contributed directly to the restriction of competition on the EU market”. The European Commission said members of the  cartel, which also included Alstom,  Schneider and ABB, met regularly “to divide projects and to prepare sham bids by the companies not supposed to win the tender, in order to leave an impression of genuine competition”.

The investigation cast light on the lengths companies now go to in order to avoid detection. Code names were used for companies and individuals. Communications were conducted via anonymous e-mail addresses and were encrypted. One message sent between  cartel members made it clear that it was strictly forbidden to have “access to your [e-mail] from your home personal computer or any computer that can be easily linked to you. This will jeopardise the whole [cartel] network safety”.

Siemens, Europe's largest engineering group, is to strengthen its core automation division by paying
$3.5 billion (€2.7 billion) to buy private equity-owned UGS as it seeks to show it has not been
paralysed by bribery allegations.

Details of the plan emerged as the German conglomerate suffered a fresh blow yesterday when the European Commission ordered it to pay a record €397 million  fine for its "leadership role" in a price-fixing cartel.

TD
Last night the company was also considering whether to float its VDO car-parts division, which has annual sales of about €10 billion, according to sources close to the situation. The moves highlight the determination of Klaus Kleinfeld,  Siemens' chief executive, to push ahead with strengthening and restructuring despite being enmeshed in corruption allegations.

Siemens's management will also hope the news will deflect criticism over the corruption scandal and underperforming businesses at the group's annual meeting today.

Allegations that managers used bribes to win contracts and that executives knew about it have tarnished the group's image and yesterday's  fine brings fresh embarrassment. All current and former management board members accused have rejected the allegations against them.

Announcing the  fines yesterday, the commission said it had punished  Siemens more severely because of its size, clout and elevated role in a cartel that carved up the market for gas-insulated switch gear.
The 11 groups involved in the  cartel were fined a total €751 million, the largest  fine for a single
cartel.

In addition to Siemens, the groups fined included MitsubishiElectric, which was told to pay €119 million; Toshiba €91 million; and Hitachi  €52 million. Alstom  was fined €65 million but may escape part of the penalty because it sold the subsidiary involved in the price-fixing to Areva in 2004. The French nuclear power group was jointly liable for €54 million of Alstom's  fine, the commission said.

ABB, the Swedish/Swiss group, was part of the  cartel but escaped punishment because it blew the whistle.

Siemens said it would appeal against the decision. The Munich-based group said in a statement that
price-fixing only took place in a "few projects" and only between October 2002 and April 2004.

Strike in Guinea Could Hurt
Global Supply of Alumina

TD
An increasingly violent national strike in the Republic of Guinea could erase the world's surplus of alumina, used to make aluminum, if it lasts through February. The West African nation's exports of bauxite, the main ore used in the production of alumina, have ground to a halt since the strike began two weeks ago. The country accounts for 10% of the world's bauxite exports and some 30% of its
reserves. Guinea's bauxite mines supply refineries in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Western  Europe. The country's main bauxite miner is Cie. des Bauxites de Guinee, a partnership between the government of Guinea and an international consortium called Halco (Mining) Inc., which includes
U.S.-based Alcoa Inc. and Canada's Alcan Inc.
Switchgear Makers Receive

Fines in Europe for Price Fixing

The European Commission fined a multinational cartel of electric-power switchgear makers, headed by Germany's Siemens AG, a total of 750.7 million euros ($978 million) for price-fixing over 19 years. Three of the companies -- Siemens, which was fined 419 million euros; France's Alstom  SA, which was fined 65 million euros; and Areva SA, which was  fined 53.6 million euros -- led the cartel and therefore had their fines increased by 50%. Siemens said it plans to take legal action against the commission in a bid to reduce the  fine. Alstom  said it will make a decision on appealing after it has received the text of the decision and has had time to examine it, a spokesman said. Areva couldn't be reached for comment.
British Airways Cabin Crews
Delay Scheduled Walkout

British Airways PLC cabin crews won't walk out on the first day of a planned three-day strike next week, to allow further time for talks, the Transport and General Workers' Union said. In a dispute over working conditions and sick leave, thousands of cabin crew were to walk out for three days starting Monday, followed by further 72-hour stoppages beginning Feb. 5 and Feb. 12. If the dispute isn't resolved, the strike will go ahead next Tuesday and Wednesday, the union said. In response, BA said the union should immediately call off its planned strikes. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who on Tuesday held five hours of talks with senior shop stewards, said progress was being made.

Tokyo, Jan. 25 (Jiji Press)--The benchmark Nikkei average climbed to the highest level in six and a half years on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday morning, driven by the U.S. market's powerful advance overnight.
At the morning close, the 225-issue Nikkei average stood up 58.98 points from Wednesday at
17,566.38. It rose as high as 17,617.64, a level unseen since July 4, 2000, on an intraday basis,
comfortably eclipsing last year's closing high of 17,563.37, marked on April 7. On Wednesday, the
Nikkei climbed 98.83 points.

TD
The TOPIX index of all first-section issues was up 3.99 points at 1,742.60, after rising 7.85 points in the previous session.

The Tokyo market followed a broad rally in the U.S. market overnight, where upbeat earnings from major technology firms lifted the Nasdaq composite index by 1.4 pct and the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record high.

Backed by the U.S. stock market's firmness, foreigners continued to show strong appetite for Japanese stocks, which was reflected in large net buy orders placed via foreign brokerage houses before the opening bell.

After pushing the Nikkei average above last year's high, however, the market gave up part of the early gains, as a sense of achievement spread and led investors to take profits.

Brokers also pointed out that brokerage house dealers are prone to cash in profits as Thursday is the last trading day for delivery within January.

Despite the major stock indexes' gains, falling issues outpaced advancers 945 to 605 on the TSE's first section in the morning, while 161 issues were flat.
Half-day volume came to 1,130 million shares.

"The Tokyo market's early morning gains directly reflected U.S. stocks' strong performance overnight, but subsequent profit-taking was inevitable because the market has already risen to pretty high levels," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co.

"For the market to extend gains further, major Japanese firms will have to release unexpectedly strong earnings figures. But that is unlikely to happen during the current quarterly earnings reporting season," Yamagishi said. Players will most probably have to wait until late April, when Japanese companies announce their fiscal 2006 results and outlooks for the next fiscal year, he added.

Nevertheless, equity analysts, including Yamagishi, said that the market will avoid a major slump in
the meantime as the recently surging trading volume will help the market absorb profit-taking pressure.

(Adds reaction from Japanese firms)

TD
BRUSSELS/TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The  European Commission shocked an intercontinental cartel of electric power switchgear makers on Wednesday with its toughest  fine yet for a single price-fixing offence, 750.7 million  euros ($977 million).

More than half the  fine, 396.6 million  euros, was levelled against Siemens because of the German company's size and role as a ringleader. Japanese and European firms shared the rest.

Siemens, whose stock fell on an early Reuters report of the  fine, will appeal to  European Union courts.

"The fines are completely exaggerated and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts," said Udo Niehage, president of  Siemens' Power Transmission and Distribution unit.

Siemens said the fine would impact its profits, adding no provision had been made for such a  fine. It reports first-quarter results on Thursday.

The cartel accounted for all  European sales of gas insulated switchgear, which is needed at sub-stations used to carry electricity to homes, offices and factories.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The cartel used encrypted emails sent to anonymous addresses to help coordinate global  cartel quotas. European companies agreed not to sell in Japan and Japanese companies stayed out of Europe, the Commission said.
SHAM TENDERS

Cartel members arranged sham tenders to maintain their global  cartel quotas, spelled out in two written agreements, the  Commission said.

Japan's Mitsubishi Electric was  fined 118.6 million euros and Toshiba Corp. 91 million euros, of which 4.7 million  euros was an overlap to be sorted out by the two firms.

Toshiba said in a statement it had not violated  European competition laws and that it planned to appeal the decision in  European courts. Mitsubishi Electric also said it may appeal.

France's  Alstom  was fined 65 million. A few months before the cartel ended Alstom  sold the unit involved to Areva , which knew nothing of the  cartel. It and Alstom  have joint liability for 53.6 million, which they must decide how to split.

Hitachi  Ltd. was  fined 51.8 million euros and Fuji Electric Holdings Co. Ltd. of Japan 3.8 million. Their joint venture Japan AE Power Systems was fined 1.4 million, which overlaps with the two big fines. The companies must figure out how to divide liability.

Hitachi  said it may appeal.  Fuji Electric said it was still considering its response but would make efforts to see that such an incident did not happen again.
Schneider Electric of France was  fined 8.1 million euros and Siemens of Austria 22.1 million  euros.

ABB of Switzerland had its  fine reduced to zero from 215 million  euros because it blew the whistle on the cartel and turned over extensive evidence.

"ABB companies and employees are not permitted under any circumstances to engage in any anti-competitive practices," the company said in a statement after the  fines were announced.
The companies may face problems yet in other countries for their actions.

Gas insulated switchgear is heavy, expensive equipment that controls the flow of energy in electrical power systems. It is sold as a distinct product, and as part of fully functional power sub-stations.

Although it is the highest  fine for an individual violation by companies, the overall fine for the sector is behind the record 790.5 million  euros imposed by the Commission on a vitamin cartel in 2001.

As for individual company  fines, the biggest was Hoffman-La Roche's 462 million  euro fine, for multiple violations. (Additional reporting by Catherine Hornby and Jens Hack in Frankfurt, Katie Reid in Zurich, Edwina Gibbs in Tokyo)

MUNICH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Germany's  Siemens posted a 4-percent rise in first-quarter new orders on Thursday despite an exceptionally strong year-ago quarter but net profit was dented by a hefty  cartel   fine from the European Commission.
Orders rose 4 percent to 24.582 billion  euros ($31.97 billion), driven by  Siemens' industrial units Power
Transmission and Distribution, Power Generation and Industrial Solutions and Services,  Siemens said
in a statement.

Net profit fell 16 percent to 788 million euros in the quarter to end-December, including a negative effect of 423 million  euros from the cartel fine, but also a significant positive effect from a switch to IFRS accounting.

Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld said he "firmly believed" all the group's divisions would meet profitability targets this quarter.

HD        UPDATE 2-Siemens board members survive  protest  vote
WC       769 words

(Updates with vote result)

MUNICH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - German industrial conglomerate  Siemens' management and supervisory board members survived a protest vote by shareholders on Thursday over a corruption scandal that has shaken the company.

TD
All the board members received a majority of votes to approve their actions in the last fiscal year at the annual general meeting of shareholders. Chairman Heinrich von Pierer received the lowest approval rate, at 66 percent.

Votes on ex-Chief Financial Officer Heinz-Joachim Neubuerger and ex-senior telecoms manager Thomas Ganswindt, who have both been named by prosecutors as suspects in the bribery probe, were postponed pending results of investigations.
Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld won 71 percent.

Many shareholders are incensed at  Siemens management's handling of an affair involving hundreds of millions of euros allegedly used for bribes to win foreign telecoms contracts.

At the  Siemens annual meeting, a series of investor-group representatives had called on 13,000 shareholders, who had braved sub-zero temperatures to attend the AGM in Munich, to withhold their approval of the actions of the boards.

"There's no reason to approve the management," said Daniela Bergdolt, the Bavarian representative of small-shareholders' association DSW. "They informed us too late, underestimated the scale of the affair and weren't proactive enough."

Hans-Christoph Hirth, a fund manager at Hermes, said, "The managers should have reacted sooner and more decisively."

Munich prosecutors are investigating the disappearance of 200 million  euros ($260 million) from Siemens accounts, and  Siemens is examining 420 million euros of what it calls "dubious payments" that were booked as consultancy fees over seven years.

The affair has been compounded by news that  Siemens is being investigated for possible abuse of the United Nations oil-for-food programme in Iraq and a hefty  cartel fine imposed by the European            Commission on Wednesday for  price-fixing.

A protest vote would have had only symbolic importance but would have been rare in Germany, where company boards' actions are normally waved through.

Siemens took the unusual step of inviting shareholders to approve the actions of its board members one by one this year in light of the affair.
CHAIRMAN CONCESSION

As well as retail shareholders, who often voice dissent at AGMs but hold little sway, institutional shareholder adviser ISS had also recommended a protest vote on Wednesday.
Page 183 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Some shareholders had called on von Pierer, who was chief executive of  Siemens until the start of
2005, to resign or step aside until the affair was resolved.

Von Pierer denies any wrong-doing but did make a concession on Thursday, saying he had withdrawn from a Siemens committee examining compliance issues.
He acknowledged concerns about a conflict of interest because of his role as chief executive of
Siemens until the start of 2005, when Klaus Kleinfeld took over.
"This measure was already in effect at yesterday's meeting of the audit committee. With this step, I
believe the concerns of a conflict of interest have been addressed," he said.

"I took major steps during my period as president and CEO to fight corruption. And you can be assured: I am deeply distressed that these efforts were not successful enough," von Pierer said.

Fund manager Henning Gebhardt, head of German equities at DWS Investment, which is one of the company's biggest shareholders with about 1 billion  euros' worth of stock, said: "The latest operating numbers make us optimistic ... that our trust in the supervisory and managing boards won't be disappointed."
"Mr Kleinfeld, take this chance to rise above this scandal and restore  Siemens' reputation." Kleinfeld, who has been forced to make numerous public statements on the subject and has hired
external advisers, auditors and experts to help stamp out corruption at  Siemens, told shareholders he
was doing his best.

"Assumptions, speculation, accusations and defamations dominate the current situation -- and, unfortunately, some of them will turn out to be based on fact," he said.

"No one knows what the outcome of these investigations will be. And it's not appropriate to fuel speculation. However, I can assure you that we are doing everything we can to clear up these incidents completely and comprehensively."

Siemens earlier reported forecast-beating first-quarter financial results that boosted its shares more than 6 percent to their highest level since November 2001.

Jan 25 (Reuters) - Shareholders at  Siemens AG's annual meeting called for a protest vote against the group's management and supervisory boards in light of its handling of a corruption affair and other matters.
Following is a chronology of events at  Siemens in the second half of last year and the beginning of
2007:

TD
Sept. 17 -  Siemens gives its top managers an average pay rise of 30 percent. Trade union IG Metall calls the move "shameless" against the backdrop of thousands of job cuts.

Sept. 22 - A magnetic train, jointly developed by  Siemens, crashes in northern Germany, killing 23 people.

Sept. 28 - The German handset unit of BenQ says it will file for insolvency.  Siemens is forced to defend itself against accusations it offloaded the loss-making unit to BenQ a year earlier without due consideration for its future.

Oct. 2 -  Siemens' top managers scrap their planned pay hikes and donate the money to a hardship fund for BenQ Mobile staff. German Chancellor Angela Merkel tells Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld Siemens has a responsibility to its former employees.

Oct. 11 - A source close to  Siemens' negotiations to sell its 3 billion  euro corporate telecoms business, Enterprise Networks, tells Reuters the sale is being hampered by the public outcry over the BenQ Mobile German insolvency.
Nov. 9 - Kleinfeld says Enterprise Networks must be strengthened before it can find a partner or buyer. Nov. 15 - Prosecutors say they have raided offices and homes of  Siemens staff as part of an
investigation into suspected embezzlement. Siemens says the probe concerns six individuals and a
sum of money in the low double-digit millions of euros.

Nov. 20 - Prosecutors say they entered Kleinfeld's offices. He is considered a potential witness, not a suspect.
Nov. 22 - Munich prosecutors say they are investigating the disappearance of about 200 million  euros
from Siemens' accounts.
Nov. 23 - Siemens sets up an anti-corruption task force.

Dec. 11 - Siemens cuts its reported 2005/06 net profit by 73 million  euros in light of the affair and hires outsiders to examine its compliance systems and rules.

Dec. 12 - Siemens says it is looking into more than 420 million  euros' worth of dubious payments. Thomas Ganswindt, who used to run  Siemens' telecoms business, is arrested.
Dec. 15 - Anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International asks  Siemens to leave the organisation.


Page 185 of 192 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Dec. 22 - Prosecutors say their suspicions that fraud was perpetrated at the company had hardened, as they conclude the first stage of their investigation.
Dec. 23 - Kleinfeld says he learned about a suspect bank account in Switzerland last January. Jan. 1 - BenQ Mobile Germany becomes bankrupt after no investor steps forward to rescue the
business.
Jan. 3 - A German prosecutor says  Siemens is being investigated for possible abuses of the United
Nations oil-for-food programme in Iraq.

Jan. 12 - Munich prosecutors say ex-CFO Heinz-Joachim Neubuerger has been questioned as a suspect in the bribery investigation.

Jan. 24 - The European Commission fines Siemens nearly 400 million euros for price-fixing among makers of electrical power system switchgear, the Commission's second-highest individual cartel fine ever. Siemens says it will appeal against the decision.

HD                 Brussels fines cartel a record €750m

The European regulator fined 10 companies €750m (£490m) in total for fixing
prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, with  Siemens ordered to

TD
pay more than half. The ruling came as an acute embarrassment to the German
engineering giant, which holds its annual shareholders' meeting in Munich today, and which promised to appeal against its €396.5m  fine.
Yesterday's decision was taken after an inquiry that studied 25,000 pages of documents dating back to 1988 and covering gas insulated switchgear projects used in power substations.
Under the scam, the companies would co-ordinate their bids to secure projects for the members of the  cartel according to a pre-ordained quota. Competitors would either be informed about the details of tenders submitted, or the companies would agree to adhere to a minimum bidding price.
A central element of the carve-up was an agreement that  European firms would not sell in Japan and vice versa. Thus  Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and  Toshiba were fined "because their agreement to abstain from bidding contributed directly to the restriction of competition on the EU market".
The European Commission said members of the  cartel, which also included

Alstom,  Schneider and  ABB, met regularly "to divide projects and to
prepare sham bids by the companies not supposed to win the tender, in order to leave an impression of genuine competition".
The investigation cast light on the lengths companies now go to in order to avoid detection. Code names were used for companies and individuals. Communications were conducted via anonymous e-mail addresses and were
encrypted. One message sent between  cartel members made it clear that it was

strictly forbidden to have "access to your [e-mail] from your home
personal computer or any computer that can be easily linked to you. This will jeopardise the whole [cartel] network safety".

MUNICH, Germany, Jan 25, 2007 (AFP) -

Managers at Siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on Thursday, as the venerable German electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations.

TD
Chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld and supervisory board chief Heinrich von Pierer sought to placate shareholders over the collapse of  Siemens' former mobile phones division and allegations of widespread bribery and embezzlement.

He also faced questions about a US and French investigation into alleged corruption in the UN's former oil-for-food programme in Iraq.

And in the latest dent to  Siemens' reputation, the group announced that its otherwise favourable first-quarter earnings had been sideswiped by a record  fine by the EU  Commission for alleged price-fixing.

Siemens, which runs its business from October to September, said that net profit amounted to 788 million
euros (one billion dollars) in the three months to December, down 16 percent from the year-earlier period.

Analysts had been pencilling in net profit of around 973 million  euros for the three-month period, but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 423 million  euros booked at the last minute.

On Wednesday, the EU Commission in Brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on Siemens and its Austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division.

Siemens is appealing against the  fine, but must nevertheless pay it initially.
Underlying earnings improved in the October-December period, however, with operating profit jumping by
51 percent to 1.631 billion  euros, boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and
automation divisions.

First-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion  euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion  euros.

"In terms of our underlying performance, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," said chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld.

"While it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past, we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year."
Investors were cheered by the figures and  Siemens shares soared 5.29 euros or 6.79 percent to 83.25
euros in afternoon trading in Frankfurt, making them the biggest gainers on the blue-chip DAX 30 index.

However, the atmosphere in Munich's Olympiahalle where the AGM was being held was decidedly less friendly as shareholders voiced their anger over the corruption charges.

There were calls for supervisory board chief von Pierer, who had been CEO during the period when the events were alleged to have taken place, to resign.

But von Pierer insisted that the principle that everyone should be presumed innocent until found guilty was "valid for all".

The former CEO insisted that he had taken ample measures to fight corruption within the company and that it saddened him that these efforts had not been not sufficiently successful.

His successor, Klaus Kleinfeld, was similarly adamant that "there is no place within our company for dubious business practices".

With regard to the mobile phones business, which  Siemens sold to Taiwan-based BenQ and which has subsequently collapsed, von Pierer insisted that the German company had done everything that could be expected for the activities.

The role of  Siemens in the collapse of BenQ Mobile has been criticised, with critics saying the German company did not do enough to save the business.

TOKYO (XFN-ASIA) - Toshiba Corp said it would appeal to the  European Court of Justice against a  fine
imposed by the European Commission over alleged cartel activity in power generation equipment.

"Our company has cooperated with the  European Commission in the investigations of the case. But our own investigation has shown that our company has not committed any act in violation of the  European Competition Law,"  Toshiba said in a statement.

TD
"We intend to contest the decision in the  European Court of Decision hereafter," the company said.

Earlier, the European Commission announced its second-biggest  fine against cartels, seeking 750 mln eur from 11 European and Japanese companies making power-generation equipment.

The EU competition regulator targeted ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech for price fixing  and illegally dividing up the market.

Mitsubishi was told to pay 118.6 mln  euros, Toshiba 90.9 mln eur and Hitachi  51.7 mln eur, according to media reports.
There was no immediate comment from the other Japanese firms involved. afp
