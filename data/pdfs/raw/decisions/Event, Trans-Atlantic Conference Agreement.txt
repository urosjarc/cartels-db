P&O NEDLLOYD RESULTS: SECOND QUARTER 1998

The attached information sets out the financial results, trade statistics and key points for P&O Nedlloyd
Container Line Limited for the second quarter 1998. In general terms it shows that:

operating profit fell from $36 million in Q2 1997 to $22 million in Q2 1998; the main reasons for this were lower revenue rates and the wider impact of Asia; the Asian situation has deteriorated since the first quarter and is not expected to improve in the near future; throughput has remained strong in spite of the Asian situation; P&O Nedlloyd is continuing to make further cost savings; Q2 1998 has seen more industry consolidation; and the overall supply/demand situation is expected to
improve from next year.

* Q2 1998 and year to date 1998 include 19,800 teus as a result of those Blue Star trades integrated since the company was acquired at the start of the quarter. These fall largely in North America.
Notes:

1.Teu = twenty foot equivalent unit. This is the standard size of container and is a common measure of capacity in the container business. 2.All financial figures are US$ million except average revenue which is US$.

3.It is important to note that a change in average revenue per teu does not necessarily equal a change in profit contribution. Average revenue per teu is calculated equally across all trades and products. It makes no allowance for cargo mix, relative volumes on different trades or additional elements which are raised and paid for in local currency.


KEY POINTS. 1.The Q2 1998 results have been significantly affected by the situation in Asia. Volumes out of Asia continue to be extremely strong and
the ships are now effectively full. Conversely, volumes into Asia are weak.
The revenue rates reflect this, with major increases on the routes out of Asia but substantial decreases on those into Asia. 2.The Asian situation has
resulted in an imbalance cost of approximately $10 million in Q2 1998, the same as for the previous quarter. In addition, however, there have been significant other adverse effects as wider competitive pressures have developed. The position is not expected to improve in the near future.
3.Despite the Asian situation, P&O Nedlloyd achieved a record throughput for the quarter. If the additional volume resulting from the Blue Star acquisition
is excluded, total throughput rose by 3.2% from 590,600 in Q2 1997 to 609,400 in Q2 1998. The main increase was on the North America trades, partly
reflecting the additional slots taken by P&O Nedlloyd in the Trans-Pacific within the Grand Alliance. 4.The average revenue rate per teu over the first half of 1998 has remained the same as in Q4 1997 at $1397. The average, however masks a number of changes both within trades and as a result of seasonality and mix. Some reduction can be expected in the second half as the higher yielding refrigerated container flows from the southern hemisphere

tail off. The key question for the second half will be
whether strong Asian export rates can match the continuing import rate weakness.
5.The integration of Blue Star is proceeding well. The net effect in the quarter was a cost of $4 million.
Page 5 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
6.A vigorous programme of cost reductions continues across the whole of the business, including the greater use of non-British ratings.

7.Following its statement of objections in May 1996, the European Commission is continuing to review the competition aspects of the Trans Atlantic Conference  Agreement.  The Conference Lines have received strong legal advice that the allegations contained in the statement can be rebutted and that an adverse decision by the  Commission would most
probably be reversed by the  European Court. The advice

also makes clear that the  fines hitherto threatened by the  Commission would in any event be severely reduced or quashed by the Court.
8.Q2 1998 has seen a number of further consolidation moves in the industry and we expect more to
follow. Looking ahead to next year and beyond, the supply/demand situation is set to improve. In the short
term, however, the trading environment is likely to remain difficult, particularly as a result of the Asian
situation.

LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch container shipping line P&O Nedlloyd said on Thursday it had received legal advice that heavy  fines threatened by the  European Commission for alleged abuse by a group of shipping lines it belongs to would be reduced.

The company said in a statement that shipping lines in the Trans Atlantic Conference  Agreement (TACA) had received legal advice that allegations contained in a European Commission review of competition aspects of the cartel could be rebutted. "An adverse decision by the Commission would most probably be reversed by the  European Court," the company said.

TD
It added that  fines would be severely reduced or quashed by the Court, according to the advice.

Significant  fines had been expected to be imposed in July, P&O Nedlloyd chief executive Tim Harris told a news conference on Thursday afternoon, but a decision had been delayed. He was not aware what had caused the delay.
Harris said TACA expected to be  fined, but was confident the  fines would be reduced.
"We have had clear cut legal advice that there has been no abuse of a dominant position," he said. ((Paul Berrill, Reuters Shipping News +44 171 542 4087 fax 542 5017)).

HD          TACA lines unfazed by EU threat, say court will overturn fines. BY         BY AVIVA FREUDMANN

LONDON - P&O Nedlloyd and other members of the Trans Atlantic Conference  Agreement  have little to fear from threats of major  fines to be imposed by the European Commission for alleged antitrust violations, according to the company's top executive.

TD
"We have good legal advice that we will not have to pay fines at the end of the day," because such fines, if imposed, would be overturned by the European Court, Tim Harris, P&O Nedlloyd's chief executive, said Thursday at the company's quarterly briefing on its earnings results.

The company has not set aside sums to be used in case of an adverse judgment, because it is not required to do so, according to Mr. Harris and Haddo Meijer, the company's Rotterdam-based finance director.

Allegations by  European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert that  TACA abused its dominant market position in the North Atlantic trades by refusing to allow its members to make one-on-one deals with shippers, "can be rebutted," according to legal advice received by  TACA, Mr. Harris said.

TACA's lawyers also advise that "the  fines hitherto threatened by the  commission would in any event be severely reduced or quashed by the court," according to a P&O Nedlloyd statement.

In a related matter, Mr. Harris said freight rates charged by  TACA lines on the North Atlantic have eroded slightly, but that in general "TACA (pricing) is holding together under Olav's leadership."

The reference was to Olav Rakkenes, chairman and chief executive of American Container Lines and chairman of TACA.

Share price plummets as Asian upheaval is blamed for huge trade imbalace.
By Janet Porter

TD
P&O reported a downturn in second quarter profits yesterday as the impact of the Asian crisis hit revenue.

Share prices of the Anglo/Dutch carrier's two parent companies dropped sharply as P&Oannounced an operating profit of $22m, down from $36m a year earlier.

A pre-tax profit of $9m was posted, up from the $1m profit for the 1997 first quarter, but well below some analysts' predictions.

P&Ochairman Tim Harris attributed the disappointing outturn largely to the huge trade imbalances created by the economic upheavals in Asia, with carryings from the Far East very strong and inbound freight volumes much lower.
He noted, though, that the company's results were very much in line with the industry.

Repositioning empty equipment back to Asia cost P&Oaround $10m in the second quarter, the same amount as in the first three months of the year. Greater competitive pressures also added to the harsh trading conditions. The company warned that "the position is not expected to improve in the near future".

The carrier is responding by pursuing rate increases on stronger trade legs and watching for further expansion opportunities. The goal is to build a company with annual throughput of 5m teu, chief financial officer Haddo Meijer said.

While declining to comment on whether P&Owas in discussion with potential merger partners, Mr Meijer said the company "was ready", should an opportunity arise. The volume of freight carried by P&Oin the April-June quarter climbed to 629,200 teu fron 590,600 teu in the corresponding period of 1997, with Europe/Asia traffic up from 228,300 teu to 235,700 teu and North American carryings also higher at
169,700 teu from 130,500 teu last year, helped by the inclusion of Blue Star Line's business.

Carryings in the north/south and cross trades were down at 223,800 teu compared with 231,800 teu in the 1997 second quarter, as the impact of the Asian crisis began to spread.
Average revenue per teu slipped to $1,380 from $1,493 teu a year earlier.

Lower income per container pushed total revenue in the second quarter, down to $868m from $882m previously.

The second quarter of 1998 does not include any costs associated with the merger of P&Oand Nedlloyd Lines at the beginning of 1997. A figure of $25m was included in the first quarter results to reflect the merger costs.
Mark McVicar, a transport analyst with SGResearch, described the results as "awful".

He said industry watchers would have to recalculate their projections for the full year results, given
P&Owarning that the trading environment is likely to remain difficult in the short-term.

Page 12 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A few weeks ago, SGwas forecasting a 1998 net profit of $65m, but this will now be downgraded.

P&O's shares closed at 811.5 pence ($13.5) yesterday, down 33.5 pence, while Royal Nedlloyd share price ended the day Fls1.3 lower at Fls34.4 ($17.2).

P&Ohas already embarked on another round of cost-cutting, having earlier this week announced that all British rating are to be replaced by Filipino seafarers. P&Oalso commented on the threat of  fines from the European Commission on the Trans-Atlantic Conferen-ce  Agreement  (Taca).

"The conference lines have received strong legal advice that the allegations contained in the statement of objections can be rebutted and that an adverse decision by Brussels would most probably be reversed by the European court."

Taca lines have also been advised that the threatened  fines would, in any event, be severely reduced or quashed by the court.

P&Ois faced with a double hit as the alleged infringements occurred before the merger. Karel van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, is expected to announce details of the  fines on September 9, and the carriers then plan to appeal through the  European courts.

Commenting on the state of  Taca, which has seen some resignations lately, Mr Harris said the conference was "performing adequately" and "holding together".

Yesterday, Mr Harris also forecast that volumes in the third quarter would be higher than in the second quarter.

P&O NEDLLOYD SEES EU  FINES BEING QUASHED, CUT

LONODN - Anglo-Dutch container shipping line P&O Nedlloyd said on Thursday it had received legal advice that heavy  fines threatened by the  European Commission for alleged abuse by a group of shipping lines it belongs to would be reduced. The company said in a statement that shipping lines in the Trans Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) had received legal advice that allegations contained in a European Commission review of competition aspects of the cartel could be rebutted. "An adverse decision by the Commission would most probably be reversed by the  European Court," the company said. It added that fines would be severely reduced or quashed by the Court, according to the advice. Significant  fines had been expected to be imposed in July, P&O Nedlloyd chief executive Tim Harris told a news conference on Thursday afternoon, but a decision had been delayed. He was not aware what had caused the delay. Harris said  TACA expected to be  fined, but was confident the  fines would be reduced.

P&O NEDLLOYD READY FOR MORE MERGERS.

LONDON - Anglo-Dutch container shipping line P&O Nedlloyd said on Thursday it was ready to consider further major mergers to reverse losses. Nedlloyd director of corporate public relations Herman Lammerts van Bueren told a London news conference that the company aimed to beome one of the top three carriers in the world. P&O Nedlloyd earlier reported a second half pre-tax loss of $30 million, compared with a loss of $57 million in the same period of 1997 which included $41 million of merger costs. The company, which was formed at the beginning of 1997 from the merger of P&O and Nedlloyd's container shipping businesses, blamed the wider impact of the Asian economic situation for a $14 million fall in operating profits in the latest quarter. Van Bueren said: "At the outset we said we wanted to build a major carrier with a capacity of 5 million teu (20ft container units) a year and we are at 50 percent of that."

RENEWED DOCKS WAR WARNING.

The Australian trade union umbrella group, the ACTU, is considering sending picket lines back to the waterfront. The continued outstanding court action of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) against the Maritime Union Australia is the reason. The fear of the action
influencing the coming election is a concern to the Australian Labor Party. The strike would bring back into focus the reopening of the conspiracy case against the Australian Government and Patrick Stevedores. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AUSTRALIA

BOATIES FACE POLLUTION PENALTIES.

New marine and pollution rules prohibiting the dumping of untreated sewage and other rubbish from boats in New Zealand coastal waters took effect this week. Leisure boaties and commercial operators face large penalties if they do not comply with the legislation, introduced under the Resource Management (Marine Pollution) Regulations and Marine Protection Rules. A breach of the regulations and rules in regional coastal plans carries a maximum  fine of $200,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both. Derek Nolan and Helen Atkins, of Russell McVeagh McKenzie Bartleet & Co, said the new legislation allowed New Zealand to ratify the 1996 protocol to the 1972 London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste and Other Matter and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973. New Zealand's maritime controls are split between the Resource Management Act and the Maritime Transport Act.

DREDGER IS A SHIP AND CAN BE ARRESTED UNDER ACTION IN REM.
AN Irish court has decided that the definition of a "ship" does not depend on whether it is capable of
self-propulsion and has held that a backhoe dredger can be considered a ship and be arrested under an
admiralty action in rem. The dispute arose as a result of an accident while the Swedish-flagged dredger
Von Rocks was being towed by a tug from Sweden to Scotland. The dredger capsized and was severely
damaged and had to be towed to a port in County Dublin. Von Rocks' insurers commenced proceedings in
Sweden against the owner and operator of the tug for damages amounting to the dredger's insured value
on grounds that the tug's crew had been negligent.

MERSEY DOCKS EARNINGS UP 7PC. Mersey Docks and Harbour Co, operator of Liverpool's port, said first-half earnings rose 7 per cent as the port handled more profitable cargo to offset a decline in total tonnage. Net income for the six months to June 30 rose to GBP16.8 million (about HK$211 million), from GBP15.7 million in the same period a year ago.

BRUSSELS, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected to delay again a decision to fine the shipping companies of the TACA conference for operating an alleged price-fixing cartel, a senior Commission source said on Tuesday.
The decision was expected to be on the  Commission's agenda for its weekly meeting on September
9, but the source told Reuters there was not enough time to prepare the decision so soon after the
summer break.

TD
The source also predicted an overall "nice, hefty  fine" despite opposition from some national antitrust experts from the 15 EU states and some of the colleagues of  European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.

The Commission's antitrust department wants the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  to modify its pricing and other restrictive arrangements for the transport of containers on North Atlantic routes. But the almost decade-long negotiations have proved fruitless.

Anglo-Dutch container shipping line P&O Nedlloyd said in August it believed the  European courts would reduce or quash any big  fines. The Commission had initially been expected to rule on the TACA case in July.

TACA currently has 14 members including Hapag-Lloyd , A.P. Moller-Maersk and Neptune Orient
Lines Ltd . ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission has put back to September 16 the likely date for a decision on whether to penalize the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  freight group, a Commission official said Wednesday.

The companies in TACA will be punished for price fixing on their inland prices - the prices charged for transporting freight from an inland point of departure to the dock, and from the arrival dock to the freight's final destination, the official said in July.

TD
"The decision has been put back to allow for sufficient time to discuss the case," the official said
Wednesday.

The case was first supposed to be settled in July, but the  Commission delayed it until after the summer break, slating a decision for September 9.

The official said the Commission has taken on board concerns voiced by some of the smaller shipping companies within TACA, which argue that the  fines the Commission is proposing have been apportioned disproportionately.

"Initially the Commission planned to hand out  fines to the members according to gravity and duration principles, but the Commission committee looking at the case has decided to make the  fines more proportionate to the size of each shipping company," he said.

In addition to fixing inland prices,  TACA members will also be punished for agreeing among themselves not to offer individual service contracts to shippers who want to use the companies' port services, and
for agreeing to restrict the content of contracts with shippers, the official said.

KVAERNER DOWNBEAT FOR IMPROVEMENT IN H2

OSLO - Anglo-Norwegian construction and engineering conglomerate Kvaerner ASA booked a sharp slide in profits for the first six months 1998 and said it saw little chance of a substantial improvement in results for the second half.

London-headquartered Kvaerner booked pre-tax profits up to June 30 of 266 million crowns ($34.5 million)
compared with 840 million crowns in the corresponding year-ago period.
The result included 442 million crowns in gains on asset sales and a write-down in short-term values of
178 million.

Kvaerner said further delays and suspension of contracts in Asia and, increasingly in other parts of the world, resulted in a weakening of capacity utilisation and a reduction in the recovery of overhead costs in some areas.

"The forestry industry is cyclic and
we happen to be at the bottom of a cycle. Pulp and paper manufacturers argue they've been at the bottom for a long, long time." But Mayson said such downturns were not new for forestry-based ports like Tauranga. REUTERS NEWS SERVICE

China Ocean Shipping Co (Cosco) plans a push into the  European crewing market by signing up with the International Shipping Federation. Lloyd's List reported the application was approved unanimously by the governing council of the worldwide employers' organisation for shipowners. Cosco will represent the mainland as a whole despite the existence of numerous but far smaller private enterprise shipowners in the country. It also said that Russia had 318 registered airlines, including 214 actual carriers. In all, 97 of the actual carriers have licences to operate domestic and international scheduled flights.

"Hull Blythe (Angola) has set a deadline of late September for outstanding invoices to be produced," it said. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST

Frontline, the Norwegian-owned tanker operator, yesterday reported record quarterly results, helped by the increased size of its fleet and improved trading of its very large crude carriers (VLCCs).
Second-quarter net income rose tenfold to $14.7m from $1.4m in the year-earlier period. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, including earnings from associated companies, rose from $25m to $33.6m while net operating revenues for the first six months rose from $86m to $105m. Yesterday's results were the first since Frontline acquired control of three ship-owning companies, which added six new VLCCs and four modern Suezmaxes to its fleet after it merged with London & Overseas Freighters. Frontline predicts the third quarter will show a "stable to positive development in operating profit", based on the increased fleet and strong VLCC earnings. Valeria Skoeld, Oslo FINANCIAL TIMES

HAPAG-LLOYD TO CHARTER 3 SHIPS FROM GREEK OPERATOR.

LONDON - German container ship operator Hapag-Lloyd said it is to charter three new Panamax vessels from a Greek shipping company, in a statement received on Tuesday. The company said it will charter, for several years, three 4,800 teu (20 ft container equivalent) ships from Athens-based Costamare Shipping Co.

HD         European Commission Puts Off Decision  On Penalizing  Shipping Firms

LP
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission has delayed to Sept. 16 the likely date for a decision on whether to penalize the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  freight group, a commission official said Wednesday.

The companies in the group, known as  TACA, will be punished for price fixing on their inland prices - the prices charged for transporting freight from an inland point of departure to the dock, and from the arrival dock to the freight's final destination, the official said in July.

TD
"The decision has been put back to allow for sufficient time to discuss the case," the official said
Wednesday.

The case was supposed to be settled in July, but the  commission delayed a ruling until after its summer break and had slated a decision for Sept. 9.

The official said the commission has heard concerns voiced by some of the smaller shipping companies within TACA, which argue that the  fines the commission is proposing have been doled out disproportionately.

"Initially the  commission planned to hand out  fines to the members according to gravity and duration principles, but the committee looking at the case has decided to make the  fines more proportionate to the size of each shipping company," he said.

In addition to fixing inland prices,  TACA members will also be punished for agreeing among themselves not to offer individual service contracts to shippers who want to use the companies' port services, and
for agreeing to restrict the content of contracts with shippers, the official said.

TACA is the successor agreement to the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement,  which was originally accused in
1992 of anticompetitive behavior.

The TACA comprises Sea-Land Service of the U.S.; Denmark's AP Moller Maersk Line; Sweden's Atlantic Container Line AB; South Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co. Ltd., Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. Ltd. and Cho Yang Shipping Co. Ltd.; Germany's Hapag-Lloyd AG and DSR-Senator Lines Gmbh, the Netherlands' Nedlloyd Lijnen BV; the United Kingdom's P&O Containers Ltd., Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co.; Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line; Poland's Polish Ocean Lines; Singapore's Neptune Orient Shipping Co. Ltd.; Japan's NYK Line (Europe) Ltd., and Mexico's TMM-Tecomar SA de CV.

HD          EU to decide fines on TACA shipping firms Sept 16. WC         384 words

BRUSSELS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Commission will decide on September 16 how much it will fine the shipping companies of the TACA liner conference for anti-competitive behaviour, a Commission spokesman said on Wednesday.

The issue was tentatively put on the agenda for the  Commission's meeting next week, but was delayed to allow time for discussions between senior antitrust aides following the August summer recess.

TD
The spokesman declined to elaborate on the likely level of fines, which have met with opposition from national government experts and within the 20-member European Union executive.

But Commission sources said that, overall, a hefty penalty was likely, even if smaller companies would be less hit than initially planned.

The Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  currently has 14 members including P&O Nedlloyd , Hapag-Lloyd , A.P. Moller-Maersk and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd which agree on prices and other arrangements for the transport of containers on north Atlantic routes.

TACA, which is headquartered in both London and in the U.S. state of New Jersey, has tried to convince the Commission for most of the decade that its arrangements were legal but to no avail.

According to guidelines on the method for setting  fines, the Commission could fine the shipping companies more than 20 million ecus ($22.5 million) each for taking part in a price-fixing and market-sharing agreement.

The exact amount will depend on the duration of the infringement and on any aggravating or attenuating circumstances.

The largest  fine ever imposed on a price-fixing cartel was 248 million ecus in 1994 on a group of cement companies.
The EU executive and competition watchdog in January  fined German carmaker Volkswagen a record
102 million ecus ($124 million) for allegedly instructing its Italian distributors not to sell outside Italy.
Although the  TACA ruling seems sure on September 16 it could still suffer a tactical delay.

Previous Commission TACA rulings have been challenged in the  European courts and some TACA members have already said the new decision, the first to carry financial penalties, would be no exception.

Areport on the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement,  including proposed  fines, has been postponed a week, a European Commission official confirmed yesterday.

Karel van Miert, the  European Union competition commissioner, is expected to call for hefty  fines on Taca members for breaching competition rules by abusing their dominant position and restricting the availability of service contracts.

TD
The Taca case is now on the agenda for the September 16 meeting of commissioners. The case had been scheduled for discussion at next Wednesday's meeting.
The 16 carriers who face sanctions plan to appeal through the  European courts.

Although details of the proposed  fines have not been made public, Mr van Miert was originally planning to levy fines ranging from $13m to more than $50m, depending on corporate turnover, according to industry reports. But some EU governments, led by Germany, objected to such huge penalties, and Mr van Miert was asked to rethink the level of  fines. He had been planning to issue the final report prior to the summer recess, but postponed publication until this month.

The commission has the right to  fine companies up to 10% of annual turnover for breaking competition law.
Once the final document has been approved, each carrier will be informed by facsimile about the level of
fines faced, with the full report sent by courier.

The fines to be announced in a fortnight, if approved, are separate from penalties that Brussels has threatened to impose on  Taca members for intermodal pricing. The carriers have challenged the commission's right to lift immunity from  fines for inland rate-making.

HD   EU/COMPETITION - DISCUSSION OF FINES TO BE IMPOSED ON TACA MEMBERS. WC  225 words

LP
Brussels, 02/09/1998 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission will be asked to state its view, on 16
September, on the  fines to be imposed on members of the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement
(TACA) for "manifest and serious violation" of the prohibition on concerted agreements relating to their
land-based cooperation activities. The discussion, initially planned for 9 September, was postponed one
week due to a controversy over the breakdown of the  fines that will affect the 20 maritime companies
whose regulatory immunity was lifted for this purpose in November 1996 (including the Korean firm
Hyundai Merchant Marine). An initial proposal made by the anti-trust services before the summer recess
came up against a minority but rather unusual opposition in the Competition Advisory Committee, because
it made no distinction between the companies in question in terms of their size.

TD
A new draft, revised to take account of these objections, is expected to be presented to the College, although in its new guidelines for the fixing of  fines in infringement cases (see  EUROPE of 01/12/1997),
the European Commission has in principle established only two criteria, the duration and the gravity of the infringement (a decision that has given rise to no objections).

TIRANA - Albania on Wednesday welcomed a procedural breakthrough in efforts to reach a negotiated solution to the crisis in neighbouring Kosovo, saying it could form a basis for a positive dialogue. A senior Western diplomat in Yugoslavia said the Serbian and ethnic Albanian sides in Kosovo had agreed that any peace  agreement they strike could be revisited in three years, thus sidestepping the issue of the province's ultimate status in relation to Serbia.

- - - - EU/Russia
BRUSSELS - A meeting of senior  European Union treasury and central bank officials ended on Wednesday, with participants saying a statement on the Russian crisis would be issued on Thursday.

BRUSSELS - Russian President Boris Yeltsin's latest attack on the eastward enlargement of NATO came as no surprise to the alliance, a NATO official said on Wednesday.

HD      Carriers meet their nemesis. WC      1,305 words

After six years, a confrontation between the European Commission and a group of ocean carriers that operate container shipping services between northern Europe and the US may end next Wednesday. But that will not conclude the bitter dispute between members of the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  and Brussels over whether or not their practices comply with European Union rules. JANET PORTER explains

IF as expected, European Union competition commissioner Karel van Miert confirms that the carriers are to be fined for breaching European competition regulations, the carriers will immediately begin appeal proceedings through the courts. For the sums at stake are potentially huge, while  Trans-Atlantic             Conference Agreement  (Taca) lines remain convinced that they have not broken the law.

TD
Even if the carriers are found guilty of some infringement, they do not accept that the level of  fines Mr van Miert is rumoured to have in mind bear any relation to the alleged crime.

Although details of the proposed sanctions have not been made public, the EC's competition directorate, DGwas originally thought to be pressing for  fines ranging from around $13m for the smaller members, to between $26m and $36m for middle-ranking carriers and more than $50m for the biggest, in terms of corporate turnover.

These amounts were apparently dismissed as far too high by some EU governments, with an advisory committee of member state representatives divided on both the question of whether  Taca lines should be penalised, and the level of  fines.
Germany has said there should be no  fines at all.
Mr van Miert was to have presented his final report on the  Taca case to the full College of
Commissioners for their approval before the summer recess, but the date was switched at the last minute
to September, supposedly because of a crowded agenda.

However, industry insiders believe Mr van Miert came under considerable pressure to redraft his report, and particularly the proposed size of the  fines.
If EU commissioners accept a revised version of the document, each carrier will be informed by fax of the
fine it faces, with the full 180-page report sent by courier.
The conference, which held one of its regular meetings in Charlotte, North Carolina this week, just before
Mr van Miert presents his findings to fellow commissioners, will then almost certainly lodge an appeal.

In a rare public comment on the case, P&Ochief executive Tim Harris said a few weeks ago that Brussels probably would levy fines.

But, he continued: "The conference lines have received strong legal advice that the allegations contained in the statement can be rebutted and that an adverse decision by the  commission would most probably be reversed by the European Court."
The carriers have also been advised by their lawyers that "the  fines hitherto threatened by the
commission would in any event be severely reduced or quashed by the court".


Page 38 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Any final verdict could be several years away, however, unless some out-of-court accommodation between the two warring sides can be reached.

Certainly, Mr van Miert and senior DGofficials have held private talks with top liner shipping executives on a number of occasions in recent months to discuss a new regulatory framework for the container shipping industry.
The lines have even offered to abandon intermodal rate-setting, the controversial practice that prompted
Brussels to start investigating freight conferences a decade ago.

Whether any  agreement between the two sides on a new set of rules could bring the  Taca dispute to an early conclusion remains unclear. If the court case cannot be halted, regulators, shipping lines and their customers face several more years of legal uncertainty.

The carriers caught up in the dispute are Atlantic Container Line, Cho Yang, DSR-Senator, Hanjin Shipping, Hapag-Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine, Maersk Line, Mediterranean Shipping Co, Neptune Orient Lines, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Orient Overseas Container Line, P&OPolish Ocean Lines,
Sea-Land, TransporMaritima Mexi-cana and Tecomar.

Although Neptune Orient and Hanjin have since withdrawn from the conference and Cho Yang will leave shortly, they are still liable if  fines are imposed.

Neither will discussions now under way about a new order for the Atlantic trades have any bearing on the case. Olav Rakkenes, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic Container Line, and chairman of Taca, is holding talks about the future of the conference, in view of ocean shipping reform in the US.

Non-Taca lines have been invited to participate, and there is even mention of transforming  Taca from a rate-setting conference into a discussion  agreement that sets policy but not prices.

The Taca dispute dates back to 1992 when a group of 11 transatlantic carriers became so desperate about their collective losses that they organised a complete overhaul of the transatlantic conference system and formed the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement,  covering both eastbound and westbound routes. A new tariff was introduced, with higher freight rates, while tonnage was withdrawn from the trades and a capacity management arrangement put in place.
Shippers, who had already objected to Brussels about the door-to-door tariff of the Far Eastern Freight
Conference, immediately lodged a complaint with the  commission about the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement.
The central issue at that time was whether regulation 4056, which grants liner shipping conferences
anti-trust immunity and allows members to set freight rates jointly, covered just ocean transport or inland
distribution as well.

While the carriers have insisted all along that the law permits them to fix a common intermodal tariff, Europe's shippers' councils continue to argue that this is a wrong interpretation, and that door-to-door pricing is unlawful.

But the case has taken all sorts of twists and turns since then, with the conference making numerous concessions over the years to pacify shippers and the authorities by amending the  agreement on several occasions, all to no avail.

Minimum cargo volumes eligible for service contracts were reduced in response to customer demands; the two-tier membership system between traditional conference lines and the so-called unstructured carriers was abandoned; and restrictions on the number of carriers with which shippers could negotiate directly lifted during a sweeping overhaul of the conference unveiled in July 1994 when the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  was also renamed.
A few months later, the capacity management programme was scrapped.

None of this has eased the acrimony between  Taca members on one side, and EU competition authorities and shippers on the other, with the two parties frequently engaged in angry exchanges through the media.

The dispute has also become increasingly complex, with both the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement  and now its successor involved in separate cases.

The Trans-Atlantic  Agreement  dispute is already before the Court of First Instance where carriers are appealing Brussels' view that multimodal freight rates are unlawful, while  Taca is challenging a move by the commission to lift members' immunity from  fines for continuing to set door-to-door freight rates collectively.
Page 39 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The report that Mr van Miert is expected to submit to his fellow commissioners for their endorsement next week concerns other complaints.

The commissioner will claim  Taca lines abused their dominant position on the Atlantic and restricted the availability of service contracts in earlier years.

Now, of course, the  Taca is in a far from dominant position as some carriers leave the conference and more newcomers launch services across the North Atlantic.
That argument will make no difference to Mr van Miert's findings which cover  Taca's earlier years.

But by the time this bitter fight is finally settled, either by the courts or through negotiation between the parties,  Taca will bear virtually no resemblance to the  agreement originally struck between founder members back in 1992 if, indeed, the conference still exists at all within a few years.

LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch container shipping line P&O Nedlloyd faces a 25 million pound ($42.19 million)  fine from the European Commission for its part in a cartel accused of
price-fixing on North Atlantic container routes, the Independent on Sunday newspaper reported.
The report said the EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert will announce his decision on
Wednesday.

TD
Members of the Trans Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) - each of which are expected to be
fined - are likely to appeal at the European Court of Justice, the report said.
No one at the shipping company was immediately available for comment.

In August, P&O Nedlloyd said shipping lines in the TACA agreement had recieved legal advice that allegations contained in the European Commission review of the competition aspects of the cartel could be rebutted.
It added that  fines would be severely reduced or quashed by the Court, according to the advice. ((London newsroom +44 171 542 7717, fax +44 171 583 3769, uk.equities.news@reuters.com)). (C) Reuters Limited 1998.

OUR PRICE ON MARKET WITH 85M STG TICKET

Richard Branson's Virgin Group has put its 229 Our Price music, video and games retail chain up for sale for an estimated 85m stg. The move comes just months after Virgin acquired the 75 percent stake of the Virgin Our Price chain it did not own from WH Smith for 145m stg. The Virgin Megastores will not be put up for sale, and Branson's group will seek to add more megastore sites. Bankers Trust has been appointed to run an auction for Our Price, and the sale is expected to be finalised within three months.
UMBRO'S US OWNER EYES SALE WITH 60M STG TAG.

Stone Manufacturing, the South-Carolina group which owns Umbro International, has appointed Salomon Smith Barney to sell the sportswear group for over $100m (60m stg). It is believed Stone will seek to sell Umbro, which generates annual turnover of $500m, and will then concentrate on its boxer shorts division, its original business. Umbro marketing director Peter Draper commented: "There is no official For Sale sign up. We're a private business. There are always issues with family-owned businesses."
EC TO  FINE P&O OVER PRICE-FIXING

The European Commission will this week impose fines on 16 container companies, including P&O Nedloyd , for breaching the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement.  The fine on P&O, for price-fixing,
is expected to be substantial, but not as high as the rumoured 25m stg. P&O has declared that if the  fine is imposed, it will "go immediately to the courts" over a disagreement with the interpretation of the regulations.

MINISTERS PRESS PHILIPS ON THREAT TO 2,000 WORKERS.

The government has entered talks with Dutch electronics group Philips in an attempt to convince it not to announce further redundancies in North East England. The move follows Philips' announcement it was considering closing its Newcastle and Leeds tank factories, resulting in the possible loss of up to 2,000 jobs. The North East has also been hit by cutbacks from Siemens , Vickers and Fujitsu , despite a recent
100m stg contribution from the government to attract activity to the region.
LYONNAIS POISED FOR PART SALE

State-owned French bank Credit Lyonnais is to reveal its interim results this week and is expected to show a small profit from 1997. The government is in the midst of selling off Lyonnais, and will use the results to finalise details of the sale.
WHITBREAD TO OPEN 200TH INN.

Brewing and leisure group Whitbread will solidify its position as the leading UK budget lodge operator
this month by opening its 200th Travel Inn at Woking in Surrey. Whitbread has expressed concern about
the high prices being paid for pubs and restaurants and has warned that the pub and restaurant market
is in danger of becoming too crowded. As a result, the group is seeking to concentrate on the hotel
market.
THE GUARDIAN
NEW BANKING CODE OUTLAWS BUILT-IN OBSOLESCENCE FOR SAVING ACCOUNTS Following a campaign led by the Tory chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, David
Davis, British Banks will on Monday reveal details of a new code of conduct aimed at eliminating
"obsolete accounts". Davis had sought to force banks to adopt better accounts, primarily in the area of
discontinuations, where he believed banks "used loyal customers to subsidise new accounts, which offer
higher interest rates, to win market share". Under the new code, bankers will agree not to leave
customers with obsolete accounts.
WHITBREAD STOPS 5,000-JOB PLAN.

A decision by pub and restaurant group Whitbread to delay its expansion is to place thousands of jobs at risk. The decision comes as a result of poor trading conditions and fears of a looming recession. The group will now place more emphasis on the budget Travel Inns, and its David Lloyd sports centres - the most profitable part of Whitbread's business. A further eight centres have been planned in addition to the present 28.
CBI DENIES STRESS IS SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF ABSENTEEISM

A Bupa-sponsored study by the CBI to be released on Monday will reveal that the average British employee was absent for 8.4 days of 1997, meaning a total of 197m days were lost through absence on the year. The highest level of absenteeism came in the public sector, where 9.3 days off were taken as opposed to 7.4 in the private sector. John Cridland, the CBI's director of human resources, said the massive cost of absenteeism remained "cause for concern" for British businesses and he added management must play "an increasingly active role in controlling absence".

SUPERMARKETS ATTACK OFT INVESTIGATION INTO PROFITS.

Leading UK supermarkets including Tesco , Sainsbury , Asda and Safeway have criticised the Office of Fair Trading's investigation into how their profits and pricing schemes are carried out. The supermarket groups believe the OFT's inquiry has been muddled, slow and uses an unworkable economic model. The supermarkets have also expressed surprise that the OFT has asked no questions about supplier relationships.
IMF PLEADS FOR CASH TO AVERT CRISIS

With resources having reached an all-time low of just $10bn-$12bn, the International Monetary Fund has launched an appeal for extra funding. An official for the IMF has called on the U.S. House of Representatives to step up its efforts to approve an increase in contributions. The IMF's cash resources have been drained most by the Asian financial crisis, which began in Thailand in 1997, and which it has dubbed "one of the worst (financial crisis) in the post-war period".
PILKINGTON STRENGTHENS BOARD.

Glassmaking giant Pilkington has unveiled plans to strengthen its board and improve investor sentiment through the appointment of three new non-executives. Bill Harrison of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , Laporte chief executive James Leng and Barclays finance director Oliver Stocken are all set to join Pilkington's board as part of its major corporate restructuring.

BRUSSELS, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Monday a newspaper report saying P&O Nedlloyd would be  fined 25 million pounds ($42 million) for its part in a price-fixing consortium was "pure speculation".

A Commission spokesman said no decision on how much to fine the company and other members of the shipping consortium  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) had been taken yet.

TD
Britain's Independent on Sunday said P&O Nedlloyd faced a 25 million pound penalty.

The spokesman declined to elaborate, but people who have been watching the discussions said there was still opposition within the  Commission to stiff penalties proposed by EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert.

The Commission can fine the TACA members up to 10 percent of their annual turnover for fixing prices and other serious infringements of fair EU competition rules.

The biggest members of  TACA, which provides container transport on North Atlantic routes, are Danish Maersk Line, part of the A.P. Moeller Group, Sea-Land of the United States, Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha. ($1=.5966 Pound).

The European Commission is to fine UK shipping firm P&O Nedlloyd up to #25m for its part in a cartel that has been accused of price-fixing on North Atlantic container routes.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert will announce the decision on Wednesday, after a meeting of senior officials the day before recommends penalties for each member of the 15-strong Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement.  The fines could be up to 10% of each company's turnover, which in P&O's case would amount to #500m - but #25m is considered the likely maximum.

The European Commission yesterday described as "pure speculation" a report that P&O will be  fined
#25m ($42m) for its role in the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement's  alleged abuse of a dominant
position and restriction of service contracts.
A commission spokesman said no decision on how much to  fine the company and other members of
Taca had yet been taken.

TD
A spokesman for P&O said the UK group had not been informed about the size of the possible  fine.
The Taca case is expected to be discussed by a meeting of commissioners tomorrow. Some EU government have baulked at the size of proposed penalties.

The Commission may still impose other  fines on the TACA, an official said. "We may impose further
fines on the TACA's inland price fixing," he said.

Rakkenes responded sharply to the  Commission's decision Wednesday."The (Commission) decision is based on numerous errors of fact and law," he said, adding: "This is our livelihood. They are taking away our livelihood. Very few trans-Atlantic operators are making money."

TD
However, the  Commission official pointed out that the article of  European law under which the
Commission acted "doesn't only prohibit successful abusers of the law, but all abusers."

The Commission also pointed out that the  TACA's price increases over the three years 1993 to 1995 have been in excess of 80%, amounting to an estimated additional cost to shippers of $65 million to $75 million.
The TACA members have a joint market share in excess of 60%, the  Commission said.

The TACA isn't new to the world of Commission law enforcement. In 1992 its predecessor, the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement,  or TAA notified the Commission of its creation and two years later the Commission took a negative decision, prohibiting the cartel.
The TAA became the  TACA shortly after that decision, and promptly filed an application to the
Commission seeking an exemption from anti-cartel rules.
The alliance is still disputing that 1994 negative decision in the  European Court of First Instance. A
conclusion to that case is expected some time next year.
The official wouldn't speculate on how long this latest appeal will take, but pointed out that  Commission
will charge interest on the  fines, if they are met with bank guarantees.

HD             EU Slaps Antitrust Fines on Nippon Yusen, 14 Other Shipping Firms. WC            187 words

Brussels, Sept. 16 (Jiji Press)-The European Commission on Wednesday decided to slap antitrust fines worth a total of 273 million European Currency Units, or roughly 314 million dollars, on 15 shipping firms, including Nippon Yusen K.K. of Japan.

The 15 firms comprising the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  violated the European Union's antitrust rules by applying price-fixing practices to their container operations, the commission said.

TD
The amount of the  fines was the biggest on record imposed by the  commission in antitrust cases. Nippon Yusen's penalty was set at 20.63 million ECUs.

In July 1994,  TACA filed for the  commission's approval for making its agreements on container operations immune from the EU's antitrust rules.

But the  commission turned down TACA's request, arguing that the organization has set a uniform rate on transportation for inland areas of EU member nations.  TACA has also fixed charges to be paid to trucking operators, the  commission also said.

The commission also cited TACA's abuse of its monopolistic position in transatlantic cargo operations.

HD         Europe Hits Shippers  With $317 Million  In Price-Fixing Fines
WC       670 words

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission said Wednesday that it will fine members of the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  freight-shipping group a total of 273 million European Currency Units ($317 million) for abusing their dominant market position and fixing prices.

The commission, which oversees antitrust matters in the 15-nation  European Union, said the  TACA group, which is made up of 16 companies, restricted the availability of individual service contracts and "actively" discouraged potential competitors.

TD
The combined fine is the largest ever imposed by the  commission on a group of companies for
price-fixing. The heaviest penalty, 41.3 million ECUs, will be imposed on Anglo-Dutch shipping group
P&O Nedlloyd Ltd., a joint venture of Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. and Nedlloyd Group
NV. The second largest  fines - 27.5 million ECUs each - will be levied on Danish shipper Maersk Group
and U.S. shipper Sea-Land, a unit of CSX Corp. (CSX).

The commission said TACA broke EU rules by agreeing to fix prices on inland transport services within the EU and prices paid to freight forwarders.

Olav Rakkenes, acting chairman of the alliance and chief executive of one of its member shipping lines, Sweden's Atlantic Container Line. said the group will appeal the decision.

The commission said individual service contracts were banned by the  TACA members in 1995, and group contracts were restricted. Agreements on terms of service contracts with shippers were also illegal, the  commission said.

"Service contracts are at the center of the commercial relationship between those shippers which require regular services and those which provide them," the  commission said. "The restrictions on ... individual service contracts constitute the biggest source of complaints by shippers against  TACA."

TACA also attracted potential competitors to join its group, and "altered the competitive structure of the market," the  commission said. One example of this was that  TACA allowed shipping lines that weren't traditionally conference members to charge a lower price for service than the existing members.

TACA argued that if the parties forced prices too high, potential competitors would enter the market and rebalance prices, the commission said. However, the  commission said there would have been greater competitive pressure if TACA hadn't held out the prospect of joining it to companies. It further said these agreements weren't exempted by a 1986 EU law on shipping conferences.

The EU said price increases over the three years 1993 to 1995 have been in excess of 80%, amounting to an estimated additional cost to shippers of $65 million to $75 million annually. The  TACA members have a combined market share in excess of 60%, the EU said.

Other companies in the group and their  fines are: Orient Overseas Container, Hong Kong, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Japan, Hanjin Shipping, South Korea, and Hapag LLoyd, Germany, 20.63 million ECUs each; Hyundai Merchant Marine, South Korea, 18.56 million ECUs; Mediterranean Shipping, Switzerland, DSR-Senator Lines, Germany/South Korea, Neptune Orient Lines, Singapore, and Cho Yang Shipping, South Korea, 13.75 million ECUs each; and TMM/Tecomar, Mexico, Atlantic Container Line, Sweden, and Polish Ocean Lines, Poland, 6.88 million ECUs each.

Page 57 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission said the fines reflect the fact that the infringements took place before the merger of
P&O and Nedlloyd. It also noted that Neptune Orient and Hanjin have left the  TACA.

Rakkenes, the shipping executive, said he expected the  commission's decision to impose  fines, but he insisted "the activities to which the  commission has objected are acceptable under EU law and other laws too.

"Fines can't be imposed on activities that have been notified to the commission, and we first notified it back in 1992," he said. Rakkenes said he is confident the commission's position will be overturned during the appeal, and is advising all members of the TACA to make bank guarantees, rather than pay the fines.

HD      P&O in record EC cartel fine

P&O Nedlloyd, the Anglo-Dutch container line, learnt today it has to pay Pounds 29 million towards a record Pounds 191 million  fine imposed by the European Commission on a container shipping
price-fixing cartel, writes Jonathan Annells.
The Commission said the 16 past and present members of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement
'had abused their joint dominant position by restricting the availability of individual service contracts and
by actively discouraging independent market entry by potential competitors.'  TACA accounts for 60% of
North Atlantic container traffic. Although prices for maritime freight transport are exempted from EU
competition rules, the  Commission found that  TACA fixed prices for the inland sectors which are not.

TD
TACA members also agreed common conditions for contracts with shippers, and fixed the prices paid to freight forwarders. The  fines reflect the severity of the offence. P&O Nedlloyd's penalty reflects the fact that the infringements predate their merger.

BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (AFP) - The European Commission on Wednesday levied  fines totalling 273 million ecus (300 million dollars) on a group of Asian, European and US shipping companies accused of operating a virtual cartel on land transport tariffs.

According to the  Commission, the companies, members of the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement (TACA), did not respect EU competition laws by concluding a pricing agreement on the land transport of goods and by exchanging information of empty containers.

TD
EU experts said the deal conveyed no advantage to consumers and violated EU regulations. They also said the members had abused their position to discourage competition from independent shipping companies.

TACA members, which include Sea-Land Service Inc, AP Moeller, Nedllyod Lijnen BV and P+O Containers Ltd., transported more than 1.3 million containers between  Europe and the United States in
1995, the last year for which figures are available.
EU sources said discussions were underway to find a solution for future commercial practice.
One of the companies  fined, AP Moeller, announced it would appeal in the  European Court of Justice. "To us, this decision seems totally incomprehensible and the size of the  fine is incredible," said Knud
Pontoppidan, a company director. AP Moeller was  fined 27.5 million dollars by the  Commission.

EU Competition  Commission Karel Van Miert had initially pushed for the  fine to be twice as big, but some EU experts felt that would ruin the smaller  TACA members.

Norway's Atlantic Container Line ASA said in a statement that  TACA members have received "firm legal advice" that  fines imposed by the EU  Commission will be "overturned on appeal".

The European Commission said it imposed the following  fines totalling 272.94 million ecus on the follozing TACA shipping lines:
AP Moeller Maersk - 27.50 million ecus
U.S.' Sea Land Service Inc - 27.50 million ecus
PO Nedlloyd - 41.26 million ecus
Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line - 20.63 million ecus
Japan's NYK Line (Europe) Ltd - 20.63 million ecus Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd - 20.63 million ecus Hapag Lloyd AG - 20.63 million ecus
Hyundai Merchant Marine - 18.56 million ecus
Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co - 13.75 million ecus

Page 60 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.

Singapore's Neptune Orient Lines Ltd - 13.75 million ecus
Korea's Cho Yang Shipping Co Ltd - 13.75 million ecus
Mexico's Transportacion Maritima Mexicana/Tecomar SA de CV - 6.88 million ecus
Sweden's Atlantic Container Line AB - 6.88 million ecus
Poland's Polish Ocean Lines - 6.88 million ecus

The fine on PO Nedlloyd reflects the fact that the infringements took place before the merger of PO Containers Ltd and NedLLoyd, the  commission said.

STRASBOURG, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected on Wednesday to impose sizable fines on A.P. Moeller Group's Maersk Line , P&O Nedlloyd and other members of the TACA shipping consortium, for allegedly driving out competition on the transport of containers between North Atlantic ports.

Commission officials have given little away over how big the  fines may be, but industry
representatives, including some of the companies themselves, said they expect sizeable sums, possibly
close to $50 million for the biggest participants.

TD
A Commission spokesman on Monday dismissed as "pure speculation" a newspaper report saying
P&O would be fined 25 million pounds ($42 million).

The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has tried for years to convince the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) to change its rules on the grounds they amount to price-fixing and abuse of dominant position - outlawed by the EU.
The companies can be  fined up to 10 percent of their annual turnover.

TACA currently has 14 members. Besides Maersk and P&O Nedlloyd they include Sea-Land of the
United States, Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha .

In January, the EU executive claimed 102 million ecus ($117 million) from German carmaker Volkswagen - the biggest  fine ever imposed on a single company under EU competition law - for allegedly preventing German and Austrian residents from taking advantage of cheaper car prices in neighbouring Italy.

Commission officials said none of the  TACA members would be hit that hard but said the penalties would be far from symbolic because the infringements were serious and had been going on for a long time.

P&O and Maersk have already said they would fight the decision in the  European courts, as did VW. The case is still pending.
The biggest  fine imposed on a cartel was 248 million ecus in 1994 on a group of cement producers. ($1
= 0.87 ecus) ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

HD        Dutch shares finish  higher on hopes for Greenspan. WC       470 words

AMSTERDAM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Dutch shares closed firmer on Wednesday, helped higher by prospects of lower interest rates ahead of testimony from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan although dealers said the optimistic mood was fragile.
The AEX index closed up 12.64 points or 1.25 percent higher at 1,027.34 as Wall Street started flat. The
Dow Jones later softened slightly.

TD
Gains by index-heavy financials helped underpin the AEX, which lost almost two percent on Tuesday.
Financial services group ING benefited from the improved tone, marching ahead 4.70 guilders to end up
4.44 percent at 110.50 guilders.

Sector peer ABN AMRO also finished up, adding 1.20 guilders to 39.00 as it shrugged off recent pressure from the financial crises in Asia and Russia.

The two financials also topped the volume charts, and dealers said turnover in other stocks had been relatively thin ahead of key U.S. August industrial production and capacity utilisation data.

However, the higher than expected numbers failed to dampen rate cut hopes, given distortions from the one-off effect of the end of the General Motors strike, dealers said.

Another major AEX pillar, Royal Dutch Petroleum, also rose to finish up 0.70 guilders at 96.10. In early trade it notched up a high of 97.60, helped by its U.S. performance overnight and higher oil prices.

Publisher Wolters Kluwer initially recouped some of Tuesday's losses, sustained on news a major broker had swapped it for KPN on its recommended list. But it ended the day down 3.50 guilders at
347.50.
KPN finished strongly higher, adding 5.30 guilders to 69.30.
Dealers said action in some stocks was options-led ahead of Friday's September options expiry. Several suggested that options players were steering for an expiry of index options around the 1,000
points mark, but a market maker on the options exchange said this was not borne out by the open
interest in AEX series.

Prominent among the losers was wafer stepper maker ASM Lithography as high-tech stocks continued their slide. ASML shares lost 1.60 guilders to 33.40, a fall of 4.6 percent.
Also down was shipping firm Nedlloyd, after the  European Commission said it was imposing a hefty
fine for Nedlloyd's alleged role in a pricing cartel on North Atlantic container traffic.

The stock hit an intraday low of 29.20 guilders, a loss of 1.20 guilders, before edging up to finish off 0.90 guilders at 29.50.

Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA), the shipping consortium of which Nedlloyd is part, has rejected the Commission ruling and said it will appeal to the  European Court for an annulment.

COPENHAGEN, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Danish shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller said on Wednesday it would appeal against the  European Commission's decision to  fine its Maersk Line unit 27.5 million ecus for participating in a price-fixing cartel in North Atlantic container traffic.

"We fail totally to comprehend the EU Commission's decision. Now we intend, of course, to turn to the European Court to overturn this unprecedented fine," A.P. Moeller director Knut Pontoppidan told Reuters by telephone.

TD
"We have acted correctly and abided by the rules laid down in the  TACA agreement," he said, referring to the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) shipping consortium.
The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, on Wednesday slapped a record  fine of
273 million ecus ($314 million) on a group of shipping companies, including Maersk Line.

It has tried for years to convince the consortium to change its rules on the grounds that they amount to price-fixing and abuse of a dominant market position - outlawed by the EU.
Pontoppidan pointed out that the notoriously strict U.S. authorities had not complained about the  TACA
agreement.

In addition to Maersk Line, the biggest of the 14 firms making up the  TACA consortium are P&O Nedlloyd, Sea-Land of the United States, Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha.

AMSTERDAM, Sep 16 (Reuters) - The shipping consortium Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement (TACA) said on Wednesday it rejected the European Commission's record fine and would appeal to the European Court for an annulment.

TACA, which was hit by a 273 million ecu  fine ($314 million) by the  Commission on Wednesday, said the ruling that it operated a cartel on North Atlantic container traffic routes was based on "numerous errors of fact, procedure and law."

TD
"The activities to which the  Commission objects are permitted under  European law and are accepted by all developed seafaring nations, notably the U.S." said  TACA chairman Olav Rekkenes in a statement.

TACA said the Commission's decision was an attempt to limit the scope of liner conferences, which it said were adopted by the European Council in 1986 and are an important stabilizing influence.

TACA is an international shipping consortium, whose members include P&O Nedlloyd , A.P. Moeller
Group's Maersk Line, U.S. firm Sea-Land, Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha .

Nedlloyd received the highest  fine at 41 million ecus, with Maersk and Sea-Land each  fined 27.5 million ecus.

TACA said the Commission's view that intermodal rate-making in  Europe is unlawful was currently under consideration by the European Court, and that the shipping lines were protected by a court suspension order.

TACA also said it had abandoned the practice of prohibiting individual service contracts in 1995, a year before the  Commission began proceedings.

Commission claims that  TACA eliminated potential competition in transatlantic shipping were not true, TACA said, since many lines have emerged as independents and others have left the group to operate outside the conference.

Earlier the  Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, said it had tried for years to convince the consortium to change its rules on the ground that they amounted to price-fixing and abuse of a dominant market position.

The biggest  fine previously handed down by the EU was 248 million ecus in 1994 to a group of cement producers, and the biggest single company penalty was the 102 million ecu  fine given to German carmaker Volkswagen in January.

BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The members of the TACA shipping group may complain that the European Commission was wrong and unjust to fine them a record 273 million Ecus ($314 million) for allegedly breaching European competition law.
But they would have suffered a lot more if  European antitrust chief Karel Van Miert had had it his way.

TD
Without actually saying what the original proposal was, Van Miert's spokesman said that industry rumours that it was about 500 million ecus were "not totally way off". The proposed ruling was discussed for months and met opposition from national capitals and inside the  Commission itself.

At 41.26 million ecus, the fine imposed on P&O Nedlloyd was only 0.9 percent of its turnover, the spokesman said, despite the Commission being allowed to go as high as 10 percent.

Maersk, the largest member of the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement,  which controls 60 percent of container trade between northern Europe and the United States, was fined 27.5 million Ecu, or 0.7 percent of its turnover, he said.
Under EU rules, the  fines must be paid within two months unless the companies ask the  European
court to suspend payment until a final ruling and the Luxembourg-based court agrees to this.

Rather than paying, the companies can also provide a bank guarantee, but it must also cover interest payments in case they lose the court battle.

EU cartel and other competition decisions are appealed in the  European Court of First Instance with the possibility of going to the higher  European Court of Justice - a process which can take four years. ((Amelia Torres +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573 brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Record fines levied by the EU on container shipping lines of the
Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) target past trading practices which have since been
amended, the head of the conference told Reuters on Wednesday.

"We have the right to appeal the fines and we will win the case,"  TACA chairman Olav Rakkenes said in a telephone interview. "The fines issue is about the past. It is harking back on old news."

TD
Earlier on Wednesday the  European Commission slapped a record fine of 273 million ecus ($314 million) on TACA for operating a price-fixing cartel on North Atlantic container traffic.

The biggest of the 14 firms that make up the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) consortium are A.P. Moeller Group's Maersk Line , P&O Nedlloyd , Sea-Land of the U.S., Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha .

The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has tried for years to convince the consortium to change its rules on the grounds that they amount to price-fixing and abuse of a dominant market position.

But TACA said in a statement that the  European Commission's decision to  fine the lines was based on a number of errors of fact, procedure and law.

Rakkenes said an example was the  Commission's objection to the practice of banning individual service contracts.

This had been abandoned by  TACA in 1995, a year before the  Commission started its procedings, he said.

The process of evolution to alter practices was being further pushed ahead by upcoming legislation, Rakkenes said.
The conference will discuss next month in Amsterdam ways of operating in a fully deregulated market.
A new U.S. Shipping Act, expected to be passed into law by next May, will fully deregulate the industry. It will end the process of publically filing all rate agreements in America and will allow confidential
service contracts, as is the case in  Europe.

"We are all agreed to that," Rakkenes said. "We just have to find a way to work together in one system."

Some lines on the Atlantic have hired an advisor, Chris Rankin who used to head up P&O Nedlloyd in the U.S., to look at how deregulation has worked in the airline business and how lessons can be applied to shipping.

"Modernisation of the conference system will fit into the deregulation of the industy. But how it will work remains to be seen," Rakkenes said.

Page 71 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We do not want to break the law and we are still talking to the EU to find a way to go forward," he added.
The EU still objects to some of the contents and conditions of  TACA service contracts.
But Rakkenes was confident the lines could beat off the  fines imposed by the European Commission. The lines would put together an appeal within a couple of months. "But it will be a year or two until
everything gets decided," he said.

Rakkenes derided Commission complaints that  TACA had been anti-competitive, by saying few lines on the Atlantic were currently profitable and that a number of new entrants had joined in the last two years, not always as members of the conference.

He rejected analysts' arguments that the trade was loss-making due to overcapacity and that consolidation of the industry had led some operators to enter the Atlantic because they needed to have a global presence.

Last week OOCL's managing director of  European operations Jim Poon suggested that the TAA, the successor to TACA, could look to act as a rate stabilisation  agreement in which policy was discussed but rates not set.
However, Rakkenes said nothing has been decided.

Sources have also said such a set-up, which would include all the operators discussing rate levels, could be illegal under the current EU competition rules. ((Paul Berrill, Reuters Shipping News +44 171

BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European          Commission on Wednesday:

Spokesman Thierry Daman in Brussels said the  Commission's meeting in Strasbourg was considering the TACA consortium issue, the proposed new trade partnership  agreement with the United States and the Malpensa airport dispute. The flight ban on JAT airlines was also on the agenda.

TD
He said information would be provided on Thursday relating to  Commission discussions on food aid, with the possibility of a press conference by Commissioners Bonino and Marin.

In Stasbourg, Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock announced the decision on Malpensa airport. The Commission had formally blocked plans by Italy to move foreign airlines to the new airport outside Milan. He said he regretted the action but the  Commission had had no option because Italy had contravened European law. He asked for rapid and effective revision of the Italian decrees relating to Malpensa. - - - -

AMSTERDAM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch shipping and road transport group Koninklijke Nedlloyd fell Wednesday after the  European Commission imposed a hefty  fine for its alleged role in a pricing cartel on North Atlantic container traffic.

The stock fell to a low of 29.20 guilders, a loss of 1.20 guilders or 2.63 percent, before edging up a tick to stand at 29.60 by 1340 GMT.

TD
Transatlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), the shipping consortium of which Nedlloyd is part, has rejected the Commission ruling and said it will appeal to the  European Court for an annulment.

Nedlloyd's share of the record 273 million ecu  fine is the largest, amounting to 41 million ecus. The company on Wednesday declined to comment on the decision, referring queries to  TACA in the U.S.

BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday slapped a record  fine on a group of shipping companies for price-fixing on North Atlantic container traffic, then warned they could be fined again for doing the same on overland routes.

The European Union executive imposed a record 273 million Ecus ($314 million)  fine on 14 firms that make up the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) shipping consortium for various breaches of EU competition law relating to the group's operations in the North Atlantic.

TD
The Commission added, however, that it was hopeful of a negotiated settlement that could put an end to the dispute between the executive, the shipping firms and other transport companies.

"The Commission may decide to impose fines at a later date in respect of the price  agreement relating to inland transport services supplied within the territory of the (EU)," it said in a statement after its weekly meeting.

It concluded: "In recent months, highly constructive discussions have been taking place both at a high level and at the working level.

"Whilst it is too early to conclude that final  agreement on all issues can be reached, Commissioner (Karel) Van Miert is optimistic that the basis for a solution to the benefit of the trade will soon be in place and that further conflict can be avoided".

The Commission found TACA, which operates on North Atlantic routes, guilty of price fixing and abuse of dominant position.

EU law only allows shipping firms to coordinate prices on maritime transport, not on the land segment of the transport, despite a growing trend to provide door-to-door services.

Of the 15 companies  fined on Wednesday, P&O Nedlloyd was hardest hit with 41 million Ecus, followed by Sea-Land of the United States and A.P.Moeller Group's Maersk Line with 27.4 million Ecus each.

BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The  European Commission was on Wednesday discussing fining the members of the  TACA shipping consortium a record of about 300 million ecus, a  Commission source told Reuters.
The Commission alleges that the 14 firms that make up the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement

The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has tried for years to convince the consortium to change its rules on the grounds that they amount to price-fixing and abuse of a dominant market position - outlawed by the EU.
The companies can be  fined up to 10 percent of their annual turnover.

In January, the EU executive claimed 102 million ecus ($117 million) from German carmaker Volkswagen - the biggest  fine ever imposed on a single company under EU competition law - for allegedly preventing German and Austrian residents from taking advantage of cheaper car prices in neighbouring Italy.
The biggest  fine imposed on a cartel was 248 million ecus in 1994 on a group of cement producers.

The Commission source said the EU executive was continuing its discussions on the issue. ($1 = 0.87 ecus) ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573

AMSTERDAM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Shipping and transport company P&O Nedlloyd declined to comment on fines expected to be levied on the company by the  European Commission.

The Commission says the shipping consortium  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA), of which P&O Nedlloyd is a member, operated for years a price-fixing cartel in North Atlantic container traffic, contrary to EU rules.

TD
P&O Nedlloyd referred press queries to the  TACA offices in the U.S. and said it had received no formal notification from the  Commission.

Shares in Nedlloyd on the Amsterdam bourse fell 40 cents to 30.00 guilders ($15.68) in early afternoon trade, a drop of 1.3 percent.

The fines against the  TACA consortium are likely to be about 300 million ecus ($347.3 million) in total, a commission source told Reuters.
Other leading companies in the 14-member group include A.P. Moeller Group's Maersk Line, U.S. firm
Sea-Land, Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha .

SOME of the world's biggest shipping companies have been stung by an all-time record  fine from the European Commission for fixing prices and sharing the market for transporting goods between the EU and US.

Fines totalling 273 million ecu were imposed on 15 container shipping firms this week, with the Commission warning that further penalties could be in the pipeline for collusion on the prices charged for transporting cargoes across land to their final destination.

TD
Anglo-Dutch shipping firm P&O Nedlloyd was targeted for the biggest punishment, with a  fine of 41.26 million ecu. Denmark's Maersk, Germany's Hapag Lloyd and DSR, Sweden's ACL and Poland's Pol face smaller penalties.
Shipping companies in the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) shared a 60% share of
the EU-US market. The Commission launched its investigation after complaints from some  European
exporters that they were being priced out of markets without having anywhere else to turn.

The TACA alliance criticised the  Commission decision and promised an immediate appeal to the European Court of Justice to try to get it suspended and reversed. "The  TACA lines have received firm legal advice that the decision will be overturned on appeal," it said.

Groups accused of abusing position and operating price-fixing cartel.

The European Commission yesterday imposed record  fines totalling ECU 273m ($298m) on 15 of the world's largest shipping lines, which dominate container trade across the North Atlantic.

TD
The Commission - the European Union's Brussels-based executive - said the lines had abused their dominance of the market and operated a price-fixing cartel.

The fines on the members of the so-called  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) beat the previous record total of ECU 248m imposed on a cement-making cartel in 1995. The Commission's largest individual  fine, ECU 102m, was imposed this yearagainst Volkswagen, the German carmaker, for competition abuses.

The Amsterdam-based Taca said it would appeal against the  fines to the European Court of Justice, accusing the Commission of "numerous errors of fact, procedure and law".

Most of the 15 companies were  fined between ECU 6.88m and ECU 27.5m, but P&O Nedlloyd, the Anglo-Dutch container line, must pay ECU 41.26m, reflecting the fact that many of the abuses took place before P&O and Nedlloyd tie-up.

Lord Sterling, P&O chairman, joint partner in P&O Nedlloyd, said yesterday: "We were very close to agreement with the  Commission on how the whole thing could be settled. I find it disappointing that fines of this magnitude have been levied on issues from the past."

The fines arose following a complaint by the European Shippers Council - which represents companies exporting goods - that between 1993 and 1995, Taca and the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement,  Taca's predecessor, were able to impose price rises of more than 80%. The US Federal Maritime Commission estimated price increases announced by  Taca for 1995 would have cost shippers $65m-$75m more than they paid in 1994.
Shippers welcomed the decision yesterday - though even they said the level of  fines appeared harsh. The fines are the latest episode in a long-running stand-off between the  Commission and shipping
lines.
The Trans-Atlantic Agreement  was prohibited by the  European Commission as anti-competitive in
1994. In the same year, Taca members asked Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, for
exemption from an EU ban on cartel agreements, under special EU rules for shipping conferences.

But Mr Van Miert found that only price-fixing arrangements on transport between northern  Europe and the US could be exempted.

Three other types of price-fixing, on inland transport services and prices paid to freight forwarders, as well as agreements on the terms and conditions of service contracts, breached the EU's anti-cartel law.

Other companies  fined yesterday were Maersk of Denmark, Sea-Land of the US, OOCL of Hong Kong, NYK of Japan, Hanjin, Hyundai and Cho Yang of Korea, MSC of Switzerland, Hapag Lloyd of Germany and the German-Korean DSR/Senator, Singapore's NOL, Mexico's TMM/Tecomar, Sweden's ACL, and POL of Poland.

INTERVIEW-EU  TACA SHIPPING FINES PUNISH PAST. LONDON - Record fines levied by the EU on container shipping lines of the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) target past trading practices which have since been amended, the head of the conference told Reuters on Wednesday. "We have the right to appeal the fines and we will win the case,"  TACA chairman Olav Rakkenes said in a telephone interview. "The fines issue is about the past. It is harking back on old news." Earlier on Wednesday the European Commission slapped a record fine of 273 million ecus ($314 million) on  TACA for operating a price-fixing cartel on North Atlantic container traffic. The biggest of the 14 firms that make
up the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) consortium are A.P. Moeller Group's Maersk Line, P&O Nedlloyd, Sea-Land of the U.S., Preussag's Hapag Lloyd and Nippon Yusen Kaisha. REUTERS NEWS SERVICE

INTERVIEW-BRITISH FIRMS SEEK NICHE IN INDIA PORTS. BOMBAY - India offers huge potential for development of ports and British companies are keenly examining investments in a few states, a senior official of a London-based marine consulting engineering firm said on Wednesday. "It's a very exciting time for port development in India because there is so much cargo expansion potential," said Gordon Rankine, partner at Beckett Rankine Partnership, an independent privately owned company. The firm provides specialist consulting service and focuses on marine projects like the development of ports and harbours. The company in a study on Indian ports has zeroed in on four major Indian states that are suitable for investments. REUTERS NEWS SERVICE

MARINE PREMIUMS DROP TO $15 BILLION THANKS TO LOW RATES, HIGH COMPETITION. LISBON
- Total marine premiums for the world insurers totaled about $15 billion in 1996, about $1.6 billion less
than what was reported for 1995, according to a report compiled by the Central Union of Marine
Underwriters in Oslo, Norway. Most surprising was the decline in premiums written by members of the
Lloyd's Underwriting Association. In 1996, the group reported premiums of $1.4 billion, a drop of $1.1
billion from 1995's $2.5 billion. Speaking at the International Union of Marine Insurance annual meeting
here, Richard Youell, liaison office for the Lloyd's Underwriters' Association, explained the decline in
premiums could be attributed to falling rates, increasing worldwide competition and business being taken
at "unrealistic" low rates. JOURNAL OF COMMERCE

SHIPS WARNED AGAINST PIRATES ON SE ASIA HIGH SEAS. DUMAGUETE CITY - Ships in southeast Asian waters, including the Philippines, are advised to be wary of piracy attacks and armed robbery, a broadcast message from the IMB regional Piracy Reporting Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia said yesterday. A copy of the report was received by the Greek cargo vessel, the M/V Konstantinos A, which called on the private port of the Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc. (LBRDI) in Barangay Simacolong, Lazi, Siquijor, to load some 60,000 tons of limestone for export to Hong Kong. Floratos Nikolaos, skipper of the M/V Konstantinos A, told Dumaguete reporters during a ship visit Wednesday that the number one problem experienced by sea vessels travelling the high seas were pirate attacks. These were mostly reported in Indonesia, he said, but all ships plying the Southeast Asian region were cautioned to take extra precautionary measures "when at all ports and waters in Indonesia, Bangkok, Thailand, and the Philippines," the report said.

EUROPE'S YARDS MUST FOCUS ON CRUISE SHIPS - ANTONINI. MILAN -  European shipbuilders, faced with a sharp drop in demand this year for conventional cargo vessels, should focus on the most sophisticated shipbuilding products and particularly cruise ships, Corrado Antonini, Chairman of Italy's Fincantieri state shipbuilder said on Tuesday. He was addressing the second Seatrade Mediterranean Cruise and Ferry Convention which opened in the port city of Genova. "After a year in which total newbuilding orders reached a record level, although with no price improvements due to excess capacity,
1998 is bringing bad news - a sharp drop of demand for conventional cargo vessels and an even sharper drop in newbuilding prices for these types of ships due to the devaluation of the Korean and Japanese currencies. "Under these circumstances, the  European shipbuilding industry has to and wants to multiply its efforts to master the most sophisticated shipbuilding products - first and foremost cruise ships - in which it has demonstrated unparalleled capabilities," Antonini said in a speech.

SHIPS COLLIDE OFF SINGAPORE, NO INJURIES OR SPILL. SINGAPORE - Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said two vessels collided in Singapore waters early on Thursday but no one had been injured. The collision, between Liberian-registered car carrier Hual Trinita and
Panamanian-registered container vessel Ever Glory also did not cause any oil pollution, an MPA statement said. The statement said the collision, which saw the bow of Ever Glory penetrate the portside of Hual Trinita, occurred at about 0020 gmt on Thursday. Both vessels are in no danger of sinking, although the Hual Trinita, now anchored, has a list to starboard and had taken in water. It is in a stable condition, MPA said. REUTERS NEWS SERVICE

GROUNDED BRITISH TRAWLER LEAKS FUEL IN ARCTIC. OSLO - A British trawler was leaking diesel fuel on Wednesday in environmentally sensitive waters off the Arctic island of Spitzerbergen after running aground on rocks, Norwegian rescue services said. Twenty-seven of the 35-member crew were airlifted from the trawler Arctic Corsair, which was listing at 10 degrees, said Bent Jamtli, duty rescue controller at

Bodoe in northern Norway. The vessel ran aground in three to four metres of water in the Ice fjord, northwest of Spitzbergen's main town Longyear. "The captain was worried about the ship capsizing and the crew was evacuated. Now it has been secured by other vessels," Jamtli said. REUTERS

DANISH MOELLER TO APPEAL  FINE. COPENHAGEN - Danish shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller said on Wednesday it would appeal against the  European Commission's decision to  fine its Maersk Line unit
27.5 million ecus for participating in a price-fixing cartel in North Atlantic container traffic. "We fail totally to comprehend the EU Commission's decision. Now we intend, of course, to turn to the  European Court to overturn this unprecedented fine," A.P. Moeller director Knut Pontoppidan told Reuters by telephone. "We have acted correctly and abided by the rules laid down in the TACA agreement," he said, referring to the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) shipping consortium. The Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, on Wednesday slapped a record  fine of 273 million ecus ($314 million) on a group of shipping companies, including Maersk Line. REUTERS

SHIP MISSING AFTER GALES. Just like the 200-year-old voyage it was to re-enact, a replica 18th century sloop was blown off course in strong gales yesterday, prompting a large air and sea search. An RAAF Orion was last night performing a radar grid search about Green Cape off the East Coast after fears the replica sloop Norfolk with a crew of five was floundering in heavy seas. The ship was on its way to Sydney from Hobart to begin a recreation of a 1798 voyage by George Bass and Matthew Flinders which proved that Tasmania was an island. But 74-year-old skipper Bern Cuthbertson failed to make two scheduled radio checks with family on Tuesday prompting the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to mount a search.

ALSTOM TO BUILD GREEK HIGH SPEED FERRY. PARIS - Alstom said its Alstom Leroux naval unit had won an order to build a high speed "Corsaire 12000" type ferry for the Greek company Nel Lines based on the island of Lesvos. The 119 metre long ship will have the capacity to carry 1,000 passengers and 200 cars at a maximum speed of 36 knots and is scheduled for delivery at the start of the year 2000. Alstom gave no financial details but said the buyer's credit had been set up by the Debis financial unit of
Daimler-Benz. The order represents one year's full workload for the Leroux Naval unit and its subcontractors. REUTERS NEWS SERVICE

ROYAL CARIBBEAN  FINED $1 MILLION FOR POLLUTION

MIAMI - A U.S. judge Wednesday ordered Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd , the world's second largest cruise line, to pay a $1 million  fine for dumping oily bilge waste into the ocean and lying about it, a U.S. prosecutor said.

The penalty was part of a plea-bargain  agreement reached in June that will see the company pay a total of $9 million, the largest pollution  fines ever assessed against a cruise company, for dumping oil into Caribbean and Atlantic waters, Asst. U.S. Attorney Tom Watts-Fitzgerald said.

In addition to the  fine, U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks put Royal Caribbean on five years probation and ordered it to submit an environmental compliance plan by December 15.

"It's a substantial amount of money," Watts-Fitzgerald told Reuters after the sentencing. "This is the largest collective  fine in the cruise ship industry. That alone has to send a significant message." REUTERS

The European Commission yesterday slapped a record  fine of 273 million ecus ($317-million U.S.) on a group of shipping companies for operating a price-fixing cartel on North Atlantic container traffic. The biggest of the 14 firms that make up the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  consortium are A.P. Moeller Group's Maersk Line, P&O Nedlloyd, Sea-Land Corp. of Edison, N.J., Preussag AG of Germany's Hapag Lloyd and Japan's Nippon Yusen Kaisha. The  Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has tried for years to persuade the shipping consortium to change its rules on the grounds they amount to price fixing and abuse of a dominant market position -- outlawed by the EU. P&O and Maersk have already said they would fight any penalty.

LONDON - The fine against the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  is the largest penalty the
European Commission has levied against a single industry in its 40-year existence. It beats out a  fine of
248 million European currency units ($213 million) imposed on 33 cement companies in October 1994.

TD
It is more than double the third-largest  fine of 132 million ECUs ($114 million) against an alleged cartel of carton board manufacturers in 1994 and a 104.4 million-ECU penalty on steel beam producers in 1993.

The TACA carriers will extend their lead if the commission decides to impose extra  fines for alleged price fixing on inland haulage within the 15-nation European Union.

However, the  TACA carriers are not among the hardest hit on an individual level. The biggest  fine against a single company, the equivalent of over $100 million, was imposed on Volkswagen AG, the German car manufacturer, this summer for preventing its Italian dealers from selling cars to Austrians and Germans crossing the border in search of lower prices.

Past experience indicates the  TACA carriers won't have to pay the  fine until well into the new millennium if they appeal. A challenge by Tetra Pak, the Swedish carton manufacturer, against a fine of 75 million ECUs in July 1991, the second-largest individual penalty, wasn't settled by the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest legal authority, until November 1996. The firm lost. TACA isn't the shipping industry's first run-in with the  commission; it's just the biggest and most costly. The  commission levied token fines of $158,000 on 13 members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference in late 1994 for alleged anti-competitive behavior on the  Europe-Asian shipping lanes.

Until the  TACA decision, the biggest  fine, the equivalent of $18.5 million, was levied on French shipping line SCAC-Delmas-Viljeux in 1992 for allegedly running a cargo cartel on the  Europe-West Africa liner trades. The company also was ordered to remove two vessels from the routes and to quit two shipping conferences.

Thirteen other carriers were  fined a combined $366,000 for colluding with SCAC-Delmas Viljeux. Belgium's CMB was among carriers that were heavily  fined for allegedly anti-competitive behavior on the West African routes.

JOURNAL OF COMMERCE STAFF

LONDON - The  European Commission, in the culmination of a campaign against unlawful shipping practices that has run most of this decade, Wednesday imposed a $318 million  fine on the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  for illegal price-fixing between 1994 and 1996.

TD
TACA, which numbered 17 ship lines at the time of the inquiry, operated outside the guidelines set for liner conferences and abused its dominant position in North Atlantic trade lanes, the  commission said.

TACA members, which now total 13, control about 60% of the trade in the North Atlantic.
The conference Wednesday remained defiant and immediately said it would appeal the ruling. "We have received firm legal advice that the decision will be overturned on appeal," said Olav
Rakkenes, chairman of  TACA.

Shippers cheered the decision, which they have sought since the Trans-Atlantic  Agreement, predecessor to TACA, formed in 1992.
"This is a landmark  agreement," said Christopher Welsh, secretary-general of the  European Shippers
Council, which brought the complaint against  TACA in 1994.
"This closes the door to an era of unlawful shipping cartels," he said, adding that  TACA cost European
industry $1.8 billion in extra shipping costs between 1994 and 1998.

The cost to the ship lines of paying the EU  fines "pales into insignificance when compared with the wider cost of the TAA and  TACA agreements to shippers," Mr. Welsh said.
Freight rates on the North Atlantic suggest otherwise, Mr. Rakkenes said.
"If we were abusing a dominant position, everyone would be making

zillions of dollars," he said. "In fact, very few lines are making money on the North Atlantic," said Mr. Rakkenes, who is also chairman and president of Atlantic Container Line, a  TACA member in South Plainfield, N.J. "Fortunately, ACL is making money, but most are losing money."

The proposed fines, if upheld, would fall most heavily on the group's largest members, including P&O Nedlloyd ($48 million); Maersk Line and Sea-Land Service Inc. ($32 million each); and Orient Overseas Container Line, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), Hanjin Shipping Co. and Hapag-Lloyd ($24 million each).

Other lines to be  fined, if the levies are upheld in court, are Hyundai Merchant Marine ($21 million); Mediterranean Shipping Co., DSR Senator Lines, Neptune Orient Lines and Cho Yang Line ($16 million each); and TMM/Tecomar, ACL and Polish Ocean Lines ($8 million each).
The ruling, which was widely expected, adds to pressures on  TACA from within and without.
Page 95 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Internally, the price-setting group has seen rates slide in a hotly contested battle with non-conference lines - and with each other - to win contracts in an oversupplied market.

In addition, the group faces adverse changes in the law governing their activities in the United States, where Congress is expected to approve a bill allowing confidential, one-on-one contracting between conference members and shippers.

Those pressures have led  TACA to discuss changing its nature from a rate-setting group to a so-called stabilization  agreement that would convene conference and non-conference lines to discuss pricing but not formally set tariffs.

Since the  TACA lines intend to appeal the decision, the impact of the  commission decision, for now, is zero, Mr. Rakkenes said.

"It is business as usual. There is no immediate effect on  TACA," he said. "We will continue to operate the same way."

But Stig Karlsson, director of the Federation of Swedish Industries and of the Swedish Shippers Council, said the commission's ruling will add to pressures within the conference.

TACA members "may be reluctant to continue with activities that can endanger their financial stability," Mr. Karlsson said.

The commission said in its ruling that liner shipping conferences are permitted under EU law, but that TACA operated outside the legal boundaries by restricting what members can offer in individual service contracts, and by allowing newcomers to charge lower rates for their services than longstanding conference members.

This eliminated competition between conference members and raised prices to levels higher than they would be, the  commission said.

The commission added that it may in the future impose  fines on TACA for a separate set of alleged legal violations: joint fixing of prices for inland transportation within the European Union.

That matter is pending before the  European Court of Justice, which has allowed  TACA to continue setting inland prices until the court issues its decision.
That means the  commission is in no position to threaten further  fines, Mr. Rakkenes said. "Europe is still free, and in a democracy the courts decide what the
law will be," he said.
He added that the  commission should have raised no objections to  TACA
restrictions on
individual service contracts, because  TACA abandoned that practice in
1995.
Shipper groups, however, say  TACA modified its practices in that

area, but not enough to permit shippers and  TACA carriers freedom to reach individual service contracts.

Mr. Rakkenes also said that, contrary to the  commission's ruling, there has been competition in the trade. Several lines, including American President Lines, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Yangming Marine Transport, China Ocean Shipping Co. and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha ("K" Line), have entered the trade as independents, he noted. Others, including Hanjin and NOL, have left  TACA.

Shippers counter that such competition may occur around the edges, but that  TACA still dominates the trade, and shippers and their customers would be better off if  TACA did not exist at all.

"We are convinced that in the long run, shipping lines will be run more efficiently if they do not cooperate in cartels," said Mr. Karlsson of the Swedish Shippers Council. "We will have more value for money in
the long run if the cartels are dismissed."

While these battles continue,  TACA will continue trying to find a compromise with the  commission, according to shippers and carriers.
Page 96 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We hope the decision will create a new environment under which the shipping industry and shippers can look to the future instead of to the past," Mr. Welsh said. "I would hope the strength of the commission decision induces TACA to change."

HD         Shippers  fined 188m pounds  for cartel. WC        456 words

THE European Union's anti-trust authority yesterday imposed a record  fine of 273 million ecus (about
#188 million) on a group of shipping companies for breaching competition rules.

The Anglo-Dutch company P&O Nedlloyd was the worst hit with a  fine of 41.26 million ecus, followed by Sea-Land of the United States and Maersk Line, of Denmark, a subsidiary of AP Moeller, with 27.5 million ecus each.

TD
The EU said the 15 companies that make up the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) were guilty of fixing prices beyond normal agreements and had abused their dominant position in the container transport market.

TACA controlled more than 60 per cent of container traffic between northern  Europe and the US, according to figures for 1995.

The EU executive also  fined Preussag's Hapag Lloyd, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Orient Overseas Container Line and Hanjin Shipping 20.63 million ecus, and Hyundai Merchant Marine 18.5 million ecus.
The EU's previous record cartel  fine was 248 million ecus in 1994 on a group of cement producers. But taken individually the punishments were well below the 102 million ecus demanded from German
car maker Volkswagen in January, also for breaching competition rules.

TACA immediately criticised the decision saying it was based on numerous errors of fact, procedure and law, and that it would seek to have it thrown out by the  European Court of First Instance.

Maersk, one of the biggest  TACA members, also denied any wrongdoing and said it would launch a court appeal.

But more fines could be on the way as the  commission said that yesterday's decision did not cover TACA's other practice of fixing prices on overland container transport, seen as another serious infringement.

The commission may decide to impose fines at a later date in respect of the price  agreement relating to inland transport services supplied within the territory of the EU, it said.

However, it hoped a negotiated settlement could end the dispute between the executive, the shipping firms and other transport companies.

Its statement concluded: "Whilst it is too early to conclude that  agreement on all issues can be reached, Commissioner [Karel] Van Miert is optimistic that the basis for a solution to the benefit of the trade will soon be in place and further conflict can be avoided."

The Commission has been fighting  TACA's practices for most of the decade amid complaints by shippers that TACA dictates prices, prevents any of its members from entering into individual service contracts and uses its power to eliminate independent ship owners.

BRUSSELS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - European exporters on Thursday welcomed the  European               Commission's decision to impose record fines on members of the  TACA shipping group, saying they hoped this would allow transatlantic container trade to be priced more fairly.

The European Shippers' Council (ESC) has complained for years that the  Trans-Atlantic                   Conference Agreement  (TACA) had abused its market power by fixing prices and restricting members from entering into individual service contracts.

TD
"The TACA has been able to completely control the terms and conditions and prices relating to service contracts," ESC director Chris Welsh told Reuters in an interview.

ESC represents national associations of users of freight transport services, while  TACA groups shipping heavyweights like A.P. Moeller's Maersk, P&O Nedlloyd and Sea-Land Inc.

Welsh said that while it was appropriate for liner conferences to set reference ocean rates they should not be allowed to ensure the tariffs were "rigidly enforced".

"You may be able to fix prices but you can't take away a free negotiation between customer and suplier," he added.

He compared the situation to buying a car and being charged the manufacturer's recommended price rather than the price set by the distributor.

The Commission on Wednesday fined TACA members 273 million ecus ($314 million) for fixing prices and abusing their market power. TACA controls around 60 percent of the sea transport of containers between northern  Europe and the United States.

In its TACA decision, the EU executive found that as a result of the practices, the group was able to raise prices and go from heavy losses in 1992 to high profits in 1996.

TACA chairman Olav Rakkenes on Wednesday denied that the conference banned its members from concluding individual service contracts, saying the practice had been abandoned in 1995.
Rakkenes told Reuters the EU  fines sanctioned past behaviour and said he was confident the
European court would slash them.

Despite the  fines, TACA could be reaching a compromise with the EU's antitrust authority after years of hostilities.

Rakkenes said the TACA rules were in the process of being modified in particular to adapt to a new deregulated market in the United States.

The Commission on Wednesday said "highly constructive discussions" had recently taken place, without elaborating.
But Welsch insisted any compromise settlement should ensure prices were fairly agreed.

Page 101 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commission spokesman Stefan Rating said  TACA proposals were about providing door to door services, including the controversial practice of also setting inland transport prices, in a way that would also benefit users.

TACA had also suggested making a better use of rail links and inland waterways - a goal dear to the
Commission's heart.

"We want door-to-door transport services, but we don't want a totally fixed price service by liner conferences covering inland transport," Welsh said.

EU rules allow liner conferences to set reference prices on maritime transport, but ban the extension of this practice to inland transport unless it brings benefits for customers.

HD       EDITORIAL - Urge to merge. WC      766 words

IDEAS that would once have been seen as heretical in the classification society world are becoming more widely accepted, judging by remarks made this week by Frank Iarossi, the American Bureau of Shipping chairman. While the level-headed folk in the sector have not yet succumbed to merger mania or flotation fever, it seems that the case for change is gathering pace.

With the advent of such developments as the International Safety Management code, ISO 9000 and the newly-developed ISO 1400 environmental standard, the role of class is arguably more important than ever before. Yet the sector has a serious image problem and its very efficacity is the subject of a persistent whispering campaign.

TD
If shipping safety is not all it might be, blame those at the sharp end, or so the erroneous logic
sometimes seems to run. Some insurers have been overtly critical, arguing that the societies are paid by
the shipowners and that this causes a conflict of interest.

Modernisation is long overdue. In any case, for the organisations themselves, remaining largely beholden to traditional classification as a source of revenue is no longer a viable option, as Mr Iarossi rightly argued.

Already, the major classification societies devote much of their time and energy to the worthy task of promoting safety offshore, in shorebased engineering and wider industry.

France's Bureau Veritas has gone so far down this road that only a relatively small proportion of its overall revenue is actually derived from marine classification activities. Quite logically, BV has openly stated that it will consider a listing on the Paris bourse sometime next year if the market remains strong.

That would be a revolutionary step which cuts against the traditional ethos of classification societies as non-profit distribution organisations, often with charitable status. Even if classification societies are de facto major businesses with turnovers to match, seeking a stock market quotation will obviously not be to everybody's taste.

The major alternative is diversification and commercial ventures - such as the new and promising ABS Nautical Systems software house - to broaden what would otherwise remain a niche business.

It is also likely to mean consolidation among the societies themselves, perhaps starting with the smaller players but inevitably extending to the larger ones too. Lloyd's Register chairman Patrick O'Ferrall dropped some intriguing hints on this score earlier this year.

The existing plethora of class societies - sometimes offering differing standards - is not doing the industry any good, Mr O'Ferrall said. The way forward for classification is streamlining, he argued, by which he made it clear that he meant fewer - but stronger and ultimately more effective - classification societies.

His comments dovetail with Mr Iarossi's belief that the next five years will bring about a spate of mergers in the sector. With each major classification society currently very much indentified by nationality, this in itself will constitute a massive wrench with the past.

That is the way of the world. What was once the automatic tendency of shipowners to fly the national flag and sign up with the national classification society has long been consigned to history.

Page 103 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So why not the rise of the world's first multinational classification society, acting to ensure the highest attainable safety standards in the world's first global industry? The economies of scale and the advantages of truly global reach should be apparent for all to see. Like all the best marriages, selected mergers could become more than the sum of their parts.

Taca trouble

PUNISHMENT should fit the crime, they say, but let us make sure there is a crime first. The European Commission has announced some hefty  fines for member lines of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement,  for abuse of a dominant market position, and for limiting competition on their sealanes.
The lines will appeal to the  European Court against the finding of guilt by competition commissioner
Karel van Miert, and the battle could be enormously costly, taking perhaps two years of everyone's time.

If there has been serious abuse of market leadership, it has been an abject failure in terms of profits. Container lines struggle to break even, with the exception of a few specialised carriers including ACL and Canadian Pacific. Restriction of competition? Outsiders APL, Mitsui OSK, Cosco and Yang Ming entered the trades.

It is a pity the scene has to be played out in the courts, when what is needed above all is to thrash out an unambiguous framework in which international shipping and trade can thrive.

Taca members open European Court legal battle to quash $317.6m penalties.
From Nigel Tutt, Brussels and James Brewer

TD
A GROUP of the world's biggest container lines have launched an immediate fightback against the European Commission after being  fined a total of Ecu273m ($317.6m) for anti-trust offences, including a price-fixing cartel.

Members of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) will urge the European Court to quash the penalties, in a legal battle expected to drag on for another two years.

Olav Rakkenes,  Taca chairman, declared: "We have the right to defend ourselves and certainly will do so by taking it to the court to get annulment and suspension."
The commission's fines include Ecu27.5m ($32m) each on AP Mller's Maersk Line and US operator
Sea-Land, and Ecu41.26m ($48m) on P&O Nedlloyd, which formerly operated as two independent lines.

A senior source within one of the affected operators suggested that the lines are likely to post a bank guarantee for the money, rather than handover the cash during an appeal process they are confident of winning.

Shipping leaders were disappointed that Brussels announced such substantial penalties - although more modest than hinted earlier - at a time when talks are underway on a future framework for the conference system.

Competition commissioner Karel van Miert is optimistic a basis for a long-term solution will soon be in place and that "further conflict can be avoided", said a statement.

The commission said: "In recent months, highly constructive discusssions have been taking place both at a high level and at the working level."

Mr Rakkenes commented: "Going forward, we do not want to have to spend our time fighting. We just want to survive."

The commission said its view was that "the behaviour of the  Taca parties, and of the TransAtlantic Agreement  [the predecessor body] parties before them, has been very different from that of a traditional conference.

"This has been revealed not only in the practices intended to ensure a very high degree of discipline between the  Taca parties but also in the methods adopted to extend the scope of the  Taca beyond the shipping lines which are usually members of a conference."

The commission said that in 1994,  Taca held a 60% share of the transatlantic market for transport of containers, and in 1995 transported 1.3m teu.

The commission found that  Taca did not qualify for the competition clearance it applied for in 1994 and that the members abused their joint dominant position.


Page 105 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It defined the abuse as the way  Taca lines restricted the availability of individual service contracts, and their active discouragement of independent market entry by potential competitors.

The commission found that  Taca members agreed a number of anti-competitive agreements, including fixing prices for provision of maritime transport services between north  Europe and the US.

Other anti-competititive agreements included price-fixing on inland transport services inside the EU, conditions for service contracts with shippers, and fixing of prices paid to freight forwarders. Of the four allegedly anti-competitive agreements, only the first on transatlantic shipping services qualified for clearance under EU competition rules covering shipping conferences, the  commission said.

On preventing market entry, the  commission said Taca members agreed that non-traditional conference lines which joined Taca were allowed to charge a lower rate in service contracts than traditional conference members.

"The purpose and effect of the  Taca's agreement to enter into dual rate service contracts was to limit competition from independent shipowners by bringing them inside the conference," it said.
The commission said Taca and its predecessor increased prices by more than 80% between 1993 and
1995, according to the European Shippers Council.

The US Federal Maritime  Commission estimated price increases announced by  Taca for 1995 would have meant an additional cost to shippers of $65m to $75m over 1994 levels.

The commission may decide to impose fines at a later date on price agreements relating to inland transport services supplied inside the EU.

The commission said Taca lines' restrictions on individual customers entering service contracts with individual shipping lines was the biggest source of complaints by shippers.

Genuine service contracts should be encouraged to improve the supply chain from manufacturer to consumer, and EU manufacturers have emphasised to the  commission their need for tailor-made services.

Mr Rakkenes said: "The activities to which the  commission objects are permitted under  European law and are accepted by all developed seafaring nations, notably the US."

Van Miert: optimisticRakkenes: survival moveP&O chairman Lord Sterling said the  commission's complaint was based on the suggestion of the lines holding a dominant position. "If anyone has been in a dominant position, it is the shippers," he said. The way forward was to create a climate in which everyone understood the situation and to allow shipping companies to get on with the job of transporting goods efficiently. "This is precisely what the lines have been working towards with the  commission."

The record fines imposed this week on 15 shipping lines for price-fixing abuses could not have come at a worse time for an industry attempting to cope with turbulence in its Asian business.

The decline in Asian imports and rise in exports have made it more difficult for shippers to balance their schedules and boosted the costs of repositioning their container "boxes". While outbound freight rates from Asia have risen, inbound rates have fallen.

TD
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&O, says his main concern was for the impact of the  European                   Commission's fines on the balance sheets of the smaller members of the TransAtlantic Conference Agreement.  But even the larger container lines have come under pressure in recent months.

Neptune Orient Lines, the Singaporean carrier, this week forecast a loss in 1998 while P&O Nedlloyd last month announced a 39% fall in second quarter profits "as a direct result of the crisis in Asia".

The container shipping lines which serve the north Atlantic have been under fire from their customers, the shippers, ever since they put in place an  agreement to regulate rates and capacity in September
1992.
The Trans Atlantic  Agreement  (TAA), as it was then known, covered 85% of sailings across the north
Atlantic and pushed up rates by up to 100%.
The shipping lines argued that the TAA was essential to stem their ruinous losses. On some trades
rates had fallen by 50% and in the four years to 1993, when TAA started to make an impact, total losses
on the north Atlantic routes reached an estimated $650m.
The shippers attacked the TAA as an illegal cartel and said shipowners were overstating their losses. In legal terms, the dispute which has continued for the past five years has centred on conflicting
interpretations of  European regulation 4056, which exempts liner "conferences" from competition rules.

In practical terms it has centred on objections by Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, to the shipping lines quoting inclusive rates for the sea and land parts of a journey; to the  agreement's control of capacity as well as rates; and to clauses in the  agreement which allow members to charge
differential rates, in contravention of the normal rules.

Under pressure from the  Commission, the shipping lines came up with compromise proposals and a new agreement - TACA - in 1994 which dropped the constraint on capacity. This did not stop the Commission outlawing the TAA in October 1994, however.

A further sign that the  Commission was determined to roll back the scope of conferences became evident in March 1995 when the 14 members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference were each  fined a "symbolic" ECU 10,000 ($10,900) for fixing prices for the land part of journeys.

The shippers are jubilant that their long campaign against the two north Atlantic conferences appears to have been successful although  TACA has said it will appeal. Lord Sterling, P&O chairman, forecast a

long battle "which only the lawyers will win". Attempts to negotiate a deal with the  Commission will continue.

Regardless of the outcome of the legal battle, the traditional conference system appears to have had its day.

In recent years the container lines have opted for a system of looser "alliances", which do not include price-fixing agreements.

But even alliances can be clumsy and some companies have preferred outright mergers to gain economies of scale.

Whether these tactics will overcome the chronic overcapacity which has kept returns low in the container sector remains to be seen.

PORT TO BUY SDG&E CHULA VISTA, CALIF. POWER PLANT.

SAN DIEGO - San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E), a unit of Sempra Energy, announced Thursday an agreement to sell its 693-megawatt (MW) South Bay power plant to the San Diego Unified Port District. Under the memorandum of understanding, the purchase of the plant, which can by fuelled by either
natural gas or oil, will be financed through the issuance of revenue bonds by the Port District of $112 million. Additionally, SDG&E will donate any excess value of the plant, plus nearly 200 acres of land, including the plant site. This charitable donation, potentially worth $50 million or more, will be valued by an independent appraisal and will create a substantial tax benefit, the utility said. The South Bay plant has been designated a "must-run" generating facility by California's Independent System Operator, the state's centralized control centre for electricity transmission.

EUROPEAN SHIPPERS WELCOME EU  TACA FINES.

BRUSSELS - European exporters on Thursday welcomed the  European Commission's decision to impose record fines on members of the  TACA shipping group, saying they hoped this would allow transatlantic container trade to be priced more fairly. The European Shippers' Council (ESC) has complained for years that the  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) had abused its market power by fixing prices and restricting members from entering into individual service contracts. "The  TACA has been able to completely control the terms and conditions and prices relating to service contracts," ESC director Chris Welsh told Reuters in an interview. ESC represents national associations of users of freight transport services, while  TACA groups shipping heavyweights like A.P. Moeller's Maersk, P&O Nedlloyd and Sea-Land Inc.

KINNOCK STARTS GREEK VISIT WITH SHIPPING ON AGENDA.

PIRAEUS -  European Union Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock began an official two-day visit to Greece on Thursday with the issue of cabotage on his list of priorities. Kinnock has scheduled a meeting with Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis as well as with representatives of the Union of Greek Shipowners and Union of Passenger Shipowners. Under EU cabotage restrictions, only Greek vessels are allowed to operate on coastal passenger and cargo routes originating in one Greek port and ending in another. However the restrictions end for cruiseships next year and for coastal shipping from 2004 to
make way for EU-wide transport deregulation.

RUSSIA'S OIL PORT NOVOROSSIISK REOPENS AFTER STORM.

LONDON - Russian oil outlet Novorossiisk reopened on Thursday morning after closing for bad weather, a shipping company said. The Black Sea terminal opened at 0840 local time. Intermittent closures meant only a 51,000 tonne cargo of Urals crude and a 25,610 cargo of fuel oil loaded on Wednesday. Other
Black Sea outlets for Russian oil, Batumi, Tuapse and Ukraine's Odessa were all operating normally. Latvia's Baltic terminal Ventspils also was open.

LATIN AMERICA'S SHENZHEN FLOURISHES IN THE WILDERNESS.

The port of Iquique, developed from wilderness on the edge of the Chilean desert, was an unlikely place for an economic phenomenon when construction started two decades ago. It never rains and the barren landscape can barely support the hardiest of bushes. But these days it is Chile's boom town and Hong Kong investors are flocking to the city, nicknamed "Latin America's Shenzhen". The attraction is not the climate, obviously, although being located beside a desert, Iquique does boast some impressive beaches.

STOCKHOLM - Swedish ferry operator Stena Lines said on Thursday that traffic developments over the summer had been weak. "Summer traffic was like the weather," company spokesman Goran Ekstedt told Reuters. The traffic figures have already been compiled but will be revised in connection with the company's nine month report that is due out on October 28. Stena Line will also then present measures to cut costs and improve profitability.

Minoan Lines, Greece's largest ferry operator, has ordered two ferries from Italy's Fincantieri for about US$260 million. The high-speed vessels, to be delivered by July 2001, will increase Minoan's fleet of car and passenger ferries to 16 and help it meet competition from rival Attica Enterprises. Attica ordered four high-speed vessels from a Finish shipyard in March to double its own high-speed fleet by 2001.

TWO MARITIME GROUPS LAMBASTE MOVE TO LIMIT LIABILITY ON PANAMA CANAL.

PANAMA CITY - Two maritime industry groups are criticizing a move by the Panama Canal  Commission to limit its liability for damage to ships as a "penny-pinching device" that sends "completely the wrong signal." The International Chamber of Shipping and the Union of Canal Pilots say they are concerned about the implications of the proposal as the United States prepares to hand the waterway over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. "If the master of the ship knows the  commission is no longer going to be responsible for damages, then the master is, of course, going to intervene in whatever action the pilot is taking to navigate the vessel.

PATRICKS PAY OUT WHARFIES.

WATERFRONT workers yesterday received their first redundancy cheques from the Patricks dispute. The first of $90 million to be handed to 726 Patrick stevedores' wharfies as part of a negotiated settlement to the docks dispute were passed on in the Sydney offices of administrator Grant Thornton. The Maritime Union of Australia requested that the cheques be handed over in private. "The MUA wished to preserve the dignity of its members who have completed long service with Patrick," MUA official Glen Wood said.

LONDON - The  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  has rejected the decision of the  European     Commission to impose fines on the 13-carrier group for anti-competitive behavior.

TD
A TACA statement issued on Wednesday says the activities to which the  commission objects are permitted under  European law and are accepted by all developed seafaring nations, notably the United States.

The statement, issued by TACA Chairman Olav Rakkenes, also says that the  commission's decision to impose $318 million in fines is based on numerous errors of fact, procedure and law, and that it will be appealed to the European Court for annulment and suspension.

The commission cannot impose fines on activities related to service contracts, as they have previously been notified to the commission, Mr. Rakkenes said.
"The commission's decision is part of its continuing attempt to limit the scope of liner conferences,"
Mr. Rakkenes said. "These are explicitly recognized under Regulation 4056, which was adopted by the
European Council in 1986."

He added that  TACA's activities are "in keeping with the laws of all other developed seafaring nations, which allow for liner conferences, recognizing their importance to stabilizing the trade on which they operate."

TACA's full rebuttal to the EU decision is available on the Internet at  www.joc.com

Agreement  accused of abusing dominant position by restricting individual service contracts. The European Commission has fined 15 Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) cartel members a total of 272.94 million ecu (about HK$2.44 billion) for breaching anti-competitive agreements of the EC Treaty.

Denmark's Maersk Line was  fined 27.5 million ecu, Sea-Land of the US 27.5 million, Anglo-Dutch P&O Nedlloyd 41.26 million, Hong Kong's OOCL 20.63 million, Japan's NYK 20.63 million, South Korea's Hanjin 20.63 million, Germany's Hapag Lloyd 20.63 million and Korea's Hyundai 18.56 million.

TD
Switzerland's MSC was  fined 13.75 million ecu, Germany's and Korea's DSR/ Senator lines 13.75 million, Singapore's NOL 13.75 million, Korea's Cho Yang 13.75 million, Mexico's TMM/Tecomar
6.88 million, Sweden's ACL 6.88 million and Poland POL 6.88 million.
The P&O Nedlloyd  fine reflected that the infringements took place before the merger of P&O and
Nedlloyd. NOL and Hanjin are no longer members of  Taca.

The commission may decide to impose fines at a later date on the price  agreement related to inland transport services within the EU.

It said Taca members, which had applied for exemption from Article 85(3) of the EC Treaty in 1994, had a joint market share in excess of 60 per cent. In 1995,  Taca carried more than 1.3 million teu (20 ft equivalent units) to northern  Europe and the US.

The commission found that  Taca did not qualify for an exemption under EU rules on shipping conferences.

It also found  Taca members had abused their dominant position by restricting the availability of individual service contracts and by actively discouraging market entry by potential competitors.

Acting on a proposal from EC Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, the  commission found the Taca parties entered into agreements which infringed anti-competitive agreements set out in Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty.

Under these agreements, the Taca parties fixed prices for the provision of maritime transport services between northern Europe and the US.
They also fixed prices they charged for the provision of inland transport services supplied within the
EC.

The members had agreed on the terms and conditions which they entered into service contracts with shippers besides fixing the prices they paid to freight forwarders.

The commission said only the first of these agreements fell within group exemption and therefore it had refused individual exemption for the remaining three agreements. In its decision, the commission also found Taca parties, which had a joint dominant position, had abused that position in two ways.

Page 114 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Firstly, the  Taca members had imposed two forms of restrictions on the availability of service contracts.

Individual service contracts were banned by the  Taca parties in 1995 and even after 1995 all contracts were available only with highly restrictive conditions.

Secondly, the  Taca parties had induced competitors to join  Taca and had altered the market's competitive structure.

The commission said the agreement to enter dual rate service contracts was aimed at limiting competition from independent owners by bringing them into the conference.

The seriousness of the second infringement came about partly because of the importance of potential competition in liner shipping markets.

The commission said the fines had been calculated based on the  commission's published guidelines.
The commission said the behaviour of the  Taca parties, and the TAA (Trans-Atlantic  Agreement)
parties before them, had differed from a traditional conference.

This had been revealed not only in the practices intended to ensure a high degree of discipline between the  Taca parties, but also in the methods adopted to extend the scope of  Taca beyond the shipping lines which usually were members of a conference to include a number of shipping lines which did not usually operate as conference members.

The commission considered that elimination of potential competition and alteration of the competitive structure of the market was a serious infringement of Article 86. It said its decision addressed steps taken by the  Taca parties to induce potential competitors to enter the market as parties to  Taca.

It did not address the ability of conferences to admit new members on the same terms as existing members or the exchange of information necessary for activities falling within group exemption. The commission said its decision did not mark any change in policy towards traditional conferences.
It hoped its decision reflected the end of a long dispute between shipowners, customers and the
commission.

Taca is the successor agreement to the TAA, an  agreement which originally was notified to the commission in 1992. The commission adopted a formal negative decision prohibiting the TAA in October 1994.  Taca came into effect on the abandonment of the TAA.
The number of members of the TAA and then  Taca has risen from 11 in 1992 to a high of 17 in 1996. Together, the  commission has estimated that the price increases announced by  Taca for 1995
would have meant an additional cost to shippers of US$65 to $75 million, when compared with 1994
prices.

In addition to seeking to eliminate price competition, the  Taca parties also have sought to prevent competition on service quality.

One way of achieving this has been by placing restrictions on individual customers from entering into service contracts (a contract for the carriage of a certain quantity of goods over a fixed period) with individual lines.

The restrictions on the availability of individual service contracts constitute the biggest source of complaints by shippers against  Taca.

[SINGAPORE] Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) is reported to have been slapped with a US$16 million (S$27.6 million)  fine by the European Commission (EC) as part of US$318 million in  fines levelled against a group of shipping lines for unfair competition practices.

In a record fine by the European Union's anti-trust authority, the EC said that the 15 companies that make up the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca) were guilty of price fixing and had abused their dominant position in the North Atlantic container transport market.

The EC also warned that they could be  fined again for doing the same on overland routes in  Europe.

Worst hit by the ruling was Anglo-Dutch giant P&O Nedlloyd which was  fined US$48 million, formerly two independent lines, followed by A P Moller's Maersk Line and its alliance partner Sea-Land with US$32 million each.

Taca members reacted quickly, firmly rejecting the decision and pledging to appeal against it in the
European Court.

Taca chairman Olav Rakkenes in a statement said: "The decision is based on numerous errors of fact, procedure and law and will be appealed to the  European Court for annulment and suspension."

NOL was just one of six Asian lines hit by the  fines with Overseas Orient Container Line (OOCL), NYK Line, and Hanjin Shipping all  fined US$24 million each, Hyundai Merchant Marine, US$21.6 million and Cho Yang Shipping, US$16 million.
NOL is no longer a member of  Taca. It was a member of the group between 1994 and 1997. South
Korea's Hanjin has also quit the conference.

The Commission found that  Taca members had made a number of anti-competitive agreements including price fixing on maritime transport services between North  Europe and the US.
The EC said that  Taca and its predecessor had increased prices by more than 80 per cent between
1993 and 1995. The US Federal Maritime  Commission (FMC) estimated that  Taca price increases in
1995 cost shippers an additional US$65 million to US$75 million over 1994 levels.
The Commission said that  Taca members controlled 60 per cent of the trade in 1995.

Hitting back, Taca's Mr Rakkenes said: "The activities to which the  Commission objects are permitted under European law and are accepted by all developed seafaring nations, notably the US."

The EC has been fighting  Taca for nearly 10 years over complaints from shippers that it fixes freight and other rates, prevents individual service contracts and prevents independent shipowners from entering the market.
For its part Taca said that member lines had "consistently sought" to reach accommodation with the
Commission, and "demonstrated a willingness" to modernise the conference system.

The companies have about two months to pay the  fines. They could ask the EU court to suspend payment until it rules on the appeals which may take up to two years. NOL said yesterday that it has

NEPTUNE Orient Lines (NOL) has been  fined 13.75 million ECUs (S$27.8 million) by the European Commission after being named as a member of an illegal cartel that sought control over land transport tariffs.

The commission on Wednesday levied  fines totalling a record 273 million ECUs (European Currency Units) on 15 shipping lines, including NOL, belonging to the Transatlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca), which it alleged operated a virtual cartel on land transport tariffs.

TD
In response, NOL yesterday said it had not received an official notification from the commission.
In any case, it said that counsel for  Taca - which intends to appeal against the fines - would act on
behalf of all the members involved in this matter.

It said that during the period it was a member of Taca - between 1994 and last year - its market share in the North  Europe-US trades operated by Taca members was a mere 0.1 per cent.

The commission has accused Taca members of not respecting  European Union competition laws through a pricing agreement on the land transport of goods and by exchanging information on empty containers.

Market observers said these practices were detrimental to consumers as it discouraged competition from independent shipping companies.

Taca is made up of most of the world's major shipping lines including AP Moeller Maersk, US' Sea
Land Service Inc, PO Nedlloyd and Orient Overseas Container Line.

Brussels, 17/09/1998 (Agence  Europe) - As briefly announced yesterday, the Ecu 273 million fine that the European Commission has decided to inflict on the members of the TransAtlantic Conference Agreement sanctions a dual infringement of Article 86 of the EEC Treaty. The sixteen signatory companies have
indeed abused their collective dominant position by limiting the availability of individual service contracts
and by actively discouraging the independent entry onto the market of potential competitors. In addition, the
TACA represented a prohibited concerted  agreement under Article 85 (1), without meeting the conditions
to be exempted from the ban.When examining the request for exemption, lodged in 1994 under Article
85(3), the  Commission noted that the parties together held a considerable market share exceeding 60%.

TD
In 1995, these companies thus carried over 1.3 million twenty foot equivalent units between Northern Europe and the United States, shipping containerised cargo for third parties. In the framework of their agreements, they: i) fixed the price they charge for the provision of maritime transport services between North Europe and the US; ii) fixed the prices they charge for the provision on inland transport services supplied within the territory of the Community; iii) agreed the terms and conditions on and under which they may enter into service contracts with shippers, and; iv) fixed the prices they pay to freight forwarders. Only one of these agreements, the first, falls within the scope of the group exemption for liner shipping conferences.In addition, the  Commission's decision establishes that the parties to the  TACA were in a collective dominant position and that they had doubly abused the situation: 1) by imposing two sorts of restrictions on the availability of service contracts (these contracts were openly banned in 1995 by the members of the  TACA and were only available, even thereafter, on the basis of extremely restrictive conditions); 2) by inciting potential rivals to join the  TACA, by that altering the competitive structure of the market in different ways, notably by agreeing that shipping line companies that were not traditional members of the  TACA be authorised to apply to service contracts prices lower than those practised by the traditional members of the conference; by thus setting up dual-rate service contracts, the aim and effect of the agreement was to limit competition on the part of independent shippers by incorporating them in the conference. The seriousness of the second infringement resides in part in the importance of the potential competition on shipping line markets. The fines inflicted on the parties for these two infringements have
been calculated on the basis of the Commission's guidelines concerning the imposition of fines, published last January. It may yet decide at a later stage to inflict  fines regarding the price agreement on land transport services provided within the Union.The spokesperson stressed that the Commission's decision makes no change to its policy regarding traditional shipping conferences. Indeed, it transpires that the conduct of the parties to the  TACA (the successor of the TAA, Conference banned in 1994) was very different to that of a traditional conference, as demonstrated not only by the practices intended to ensure a very high degree of discipline between parties, but also the methods adopted to extend the scope of the TACA beyond the usual shipping companies members of a conference and thus include several shipping companies that are not formally part of it. The  Commission's decision attacks, in particular, measures
taken by the parties to the  TACA to incite potential competitors to enter the market as members of their conference. It therefore neither deals with nor prejudges in any way the ability of shipping conferences, whose activities come within the scope of group exemptions, to admit new members on the same basis as the old ones, and neither the ability of members of such conferences to exchange the information necessary for the activities under the group exemption.It is to be hoped that the adoption of this decision marks the end of a long-standing dispute between, on the one hand, shipping companies and their clients,
and, on the other, the  Commission, the spokesperson also stressed. He confirmed that "very constructive" talks had been taking place over the past few months, at high and operational level, but that it was still too

early to conclude that they would lead to a final  agreement on all these subjects. Commissioner Karel van Miert is nevertheless optimistic regarding the fact that the foundations of a favourable solution would soon be in place, thereby allowing for later conflicts to be avoided.The sixteen companies subjected to this  fine are as follows: Maersk (Denmark) Ecu 27.5 million; Seaa-Land (USA), 27.5 million; P&O Nedlloyd (UK/Netherlands) 41.26 million); OOCL (Hong Kong), NYK (Japan), Hanjin (Korea) aand Hapag Lloyd (Germany) 20.63 each; Hyundai (Korea) 18.56 million); MSC (Switzerland), DSR/Senator (Germany and Korea), Nol (Singapore) and Cho Yang (Korea) 13.75 million each; TMM/Tecomar (Mexico), ACL (Sweden) and POL (Poland) 6.88 million each.The total amount is Ecu 271.94 million. NOL and Hanjin left the  TACA before the  Commission's decision.

EU/Federalism/Brittan

BRUSSELS - European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said on Thursday that a drive for a federal Europe had passed its peak and  European Union institutions would not be changed in future just for the sake of more integration. "It is now, I hope, clear to all observers of the EU that the high water mark of federalist, unifying aspirations has passed," Brittan said, in a lecture in London given annually in memory of Jean Monnet, whose idea led to the creation of a forerunner of the EU.
- - - - EU/Albania
ATHENS -  European countries are considering sending a high-level ministerial delegation to Albania in the next few days to seek ways to end the internal violence in the Balkan nation, Greece said on Thursday. Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou said it was possible that ministers from Austria, Greece, Poland and Italy, representing various  European institutions, could make a crisis trip as early as this weekend.
- - - - EU/Russia/troika
MOSCOW - A "troika" of  European ministers made a flying visit to Moscow on Thursday and said they had been reassured Russia's new government would honour its debts and not turn its back on reform. "We have the impression that the Russian government has absolutely no intention to engage the reverse gear in any shape or form," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told a news conference with colleagues from Austria and Britain.

EMU/public support

BRUSSELS - Support for Europe's single currency has soared this year as its launch date draws nearer, according to a European Commission survey, which shows that even in eurosceptic Britain there is no longer a majority against. The Commission said on Thursday support for Europe's single currency had shot up to 60 percent in the 15-nation European Union, the highest level since it started surveying public opinion in 1993.

THE HAGUE - The  European Union's Hague-based police agency,  Europol,  expects a sharp expansion in its efforts to fight crime after it obtains formal legal status on October 1, with a new target being terrorism. "The next step, already more or less decided, is terrorism," said Juergen Storbeck, Europol  coordinator, adding that plans were expected to become concrete as early as next January.
- - - - EU/trade/cotton
BRUSSELS - The  European Commission was on Thursday "trying to find a way out" after a majority of
European Union governments opposed its call for anti-dumping duties on unbleached cotton fabrics
from five developing countries.

BRUSSELS - The  European Union's executive body said on Thursday it was launching a probe of whether stainless steel heavy plates from Slovenia and South Africa were being dumped on the European market.
- - - - EU/airlines
BRUSSELS - Pilots from Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS), Germany's Lufthansa and United Airlines (UAL) of the U.S. urged the  European Commission on Thursday to reconsider conditions aimed at increasing competition on certain routes between the U.S. and  Europe, saying they would lead to huge job losses.
- - - - EU/trade/data
BRUSSELS - The  European Union had a trade surplus with the rest of the world of 2.9 billion Ecu ($3.4 billion) in May, down from a 4.4 billion Ecu surplus in May last year.
- - - - EU/shipping
BRUSSELS - European exporters on Thursday welcomed the  European Commission's decision to impose record fines on members of the  TACA shipping group, saying they hoped this would allow transatlantic container trade to be priced more fairly. The European Shippers' Council (ESC) has complained for years that the  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) had abused its market power by fixing prices and restricting members from entering into individual service contracts.

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission said on Thursday a suspected fraud against the  European Union humanitarian aid budget had cost it around 500,000 Ecus and not up to 2.4 million Ecus ($2.6 million) as earlier thought. REUTERS.

Lobbying reduced Taca fines
From Nigel Tutt, Brussels

TD
THE European Commission's decision to impose only Ecu273m ($317.6m)  fines on 15 shipping lines in the TransAtlantic Conference  Agreement  follows intense lobbying among member states and inside the commission itself to reduce earlier plans for a Ecu500m package.

Aides to transport commissioner Neil Kinnock have stressed his efforts in curbing the excess of competition commissioner Karel van Miert, who originally proposed near Ecu500m. Mr Kinnock wants to encourage talks on a solution for  Taca in the future and to prevent years of legal cases.

"The fines are half what they might have been," said a Kinnock aide. "Mr van Miert is in the lead on this case but we worked very hard to convince them that the case was not 'very serious', but 'serious'. We did that in order to get these talks off the ground because that is vital for the maritime industry.

"We feel the  fines are not as crippling as if Mr van Miert had had a free rein. The total has come down from Ecu500m to a maximum of Ecu290m," the aide said, speaking just before Wednesday's final decision.
Mr Kinnock was keen to emphasise how important shipping conferences were and that much of Mr van
Miert's case involved past misdemeanours.
Mr Kinnock believed that the tripartite talks between  commission, shipowners and shippers were
'looking quite good' and must be given a chance.

But Mr Kinnock has not been alone in lobbying inside the  commission. Ritt Bjerregaard, the environment commissioner from Denmark, has been pressing behind the scenes for lower  fines. Indeed it was her efforts that delayed the decision from the planned July to mid-September.

A Bjerregaard aide said: "I know that a Danish company (Maersk) is involved but we have been very open and transparent and I understand discussions are going on on how the situation can be rectified in the long-run, and that would depend on whether companies would want to appeal."

Ms Bjerregaard has also felt that the  Taca infringements were 'serious' rather than 'very serious', especially because Taca originally notified its arrangements to the commission for a competition clearance. She has wanted a "fair and well-balanced" decision on fines, an aide said.

"First of all it is quite clear you are not talking about a monopoly.  Taca has a 50% market share, which is not a monopoly, and it has a reducing market share. Its profits are going down," he said, noting how an effective cartel should be boosting its profits from its monopoly position.

The pressure for lower  fines inside the commission mirrors that among member states since they were told of Mr van Miert's plans this Spring.

Many queried the high level of  fines and particularly the way that EU rules prevented the smaller lines receiving smallerfines.


Page 124 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The package of  fines is close to the record levied on a similar number of cement producers for running a price-fixing and market-sharing cartel in that sector. However  fines on individual Taca members are well below the Ecu100m imposed on Volkswagen, an individual company record.

l Tony Santamera, national shipping officer of UK ratings union RMT, says that P&O Nedlloyd had long foreseen the  fine, and that this was one of the reasons behind the company's recent decision to sack
330 British and New Zealand seafarers and replace them with low cost Filipino employees, writes David
Osler.

"We are alarmed by the enormousness of the  fine and the effect it has had on our members," he said yesterday.

"Some #29m ($48.8m), on a fair guess, is probably about five years' pay bill for our people employed there."

The anticipated two year legal battle would also greatly increase the final costs, Mr Santamera added.Kinnock: major roleVan Miert: reined back.

HD    COMPETITION/SHIPPING - COMMISSION SINGLES OUT TACA MEMBERS FOR FINES. WC   439 words
PD    19 September 1998
SN    European Report

CY    (c) 1998 European Report.

LP
The European Commission adopted a Decision on September 16 to impose a batch of  fines on shipping firms party to the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA). After a lengthy inquiry, the Commission found that the TACA did not qualify for an exemption under EU rules on liner shipping conferences parties. It also found that the  TACA members have abused their joint dominant position by restricting the availability of individual service contracts and by actively discouraging independent market entry by potential competitors.  Fines for these two breaches of Article 86 of the EC Treaty total ECU
273m. The Commission has taken a tough stance on  TACA for some years now. Back in 1994, it said the Agreement  breached competition rules and did not qualify for block exemption as it did not bring sufficient benefits to users.

TD
Members of the  TACA applied in 1994 for an exemption from EU rules on restrictive business practices (Article 85@3 of the EC Treaty). Only one of four price-fixing agreements reached by the member companies on the provision of shipping services between Northern  Europe and the United States, is likely to enjoy a block exemption from competition rules, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation
4056/86/EEC. The other agreements, on the provision of inland transport services supplied within the territory of the Community, the conclusion of service contracts with shippers and prices applicable to freight forwarders, come with the scope of anti-competitive agreements, as defined in Article 85@1 of the EU Treaty.

In its September 16 Decision, the  Commission also finds that the  TACA parties have been in a joint dominant position and that they have abused that joint dominant position in two ways. First, by imposing two kinds of restrictions on the availability of service contracts. Individual service contracts were openly banned by the TACA parties in 1995 and even after 1995 all service contracts were only available on the basis of highly restrictive conditions. Second, the TACA parties have abused that joint dominant position by inducing potential competitors to join the TACA.

The TACA is the successor agreement to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  (TAA), an  agreement which was originally notified to the Commission in 1992. The Commission adopted a formal negative decision prohibiting the TAA in October 1994. Its overall market share is in excess of 60%. Its aim is to prevent
price competition between cartel members. The upshot is prices higher (80% according to the  European
Shippers' Council) than they should have been and significant restrictions on the provision of services.

From Nigel Tutt, Brussels
Shipping lines in the TransAtlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) could face further anti-trust  fines
over rate-fixing on inland transport legs, the European Commission has warned.

TD
A spokesman was commenting on the  commission's decision on Wednesday to levy Ecu273m ($317.6m) in fines on 16 shipping lines, including AP Moeller's Maersk, P&O Nedlloyd and Hapag-Lloyd.
The commission will wait to see whether a European Union court judgment on inland rate-fixing by
Taca's predecessor, the TransAtlantic Agreement,  goes in its favour before taking a decision, he said.

The amount of any further  fines will partly depend on the court judgment, he added, without being able to say when the judgment is scheduled.
This week's  fines are a record package on a cartel, and beat the previous record set in 1994 of
Ecu258m imposed on a cement cartel.

However, the Maersk  fine represents 0.7% of its sales while the P&O Nedlloyd  fine is 0.9% of its sales, against the maximum of 10% of sales that can be levied for anti-trust offences by the commission.

The spokesman declined to give details on the talks being held with shipping lines and shippers on a longer-term solution to  Taca and shipping liner conferences in general.

"We are going through the practices of  Taca and the liner industry to see where we can be more precise and where issues are not covered by the exemption (competition rules on conferences) in a non-contentious way," he said.

He added: "The purpose of the exercise is for them not to find out that when they do notify something they are then surprised to be  fined. It is fair to say the exemption is not as specific as it could be."

While Taca has offered to change its inland rate-fixing, there have been no changes made to deal with the lack of scope for shippers to negotiate contracts with individual members of  Taca.

Meanwhile, the  European Shippers Council said the  commission's decision "vindicated" the formal complaints it has made against  Taca and TAA over the last six years.

Council secretary general Chris Welsh hoped the decision would "close the door to an era of unlawful shipping cartels" and lead to an  agreement on shipping industry practices.

The Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca) has strongly rejected the European Commission's decision to impose 272.94 million ecu (about HK$2.45 billion) in fines on its 15 members for alleged anti-competitive practices.
"The decision is based on numerous errors of fact, procedure and law and will be appealed to the
European Court for annulment and suspension,"  Taca chairman Olav Rakkenes said.

TD
The activities to which the  commission objected were permitted under  European law and were accepted by all developed seafaring nations, he said.

Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, a member of  Taca, was fined 20.63 million ecu. Anglo-Dutch P&O Nedlloyd received the most severe  fine of 41.26 million ecu, followed by Denmark's Maersk Line with 27.5 million ecu.
In its landmark decision, the  commission said fines might be imposed later on the price
agreement related to inland transport services within the  European Union.

It said Taca and its predecessor had increased prices by more than 80 per cent between 1993 and 1995.

A Business Times report in Singapore said the US Federal Maritime  Commission estimated that Taca price increases in 1995 compared with 1994 levels cost shippers an additional US$65 million to $75 million.

Mr Rakkenes said Taca member lines consistently had sought to reach an accommodation with the EC and had demonstrated a willingness to modernise the conference system.

Taca members, who have about two months to pay the  fines, may ask the European Court to suspend payment until a final ruling on this case is reached. The case could take as long as two to three years.

HD        Will Asia's shippers be forced to pay for fines imposed  by EC? BY        By David Hughes.

IT was not the happiest of weeks for Singapore's national carrier Neptune Orient Lines (NOL).

Shortly after group deputy president and deputy chief executive officer, Lim How Teck, conceded that the company would make a whole-year loss in 1998 came news that the  European Commission (EC) had fined NOL US$16 million (S$27.5 million).

TD
NOL can take some consolation from the fact that most other major carriers are also facing the possibility of having to pay the EC very substantial sums. The EC claims that the 15 companies,
including NOL, that were parties to the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) in 1994/95, were guilty of price fixing and had abused their dominant position in the North Atlantic container transport market.

On learning of the EC's ruling, German carrier DSR-Senator's marketing and sales vice-president, Eberhard Walther, came out with a strong contender for the understatement of the decade award. He was quoted as saying: "We consider the  commission's decision to be incorrect."

Sharing Mr Walther's view was P&O chairman Lord Sterling, who dismissed the idea that the lines had held a dominant position. He said: "If anyone has been in a dominant position, it is the shippers." P&O's container shipping joint venture, P&O Nedlloyd, stands to pay US$48 million, by far the most of any carrier, as the then separate P&O Containers and Nedlloyd were each  fined US$24 million.

At its half-year results news conference a few weeks ago, when the amount it would be  fined was still a matter of speculation, the Anglo-Dutch company was adamant that the company would not make provision in its accounts for any  fine. The lines should pay the  fines within a couple of months but they are hoping to get the  European Court to first suspend and then squash the payments.

P&O Nedlloyd claims to have "very strong" legal advice that the lines will win at the  European Court. Presumably, though, the EC's Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert has also had a few words with his lawyers over the past three years that this row has been going on, and the 10 years since his Competition Directorate and Atlantic carriers first locked horns. He must also feel he is on firm ground. Whatever the eventual outcome, it is likely to be some time before the court rules on the case, perhaps two years.

The whole issue provides plenty of food for thought. The first reaction of somebody who works in another conference was: "Now I suppose the lines will have to introduce an Emergency EU  Fine Surcharge." Flippant of course but the question of who really pays for such  fines, if they are upheld, is a particularly valid one.

One bitter answer to that, according to UK ratings' union official Tony Santamera, is that 330 UK and New Zealand ratings will pay with their jobs. He says the EU  fine is one of the reasons why P&O Nedlloyd is sacking those ratings and replacing them with Filipinos and he notes the amount of the  fine would pay their wages for five years. That is certainly an ironic twist to the story.

More generally however there are only two parties who can eventually pay the  fines, the lines and the shippers. If we were talking about an industry where the companies were making huge profits it would be fairly easy to make sure the lines paid.

Returning to the real world, no container shipping line is making huge profits. Rather, few are making any profits at all and NOL is hardly alone in contemplating the prospect of red ink on its accounts at the end of the year.

The fines, and the possibility of further large  fines to follow, will simply add to the pressure on lines to make more money in order to show decent returns on their huge investments. Almost all of the carriers involved are global operators. As it is, they are finding it nearly impossible to charge anything at all for taking boxes to Asia from  Europe and the US. On the other hand, ships are sailing to  Europe so full that some cargo is being shut out.

So the obvious thing to do is to take advantage of market forces and charge as much as the trade will bear on Europe and US-bound cargoes. And if the lines need to put a few million dollars away to pay for Mr van Miert's fines then, if the current market pattern continues, those dollars will come from Asia's shippers.

The European Commission made big headlines last week when it levied massive  fines on the
Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  for illegal price-fixing. It was an action worthy of note, a major
development in the long-running struggle involving the conference, shippers and the  commission.

But the more significant news is to be found away from the battlefield. It's in the fact that shippers, the conference and the  Commission's competition directorate are still engaged in top-level, top-secret discussions on what the future holds. It's in the statements of some conference members, hotly contested by other members, that fundamental changes are on the  TACA agenda. It's in shipper statements that they and carriers must work together instead of fighting. And, on this side of the Atlantic, it's in the expected passage in Congress of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act.

TD
The significant news doesn't concern famous battles, decisions or  fines. It concerns change. It is, very simply, that the time has arrived for a change in the way of doing business in the shipping industry. The day of carriers dealing with their customers through the rigid, bureaucratic framework of the conference system is drawing to a close. A new day of competition, of shippers and carriers focusing on their individual needs and requirements, is dawning.

All involved - the carriers who offer shipping services, the shippers who use them, the governments that deal with them - recognize that fact and are moving to cope with it. And all involved should press ahead with full vigor. The benefits are too great to do otherwise.

Conferences legally set shipping rates on the trade lanes they cover. They have been under attack as anti-competitive cartels since the first one was founded in 1875 in a trade lane marked by vicious rate wars as steamships competed with sailing vessels.

Shippers say the conference system drives out competition and keeps shipping rates artificially high. They say carriers, through conferences, behave greedily, dictatorially and unresponsively toward their customers.

Carriers say the conference system provides rate and service stability, keeping predatory competition from driving responsible operators out of a trade lane. They point out that, if conferences worked as their critics charge, rates would be far higher and carriers far richer than they are.
There's some truth on both sides. The conferences do indeed interfere in the workings of the
marketplace. And undoubtedly that worked to benefit both shippers and carriers at times, especially times
gone by.

But today conferences are increasingly an anachronism. Carriers and shippers alike operate in a highly automated, fiercely competitive global marketplace, one in which the ability to respond quickly and decisively is critical. They should have the ability to deal with each other on an individual basis, to negotiate individual agreements to meet individual needs.

That's what the talking is about in  Europe, and what  TACA members, other carriers and shippers are discussing among themselves. It's what shippers and carriers in other trades are thinking about. It's what the Ocean Shipping Reform Act is about. And this is the beginning of a process, not the end.

The efforts to deal with modern reality are highly positive and deserve continuing encouragement. The process won't be neat or easy.

Page 132 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The shipping world's metamorphosis into a more free-market system will be bumpy, noisy and often unsettling, and there will be winners and losers among carriers and shippers alike. Carriers and shippers both will have to get used to operating in a new environment, one that will lack not only the restrictions but also the security of the old system.

But what will emerge is a shipping industry that will be stronger, more efficient, more responsive to its customers - and better able to serve its customers and itself.

To be sure, the  TACA battle isn't over.  TACA hotly disputes the specific grounds of the EC's decision. It calls the action erroneous and unfair and is appealing its $318 million in  fines. And that's a matter for the European legal system.

For the long run, however, ruinous legal battles aren't good business for anyone but lawyers. Carriers and shippers must find a way to deal with each other rationally and responsibly, for the benefit of all concerned.

HD       US launches  probe into Pacific liner complaints. BY       By Joel Glass,Washington Correspondent

THE US Federal Maritime  Commission has launched a probe into the practices of shipping lines operating on the Pacific after a spate of complaints from shippers claiming they are suffering from unlawful practices.

The fact-finding investigation into the transpacific trades comes as the trade moves towards peak season in the run-up to Christmas and after a year which has seen the lines impose a series of cargo rate increases.

TD
"The commission has been receiving numerous reports from shippers, particularly non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC), of ocean carriers selectively refusing to provide space for cargo unless the shipper agrees various forms of carrier demands for substantial rate increases, or additional charges," a statement said.

Chairman Harold Creel Jr added: "The entire  commission is very concerned about these reports, which allege potentially unlawful activity on the part of the carriers at this peak shipping season.

"While this proceeding may ultimately result in prosecutions, our immediate aim is to put a stop to any such unlawful practices."

The five-page Order of Investigation said the  commission in recent weeks had received information and allegations that shipping companies in the eastbound transpacific trades had engaged in activities possibly "inconsistent with their obligations as common carriers" and in violation of certain prohibitions of the US Shipping Act of 1984.

These allegedly included refusals of cargo space unless the shipper agreed significantly increased rates or charges, and-or the imposition of "novel charges" such as an "additional space protection surcharge", or a "co-ntainer repositioning charge", the  commission said.

Both conference members and independents appeared to be involved, and their actions may have been taken individually or collectively.

There were "some indications" that their activities were targeted at small and medium-size shippers and NVOCCs, while large "champion accounts" were exempted from such pressures. The lines will be particularly sensitive to the new probe as it comes just a week after the European Commission imposed record fines of $317.6m on members of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca).
The Federal Maritime  Commission said: "The current situation in the

"Exacerbating this inbound cargo surplus is a significant decline in westbound shipments, causing an imbalance in cargo and in the need for carrier equipment. Nevertheless, ocean common carriers operating in US trades have an obligation to treat shippers in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in the acceptance, handling and carriage of cargo.

"If there is insufficient space for the amount of cargo tendered, carriers may not refuse to accept cargo or bookings because of the level of revenue to be achieved by the particular shipment," it said.

Commissioner Delmond Won, appointed as the investigative officer, was given subpoena powers and directed to "develop a record on various practices allegedly engaged in by ocean common carriers in recent weeks, either individually or collectively to obtain, or attempt to obtain higher rates or charges for carrying cargo in the inbound trades from the Far East to the US".

Backing for the TransAtlantic Conference  Agreement's  appeal against European anti-trust  fines of Ecu273m ($317.5m) for anti-trust offences has come from the European Community Shipowners Association.

Association president Brian Kerr said he was "disappointed" by the  commission's decision against people who were providing the "backbone of trade" and who had exerted a lot of effort to link up in order to cut their costs.

TD
Secretary general Alfons Guinier said the main reason for the case was service contracts between Taca and shippers, not clearly dealt with in the EU's competition regulations but traditional liner practice. "We are not talking here of excessive rates," he said.
Guinier said he questioned  commission statements that  Taca had increased its rates by 80% over the
1993-1995 period and cited figures of a westbound rate rise of 14.85% and 4.52 on eastbound over
that period.

"There have been talks for the future and these are still going on. The aim is to clarify issues which are not clear in the regulation like service contracts," he said.

The other contentious issue of price-fixing of the inland leg of door-to-door container transport could be also be covered by the talks, though it was also subject of EU court cases, he said.
The talks were "very constructive" and aimed to end the long-running row with the  commission over
Taca and its TAA predecessor, he said.

The European Community Shipowners Association said it queried the  commission decision on factual grounds, such as on when  Taca ended its prohibition on individual service contracts, and on how  Taca prevented potential competition.

"There is clear evidence of strong competition on price and service between the  Taca lines and between Taca and the independents," it said.

Opponents say plans don't say who'll pay
BY AVIVA FREUDMANN

TD
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE STAFF

BRUSSELS - Initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic to charge shipowners for the use of port infrastructure are unclear, and could lead to the shipping industry paying more than its fair share, says the European Community Shipowners' Association.

In principle, the "user-pays" concept is a good one, said Brian Kerr, a shipowner based in Ireland and president of the association. However, he said, the way proposals are shaping up in both the United States and in the  European Union would tend to burden shipowners by failing to define the responsibilities of other users of port services, and by failing to specify where port infrastructure begins and ends.
Report weighs labor pacts

Mr. Kerr spoke on the occasion of the release of ECSA's annual report, which focuses on new agreements with labor unions to implement International Labor Organization rules on working hours aboard ships.

In the United States, where Congress is debating a replacement for the harbor maintenance tax, "we are not happy with the way it seems to be developing," said Alfons Guinier, the ECSA's secretary general.
"It is not good at all."

In Europe, the European Commission last year issued a proposal on ports and competition in port services and this past summer issued a more specific proposal on charging for all manner of transport infrastructure.

But the ECSA says neither proposal defines which users would be charged, including manufacturers based at ports, owners of trucks that use roll-on, roll-off vessels and pleasure craft.

Nor do the EU papers say whether such expenses as anti-flooding measures on river approaches are to be paid for entirely by users, or shared by government bodies.
Positive developments

However, the association emphasized that the  commission's closer look at who pays for port infrastructure and its effort to clarify where subsidies are occurring are positive developments.

"Improvements in efficiency and a free competitive environment in ports and port services will be to the benefit of shipping, trade and ports themselves," the ECSA said in its report.

TACA fines 'disappointing'
On other matters, Mr. Kerr said that the recent  European Commission imposition of  fines on the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  lines is unfortunate.

Page 137 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's disappointing that the  commission would take this line against the people who are the backbone of trade," Mr. Kerr said.

The shipowners are continuing negotiations with the  commission, and a compromise may be possible, Mr. Kerr added.

"It appears to be a matter of wording. There was no violation of the Treaty of Rome as such. We hope to sort this thing out," he said. "This is not a case of excessive rates or enormous abuses, but a case of interpretation of the regulations."

Regarding the World Trade Organization's "Services 2000" negotiations, which are set to begin in the year 2000, Mr. Guinier said the aim is to liberalize shipping where trade restrictions apply, including in China, Japan and the United States.
"The Jones Act is a word which cannot be spoken when one talks to the United States," Mr. Guinier said. "It seems to be a holy word. But it is part of the larger picture" of worldwide liberalization in trade in
maritime services.

He was referring to the U.S. law that reserves domestic maritime services to U.S.-owned, - built and - crewed vessels.

HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Orient Overseas (International) Ltd said one of its wholly-owned units would be required to pay a HK$180.75 million  fine if a European Commission fine against a shipping consortium was upheld.

The European Commission on September 16 imposed a fine of 273 million Ecus (US$314 million) on the shipping consortium Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (TACA) for breaches of  European Union competition law.

TD
"A wholly owned subsidiary (Subco) of Orient Overseas (International) Limited is a member of TACA," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. "The  fine imposed on Subco, if upheld by the European courts, would be 20 million ECU (equivalent to approximately HK$180.75 million)."

TACA said earlier this month it would appeal to the  European Court for an annulment of the
Commission's fine.

SHIPOWNERS CALL FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR DUTY-FREE SALES, OPPOSE THE HARMONISATION OF WORKING CONDITIONS ON FERRIES AND REJECT  FINES ON TACA MEMBERS.

TD
Brussels, 29/09/1998 (Agence  Europe) - European shipowners are not giving up in the face of the abolition of duty-free sales due to come into force in July 1999. "Why should duty-free be abolished? Nobody really understands the reason, except that the Commission has decided that everything should be harmonised" said Brian Kerr, President of the European Community Shipowners' Association, presenting their annual report to the Press. "If duty-free is abolished, which tax rate will we have to apply between Dover and Calais; the French rate? The English rate? And what should apply in international waters? The situation is unclear, the ECSA Secretary General, Alfons Guiner, commented. "We are no longer campaigning to retain duty-free, but for a replacement system" he stated.The shipowers' second campaign is against the harmonisation of working conditions on board ferries. The  Commission released a proposed directive last Spring which would mean that crew from Third Countries working on Community vessels will benefit from the same social conditions as crew from the State where the ship is registered (see  EUROPE
30 April p.9). According to the ECSA President, "this measure will be "counter-productive" because it will adversely affect employment in the sector, lead to a rise in ticket prices and a reduction in the number of services. It will also encourage Third Countries to apply the same rule to crew from Member States on its vessels, particularly the USA. In essence, the ECSA believes that this proposal is contrary to international law, which recognises that the Member State where the ship is registered is responsible for social conditions on the vessels it registers. To the shipowners, this proposal "runs contrary to the principles of free trade and could infringe the peace clause in the WTO and contravene ILO conventions".The third area of controversy in the shipowners' report concerns competition rules on liner shipping. "We are very disappointed that the  Commission has targeted those who are "backbenchers" in the trade", Brian Kerr stated, commenting on the 273 MECU fine imposed by the Commission on members of the Transatlantic conference Agreement  (TACA) (see EUROPE 18 September p.15). The  TACA President opposes this decision because: i) "the activities condemned by the  Commission are authorised under  European legislation and accepted by all maritime countries, particularly the USA", ii) the decision is based on numerous errors of fact, procedure and on legal matters, and it will be taken before the Court of Justice for cancellation or suspension; iii) "fines cannot be imposed on activities related to service contracts. The TACA lines have received legal advice that clearly points to the  Commission's decision being cancelled in appeal".ECSA, on the other hand, gives a positive account of the past year on several other points. These include: i) an agreement on working hours reached between social partners on 24 March 1998. It will be formally signed on Wednesday 30 September; ii) the  Commission Green Paper on ports dated December
1997 and the White Paper on the pricing of transport infrastructures has given fresh impetus to discussion. During the conference on ports, organised in May in Barcelona by the  Commission, the parties recognised the need to improve the effectiveness and competitiveness of port services, mainly in the aim of promoting connections between the various forms of transport (intermodality). Nonetheless, noted Brian Keer during his press conference, some terms and in particular that of "marginal social cost" must be defined more clearly in practice; iii) the guidelines on State aid in the maritime field of July 1997 have begun to bear fruit. According to ECSA, the effect was particularly positive in the Netherlands (where the fleet was increased
by 100 vessels in two years) and in Norway. On the other hand, in Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, there has been less progress so far; iv) a study on the training needs in the maritime sector will be published in the autumn. "There is clearly a problem of training in the maritime sector, where we are finding it harder and harder to recruit good crews. This is a point on which the Commission could do something, for example by creating a fund", said Brian Kerr. V) ECSA is in favour of Commission's Green Paper on the treatment of waste from ships (see  EUROPE of 31 July, p.6), but it

must be specified how these charges will be imposed, who will be responsible for dealing with waste collection, etc., stressed ECSA president.

Rate-making group down to 11 members
BY PAUL RICHARDSON

TD
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE SPECIAL

LONDON - Germany's DSR-Senator Lines GmbH and Transportacion Maritima Mexicana Wednesday told the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  that they were pulling out of the rate-making group.

Both moves will carry the obligatory 90-day "cooling-off and reconsideration" period, although industry sources said they believe both lines will operate as independents starting Jan. 1 unless dramatic changes take place.

The departures would bring TACA's membership to 11. When first formed in 1994 after its predecessor, the Trans-Atlantic Agreement,  was ruled illegal by the  European Union, TACA had 17 members. It still controls about 60% of the North Atlantic trade.

DSR-Senator Lines is part of the United Alliance with Cho Yang Shipping Co. and Hanjin Shipping Co. of South Korea and United Arab Shipping Co. Cho Yang announced this summer that it was pulling out of TACA. That move is imminent.
DSR-Senator holds around 4% of the east and westbound trans-Atlantic market share.
Speaking from Bremen late Wednesday, Eberhard Walther, DSR-Senator's vice

president, confirmed that the company had tendered its resignation from  TACA and that it was intended to be effective on Jan. 1.

"Within the present  TACA agreement, and the way we are operating today is not the way for the future. And of course, we believe that deregulation must change the entire approach of shipping in this sector."

Pointing to  TACA meetings scheduled for Tuesday concerning the future of the conference, Mr. Walther said, "We may reconsider our decision to withdraw from  TACA, (but) we have made the move to tender our resignation, and that has been made with a positive eye on the future."
TMM, which holds around 1% of  TACA's market share, also confirmed that it is leaving the conference. "We have notified  TACA that we will be out," said Pedro S. Mejorada, TMM's director of investor
relations. "Yes, we are out."

The European Commission in September slapped  TACA with $318 million in  fines for alleged antitrust violations related to price fixing.
DSR-Senator's portion of the  fine was $16 million, though Mr. Eberhard insisted that the  fine had
"absolutely no connection" with the company's decision to withdraw from the conference.
TMM was fined $8 million.

"We, like other  TACA members, believe the  fines are wrong, and we have a good case to fight them. We will do that through the proper channels," he said.
The fines add to the pressures the conference has been feeling from within and without.
Internally, the price-setting group has seen rates slide in a hotly

contested battle with non-conference lines - and with each other - to win contracts in an oversupplied market.

TACA has vowed to appeal the  fines to the European Court.

The European Community Shipowners' Association has come out in support of the appeal by the Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca) against European Commission fines of 273 million ecu (about HK$2.49 billion) for antitrust offences.

Association president Brian Kerr said he was disappointed by the  commission's decision against people who were providing the backbone of trade and who had exerted a lot of effort to link up in order to cut their costs.

Secretary-general Alfons Guinier said the main reason for the case was service contracts between Taca and shippers, not clearly dealt with in the  European Union's competition regulations but traditional liner practice. "We are not talking here of excessive rates," he said.

HD        Taca faces fresh crisis  as three carriers quit.

The TransAtlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca) may be facing further defections, following the decision by three carriers, DSR-Senator, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and Tecomar, to quit.

The three have given 90 days' notice to leave the rate-setting group in a bid to improve their market strength.

TD
Sources say that intense competitive pressure among the unstructured tier of lines in  Taca - those which rely on third-party agents for some distribution functions - is forcing a rethink.

That grouping includes the three departing members, and Cho Yang, Mediterranean Shipping Co and Hyundai. Cho Yang - a partner of DSR-Senator in the United Alliance group - earlier gave notice to leave on November 1.
"I should not be surprised to see Hyundai make a similar move," said one industry insider.
The four departures that have been officially notified would reduce  Taca's membership to 11. Officials at
Taca declined to comment.

The carriers involved in the latest decision will explain their motives at a meeting of members in the next few days.
DSR-Senator said it might reconsider its decision to withdraw  agreement.
"For that, we need at the meeting on October 6 sufficient indicators that bureaucracy will be cut and that
Taca will be more efficient in achieving its goals," Heinz Bartkowski, managing director for
DSR-Senator's profit centre  Europe, told Lloyd's List. DSR-Senator, which is controlled by Hanjin of
Korea, and fellow conference lines are reported to have been hit by the entry into the trade of Cosco,
APL and other independents.
Mr Bartkowski said that the move had nothing to do with the  fines recently imposed on Taca members
by the EU. Parent Hanjin was also not involved in the decision. "Our marketing and sales are completely
different; they do not put pressure on us in these fields," he said.

"We are no longer convinced that the conference gives us the benefits we are seeking," he added. "Our volumes on the North Atlantic this year are down some 20% westbound and 30% eastbound compared with 1997. Prices had slipped substantially." Outsiders were making inroads.

Industry experts said the lines are changing their stance in reaction to the expected implementation in May 1999 of the US's Bill 414, which will enable agreements between carriers and shippers to remain confidential, providing they are notified to the Federal Maritime  Commission.
This is seen as enabling the lines to respond better to customers' needs. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1998.

HONDURAN FREIGHTER REFLOATED IN DARDANELLES.

ISTANBUL - A Honduras registered freighter that ran aground at the entrance to Turkey's Dardanelles straits was refloated early on Friday, Anatolian news agency said. It said the crew of the 3,995-tonne Spica, carrying a cargo of steel from Russia to Egypt, had succeeded in refloating the ship by their own
efforts and the ship would continue on its journey after checks for damage at Gelibolu in the Marmara Sea. Turkey's busy Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits connecting the Aegean and Black Seas handle around
60 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products in tanker traffic annually, leading
to fears of a major spill from a grounding or collision. REUTERS

SEA-GOING PLATFORM CRUISES INTO LONG BEACH HOME PORT - FIRST LAUNCH ANTICIPATION GROWS.

LONG BEACH, Calif.-An immense ocean-going launch platform arrived at Sea Launch Home Port today, docking next to another one-of-a-kind vessel as anticipation builds for the first-ever firing of a commercial satellite into orbit from a platform at sea. The Odyssey, a 20-story converted oil-drilling rig, arrived at the Port of Long Beach amid cheers and eased itself next to its sister ship, Sea Launch Commander. The
667-foot-long Commander, a mission-control center and floating rocket assembly plant, carried the first two Sea Launch rockets into Home Port on July 13. "Bringing the Odyssey and Commander together for the first time closes a critical chapter in our mission of providing an affordable and reliable sea-based launch service, but it is merely a prologue to the work ahead as we integrate the various systems and prepare for the initial launch," said Allen B. Ashby, president and general manager of the international Sea Launch partnership. "Building these two unique vessels and bringing them to our operations base in Long Beach, along with the launch vehicles, represents a tremendous undertaking by thousands of dedicated professionals."

INDIA'S FIRST DOUBLE-HULL OIL TANKER LAUNCHED.

KOCHI, India, Oct 5, Asia Pulse - India's state-owned ship building major Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) has launched country's first double-hull oil tanker. Speaking on the occassion, in the southern Indian state of Kerala, the corporation chairman and managing director P K Srivastava said the corporation was in the process of finalising contracts for a few more similar types of ships for the state-owned Shipping Corporation of India's (SCI). He expressed concern and anxiety over the constraints and difficulties faced by the domestic ship-building and shipping industry owing to the levies. (PTI).

SHIPOWNERS HAIL MOVE TO PROMOTE PORT KLANG.

Foreign and local shipowners say they understand the move by the Government to woo back local cargo to local ports and such a policy is aimed at protecting the nation's interest. The International Shipowners Association chairman Abdul Latif Abdullah in dismissing a shipping manager's view that it was
"Singapore-bashing", said: "What the Government is trying to do is to get back Malaysian cargo to be shipped direct via local ports, with the hub port in Port Klang". "What the Government is trying to do is where possible get as much local cargo to be consolidated and transshipped via Port Klang," he told Business Times. Latif, however, stressed that it is indeed impossible and impractical to try and have mainline calls at Port Klang to all destinations which Malaysia trade with. BUSINESS TIMES

SUNKEN-FERRY FIRM IN OIL SPILL WRANGLE.

The owners of the ferry which sank two weeks ago with the loss of 91 lives are refusing to pay for the clearing of an oil spill above the spot where the vessel went down. Sulpicio Lines challenged the Government to first prove the sunken Princess of the Orient was responsible. At least five million pesos (HK$875,000) was needed to clear the large slick, which had reached Manila's shore, blackening and polluting surrounding fishing grounds, Coast Guard chief of staff Captain Herby Escutin said yesterday. The Coast Guard told the shipping firm to pay the bill but it refused, questioning whether the sinking of the inter-island ferry 35 nautical miles south of Manila was alone responsible for an estimated 50,000 litres of fuel oil spilling into the sea.

LONDON - DSR-Senator Lines plans to leave the  Trans Atlantic Conference Agreement  because of declining market share and because it is dissatisfied with the way the rate-making conference operates, an executive of the Bremen-based carrier said.

TD
The departure of DSR-Senator from the rate-setting group adds to the pressures on  TACA, which faces shipping deregulation in the United States and which last month was  fined $318 million by the European Commission for antitrust violations.

DSR-Senator said on Wednesday that it would leave  TACA by Jan. 1. Its parent company, Hanjin Shipping Co., left  TACA last January. Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, Mexico's largest ocean carrier, also intends to leave the conference by Jan. 1.
Cho Yang Shipping Co. of South Korea and Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines previously withdrew. DSR-Senator became unhappy with "the general efficiency of TACA, the way things were working," said
Heinz Bartkowski, DSR-Senator's managing director for Europe, in a telephone interview from Bremen.

He said the carrier may review its decision after a  TACA meeting in Amsterdam on Tuesday. That meeting was called to consider the impact of U.S. shipping deregulation, among other matters.
"A simpler and more efficient conference structure" could persuade DSR-Senator to remain
a TACA member, he said. DSR-Senator, which holds roughly 4% of the

trans-Atlantic market, was losing market share as a member. "The conference was not able to maintain rate stability in principle," Mr. Bartkowski said. "Over the past two to three years rates have gone down." The decline in rates has not been caused by lack of discipline within the  TACA organization, but rather because of "the general situation, and the pressure of the independents," he said.

DSR-Senator's decision to leave  TACA had nothing to do with parent company Hanjin's departure, nor was it related to changes in U.S. law or the imposition of  European fines, he added.

Shippers were pleased to hear that  TACA would be losing DSR-Senator, as well as TMM. The latest departures reduce TACA's membership to 11 carriers, from 17 in the mid-1990s.

"I would not be surprised if there were more lines announcing that they are withdrawing from the  TACA agreement," said Stig Karlsson, director of the Federation of Swedish Industries and of the Swedish Shippers Council. "For shippers, this means we will have better competition."

Last month's EU ruling against  TACA "probably means that  TACA as such will be declared unlawful and not allowed to exist any more," Mr. Karlsson said. "Therefore, it will be easier for members to leave TACA than it was before."

TACA evolved out of a Trans-Atlantic  Agreement,  which the EU ruled illegal in 1992.

Mr. Karlsson also said that the type of cooperation that will be permitted after the EU decision "will be less attractive to many of the" lines. Third, he said, "TACA members must realize that there is a financial risk to continuing as a member of a liner cartel. All intelligent shipping line managers must have noticed that their customers don't want them to be members of cartels."

The departures of DSR-Senator and other carriers "underlines the fact that shipping companies often have more freedom and flexibility to meet customer demands when they are unconstrained by commitments they have made to other lines," said Christopher Welsh, secretary-general of the European Shippers Council.

[SINGAPORE] The Singapore National Shippers Council (SNSC) says that it "welcomes" recent fines imposed by the European Commission (EC) against the member lines of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference  Agreement  (Taca) as it proves lines have been "unfair" in their dealings with shippers.
"This is a very clear reflection of why we have been campaigning all this time," John Lu, chairman of
SNSC told Shipping Times. "It shows we have not been complaining for no reason."

TD
In a record fine by the European Union's anti-trust authority, the EC  fined 15 companies that make
up the Taca some US$317 million (S$532.5 million). It said the lines were guilty of price fixing and had
abused their dominant position in the North Atlantic container transport market.
"I think all the time this was what shippers have been waiting for," said Mr Lu.

Shippers' councils both in Asia and throughout the world have campaigned for many years against liner conferences which they see as price fixing cartels.

The actions of the conferences will be one of the major issues coming under the spotlight at the 21st Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Federation of Asean Shippers' Councils (FASC) which begins today at the Westin Stamford in Singapore.

Shippers' councils in the region have expressed great concern over recent rate restorations, container repositioning surcharges and terminal handling charges (THCs) imposed by liner conferences.

The AGM will also see the election of a new chairman of FASC to replace the current chairman Vicharn Nivatvongs from the Thai National Shippers' Council. The chairmanship is rotated every two years.

In total 60 participants representing 15 countries, both from the region and beyond will be attending the two-day meeting.

Many of the world's top ocean carriers will be meeting in Amsterdam today and tomorrow to discuss the future of the transatlantic trades.

Both conference and non-conference lines will be participating in the review which will take place alongside a regular monthly  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  meeting at which the group's 1999 business plan is to be finalised.

TD
The high-level meeting of so-called "interested parties" will be considering whether  Taca should be replaced by a different type of  agreement in recognition of shipping reforms in the US that will have a considerable impact on the liner trades.

The meeting is to be chaired by Olav Rakkenes, chairman of  Taca and president and chief exexecutive of Atlantic Container Line, and John Clancey, president and chief executive of Sea-Land. Christopher Rankin, the former president and chief executive of P&O Nedlloyd North America, will be giving a presentation on the North Atlantic trades and the likely impact of deregulation. Several carriers that currently operate as independents on the North Atlantic will be present at the meeting.

The initiative coincides with considerable structural changes taking place in the transatlantic trades as more carriers enter the market and  Taca membership shrinks.

The latest review of capacity utilisation in the US liner trades by Piers Maritime Research Services shows that the number of US east coast ports served by the major lines is falling while vessel size is increasing. In 1994, only 12 ships of more than 4,000 teu were present in the transatlantic trades.
Today, that number has swollen to 23, with the prospect of even larger vessels being introduced. "This activity is sparking heightened competition among east coast ports to develop the intermodal
infrastructure required to handle efficiently this traffic," the report notes. The impact on carriers
themselves is also apparent, with six years of relative stability coming to an end as the newcomers put
downwards pressure on freight rates.

Taca lines, which will also be meeting separately this week to discuss internal conference matters, will be hearing from their lawyers about the appeals process following confirmation last month that conference members are to be heavily  fined by the European Commission for breaking EU antitrust rules. The
lines also want to know what they can and cannot do in future in order to avoid any further sanctions.

Meanwhile, a number of transatlantic carriers are in the final stages of agreeing a new co-operative arrangement. The negotiations are thought to involve the longstanding Vessel Sharing  Agreement  which currently includes Sea-Land, P&O Nedlloyd and Orient Overseas Container Line, with Maersk an associate member. The partnership may be extended.

Deregulation on both sides of the ocean threatens price-setting system
BY AVIVA FREUDMANN

TD
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE STAFF

LONDON - Ocean carriers operating in North Atlantic trade lanes are weighing their options for cooperation as deregulatory pressures mount on both sides of the Atlantic.

In what may be the start of formal talks leading to a reorganization of the industry's price-setting system, executives from 20 ship lines met in Amsterdam on Tuesday to discuss their legal alternatives.

While no formal decisions were made, the group agreed to meet again in mid-November to consider the impact of the new Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, the pending U.S. law that will allow confidential contracting between individual carriers and shippers. They also will discuss the impact of last month's adverse antitrust ruling by the  European Commission, which requires rate-setting conferences to give their members more freedom to reach private deals with shippers.

The 20-carrier assembly in Amsterdam, dubbed the "meeting of interested parties," took place against the backdrop of declining transportation rates in the North Atlantic and recent departures of three members of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement,  a price-setting group comprising 13 carriers.

"I don't know what kind of  agreement will be reached, but a lot of carriers are starting to lose money, and something has to happen," said Olav Rakkenes, chief executive of  TACA member Atlantic Container
Line and the conference's chairman. ACL, along with Sea-Land Service Inc., the United States' largest ocean carrier, sponsored the Amsterdam meeting.

"We had legal people explain to us what we can do and what we cannot do under the new regimes in Europe and the United States," Mr. Rakkenes said in an interview in London Thursday. "That was the purpose of the meeting."

TACA members, separate from the "meeting of interested parties," also met in Amsterdam to consider their business plans. But no decisions were made there, either, because of uncertainty in the legal regime, Mr. Rakkenes said.
"We can't do that until we have greater clarity on how we can operate legally," he said.
The Amsterdam meeting was entirely expected, in view of recent legal
changes, said Stig Karlsson, director of the Federation of Swedish Industries and a spokesman for
European shippers.

He added, however, that "as shippers, we would prefer them to be brave enough to act alone in the market."
Open discussion


Page 158 of 170 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Participants in the meeting said there was "a free and frank discussion of the industry's problems, including the problem of too many ships chasing too little freight."

"We have to look at the general market situation and put the appropriate tonnage to it," said Eberhard Walther, vice president of corporate marketing and sales for DSR-Senator Lines, a Bremen-based carrier that recently announced its intention to leave  TACA. "If there is a permanent oversupply in the market, something must be done."
But carriers face legal barriers to making joint decisions to limit capacity in the market. Under a 1994
European Commission ruling, members of  TACA's predecessor organization, the Trans Atlantic
Agreement,  were barred from agreeing to withhold a certain percentage of each ship's volume.

Among the other options that carriers have floated is a so-called stabilization  agreement, in which ship lines would discuss pricing and capacity issues but would not make binding rate decisions.
Legal difficulties seen
But a stabilization agreement also could run into legal difficulties, according to antitrust lawyers in
Brussels. The European Commission has ruled in the past that such discussion forums are
anti-competitive.

There is no consensus on a stabilization  agreement or any other response to the complex legal situation, Mr. Rakkenes said.

"I still believe it is better to talk together and find a collective solution," he added. "The conference will remain on the North Atlantic in some way, shape or form." But according to Mr. Karlsson of the Federation of Swedish Industries,  TACA may be forced to disband.

"We have not yet seen the full text of the  European Commission's decision, but as far as I understand, it will declare TACA illegal," Mr. Karlsson said. "If that is so, then all the contracts between  TACA members and shippers will end on Dec. 31."

TACA will challenge the  European Commission's imposition of $318 million in fines on TACA members for past antitrust violations, and will fight other legal conclusions in the commission's Sept. 16 ruling, Mr. Rakkenes said.
New tricks needed

But he added that  TACA "has no intention to continue fighting the  commission" on other regulatory matters.

Although the EU decision and the new U.S. law makes it more difficult to operate a rate-making conference, the provision of the U.S. law eliminating public tariff-filing requirements may make things easier for the conference, Mr. Rakkenes said.

"We have to learn to operate in a different way," he said. "We have a new set of rules in  Europe, and we intend to live up to the  commission's decisions. Times change, and we have to change with them."

Publication delay while carriers consider changes.
By Janet Porter

TD
TRANS-Atlantic Conference Agreement  carriers have delayed publication of the group's 1999
business plan for a month while they consider how to respond to regulatory changes on both sides of the
Atlantic.

A Taca committee will spend the next few weeks deciding on the terms of next year's business plan which will now probably be published after the next  Taca meeting in New York on November 11. The over-riding goal is to ensure that the plan complies with legal requirements in both  Europe and the US.

Normally, Taca's proposed freight rate changes and service contract conditions would have been published by now in preparation for the annual round of negotiations with customers.

But because of pending ocean shipping deregulation in the US and the recent decision by the  European Commission to fine Taca lines for breaking EU competition rules,  Taca members say they need more time to prepare for next year.

Nevertheless, carriers will probably be seeking modest rate increases for some types of cargo, said Olav Rakkenes, Taca chairman and president and ceo of Atlantic Container Line. Although rates are currently under pressure because of increased competition and surplus tonnage, there may still be scope for some small rate rises.

What will be considered in the coming weeks is the structure of the tariff. With carriers now accepting that intermodal pricing is not permitted in  Europe, shippers will probably be quoted rates from a  European port to a final destination in the US, or vice versa, with the  European inland portion of the whole tariff dropped.

Another matter still to be resolved involves service contracts. Until the Ocean Shipping Reform Bill becomes law next May, carriers will still be required to publicly file rates in the US, whereas they are confidential in  Europe.

Meanwhile, Taca lines are now preparing their response to the recent EU ruling and deciding whether to just challenge the  fines or to also appeal any of the legal judgment. The conference has two months from notification of the verdict to lodge an appeal with the  European court. Likewise, carriers have
60-days in which to either pay the  fines or provide bank guarantees. Some  Taca lines are thought to face financial difficulties meeting this commitment.

Once the legal appeal process begins, the case is effectively out of the hands of both  Taca and Brussels so that there may be no further chance for any out-of-court settlement on the issues being disputed.

But that is not stopping regular dialogue between the two sides about the future and discussion about a new regulatory framework which provides clear guidelines for the industry. These talks are continuing in a constructive manner, despite the recent imposition of  fines.
"We need legal certainty so that we can move forward," said Mr Rakkenes.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Container shipping companies operating on the Atlantic between  Europe
and the U.S. have postponed setting rates for next year for at least a month.

"Publication of the 1999 business plan relating to service contracts and tarrif must be postponed until mid-November 1998," the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (TACA) said in a statement released late on Friday.

TD
The shipping lines said the delay was due to changes in the regulatory environment which require clarification.
Normally TACA would issue proposed rates for the next year around this time, the group said. Pending shipping deregulation in the U.S. and the recent decision by the European Commission to
fine TACA lines for breaking EU competition rules are behind the move. TACA is likely to appeal the
fines and possibly the legal decision.

But the conference is aware that inland transport pricing in  Europe is unlikely to be allowed, forcing carriers only to quote rates from or to  European ports compared with the ability to charge to final destination in the U.S.

Until the new U.S. Ocean Shipping Act becomes law in May 1999 and changes the position, carriers are required to file rates publically while contracts are confidential in  Europe.

TACA added that it intends its 1999 business plan to take into account prevailing trading conditions, indicating it would be seeking moderate rate rises.

TACA comprises Atlantic Container Line AB , DSR-Senator Lines GmbH, Hapag-Lloyd Container Linie GmbH , Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd , Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, Mexican Line Ltd, A.P.

The European Commission has levied a record Ecu273 million ($224 million)  fine against the Transatlantic Shipping Conference  Agreement  (TACA; Hamburg) for pacts that drove up prices on transatlantic container traffic between 1993 and 1995. TACA has appealed the decision and has advised its members to submit bank guarantees rather than pay the fines. The companies involved are P&O
Nedloyd (Rotterdam), Maersk, Sea Land, Hapag Loydd, DSR Senator, and three Asian shippers. The  fines run from Ecu6.88 million for the smallest company in the group to Ecu41.26 million for the largest. The commission accuses TACA of breaking competition rules and warns of further substantial  fines for any collusion on inland transport prices.

[SINGAPORE] Member container lines in the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  (Taca) have delayed publication of 1999 rates for at least a month as it grapples with the twin issues of deregulation in the US shipping industry and the imposition of  fines by the European Union.

"Publication of the 1999 business plan relating to service contracts and tariff must be postponed until mid-November 1998,"  Taca said in a statement.

TD
The shipping lines said the delay was due to changes in the regulatory environment, particularly the impending deregulation in the US and the recent decision by the  European Commission to fine        Taca lines for breaking EU competition rules.

A Taca committee is scheduled to decide on the terms of the 1999 business plan which will now be published after the Nov 11 meeting in New York.

Another issue yet to be resolved involves service contracts. Until the new US Ocean Shipping Act becomes law in May 1999, carriers are required to publicly file rates in the US, while they are confidential in  Europe.

Meanwhile, Taca lines are preparing their response to the recent EU ruling and deciding whether to challenge the fines or appeal any legal judgement.

The EC claims that the 15 companies which were members of  Taca between 1994 and 1995, were guilty of price fixing and had abused their dominant position in the North Atlantic container transport market.

Among the companies  fined were Neptune Orient Lines, Overseas Orient Container Line (OOCL), NYK Line, and Hanjin Shipping, Hyundai Merchant Marine and Cho Yang Shipping. NOL was a member of Taca between 1994 and 1997.

The conference has two months from notification of the verdict to lodge an appeal with the EU. Similarly, the carriers have 60 days in which to either pay the  fines or provide bank guarantees.

Lines take too much for granted on Ocean Shipping Reform

It has been a week of turbulent happenings in the steamship conference business. Resignations seem to be coming in thick and fast, and they all have just one very important aspect in common: deregulation.

TD
Member lines of the  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement,  and most of their non-conference counterparts, got together for their own special summit meeting in Amsterdam to talk trade. Naturally, TACA lines were keen to figure out the way ahead for a structure that has looked anything but stable in recent months.

As has been reported in this newspaper,  TACA's crew list has dwindled somewhat, with carriers from South Korea, Germany and Mexico preferring the open-market status, and the apparent "freedom," offered by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, due to become effective next May.
DSR, TMM and Tecomar throw in the  TACA towel

DSR-Senator Line and Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, together with closely connected Tecomar, have handed in their all-important resignation papers. Next month, Korea's Cho Yang Shipping Co. joins an earlier deserter, the closely linked Hanjin Shipping Ltd. Of course, it would be wrong to suggest happenings of late should be likened to the proverbial "rats deserting a sinking ship" scenario. Salvage experts are standing by, and  TACA is still afloat, even though it is deeply laden with ballast, wallowing in heavy seas under the Brussels coastline (yes, the city does have a water bank, albeit along the canal sides). And, yes,  TACA is the subject of an onshore current that could force it on the rocks any minute - but importantly, it is still there making its presence felt.
APL says goodbye to trans-Pacific conference

While the Netherlands played host to the Atlantic players and provided the ideal neutral backdrop to international concerns, APL Ltd., over on the U.S. West Coast, was putting the final touches to its "notice of resignation" letter to the Transpacific Westbound Rate  Agreement.

APL has been a TWRA member since '85, when the conference started, and in a statement, the Oakland, Calif., carrier praised the structure by saying the TWRA "had contributed positively to trade stability (on
the Pacific) during that time." However, echoing the words of DSR-Senator when it handed in its resignation papers to  TACA on the last day of September, APL executives went on to say, "TWRA no longer meets APL's long-term objective" in the Pacific trades.

The synergies of the week's developments are naturally simple to identify.  TACA's exiles may be upset by their European Union fines for alleged wrongdoing on the Atlantic some years back, but there is little or
no connection between these penalties and the decision to opt out.

APL is a respected name on the Pacific - in fact, it is one of the market leaders in this horrifically imbalanced trade zone. But this is a line looking to the long-term future. It has had a bumpy ride since Neptune Orient Line got involved in its running, but it must be acknowledged that what happened was for the best.

The ocean container shipping business is getting ready, as we all know. It is getting ready for that day
next May, when everyone expects the Ocean Shipping Reform Act officially to take effect. What is on offer
right now just does not fit as part of future shipping business.

This much-talked-about act, which is now awaiting President Clinton's consideration and signature, will take another step toward becoming reality on March 1, when the Federal Maritime  Commission issues the final regulations that will effectively implement the changes to take place between current law and the new act. No one likes sifting through reams and reams of legislative theses, unless of course you are paid to do just that. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act contains paragraphs of law that could send most industry "experts" into a deep slumber before they reach the centerfold.

It comes as no surprise then that a line such as APL should use modern technology and Internet Web site facilities to provide its readers with a much-simplified way of finding out what the act is really all about. Since Sept. 29, a couple of days before Congress approved the act in principle, APL has posted on its Web site its own review of the impact of deregulation on shippers. But it does come as a big surprise to find that, in the first few days after the review appeared, APL recorded about 500 hits from customers and even other carriers - doubtless keen to have a simplified idea of what to expect come next May. This is indeed a strange scenario - after all, this is supposedly one of the biggest changes that the container shipping business has faced in years. Are carriers so lost in their internal concerns about dwindling financial strength and other matters that they have turned their backs on this issue?

Are the big shipping lines so immersed in their need to survive - either alone or as a merged entity - that they may prefer to wait until it all happens before thinking too deeply about the outcome?
Do shippers really know what to expect in May?

A source in the  European car manufacturing industry, who is strongly involved in trans-Atlantic trade, feels there is a lot of confusion among individual shippers over the Reform Act and what to expect.
Shipping Reform Act - What Shipping Reform Act?

Incredibly, one shipper of electronic telecommunication products didn't even know the act had gone through Congress, though it must be emphasized that his company relies more on air transport. On the ship-line side, there is a general feeling on the Atlantic among non-TACA members that the act will make for little change generally in pricings, despite the individual contract goalposts moved to suit the players on both sides.

Most TACA members are keeping an open mind, adopting the normal wait-and-see attitude. It will be another month before signs of rate adjustments come through that side. It is difficult to believe that the very might of the wordings Deregulation of Shipping and Ocean Shipping Reform Act is causing so little reaction from both carrier and shipper alike. The biggest change in ocean container shipping in years is almost being brushed aside as just another problem to be faced when it happens, and not before it occurs.

HD        Shippers  urged to learn how to use conferences to advantage. BY        By Janet Porter

SHIPPERS should learn how to use freight conferences to their advantage rather than constantly attacking the system, a former  Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement  employee who now works for a shippers' association, is advising.

James Walker, who was general manager for  Taca in New York for five years before joining Overseas Moving Network International in March, has also challenged many of the claims made by shippers about conference practices and behaviour.

TD
Some of the allegations made about  Taca by shippers during oral hearings called by the  European        Commission were wrong or misleading, according to Mr Walker. And yet while these claims were refuted by Taca lawyers, those who gave inaccurate evidence were not called back for further questioning, he said.

Now free to speak out, Mr Walker also dispels many of the popular perceptions about  Taca peddled by Europe's shipper councils, who have waged a long campaign against liner shipping conferences, and Taca in particular.

Suggestions that conferences restrict direct access to shipping lines and prevent customers from having face-to-face negotiations with the carrier of their choice are completely untrue, according to Mr Walker.

Shippers are free to organise meetings with any carrier or group of carriers they want, with or without a conference representative present, he told Lloyd's List.

Mr Walker, who is now commercial director for Omni Shippers Association, stressed that his views were not necessarily those of Omni members. The organisation represents household removal firms based around the world. Omni moves some 10,000 teu a year with  Taca lines, and a further 2,000 teu with independent transatlantic carriers.

Before joining  Taca, Mr Walker worked for Maersk for 10 years. He frequently represented Maersk at meetings of the North Europe USA Rate  Agreement,  the transatlantic conference that preceded the Trans-Atlantic Agreement  and Taca.

This background, together with his presrent position, has given Mr Walker a rare insight into all aspects of the industry.

And from this perspective, he argues that shippers are wrong to be so antagonistic towards  Taca and other rate-setting conferences.
Shippers can use conferences to their advantage, he insists.

"I like the ability to talk to several carriers at once," Mr Walker explained. "I don't think  Taca is shipper unfriendly."

Documenting how Taca has responded to virtually every complaint since it was formed in 1992 by changing its rules and adopting new practices, Mr Walker pointed out that it is the market that dictates what the conference does, not the reverse.

Contrary to the claims of some critics,  Taca "has listened to customers," he said.
If the market is over-tonnaged, freight rates will go down, which is exactly what is happening now. Average all-in transatlantic freight rates are currently around $1,000 per teu, he estimates, but are under
severe pressure as recent newcomers buy their way into the market.

Mr Walker described the $317m  fines imposed on Taca lines by the European Commission as "numbing". If the carriers have to pay, what impact will that have on jobs and the very existence of some carriers, he asked.
And "where is the proof" that  Taca lines have done anything wrong?

Instead of engaging in constant conference-bashing, shippers should realise that conferences can benefit both sides of the industry. Shippers should learn to use the services provided by conferences, such as the ability to negotiate with several carriers at once if wanted, rather than continue to be so adversarial.

"I'm not saying shippers were wrong to complain about  Taca," said Mr Walker. But he is disappointed that insufficient attention was paid to some of the more questionaable claims made by shippers during the Brussels investigation that culminated last month in the imposition of such huge  fines on Taca members.
Transatlantic freight rates are under pressure as newcomers buy their way in. (c) of Lloyd's of London Press Limited 1998.
