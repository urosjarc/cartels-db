* Lundbeck faces "significant"  fine - sources

* Regulators say pay-for-delay deals hurt consumers (Adds comments by lawyer, details, updates share prices)
By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, June 3 (Reuters) - A European regulator will  fine Denmark's Lundbeck and eight other makers of generic drugs for limiting the supply of cheaper medicines, two people with knowledge of the matter said, its first sanction against "pay-for-delay" deals.

Following an inquiry launched in 2009, the European Union's anti-trust regulator will impose a "significant"  fine on Lundbeck and lesser fines on Germany's Merck KGaA this month, the people said. Seven smaller drug firms will also be fined.

The sanctions underscore the determination of EU and U.S. regulators to break agreements that involve brand-name drug companies paying generic manufacturers not to deliver cheaper versions of their drugs to the market, a practice that ultimately harms consumers.

European regulators have estimated that consumers are paying up to 20 percent more for medicines in some cases. Generic versions typically cost a fraction of the price of original medicines in Western markets.

The pharmaceutical industry will be looking for guidance from the case as to what is lawful and what is not, said Koen Platteau, a partner at Brussels-based law firm Olswang.

"The Commission clearly wants to send out a message that in circumstances, this kind of agreement can be restrictive. This is the first case where they will set a precedent," he said.

The European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, can fine a company up to 10 percent of its global revenue for breaching competition laws. In the case of Lundbeck, which makes an
anti-depressant drug and a treatment for Alzheimer's, that would be up to 240 million euros ($311.04 million).
The people Reuters spoke to did not give the precise size of the  fines.

"The fine for Lundbeck is expected to be significant, less so for the others," said one of the people, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Lundbeck paid the generics firms to keep its products from the market and bought stocks of the generic anti-depressant drug citalopram to be destroyed, the person said.

A spokesman for Lundbeck said the company had not been notified of any  fine and believed it had done nothing wrong. Lundbeck shares fell 1.9 percent after Reuters reported the  fine. They were trading 1.4 percent lower at 109.2 crowns by 1516 GMT.

Page 4 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The other companies to be  fined are Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and India's No. 1 pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy , all of them makers of generic drugs. Ranbaxy declined to comment.

A Merck KGaA spokeswoman said the company, which sold subsidiary Generics UK to U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan in 2007, does not comment on pending legal issues.
Antoine Colombani, the spokesman for competition policy at the Commission, declined to comment. The EU competition authority has two similar cases in the pipeline, involving Israel's Teva, French
drugmaker Servier, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has battled against such deals in court for more than a decade. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide on the issue by the end of the month after lower courts issued conflicting rulings.

Brand name companies have defended "pay-for-delay" deals in large part to protect patents and avoid costly litigation.

In a typical case, a generic rival may challenge the patent of a brand-name competitor, which then pays the rival a sum of money to drop its challenge. Defenders of the practice call it a legitimate means to resolve patent litigation.

Obama to highlight mental health six months after Newtown shooting

TD
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will highlight the issues faced by Americans with mental health problems at a White House conference on Monday, following his promise to start a "national conversation" on the subject after the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at a school last year. The massacre at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14 raised awareness of mental issues, although little is known about the state of mind of the shooter, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who committed suicide.
Start-up tries tapping market of uninsured dental patients

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - While many healthcare startups are hoping the new healthcare law going into effect next year will help drive more business their way, dental network Brighter believes being left out of the law will help it more. Dental services for adults are not part of the Affordable Care Act, which
Brighter founder and chief executive Jake Winebaum believes could encourage more businesses to drop their existing dental-care coverage. That could help Brighter win customers, he says.
EU regulators to impose  fines on generic drug makers

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European regulators will clamp down on "pay-for-delay" deals in the pharmaceutical sector this month, fining Denmark's  Lundbeck and eight other generic drug manufacturers for limiting access of cheaper products to the market. Following an inquiry launched in
2009, the European Commission, the EU's anti-trust regulator, will impose a "significant"  fine on Lundbeck and lesser fines on Germany's Merck KGaA and seven smaller drug firms when it announces the sanctions later this month, two officials said.
GSK's breast cancer drug Tykerb fails in gastric cancer study

LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline said on Monday that its breast cancer drug lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy did not improve survival rates for patients with gastric cancer compared
to the use of chemotherapy alone. Lapatinib, which is marketed as Tykerb mainly in the United States and as Tyverb mainly in Europe, is approved for the treatment of breast cancer and some other solid tumors.
Synta drug shown to extend lives of certain lung cancer patients

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A drug designed to block a protein known to help cancer cells grow was shown in a mid-stage trial to lengthen survival in patients with advanced lung cancer that worsened after initial treatment, researchers said on Monday. The results, presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, are the first time an agent in a class known as heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, HSP90 for short, has been shown to be safe and effective, they said.

early-stage study, U.S. researchers said on Sunday. Based on the findings about the drug lambrolizumab, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Merck says it will move directly into a late-stage clinical trial, which will start in the third quarter.
Fittest cities take exercise publicly and personally

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cities that provide parks, walking trails, playing fields and running tracks are setting standards for the country's healthiest urban areas and showing that if they build fitness opportunities, residents will come. A new ranking of the 50 healthiest U.S. cities weighs "community indicators" that include everything from obesity rates and percentage of smokers to the number of baseball diamonds and tennis courts.
Vinegar screening helps cut cervical cancer deaths in India: study

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A simple screening program for cervical cancer using vinegar and visual exams helped reduce deaths caused by the cancer by 31 percent in a group of 150,000 poor women in India, researchers reported on Sunday. If implemented broadly, the screening program could lead to the prevention of 22,000 deaths from cervical cancer in India, and 72,000 deaths in the developing world each year, the team reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.

Vaccine exemptions rising, tied to whooping cough

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The number of New York parents who had their child skip at least one required vaccine due to religious reasons increased over the past decade, according to a new study. What's more, researchers found counties with high religious exemption rates also had more whooping cough cases - even among children that had been fully vaccinated.

The European Commission (EC) will soon impose  fines on nine pharmaceutical firms over payments to delay the launch of generic versions of their drugs, according to sources cited by Reuters.

The concerned firms include Danish  Lundbeck and German Merck as well as Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and Ranbaxy.

TD
The EC launched the investigation in 2009. It found that under the so-called pay-for-delay agreements, the firms postponed the launch of generic drugs by two years, harming the interests of consumers.
According to the sources,  Lundbeck will face the biggest  fine.

Børsen, 04 Jun 2013, online:- The  European Commission is expected to slap a  fine of DKK 1.50bn (EUR 201.23mn USD 263.01mn) on Danish pharmaceutical company  Lundbeck due to pay-for-delay deals. The commission claims that  Lundbeck has paid several rivals that produce copy versions of Lundbeck's anti-depressant Cipramil in the European market to delay the launch of their products. Lundbeck has rejected these accusations.
The DKK 1.50bn  fine equals to 10% of  Lundbeck's total global sales.

European regulators will clamp down on "pay-for-delay" deals in the pharmaceutical sector this month, fining Denmark's  Lundbeck and eight other generic drug manufacturers for limiting access of cheaper products to the market.

Following an inquiry launched in 2009, the  European Commission will impose a "significant"  fine on Lundbeck and lesser fines on Germany's Merck KGaA and seven smaller drug firms when it announces the sanctions later this month, two officials said.

The fines underscore the determination of EU and US regulators to break agreements that involve brand name drug companies paying generic manufacturers not to deliver cheaper drugs to the market, a process that ultimately harms consumers.

European regulators have estimated that consumers are paying up to 20% more for medicines in some cases.

The Commission can fine a company up to 10% of its global revenue for breaching EU antitrust laws, which in Lundbeck's case would be up to €240 million.

The officials Reuters has spoken to have given no indication of the precise size of the  fines apart from to say it will be sizeable in  Lundbeck's case.

"The fine for Lundbeck is expected to be significant, less so for the others," said one of the people, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

The other companies to be  fined are Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and India's No. 1 pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy, all of them makers of generic drugs.

A spokesman for  Lundbeck said the company had not been notified of any  fine and believed it had done nothing wrong. A Merck KGaA spokeswoman said the company does not comment on pending legal issues.
Antoine Colombani, spokesman for competition policy at the Commission, declined to comment.

HD     Ranbaxy, Lundbeck face EU fury for blocking generics

Singapore: The  European Commission (EC) is going to  fine seven generic drug firms, including
India-based Ranbaxy and Denmark-based  Lundbeck, for limiting the supply of cheaper medicines to the
European Union (EU).

The EU's antitrust regulator is determined to break agreements that involve brand-name drug companies paying generic manufacturers not to deliver cheaper versions of their drugs to the market, a practice that eventually harms consumers. This practice came to light following an inquiry in 2009, which was conducted in order to get to the bottom of what has been labeled as &pay-for-delay& deals.

TD
European regulators have estimated that consumers are paying up to 20 percent more for medicines in some cases. Generic versions typically cost a fraction of the price of original medicines.

The European Commission can fine a company up to 10 percent of its global revenue for breaching competition laws. In the case of Lundbeck, which makes an anti-depressant drug and a treatment for Alzheimer's, the  fine could be as high as $313.39 million (240 million euros).

The other companies to be  fined are Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, AL Industrier, all of them makers of generic drugs. The EU competition authority has two
similar cases in the pipeline, involving Israel's Teva, French drugmaker Servier, Johnson & Johnson and
Novartis.

The European Commission is preparing to fine the Danish laboratory Lundbeck over an agreement to delay the release onto the market of generic medicines. According to a source, Lundbeck is set to receive a large fine in June, and the Commission is also targeting the German company Merck and seven others manufacturing generic medicines over agreements to delay for two years the entry onto the market of the generic form of the anti-depressant Citalopram. These generic medicines contain the same molecule as the original but cost, on average, 40% less than the original since the patent has expired, or is due to expire.

TD
The agreements concerned are typical examples of pay for delay' deals, where originator companies strike a deal with one or several manufacturers of generic medicines to postpone the release onto the market of a medicine (see insight in Europolitics 4553). Such agreements have been highlighted by a major competition inquiry into the pharmaceutical sector, which the Commission has been working on since 2008. In this case, the EU executive sent its grievances to  Lundbeck in July 2012 (4473).

It has also launched an in-depth inquiry into these types of agreement between several manufacturers of generic medicines and the Sevier laboratory (3892) regarding Perindopril, a cardio-vascular medicine. Equally, it suspects Johnson and Johnson and subsidiaries of Novartis of engaging in similar practices to prevent the introduction of generic versions of a patch form of the painkiller Fentanyl in the Netherlands. Both these companies received complaints on 31 January (4291 and 4577).

HD         Commission accused of moving  the goalposts on competition law

A Danish pharmaceutical company is bracing itself for the imposition next week of heavy fines by the European Commission – on what the company claims is unreasonable grounds. Lundbeck, one of several firms caught up in anti-trust investigations in the wake of the Commission’s 2008 pharmaceutical sector inquiry, believes it will be the first victim of a push by Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for competition, to limit patent-holders’ rights to settle litigation out of court.

“Intellectual property rights should not be ruthlessly ignored,” a spokesperson for the company told European Voice. The company argues that in its determination to rule that the company has breached competition law, the Commission is moving the goalposts.

TD
After receiving a response from  Lundbeck to its initial statement of objections, the Commission modified its accusations. But its revised statement modifies the initial objections, and raises issues and draws conclusions that the company strongly contests.

The case dates back to an inspection of  Lundbeck’s premises by officials in 2005, which led to formal allegations in July 2012 that the company had reached illegal agreements in 2002 with four companies to dissuade them from marketing generic copies of one of its leading products.  Lundbeck insists that it was within its rights to reach these agreements, which lasted for between ten and 21 months, while awaiting the outcome of key patent-related issues then subject to litigation.

The European pharmaceutical industry recently called for “a fuller policy debate at the level of the college of commissioners before the competition department sets the law in this important area”.

Payments by pharmaceutical companies to generic rivals to delay the launch of competing medicines are coming under fresh pressure on both sides of the Atlantic, with a European regulatory penalty and a US Supreme Court ruling expected in the coming days.

The European Commission is set this week to  fine the Danish pharmaceutical group  Lundbeck and four generic makers for allegedly reaching anti-competitive deals to delay generic versions of its antidepressant citalopram. The commission has powers to levy  fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover.

TD
Brussels' penalty for the so-called "pay for delay deal" is the first to arise from almost a decade of antitrust scrutiny of the sector. It will have wide ranging implications for settlements in such patent disputes.

It comes ahead of a US Supreme Court decision on the case brought by the Federal Trade Commission against Solvay for payments to generic producers to delay rivals of its AndroGel product, with initial indications that the judges will also take a tough line.

Joaquín Almunia, EU competition chief, sees the enforcement action as a test case for the sector, demonstrating that regulators will be unwilling to allow side-deals that harm consumers by restricting access to cheap drugs.

EU officials see direct payments or benefits offered to generic makers as a means to stifle competition by colluding to share monopoly rents. The enforcement decision will give notice that the commission will act against pharma patent settlements that effectively delay market entry of generic drugs.

The tough line in the  Lundbeck case is worrying lawyers and companies. They fear it takes a simplistic view of a complex and uncertain legal process which sometimes justifies agreements to bring a clear and rapid resolution.

Lundbeck strongly denied wrongdoing. It argued that the settlements were a legal means to protect a strong and valid production patent, which it successfully defended in court. Some of the antitrust probes of these deals are so old that they are approaching the 10-year statute of limitations.

Competition officials concluded that the settlements - which came after  Lundbeck's patent expired in some European markets - delayed market entry of the generic product by up to two years.

While some other EU commissioners are being urged to raise concerns about the decision, Mr Almunia's recommendation is highly unlikely to be overturned. He sees the implications as limited to tackling damaging anti-competitive practices among drugmakers, rather than a judgment with implications for patent enforcement in other sectors.

Since it launched a major review of the pharmaceutical industry in 2009, which identified key concerns about "pay-to-delay" agreements, Brussels has served charges in three separate cases against Lundbeck, involving Servier , Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

It comes ahead of a US Supreme Court decision on the case brought by the Federal Trade Commission against Solvay for payments to generic producers to delay rivals of its AndroGel product, with initial indications that the judges will also take a tough line.

Joaquín Almunia, EU competition chief, sees the enforcement action as a test case for the sector, demonstrating that regulators will be unwilling to allow side-deals that harm consumers by restricting access to cheap drugs.
EU officials see direct payments or benefits offered to generic makers as a means to stifle competition
by colluding to share monopoly rents. The enforcement decision will give notice that the commission will
act against pharma patent settlements that in effect delay market entry of generic drugs.

The tough line in the  Lundbeck case is worrying lawyers and companies. They fear it takes a simplistic view of a complex and uncertain legal process that sometimes justifies agreements to bring a clear and rapid resolution.

Lundbeck strongly denied wrongdoing. It argued the settlements were a legal means to protect a strong and valid production patent, which it successfully defended in court. Some antitrust probes of these
deals are so old they are approaching the 10-year statute of limitations.
Competition officials concluded the settlements - which came after  Lundbeck's patent expired in some
European markets - delayed market entry of the generic product by up to two years.

While some other EU commissioners are being urged to raise concerns about the decision, Mr Almunia's recommendation is unlikely to be overturned. He sees the implications as limited to tackling

anti-competitive practices among drugmakers, rather than a judgment with implications for patent enforcement in other sectors.

Since it launched a review of the pharmaceutical industry in 2009, Brussels has served charges in three separate cases against  Lundbeck, involving Servier, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis. Charges in the Lundbeck case were also served against offshoots of the generic groups: Merck KGaA, Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and Ranbaxy.

HD      EU fines drugs firms 150 mn euros for delaying  cheap generics

The EU executive on Wednesday imposed hefty  fines of around 150 million euros on pharmaceutical firms including Denmark's  Lundbeck for colluding to delay the sale a decade ago of a cheap generic version of a widely sold anti-depressant.

Lundbeck was fined 93.8 million euros by the  European Commission for striking a 2002 agreement with producers of generic drugs to delay the introduction on the market of its popular anti-depressant, citalopram.

TD
"It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines," said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's Competition Commissioner.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices".

The generics firms involved include notably Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. They were  fined 52.2 million euros.

The agreement between  Lundbeck and the generics producers "violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements," the Commission said in a statement.
Citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant, was  Lundbeck's best-selling product at the time.

When the Danish firm's patent for the citalopram molecule expired, one of the generics producers had started selling its own version and several others were preparing to do so.

But instead of competing with  Lundbeck, the generics companies agreed in 2002 "not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from  Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros," the Commission said.

During its investigation into the case, the EU executive found internal documents that refer to a "club" being formed and to "a pile of $$$" to be shared.

Lundbeck paid significant lump sums, purchased generics' stock for the sole purpose of destroying it under agreements designed to ensure the generics producers would stay out of the market for a set time.

However the Danish firm said it would appeal, saying it "strongly" disagreed with the ruling and believed it was "erroneous".

In a statement it said the payments "did not restrict competition" beyond the protection offered via patents rights held by Lundbeck and confirmed by the European Patent Office.

Competition from generics is known to drive prices down significantly, reducing the profits of the producer on the branded product and bringing large benefits to patients.
The EU said that prices of generic citalopram dropped on average by 90 percent in Britain compared to
Lundbeck's previous price level once widespread generic market entry took place.

HD           European regulator fines Ranbaxy and 8 others for blocking generic drugs

The European antitrust regulator today  fined nine pharmaceutical companies including Ranbaxy a total of 146 million ($195 million) for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant drug to the market.

The European Commission (EC) has fined Germany's Merck KGaA, Denmark's  Lundbeck, India's largest generic drugmaker Ranbaxy, Arrow (now part of Actavis), Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma (now a unit of Zoetis) and A.L. Industrier.

TD
Lundbeck was awarded the highest  fine of 93.8 million, while the second-largest  fine of 21.4 million was given to Merck KGaA and Ranbaxy 10.3 million.
The German drugmaker was  fined an additional 7.77 million jointly with its former subsidiary Generics
UK, which is now owned by US generic drugmaker Mylan.

The EC said that in 2002,  Lundbeck agreed with Alpharma, Merck KGaA/Generics UK, Arrow and Ranbaxy to delay the entry of cheaper generic versions of its branded blockbuster antidepressant drug Citalopram into the market.
It said that these agreements violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements. Citalopram is a blockbuster antidepressant medicine and was  Lundbeck's best-selling product at the
time. After  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of
related process patents which provided a more limited protection.

Generic drug makers could produce cheaper versions of citalopram and one of them had actually started selling its own generic version while several others had made serious preparations to do so, said the Brussels-based regulator.

Generic competition usually drives down prices significantly and bring large cost benefits to patients. The prices of generic citalopram dropped on average by 90 per cent in the UK compared to Lundbeck's previous price level.

But instead of competing, the EC alleges that generic producers agreed with  Lundbeck not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements amounting to tens of millions of euros.

The EC vice-president, Joaquin Almunia, said, "It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines.

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, has fined India’s Ranbaxy Laboratories among many other global pharmaceutical firms for blocking the supplies of cheaper medicines in the market, said a media report. The move comes after the commission found that such activities were leading to customers paying as much as 20 per cent more than their medicines. The nine companies penalized by EC include Denmark's  Lundbeck, Germany's Merck KGaA, Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industries and India's biggest pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories. "Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

HD         Lundbeck fined €94m for 'pay for delay' deals to rivals

LP
European regulators have  fined Lundbeck, the Danish pharmaceutical company, €94m for paying rivals to delay cut-price competition for one of its antidepressant medicines.

The action - which  Lundbeck said it would appeal - came after a five-year probe by the  European        Commission concluded that the company had paid several generic drug producers not to launch their own versions of the drug Citalopram once its patent expired in 2002.

TD
The decision was the latest in a series of increasingly aggressive moves by antitrust authorities on both sides of the Atlantic towards "pay for delay" deals negotiated between drug companies.

Joaquín Almunia, vice-president of the  European Commission responsible for competition policy, said: "The practices we are sanctioning are simply unacceptable. By today's decision we are confirming that these so-called 'pay-for-delay' deals constitute severe infringements of EU competition law. They may cause severe harm to patients and taxpayers and must be sanctioned accordingly."

Tim Race, pharmaceutical analyst with Deutsche Bank, said in a research note that "pay for delay" deals allowed drug companies to achieve certainty rather than pursue complex legal battles over patents. But he predicted: "This is the first case of likely many for which we will see  fines imposed."
The judgment came after the US Supreme Court this week paved the way for the Federal Trade
Commission to scrutinise such deals, after a case involving Solvay (now part of AbbVie) and Actavis.

The European Commission said Lundbeck had paid significant lump sums to generic companies, purchased their stocks of the drug in order to destroy them, and offered guaranteed profits, rather than permitting competition that would have sharply cut the price of Citalopram.

The ruling also imposed  fines of a total €52m on the recipients, including Merck of Germany, Arrow, Zoetis and Ranbaxy. It highlighted internal  Lundbeck documents referring to the creation of a "club" that would share "a pile of $$$" among participants.

But Lundbeck rejected the judgment, arguing that the Citalopram agreement had been scrutinised and cleared by the Danish authorities at the time and that it still held manufacturing patents on the drug that remained in force.

Ulf Wiinberg, chief executive, said: "I am surprised and disappointed. We have co-operated fully and we have a valid process patent. We had agreements to ensure we don't give generic companies an
advance start, and at no point was it our intention to get more out of our patents than they were intended to give us."

He called for reform of the regulatory system in Europe, which allowed approval of generic versions of drugs even while they were still under patent and ahead of the outcome of any legal challenge.

Richard Bergström, head of Efpia, the drug companies' European trade association, said: "Today's decision will only prolong patent litigation. It also weakens the protection afforded by patents and will undermine confidence in the patent system itself to the detriment of innovation and growth in Europe."

India, June 19 -- European antitrust regulators  fined nine drugmakers, including Denmark's  Lundbeck
and India's Ranbaxy, a total of 146 million euros for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant
to the market, the first EU sanction against such deals.

Ranbaxy, India's leading pharma company, was  fined 10.3 million euros (Rs. 81.06 crore), while Lundbeck was slapped the largest  fine of 93.8 million euros. Both companies said they would appeal the decision.

TD
The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" agreements between companies lead to consumers paying as much as 20 per cent more for their medicines.

The EU action came two days after the US Supreme Court said US regulators could challenge deals between brand-name drug firms and generic rivals because of the resulting higher consumer costs.

Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to market rival versions of their medicine. The generics usually cost a fraction of the original drug, though the issue is complicated by patent ownership.

In this case,  Lundbeck, one of the Nordic region's largest drugmakers, was accused of paying other companies to have them delay delivering a generic version of its anti-depressant medicine citalopram to the market.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. "The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices."

BRUSSELS--Days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that U.S. antitrust enforcers can pursue "pay for delay" cases in the pharmaceutical industry, European Union antitrust authorities  fined Danish pharmaceutical company  Lundbeck 93.8 million euros ($125.4 million) over payments to competitors to delay the market entry of generic versions of antidepressant drug citalopram.

The EU is investigating three other similar cases, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday.

The European Commission also imposed fines of EUR52.2 million on generic medicine companies including India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (500350.BY), Arrow and Merck KGaA/Generics U.K. (MRK.XE) and Alpharma, now part of Zoetis Products LLC (ZTS), for colluding in the delay.

After  Lundbeck's patent on the blockbuster antidepressant drug expired, the company paid the other companies tens of millions of euros not to enter the market and purchased generics' stock "for the sole purchase of destroying it," the commission said.

"It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market," said Mr. Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief. "Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems which are already under tight budgetary constraints."

Lundbeck said it would appeal both the decision and the  fine, and had acted in good faith.
"Lundbeck strongly disagrees with the Commission's decision," the company said in a statement. "Upon entering the agreements, they were all reviewed by external antitrust experts," the company
said. "The agreements were furthermore in 2004 reviewed by both the  European Commission and
the Danish Competition Authorities who publicly stated that it could not be rendered probable that the
agreements were restricting competition."

Mr. Almunia said that his services are "continuously monitoring" settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.

"Three more cases of similar practices are under formal investigation," he told reporters. "We will continue to fight against patent cases...paying them to stay out has nothing to do with legitimate protection of intellectual property."

He also highlighted that the U.S. Supreme Court embraced a similar approach to such cases earlier this week, when it ruled that courts should give more scrutiny to pay-for-delay cases.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has for years has sought to prohibit settlements in which
brand-name drug companies pay generic-drug makers to drop patent lawsuits that could lead to the
earliest possible sales of their cheaper versions. The agency has argued the deals deprive the public
of billions of dollars in lower drug prices, a contention the industry has disputed.

BRUSSELS--The European Union has imposed a 93.8-million-euro ($125.4 million)  fine on Danish pharmaceutical company  Lundbeck, saying it was working with other companies to delay the market entry of generic versions of its blockbuster antidepressant drug citalopram.

The European Commission also imposed fines worth EUR52.2 million on a number of generic medicine companies including India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (500350.BY), Arrow and Merck KGaA/Generics UK and Alpharma, now part of Zoetis Products LLC (ZTS), for colluding in the delay.

-Lundbeck says the agreements did not restrict competition in the market beyond the protection offered via the patent rights  Lundbeck already held.
-Lundbeck's financial guidance for 2013 is maintained excluding costs connected to the  fine.

-Lundbeck strongly disagrees with the Commission's decision which the company believes is erroneous and the company intends to appeal the decision.
-At 0938 GMT shares traded 0.2% higher at DKK101.40.

BRUSSELS--The European Union has imposed a 93.8-million-euro ($125.4 million)  fine on Danish pharmaceutical company  Lundbeck, saying it was working with other companies to delay the market entry of generic versions of its blockbuster antidepressant drug citalopram.

The European Commission also imposed fines worth EUR52.2 million on a number of generic medicine companies including India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (500350.BY), Arrow and Merck KGaA/Generics UK and Alpharma, now part of Zoetis Products LLC (ZTS), for colluding in the delay.

TD
According to a statement by the EU's antitrust authorities, after  Lundbeck's patent expired, the company paid the other companies tens of millions of euros not to enter the market and purchased generics' stock "for the sole purchase of destroying it."

"It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines," said EU anti-trust chief Joaquin Almunia. "Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems which are already under tight budgetary constraints."

HD     Delayed release of generic drugs prompts EU fine for Danish firm
WC     440 words

LP
Brussels (dpa) - Danish pharmaceutical firm  Lundbeck was hit Wednesday with a  fine of 93.8 million euros (125.6 million dollars), after the European Union found that it conspired to keep cheaper
anti-depressants off the market in a bid to maintain its profits.

Lundbeck said it will fight the  fine, arguing that the deal had been approved and cleared by EU and
Danish regulators.

TD
The company is accused of striking deals in 2002 with four generic competitors - Germany's Merck and its former British subsidiary Generics; European company arrow; US company Alpharma; and Indian company Ranbaxy - to delay the release of their lower-cost products.

"Internal documents refer to a 'club' being formed and 'a pile of $$$' to be shared among the participants," said the European Commission, the EU's executive.

In return, the other companies received money, profit guarantees and the purchase of generic stocks for destruction, the  European Commission said. It charged that this helped  Lundbeck keep up prices for its best-selling product, the anti-depressant citalopram.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. "It is unacceptable."

He encouraged people who were denied lower medication prices because of the arrangement to seek compensation.

Lundbeck's generic competitors also were slapped with different EU  fines, for a total of 52 million euros. Merck said in a statement it was considering its legal options.

Lundbeck said it "strongly disagrees with the commission's decision" and planned to appeal.

The Danish firm said the agreements "did not restrict competition in the market beyond the protection already offered by society via the patent rights  Lundbeck already held."

In addition to consulting external anti-trust experts,  Lundbeck said the agreements were "in 2004 reviewed by both the  European Commission and the Danish competition authorities who publicly stated that it could not be rendered probable that the agreements were restricting competition."

The commission has paid particular attention to the pharmaceutical industry ever since an inquiry in 2009 revealed "significant competition issues," including the practice of delaying generics.

The French pharmaceutical firm Servier, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis and the US company Johnson and Johnson are still under investigation by the EU for delaying the entry of generic cardiovascular medication and painkillers onto the market.

Almunia said the  Lundbeck case is the first involving a pharmaceutical company paying for a generics delay, but "I can promise you it will not be the last one." dpa amh lsm ncs Author: Alexandra

HD           EU fines Lundbeck, 8 others 146 mln euros for blocking cheaper drugs

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nine drugmakers, including Denmark's  Lundbeck, were fined a total of 146 million euros ($195 million) by EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant medicine to the market.

The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20 percent more for their medicines.

TD
The EU action came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court said that U.S. regulators could challenge deals between brand-name drug companies and generic rivals because of the higher consumer costs.

Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to deliver versions of their drugs, which usually cost a fraction of the original medicine, to market, although the issue is also complicated by patent ownership.

In this case,  Lundbeck was accused of paying other companies to have them delay delivering a generic version of its anti-depressant medicine citalopram to the market. Reuters first reported the fines on June 3.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
"The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices."

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, handed Lundbeck the largest  fine totaling 93.8 million euros. As a result,  Lundbeck cut its guidance for operating profits this year.

The Commission fined Germany's Merck KGaA 21.4 million euros and handed a further 7.77 million euro fine jointly to Merck and its former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan.
The other penalized companies were Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma
- which is now part of Zoetis Products LLC, A.L. Industrier and India's No. 1 pharmaceutical company
Ranbaxy.

The Commission said the generic companies agreed with  Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments, with internal company documents referring to forming "a club" and "a pile of $$$" to be shared.
It said Lundbeck also bought generics' stock and destroyed it.  Lundbeck said it would appeal the EU
decision to the courts.

The EU competition authority has two similar cases in the pipeline, involving Israel's Teva, French drugmaker Servier, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

Brand name companies have defended "pay-for-delay" deals in large part to protect patents and avoid costly litigation.

BRUSSELS—Days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that U.S. antitrust enforcers can pursue "pay for delay" cases in the pharmaceutical industry, European Union antitrust authorities  fined Danish pharmaceutical company  Lundbeck €93.8 million over payments to competitors to delay the market entry of generic versions of antidepressant drug citalopram.
The EU is investigating three other similar cases, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said
Wednesday.

TD
The European Commission also imposed fines of €52.2 million on generic medicine companies including India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, Arrow and Merck KGaA/Generics U.K. and Alpharma, now part of Zoetis Products LLC, for colluding in the delay.

After  Lundbeck's patent on the blockbuster antidepressant drug expired, the company paid the other companies tens of millions of euros not to enter the market and purchased generics' stock "for the sole purchase of destroying it," the commission said.

"It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market," said Mr. Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief. "Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems which are already under tight budgetary constraints."

Lundbeck said it would appeal both the decision and the  fine, and had acted in good faith.
"Lundbeck strongly disagrees with the Commission's decision," the company said in a statement. "Upon entering the agreements, they were all reviewed by external antitrust experts," the company
said. "The agreements were furthermore in 2004 reviewed by both the  European Commission and
the Danish Competition Authorities who publicly stated that it could not be rendered probable that the
agreements were restricting competition."

Mr. Almunia said that his services are "continuously monitoring" settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.

"Three more cases of similar practices are under formal investigation," he told reporters. "We will continue to fight against patent cases…paying them to stay out has nothing to do with legitimate protection of intellectual property."

He also highlighted that the U.S. Supreme Court embraced a similar approach to such cases earlier this week, when it ruled that courts should give more scrutiny to pay-for-delay cases.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has for years has sought to prohibit settlements in which
brand-name drug companies pay generic-drug makers to drop patent lawsuits that could lead to the
earliest possible sales of their cheaper versions. The agency has argued the deals deprive the public of
billions of dollars in lower drug prices, a contention the industry has disputed.


Page 57 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Supreme Court's 5-3 ruling, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, rejected drug industry arguments that such settlements are almost always allowable under antitrust laws because a patent gives a pharmaceutical company the right to exclude competitors from making its drug.

against such deals. The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the
pharmaceutical sector, which said pay-for-delay agreements between companies lead to consumers
paying as much as 20% more for their medicines. Original Source: Pharmalot, 2013. From website:

(Makes clear Merck KGaA/Generics UKfine included in Merck KGaA's 21.4 mln total  fine in paragraph
8)

BRUSSELS, June 19 (Reuters) - European antitrust regulators  fined nine drugmakers, including Denmark's Lundbeck, a total of 146 million euros ($195 million) for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant to the market, the first EU sanction against such deals.

TD
The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" agreements between companies lead to consumers paying as much as 20 percent more for their medicines.

The EU action came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court said U.S. regulators could challenge deals between brand-name drug firms and generic rivals because of the resulting higher consumer costs.

Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to market rival versions of their medicine. The generics usually cost a fraction of the original drug, though the issue is complicated by patent ownership.

In this case,  Lundbeck, one of the Nordic region's largest drugmakers, was accused of paying other companies to have them delay delivering a generic version of its anti-depressant medicine citalopram to the market.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Wednesday. "The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices."

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, handed Lundbeck the largest  fine, totalling 93.8 million euros.  Lundbeck said it would appeal the EU's decision but cut its guidance for operating profits this year as a result of the  fine.

The Commission fined Germany's Merck KGaA 21.4 million euros, of which 7.77 million euros was imposed jointly on Merck and its former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan.
India's No. 1 pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy, said it also plans to appeal to the EU General Court in
Luxembourg, Europe's second-highest, after it was  fined 10.3 million euros.

The other companies to be penalised were Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma - which is now part of Zoetis Products LLC, and A.L. Industrier.
GAME-CHANGING DECISIONS

The EU sanctions and the U.S. court decision could force a major change in the pharmaceutical industry, said Michael Carrier, a professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School.


Page 61 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"This week could be the most important week in the history of this concerning activity: a game-changing
U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing these suits to proceed and the first  fines issued in the EU
against this activity," he said.
The EU competition authority has two similar cases in the pipeline, one involving Israel's Teva and
French drugmaker Servier, and another related to Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

The Lundbeck case sets a precedent for EU regulatory handling of such offences, said Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race.
"This is the first case of likely many for which we will see  fines imposed," he wrote in a note.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations lobbying group said patent settlements were symptomatic of Europe's weak patent litigation system.

The Commission said the generic companies agreed with  Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments, with internal company documents referring to forming "a club" and "a pile of $$$" to be shared.
It said Lundbeck also bought rivals' stock and destroyed it.

Since Reuters flagged the EU's decision on June 3,  Lundbeck shares have lost 7.5 percent or 220 million euros of the firm's market value, said Deutsche Bank's Race. The stock traded 1.28 percent higher at 1219 GMT on Wednesday.

COPENHAGEN, June 19 (Reuters) - Danish pharmaceutical group Lundbeck cut guidance for operating profits this year after the  European Commission said it would fine the company 93 million euros for violation of competition law.

Lundbeck said in a statement on Wednesday the commission had decided that  Lundbeck's agreements concluded with four generic competitors concerning antidepressant citalopram, had violated competition law.

While keeping 2013 guidance for revenue intact, it said it saw operating profits in a range of 1.2 billion Danish crowns and 1.7 billion ($215.43 million to $305.20 million) against a previous forecast before the fine of 1.9 billion to 2.4 billion.

Lundbeck said it disagreed with the decision and intended to appeal. ($1 = 5.5702 Danish crowns) (Reporting by Mette Fraende; editing by James Jukwey)

AstraZeneca turnaround is 3-4 year journey, says CEO

TD
LONDON (Reuters) - Turning around drugmaker AstraZeneca will be a long haul, with a strategy of revamping research and boosting acquisitions set to take up to four years to pay off, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Speaking as the group unveiled the location for a new global headquarters and research center in Cambridge, England, Pascal Soriot said he was not expecting any short-term fixes for the group, which is struggling from falling sales as patents expire.

Analysis: Hospital investors sold on U.S. health reform despite bumps

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. hospital operators have been on a tear this year, on average posting triple the gains of the broader stock market, as investors tallied up the benefits of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform. While some on Wall Street have held back amid signs of trouble as U.S. states prepare to implement the reform law, long-term investors still see more reward than risk on the horizon for hospital stocks.
AstraZeneca, Bristol diabetes drug disappoints in key test

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb's diabetes drug Onglyza failed to reduce heart risks in a large clinical study, disappointing investors who had thought it might demonstrate an edge over rivals. The companies, which jointly sell several diabetes drugs, said on Wednesday the
so-called SAVOR trial showed that patients on Onglyza had no fewer adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, than those on placebo.
Enroll America sets private outreach for Obamacare sign-up

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Enroll America, a nonprofit group at the center of the political fight over President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, launched a multi-state grassroots campaign on Tuesday to help sign up millions of uninsured Americans for health coverage in the coming months. The group, which has strong ties to the Obama administration and the healthcare industry, announced plans for more than 50 events in 18 states, including California, Florida and Texas, as part of its "Get Covered America" campaign. The events include canvassing neighborhoods and speeches at churches and other local venues to explain the need for health insurance, particularly among younger people, whose participation could determine whether "Obamacare" succeeds or fails.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical companies need to boost the benefits of drug research by working with regulators and healthcare providers to overhaul the way medicines are approved and paid for, a thinktank backed by investors says. After years of disappointing research and development (R&D) productivity, a new report backed by leading institutional investors sees "early indications of a recovery", with U.S. approvals of new drugs last year the highest since 1996.
WHO urges tougher food marketing rules to curb childhood obesity

LONDON (Reuters) - The marketing of unhealthy foods to children has proven "disastrously effective", driving obesity by using cheap social media channels to promote fat-, salt- and sugar-laden foods, the World Health Organisation's Europe office said on Tuesday. The United Nations health agency called for tighter controls on such marketing, saying tougher regulations were crucial to winning the fight against childhood obesity.
Outbreak of deadly piglet virus spreads to 13 U.S. states

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A swine virus deadly to young pigs, one never before seen in North America, is spreading rapidly across the United States and proving harder to control than previously believed. The virus now has spread to 13 states - with more than 100 positive cases to date - since it was first diagnosed in the United States last month, said Montserrat Torremorell, the Allen D. Leman Chair in Swine Health and Productivity at the University of Minnesota's College of Veterinary Medicine.
Industry-backed studies more prominent at meetings

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Studies that are funded by pharmaceutical companies or involve industry-backed scientists tend to be more prominent at cancer meetings than independent studies, a new report suggests. "Figuring out the reasons behind these findings is critical," said Dr. Beverly Moy, who led the analysis at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.
Obamacare-like groups tied to lower costs: study

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Large independent doctor practices that focus on primary care tend to spend less money and are more likely to meet guidelines for Americans on Medicare than smaller groups, according to a new study. The findings suggest that the so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act may improve the quality of care while lowering spending, said the study's lead author.

Valby, Copenhagen, 2013-06-19 11:25 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Lundbeck intends to appeal the decision from the  European Commission
-- The European Commission has decided that  Lundbeck’s agreements concluded

TD
with four generic competitors concerning citalopram violated competition law

-- The decision includes fining  Lundbeck EUR 93 million -- Lundbeck’s financial guidance for 2013 is maintained excluding costs connected to the  fine -- Lundbeck is very disappointed that the Commission has come to this


the
conclusion and strongly disagrees with the Commission’s decision which

company believes is erroneous

-- The company intends to appeal the decision

Valby, Denmark, 19 June 2013 - H.  Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) today received the  European                 Commission’s decision that the company’s agreements concluded with four generic competitors concerning citalopram violated competition law. The decision, that  Lundbeck intends to appeal, includes fining Lundbeck EUR 93 million (approximately DKK 700 million).

Lundbeck strongly disagrees with the Commission’s decision. It asserts that any settlement agreements involving a transfer of value from an originator to a generic company is a restriction of competition and the value transfer reflects an understanding that the patent is invalid or weak. This approach is erroneous. There is no question about the validity of  Lundbeck’s process patents at issue. Patent settlement agreements are efficiency enhancing and legitimate when there are bona fide grounds for dispute.

The agreements did not restrict competition in the market beyond the protection already offered by society via the patent rights  Lundbeck already held and as has been confirmed by the European Patent Office (EPO). Over 600 meticulous analyses of the generic citalopram demonstrated that they were all produced with infringing processes. Furthermore, in many concurrent documents the generic companies acknowledged that their products violated  Lundbeck’s patents.

Lundbeck welcomes competition between companies.  Lundbeck also strongly believes in and advocates for a level-playing field, which includes that intellectual property rights should not be ignored and infringed by third parties, since this seriously damages innovators’ investments and reduce their incentives to innovate.

The company acted transparently and in good faith in trying to protect our patents. Upon entering the agreements they were all reviewed by external anti-trust experts. The agreements were furthermore in
2004 reviewed by both the  European Commission and the Danish Competition Authorities who publically stated that it could not be rendered probable that the agreements were restricting competition.


Page 66 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Background

In 2008, the  European Commission initiated a wide-ranging sector inquiry of the pharmaceutical industry to review possible anti-competitive conduct.

In 2010, the  European Commission opened a formal investigation against  Lundbeck to investigate possible infringement of European competition law relating to restrictive business practices and abuse of a dominant market position. Specifically, the Commission has investigated whether  Lundbeck's agreements with generic manufacturers have delayed the entry of generic citalopram into markets in the EEA.

In July 2012 the  European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to  Lundbeck regarding agreements concluded with four generic competitors concerning citalopram.
Financial guidance

For the full year 2013,  Lundbeck still expects reported revenue to be DKK 14.4-15.0 billion and EBIT to be DKK 1.9-2.4 billion before costs incurred in connection with the  fine of EUR 93 million (approximately DKK 700 million). Including the  fine, Lundbeck now expects revenue of DKK 14.4-15.0 billion (unchanged) and EBIT of DKK 1.2-1.7 billion.

HD     European Commissionfines 9 pharma firms, including Ranbaxy

New Delhi: The  European Commission on Wednesday imposed a  fine of 146 million euros on nine pharma companies, including Ranbaxy Laboratories, for delaying market entry of cheaper generic versions of Danish company Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant. According to
information available on the European Commission (EC) website, Ranbaxy Laboratories has been  fined euro 10.32 million (over Rs 80 crore). "The European Commission has imposed a fine of euro 93.8 million on Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and fines totalling euro 52.2 million on several producers of generic medicines," EC said. In 2002, Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant, it added. "These agreements violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ? TFEU)," EC said.

TD
The generic companies which have been  fined are Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. The  fine on Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Ranbaxy (UK) Limited, is euro 1,03,23,000. Commenting on the development, European Commission Vice-President Joaqu?n Almunia (in charge of competition policy), said: "It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines. "Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive
practices". Reacting to the fine, Ranbaxy Laboratories said: "Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the
molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the Decision to the General Court of the European Union." These events took place over ten years ago, and the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law, it said, adding it believed it has strong grounds of appeal. Citalopram is a blockbuster antidepressant medicine and was  Lundbeck's best-selling product at the time. EC said after  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection. Producers of cheaper, generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market. "But instead of competing, the generic producers agreed with Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros," EC said. It further said  Lundbeck paid significant lump sums, purchased generics' stock for the sole purpose of destroying it, and offered guaranteed profits in a distribution pact. "The agreements gave  Lundbeck the certainty that the generics producers would stay out of the market for the duration of the agreements without giving the generic producers any guarantee of market entry thereafter," the EC statement said. These agreements are very different from other settlements of patent disputes where generic companies are not simply paid off to stay out of the market, it added. For Ranbaxy the  fine by the EC comes close on the heels of its agreement with US authorities last month under which it had agreed to pay a  fine of USD
500 million after pleading guilty to 'felony charges' over violation of approved manufacturing norms at its two facilities in India.

Merck has to pay an EU  fine of EUR 21.4 M because it forced up prices. The  European Commission believes Merck and several other companies delayed the launch of cheaper generic versions of antidepressant citalopram in Europe. The cartel has kept the price of the drug high. Merck is considering complaining to the European Court over the  fine. The cartel was instigated by Danish company Lundbeck, which developed citalopram and then ensured that generics only came onto the market later. Lundbeck thus has to pay the largest fine EUR 93.8 M. Four generics producers, with whom  Lundbeck
is said to have colluded, received a fine totalling EUR 52.2 M.  Lundbeck is to take legal steps against the EU decision. Original Source: Handelsblatt,  http://www.handelsblatt.com/, Copyright Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH & Co KG 2013.

European Commission levies a fine of 146 mn euros on nine pharma firms, including Ranbaxy for delaying the market entry of cheaper generic versions of Danish company  Lundbeck's branded citalopram

New Delhi: The  European Commission imposed a fine of 146 million euros on nine pharma companies, including Ranbaxy Laboratories, for delaying market entry of cheaper generic versions of Danish company Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant, reports PTI.

TD
According to information available on the  European Commission (EC) website, Ranbaxy Laboratories has been fined euro 10.32 million (over Rs 80 crore).

"The European Commission has imposed a fine of euro 93.8 million on Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and fines totalling euro 52.2 million on several producers of generic medicines," EC said.

In 2002, Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant, it added. "These agreements violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - TFEU)," EC said.

The generic companies which have been  fined are Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. The fine on Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Ranbaxy (UK) Limited, is euro 1,03,23,000.

For Ranbaxy the  fine by the EC comes close on the heels of its agreement with US authorities last month under which it had agreed to pay a  fine of USD 500 million after pleading guilty to 'felony charges' over violation of approved manufacturing norms at its two facilities in India.

Commenting on the development,  European Commission Vice -President Joaquin Almunia (in charge of competition policy), said: "It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices".

Reacting on the fine, the Gurgaon-based firm said: "Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the Decision to the General Court of the European Union."

These events took place over ten years ago, and the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law, it said, adding it believed it has strong grounds of appeal.

EC said after  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection. Producers of cheaper, generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market.

"But instead of competing, the generic producers agreed with Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros," EC said.

New Delhi: Indian drug giant Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd is likely to file an appeal against an European Union anti-trust commission's decision to  fine the drugmaker for delaying access to a generic version of best-selling anti-depressant medicine Citalopram in the EU market, media reports said.

Earlier Wednesday, the EU anti-trust commission had slapped a total fine of 146 million euros on nine drugmakers, including Ranbaxy and Danish pharmaceutical major Lundbeck, for blocking the supply of a low-cost generic anti-depressant drug to the market.

The Indian drug firm would have to pay 10.3 million euros as penalty.

"Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the  European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the Decision to the General Court of the European Union," media quoted an unidentified company spokesperson of Ranbaxy as saying.

Besides, "these events took place over 10 years ago, and the company (Ranbaxy) considers that the (European) Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law. Ranbaxy believes it has strong grounds of appeal. Ranbaxy respects, and is committed to conducting its business in compliance with, European law," the spokesperson added.

Recently, Ranbaxy had agreed to pay a penalty of $500 million to the US drug regulator for making fraudulent statements about how it tested medicines at two of its plants in India.

European antitrust regulators on Wednesday slapped nine drug-makers, including India-based Ranbaxy, with a hefty  fine of _146 million (Rs 1,150 crore) for blocking the supply of cheaper generic drugs in the market.

The European Commission (EC) found the drug-makers guilty of blocking the launch of cheaper versions of antidepressant drug citalopram, which is produced by Denmark-based  Lundbeck.

TD
In 2002,  Lundbeck had hit agreements with the nine drug-makers to delay the launch of cheaper generic versions of citalopram. The EU ruled that those agreements violated its anti-trust rules that disallow anti-competitive agreements.

Ranbaxy alone was fined 1,03,23,000 (roughly Rs 80cr). But, Ranbaxy argued that its stance was not wrong, and that it would appeal the decision at the EU's general court.

A spokesperson for Ranbaxy said that the drug-maker was disappointed with the EU's decision to rule its agreement with  Lundbeck as anti-competitive. Speaking on the topic, the spokesperson added, "These events took place over 10 years ago. And the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law."
Apart from Ranbaxy, the generic drug-makers  fined by the EC included Alpharma, Arrow and Merck
KGaA/Generics UK.

HD         Europe Fines Drug Companies  for Delaying Generics

BRUSSELS — Europe’s top antitrust enforcer continued a crackdown on drug companies’ efforts to keep low-cost generic versions of their medicines off the market, a campaign that is taking place on both sides of the Atlantic.

On Wednesday, the European Commissionfined a Danish pharmaceutical company and a number of generic producers a total of 146 million euros, or $195 million.The commission said that  Lundbeck of Denmark colluded with companies like Ranbaxy of India and Merck of Germany in 2002 and 2003 to delay market entry of a less expensive generic version of a blockbuster antidepressant called citalopram. Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for competition, said that  Lundbeck also destroyed significant quantities of the low-cost version of the drug.

TD
“All this occurred at the expense of patients who were deprived of access to cheaper medicines,” Mr. Almunia said at a  news conference on Wednesday. “It also harmed our public health systems, who for a longer period had to artificially bear the costs of an expensive medicine and one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants.”Lundbeck said it had done nothing wrong and would appeal the decision. “The company acted transparently and in good faith in trying to protect our patents,”  Lundbeck said in a statement. “Upon entering the agreements, they were all reviewed by external antitrust experts.”

The case mirrors a decision on Monday by the United States Supreme Court, which empowers the Federal Trade Commission to sue drug makers that engage in so-called pay-for-delay tactics. The Supreme Court decision is likely to increase the number of generic drugs, in that way benefiting consumers. The F.T.C. said that pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.

Many European governments with socialized medical systems buy or help to pay for prescription drugs used by citizens, which means that the blocking of generics affects those nations’ budgets. Mr. Almunia said that when generic versions of citalopram became available in Britain, during the second half of
2004, prices there dropped by 90 percent.

The scale of savings in Britain helped to ensure that “public health systems can remain economically sustainable in these times of difficult budgetary constraints,” Mr. Almunia said. Peter Kaplan, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, would not comment on the European decision, but he indicated that officials had been coordinating on the issue of drug pricing. “F.T.C. staffers have had productive policy discussions with their counterparts in the E.U. on the pay-for-delay issue, which is a longstanding enforcement priority at the F.T.C.,” Mr. Kaplan said.
Similarly, European Union officials said their decision on Wednesday was not timed to follow the
Supreme Court case.

Early this year, the commission accused the drug giants Johnson & Johnson and Novartis of colluding to delay the availability of a generic version of fentanyl, a drug often used to ease severe pain. A year ago, the commission accused the French pharmaceutical company Servier and competitors of delaying the generic entry of perindopril, a cardiovascular medicine. And in 2011, the commission opened an investigation into whether the American pharmaceutical company Cephalon and the generic maker

Page 77 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Teva of Israel hindered the entry of the generic version of modafinil, used for the treatment of certain types of sleeping disorders.
Those cases still are pending.

In the Lundbeck case, Mr. Almunia’s office said that various generic makers colluded with the Danish company, agreeing to not enter the market in return for “substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros.” Commission officials said that they had found documents referring to a “ ‘club’ being formed and ‘a pile of $$$’ to be shared among the participants.”

The European Commissionfined Lundbeck 93.8 million euros, which amounts to roughly 4.6 percent of its 2012 sales. The regulator can fine companies up to 10 percent of annual sales.

HD     EC Fines Lundbeck, Generics Millions For Pay-for-Delay  Settlement

The European Commission (EC) Wednesday slapped  Lundbeck with a nearly $126 million  fine, and levied fines totaling $70 million on four of its generic rivals, for their respective roles in 2002 pay-for-delay settlement deals tied to the Danish drugmaker's antidepressant citalopram.
The four generic drugmakers  fined were India's Ranbaxy, Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck
KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan) and Arrow (now part of Actavis).

TD
Critics of the practice, also known as reverse payments, were likely to be buoyed by the timing of the commission's enforcement action as it came on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's Monday decision in FTC v. Actavis. The justices ruled pay-for-delay deals can sometime violate antitrust law, making it easier for legal challenges to be brought against industry (DID, June 18).

The European Commission found the agreements violated EU antitrust rules, housed in Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that prohibit agreements between two or more independent market operators which restrict competition (DID, July 26, 2012).

Citalopram was Lundbeck's best-selling product at the time, but the expiry of the drug's basic patent left the drugmaker with only a number of limited-protection patents to maintain its exclusivity. Generic drugmakers were readily prepping their market entry when  Lundbeck offered big payments and "inducements" to hold off production of generic versions of the drug.

EC Vice President Joaquin Almunia said the practice delays the availability of cheaper drugs to the detriment of patients and national health systems "already under tight budgetary constraints."
"The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices," he added.

Lundbeck said it strongly disagrees with the Commission's decision and is planning an appeal.

The fines flow from a massive, years-long effort by the EC to crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices. The commission launched an inquiry in January 2008 to investigate why fewer new drugs made it to market and why generic entry seemed to be delayed in some cases.

The inquiry results prompted the EC to launch a series of surprise inspections at the offices of European pharmaceutical companies in an attempt to dig up evidence of antitrust business practices and to further investigate those companies suspected of doing so (DID, Dec. 10, 2009).

The EC opened a formal investigation against  Lundbeck in 2010 (DID, Jan. 8, 2010). Such actions continued at Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, among others (DID, Oct. 24, 2011).

Earlier this month, the commission doubled down on those efforts, establishing a legal framework to address pay-for-delay cases. The EC on June 11 adopted a proposal for a directive that aims to make it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to collect damages, particularly patients and the public, which rarely seek out compensation. The directive would standardize the process across the EU's member states and grant national courts the power to remove certain obstacles, such as access to evidence or the burden of proving infringement.

The competition watchdog on Wednesday imposed a  fine on Ranbaxy Labs, among other generic firms and innovator firm, Denmark-based  Lundbeck, for postponing the launch of low-cost generic version of Citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant in the EU market."Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the  European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the decision to the General Court of the European Union," a company spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added,"These events took place over ten years ago, and the company considers that the commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law.
Ranbaxy believes it has strong grounds of appeal.
Ranbaxy respects and is committed to conducting its business in compliance with, European law". The commission slapped a  fine of Euro 93.8 million on  Lundbeck while all generic firms, including
Ranbaxy, will have to pay a penalty of $52.2 million.
The other generic firms include Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK
is now part of Mylan) and Arrow (now part of Actavis).

Lundbeck entered into this deal with the generic firms in 2002.
These agreements violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements, said an EU
anti-commission statement."It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its
market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines.

Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints.

The commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices," said Joaquín Almunia, EU antitrust competition commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy.

The competition watchdog had noted in its 'preliminary view' in July 2012 that the patent settlement agreements between  Lundbeck and other generic firms including Ranbaxy aimed at preventing the market entry of cheaper generic medicines, in violation of EU antitrust rules.

Its investigation had found that  Lundbeck had paid four of these generic firms to postpone launch of their cheaper versions in the European market even after patents of its blockbuster drug Citalopram expired."Experience shows that effective generic competition drives prices down significantly, reducing

dramatically the profits of the producer of the branded product and bringing large benefits to patients," the commission said in a statement.

For instance, prices of generic Citalopram eroded on average by 90% in the UK compared to Lundbeck's previous price level once widespread generic market entry took place following the discontinuation of the agreements.

But instead of competing, the generic producers agreed with Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros."Internal documents refer to a 'club' being formed and 'a pile of $$$ ' to be shared among the participants.

Lundbeck paid significant lump sums, purchased generics' stock for the sole purpose of destroying it, and offered guaranteed profits in a distribution agreement," the EU statement said.

The agreements gave  Lundbeck the certainty that the generics producers would stay out of the market for the duration of the agreements without giving the generic producers any guarantee of market entry thereafter.

These agreements are very different from other settlements of patent disputes where generic companies are not simply paid off to stay out of the market, the statement said.

Ranbaxy to appeal against the EU charges of delaying access to a generic version of a blockbuster anti-depressant

Pharma firms  fined

The European Commission imposed fines yesterday (19 June) totalling €145 million on Danish pharmaceutical firm Lundbeck and four generic rivals for what it judged were anti-competitive agreements. The Commission said that payments made to keep cheaper copy drugs off the market breached EU anti-trust rules. The firms have said they would appeal against the  fines.

Credit-rating rules

Stricter rules for credit-rating agencies operating in the EU come into force today (20 June). The legislation aims at decreasing reliance on credit-rating agencies and improving the quality of ratings.
Transaction tax backed

Members of the European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee voted on Tuesday (18 June) to support the Commission’s proposal for a financial transaction tax to include a range of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds and derivatives. MEPs have only a consultative role on tax matters; a group of 11 member states that want to introduce a transaction tax must agree on the details before it can come into effect.
Legal advice ruling

The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that legal advice given by law firms or a decision of a national competition authority does not exempt an undertaking from anti-competitive conduct or from the imposition of a  fine. The case arose from a cartel of freight forwarding agents in Austria, dating back to 1994.
Employment plans

The Commission on Monday (17 June) launched plans to make national employment services more effective in helping people find jobs. As part of the plan announced by László Andor, the European commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, services across the EU will be encouraged to work together and share best practice.
Credit card fees

The Commission started on 13 June to ask companies what they think about Visa’s offer to cap the fees it charges banks for credit-card transactions. Visa last month made an offer to reduce the fees by up to 60%, to 0.3% of the value of the transaction, in a bid to stave off a possible  fine if found guilty of breaching EU anti-trust rules.

The European Commission (EC) imposed yesterday a  fine of EUR 146 million on nine drug makers whose actions delayed the market launch of generic drugs.
According to the EC, the nine pharma companies struck so-called pay-for-delay deals under which
generic drug makers had to delay the launch of generic medicines. This harmed both free competition and
consumers' interests.

TD
Danish group Lundbeck will have to pay EUR 94 million of the overall amount, thus being the most affected company by the antitrust probe. Second comes German Merck with EUR 21.4 million. The other implicated pharma groups are Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharm, A.L. Industrier and Ranbaxy.

PHARMACEUTICALS

European regulators have  fined Lundbeck, the Danish pharmaceuticals company, €94m for paying rivals to delay cut-price competition for one of its antidepressant medicines.

TD
The action - which  Lundbeck said it would appeal - came after a five-year probe by the  European        Commission concluded that the company had paid several generic drug producers not to launch their own versions of the drug Citalopram once its patent expired in 2002.

The decision was the latest in a series of increasingly aggressive moves by antitrust authorities on both sides of the Atlantic towards " pay for delay " deals negotiated between drug companies.

Joaquín Almunia, vice-president of the  European Commission responsible for competition policy, said: "The practices we are sanctioning are simply unacceptable. By today's decision we are confirming that these so-called 'pay for delay' deals constitute severe infringements of EU competition law. They may cause severe harm to patients and taxpayers and must be sanctioned accordingly."

Tim Race, pharmaceutical analyst with Deutsche Bank, said in a research note that "pay for delay" deals allowed drug companies to achieve certainty rather than pursue complex legal battles over patents. But he predicted: "This is the first case of likely many for which we will see  fines imposed."
The judgment came after the US Supreme Court this week paved the way for the Federal Trade
Commission to scrutinise such deals, after a case involving Solvay (now part of AbbVie) and Actavis.

The European Commission said Lundbeck had paid significant lump sums to generic companies, purchased their stocks of the drug in order to destroy them, and offered guaranteed profits, rather than permitting competition that would have sharply cut the price of Citalopram.

The ruling also imposed  fines of a total €52m on the recipients, including Merck of Germany, Arrow, Zoetis and Ranbaxy.

But Lundbeck rejected the judgment, arguing that the Citalopram agreement had been scrutinised and cleared by the Danish authorities at the time and that it still held manufacturing patents on the drug that remained in force.

Ulf Wiinberg, chief executive, said: "I am surprised and disappointed. We have co-operated fully and we have a valid process patent. We had agreements to ensure we don't give generic companies an
advance start, and at no point was it our intention to get more out of our patents than they were intended to give us."

He called for reform of the regulatory system in Europe, which allowed approval of generic versions of drugs even while they were still under patent and ahead of the outcome of any legal challenge.

Richard Bergström, head of Efpia, the drug companies' European trade association, said: "Today's decision will only prolong patent litigation. It also weakens the protection afforded by patents and will undermine confidence in the patent system itself to the detriment of innovation and growth in Europe."

New Delhi, June 20 -- The  European Commission on Wednesday imposed a  fine of 146 million euros ( R1,138 crore) on nine pharma companies, including Ranbaxy Laboratories, for delaying market entry of cheaper generic versions of Danish company  Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant.

Ranbaxy Laboratories has been  fined over R80 crore, as per the information available on the website of European Commission (EC). "The  European Commission has imposed fines totalling euro 52.2 million ( R407 crore) on several producers of generic medicines," EC said.

TD
The punishments follow a 2009 report by the EC, which said "pay-for-delay" deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20% more for medicines.

However, Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the  European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the decision to the general court of the European Union. "These events took place
over ten years ago, and the company considers that the commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law. We believe we have strong grounds of appeal," press statement by Ranbaxy Laboratories said.

India, June 20 -- The European antitrust regulators, on Wednesday, slapped a  fine of 146 million euro on nine pharma companies, including Ranbaxy Laboratories, for blocking the market entry of cheaper generic versions of Danish company Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster anti-depressant.
While, the European Commissionfined euro 93.8 million on Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, a fine of euro 10.32 million was imposed on Ranbaxy Laboratories.The penalty follows a 2009 report by the European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which pointed at 'pay-for-delay' agreements between companies, leading to consumers paying as much as 20 percent more for their medicines.
Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to market rival versions of their medicine.

TD
These agreements violated the EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union -TFEU).Further, country's largest pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy now plans to appeal to the EU General Court in Luxembourg, Europe's
second-highest, after being  fined 10.3 million euros.

HD     ANTI-TRUST POLICY : LUNDBECK FINED FOR BLOCKING GENERIC RIVALS WC    867 words

€93,8 million. That is the fine the European Commission levied, on 19 June, against Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck for having entered into an agreement, in 2002, with various laboratories to delay the placing on the market of the generic version of citalopram, a "blockbuster"
anti-depressant it produced. These generics contain the same molecule as the original (princeps) but are sold on average 40% cheaper than princeps as soon as the patent has expired or is about to (see Europolitics 4658). It is the first time the Commission has penalised a so-called "pay-for-delay" agreement
- by which a laboratory enters into an agreement with one or several laboratories producing generics to delay the entry onto the market of said generics (see Insight on Big Pharma in Europolitics 4553). These generic companies were Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy.

TD
These laboratories were  fined in total €52.2 million.

The Commissioner for Competition, Joaquín Almunia, said that "It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines. Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anti-competitive practices".

Citalopram is a blockbuster antidepressant medicine and was  Lundbeck's best-selling product at the time. After Lund-beck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents, which provided a more limited protection. Producers of cheaper, generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market. Indeed, one of them had actually started selling its own generic version of citalopram and several other producers had made serious preparations
to do so. This new competition should have led to a drop in the price of the medicine. But instead of competing, the generic producers agreed with Lundbeck, in 2002, not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions euro. Internal documents refer to a "club" being formed and "a pile of $$$" to be shared among the participants. Lundbeck paid significant lump sums, purchased generics' stock for the sole purpose of destroying it, and offered guaranteed profits in a distribution agreement, the Commission notes. "The agreements gave Lundbeck the certainty that the generics producers would stay out of the market for the duration of the agreements without giving the generic producers any guarantee of market entry thereafter." These agreements are very different from other settlements of patent disputes where generic companies are not simply paid off to stay out of the market. For example, prices of generic citalopram dropped on average by
90% in the UK, compared to  Lundbeck's previous price level once wide-spread generic market entry took place following the discontinuation of the agreements.
MONITORING

The EU executive sent the parties a statement of objections in July 2012 (see Europolitics 4473), but it has been closely following this type of agreement since its big investigation into competition in the pharmaceuticals sector in 2008. Moreover, the Commission launched an in-depth investigation into this type of agreement between several manufacturers of generics and the Servier laboratory (3892) concerning a cardio-vascular medicine (perindopril). The Commission also suspects Johnson & Johnson and subsidiaries of Novartis generics of similar practices to push back the introduction in the Netherlands of generic versions in patch form of the painkiller fentanyl. The Commission sent both Servier and Johnson & Johnson a statement of objections, on 31 January (4291 and 4577).

In addition, the Commission has been monitoring patent settlements in order to identify those settlements that could be potentially problematic from an anti-trust perspective - namely those that limit generics' entry against a value transfer from an originator to a generic company. The latest report, published in July 2012, indicates that the proportion of such potentially problematic settlements has stabilised at the low level of
11%. The report therefore shows that the vast majority of patent settlements are unproblematic from the point of view of anti-trust rules. The number of patent settlements has significantly increased since the sector inquiry, suggesting that the Commission's action has not hindered pharmaceutical companies from concluding legitimate settlements. At the same time, the persistence of potentially problematic settlements shows that the Commission has reason to remain vigilant.

MUMBAI: EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday imposed  fines totalling 146 million euros (Rs 1,150 crore) on nine global drugmakers, including Ranbaxy, for blocking the supply of cheaper versions of Danish company Lundbeck's antidepressant drug citalopram. Ranbaxy, which needs to pay a penalty of 10.3 million euros (around Rs 80 crore), is expected to appeal against the EU decision.

Lundbeck has to pay damages of 94 million euros while the others  fined include Alpharma (now part of
Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan) and Arrow (now part of Actavis).

In 2002,  Lundbeck had entered into agreements with each of these companies to delay the entry of cheaper generic versions of its blockbuster citalopram, the EC said. The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20% more for their medicines.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement, adding, "The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices."

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, imposed a 21.4 million euro  fine on Germany's Merck KGaA, and another 7.77 million euros on it jointly with former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by US generic drugmaker Mylan.

Ranbaxy may appeal against the EU order. When contacted, a Ranbaxy spokesperson said "the company is disappointed with the decision by the  European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the decision to the General Court of the European Union. These events took place over 10 years ago, and the company considers that the commission has misunderstood the facts, and misapplied the law. It believes it has strong grounds of appeal."

In 2002, after  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection. Producers of generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market. But instead of competing, generic
companies agreed with  Lundbeck not to enter the market in return for substantial payments, and other inducements amounting to tens of millions of euros, the EC said.

The agreements gave  Lundbeck the certainty that generics producers would stay out of the market for duration of the agreements, without giving the generic producers any guarantee of market entry thereafter.

Penalty For Pacts To Delay Cheaper Antidepressant

Mumbai: EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday imposed  fines totalling 146 million euros (Rs 1,150 crore) on nine global drugmakers, including Ranbaxy, for blocking the supply of cheaper versions of Danish company Lundbeck's antidepressant drug citalopram.

Ranbaxy, which needs to pay a penalty of 10.3 million euros (around Rs 80 crore), is expected to appeal against the EU decision.

The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20% more for their medicines.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement, adding,"The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices."

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, imposed a 21.4 million euro  fine on Germany's Merck KGaA, and another 7.77 million euros on it jointly with former subsidiary Generics UK.
Ranbaxy may appeal against the EU order.
When contacted, a Ranbaxy spokesperson said "the company is disappointed with the decision by the
European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the
molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the decision to the General Court of the
European Union.

These events took place over 10 years ago, and the company considers that the commission has misunderstood the facts, and misapplied the law.
It believes it has strong grounds of appeal."

In 2002, after  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection.
Producers of generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market.

But instead of competing, generic companies agreed with  Lundbeck not to enter the market in return for substantial payments, and other inducements amounting to tens of millions of euros, the EC said.

HD     Belgium  : Antitrust - Commission fines Lundbeck and other pharma companies for delaying market entry of generic medicines

The European Commission has imposed a fine of 93,8 million on Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and fines totalling 52,2 million on several producers of generic medicines. In 2002,  Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant. These agreements violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU). These generic companies were notably Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy.

TD
Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "It is unacceptable
that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines.
Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight
budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices".

Citalopram is a blockbuster antidepressant medicine and was  Lundbeck's best-selling product at the time. After  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection. Producers of cheaper, generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market. Indeed, one of them had actually started selling its own generic version of citalopram and several other producers had made serious preparations to do so.

Experience shows that effective generic competition drives prices down significantly, reducing dramatically the profits of the producer of the branded product and bringing large benefits to patients. For example, prices of generic citalopram dropped on average by 90% in the UK compared to  Lundbeck's previous price level once wide-spread generic market entry took place following the discontinuation of the agreements.

But instead of competing, the generic producers agreed with Lundbeck in 2002 not to enter the market in return for substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros. Internal documents refer to a "club" being formed and "a pile of $$$" to be shared among the participants.  Lundbeck paid significant lump sums, purchased generics' stock for the sole purpose of destroying it, and offered guaranteed profits in a distribution agreement. The agreements gave  Lundbeck the certainty that the generics producers would stay out of the market for the duration of the agreements without giving the generic producers any guarantee of market entry thereafter. These agreements are
very different from other settlements of patent disputes where generic companies are not simply paid off to stay out of the market.

In 2002,  Lundbeck inked agreement with nine pharmaceutical companies to postpone the launch of citalopram, its generic antidepressant medicine. Now, the nine pharma companies including Ranbaxy Laboratories have been charged with a cumulative  fine of EUR 146 M by the European Commission for the deal with  Lundbeck. Ranbaxy Laboratories was asked to pay EUR 10.32 M, Lundbeck with EUR
93.8 M, Merck with EUR 21.4 M, out of which EUR 7.77 M was imposed jointly on Merck and its former subsidiary Generics UK. In 2009, the EU reported that the consumers have to pay 20% more due to the pay-for-delay agreements between brand-name drug firms and generic competitor. To address this issue, the US Supreme Court declared that the US regulators are free to look into the deals between the generic sellers and branded companies.

HD          EU fines nine pharma firms for blocking cheaper drugs

Nine drugmakers, including Denmark's  Lundbeck, were fined a total of 146 million euros ($195 million) by EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant medicine to the market.

The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said "pay-for-delay" deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20% more for their medicines.

TD
The EU action came two days after the US Supreme Court said that US regulators could challenge deals between brand-name drug companies and generic rivals because of the higher consumer costs. Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to deliver versions of their drugs, which usually cost a fraction of the original medicine, to market, although the issue is also complicated by patent ownership. In this case,  Lundbeck was accused of paying other companies to have them delay delivering a generic version of its anti-depressant medicine citalopram to the market. Reuters first reported the  fines on June 3.

"Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints," said EU Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "The Commission will not tolerate such anti-competitive practices." The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member European Union, handed Lundbeck the largest  fine totalling 93.8 million euros. As a result,  Lundbeck cut its guidance for operating profits this year.

The Commission fined Germany's Merck 21.4 million euros and handed a further 7.77 million euro fine jointly to Merck and its former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by US generic drugmaker Mylan.

press trust of india NEW DELHI, 19 JUNE: The  European Commission today imposed a fine of euro
146 million on nine pharma companies, including Ranbaxy Laboratories, for delaying market entry of
cheaper generic versions of Danish company  Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster
antidepressant. According to information available on the  European Commission (EC) website,
Ranbaxy Laboratories has been fined euro 10.32 million (more than Rs 80 crore). “The European
Commission has imposed a fine of euro 93.8 million on Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck
and fines totalling euro 52.2 million on several producers of generic medicines,” EC said. In 2002,
Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of
Lundbeck's branded citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant, it added. “These agreements violated EU
anti-trust rules that prohibit anti-competitive agreements (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union),” EC said.

TD
The generic companies which have been  fined are Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. The  fine on Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Ranbaxy (UK) Limited, is euro 1,03,23,000. Commenting on the development, European Commission vice-president Joaqun Almunia (in-charge of competition policy), said: “It is unacceptable that a company pays off its competitors to stay out of its market and delay the entry of cheaper medicines.“Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which
are already under tight budgetary constraints. The Commission will not tolerate such anti-competitive practices”. Reacting to the fine, Ranbaxy Laboratories said: “Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the European Commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the Decision to the General Court of the European Union.” These events took place over 10 years ago, and the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law, it said, adding it believed it has strong grounds of appeal. Citalopram is a blockbuster anti-depressant medicine and was  Lundbeck's
best-selling product at the time. EC said after  Lundbeck's basic patent for the citalopram molecule had expired, it only held a number of related process patents which provided a more limited protection. Producers of cheaper, generic versions of citalopram therefore had the possibility to enter the market.

HD       E.U. imposes  fines on drug firms for collusion; Lundbeck and others to pay €146 million for delaying  generic’s entry

Europe’s top antitrust enforcer on Wednesday continued a trend on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on drug company efforts to keep low-cost generic versions of their medicines off the market, fining a Danish pharmaceutical company and a number of generic producers a total of €146 million, or $195 million.

The European Commission said that  Lundbeck of Denmark colluded with companies including Ranbaxy of India and Merck of Germany in 2002 and 2003 to delay market entry of a less-expensive generic version of Lundbeck’s blockbuster antidepressant called citalopram.

TD
Lundbeck, fined €93.8 million, the highest amount, went as far as destroying significant quantities of the less expensive version of the drug, according to Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, whose office enforces antitrust law on behalf of the 27-nation European Union.
The commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their most recent annual worldwide sales. The
fine against Lundbeck amounts to about 4.6 percent of its 2012 sales of €2 billion.

‘‘All this occurred at the expense of patients who were deprived of access to cheaper medicines,’’ Mr. Almunia said at a news conference Wednesday. ‘‘It also harmed our public health systems, who for a longer period had to artificially bear the costs of an expensive medicine and one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants.’’

The case mirrorsa decision on Monday by the United States Supreme Court that is likely to increase the number of generic drugs in the marketplace to benefit consumers. Like the U.S. case, which empowered the Federal Trade Commission to sue drug makers that engage in so-called pay-for-delay tactics, the European decision focused on efforts by a major pharmaceutical company to slow or block the
availability of cheaper versions of medicines.
The European Commission has other cases still pending, including one against the drug giants
Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

Many governments in Europe buy or help pay for prescription drugs used by citizens under socialized medical systems, which means the blocking of generics imposes a financial burden on national budgets. Mr. Almunia said that once generic versions of citalopram became available in Britain, during the second half of 2004, prices there dropped 90 percent.

The scale of savings seen in Britain helped ensure that ‘‘public health systems can remain economically sustainable in these times of difficult budgetary constraints,’’ he said. The drug makers’ collusion had affected ‘‘the budgets of states and households,’’ he said.
But Lundbeck said it had done nothing wrong and would appeal the decision.

‘‘The company acted transparently and in good faith in trying to protect our patents,’’  Lundbeck said in a statement on its Web site. ‘‘Upon entering the agreements they were all reviewed by external antitrust experts.’’
Page 140 of 161 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As Monday’s Supreme Court decision indicates, the issue is a live one in the United States and Europe alike. The Federal Trade Commission says that pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.

‘‘On both sides of the Atlantic regulators are increasingly regarding generic makers not entering the market as soon as they could have done as potentially anti-competitive,’’ said Richard A. Ripley, a partner with Haynes & Boone in Washington, who has clients in the pharmaceutical sector but represents none of the parties in the  Lundbeck case.

Peter Kaplan, an F.T.C. spokesman, had no comment on the decision made by Mr. Almunia on Wednesday. But he indicated that officials in the United States and Europe had been coordinating on the issue of drug pricing.
‘‘F.T.C. staffers have had productive policy discussions with their counterparts in the E.U. on the
pay-for-delay issue, which is a longstanding enforcement priority at the F.T.C.,’’ Mr. Kaplan said. ‘‘These
discussions have benefited both agencies.’’
And while European Union officials said their decision on Wednesday was not timed to follow the
Supreme Court decision, Mr. Almunia said, ‘‘We are in good company in this approach.’’

Mr. Almunia’s office said that instead of competing with  Lundbeck when its basic patent on the drug citalopram expired, various generic makers colluded with the Danish company in 2002 to not enter the market in return for ‘‘substantial payments and other inducements from  Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros.’’
Commission officials said that they had found documents referring to a ‘‘‘club’ being formed and ‘a pile of
$$$’ to be shared among the participants.’’  Lundbeck also purchased supplies of generic versions of the
medicine ‘‘for the sole purpose of destroying it,’’ the officials said.

The decision against  Lundbeck was the first in a pay-for-delay case, Mr. Almunia said, ‘‘but I can promise you it’s not the last one.’’

Early this year, the commission accused the drug giants Johnson & Johnson and Novartis of colluding to delay the availability of a less expensive generic version of a powerful medication, fentanyl, often used to ease severe pain.

A year ago, the commission accused the French pharmaceutical company Servier and several of its generic competitors of delaying the generic entry of perindopril, a cardiovascular medicine.

And in 2011, the commission opened an investigation into whether the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company Cephalon and the Israel-based generic maker Teva of hindering the entry of the generic version of modafinil, used for the treatment of certain types of sleeping disorders.
Those three cases still are pending.

Indian major to appeal European Commission decision Some more bad news for Ranbaxy. The European Commission has fined the India-based drug-maker, along with eight other firms, on the charge of delaying launch of cheaper generic drugs in the market.

Ranbaxy has been fined €1,03,23,000 (over Rs 80 crore) for delaying the marketing of its generic version of depression drug citalopram made by Danish company  Lundbeck.

TD
Ranbaxy said it would appeal the decision at a general court in the European Union as it believed it was on a strong ground.

The EC note said: “In 2002,  Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of its branded citalopram, a blockbuster anti-depressant. These agreements violated EU anti-trust rules that prohibit anti-competitive agreements.”

The generic companies  fined included Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. The  fine imposed by the European Commission on the nine companies totals €146 million.

A Ranbaxy spokesperson said the company was “disappointed with the European Union’s decision to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the anti-depression drug, as
anti-competitive.”

“These events took place over 10 years ago. And the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law.”

Recently, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $500 million to settle criminal and fraud charges in the US. The company was charged with data falsification, among others.
Pay to delay

Settlements between innovator drug companies and generic drug-makers (which make cheaper versions of an innovative drug) are coming under the scanner, not just in the EU, but in the US as
well. Authorities are viewing such “pay-to-delay” settlements as being anti-competitive, as they stymie generic competition, in the process depriving patients cheaper versions of a critical drug.

In its statement, the EC’s Vice-President Joaquín Almunia (in charge of competition policy), said: “Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints”.

HD        Ranbaxy gets another blow, EU slaps huge fine

Yet to overcome the blow dealt to it by the loss of case in US court and allegations of bad quality drugs back home, the Ranbaxy now has been  fined 10.3 million euros by the European Union (EU) for blocking the supply of cheaper anti-depressant

The nine drugmakers that include India's Ranbaxy and Danish company  Lundbeck have been fined a total of 146 million euros (Rs 1, 150 crore) by EU antitrust regulators for blocking the supply of a cheaper anti-depressant medicine to the market. Ranbaxy was  fined with 10.3 million euros (close to Rs 80 crore) by the authority. The companies are now planning to appeal against the EU decision.

TD
The other penalised companies were Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma - which is now part of Zoetis Products LLC, AL Industrier.

The punishments follow a 2009 report by the  European Commission on the pharmaceutical sector, which said &pay-for-delay& deals lead to consumers paying as much as 20 percent more for their medicines.

The EU action came two days after the US supreme court said that US regulators could challenge deals between brand-name drug companies and generic rivals because of the higher consumer costs.
Pay-for-delay agreements involve brand-name firms paying generic companies not to deliver versions
of their drugs, which usually cost a fraction of the original medicine, to market, although the issue is also
complicated by patent ownership.

In this case,  Lundbeck was accused of paying other companies to have them delay delivering a generic version of its anti-depressant medicine citalopram to the market.



&Agreements of this type directly harm patients and national health systems, which are already under tight budgetary constraints,& said EU Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia. &The Commission will not tolerate such anticompetitive practices.&

The European Commission, which acts as competition regulator across the 27-member, European Union handed Lundbeck the largest  fine totalling 93.8 million euros. As a result,  Lundbeck cut its guidance for operating profits this year.

The Commission fined Germany's Merck KgaA 21.4 million euros and handed a further 7.77 million euro fine jointly to Merck and its former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan. The other penalised companies were Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma - which is now part of Zoetis Products LLC, AL Industrier

HD       Ranbaxy says EU fine won’t hurt business

Visitmydigitalfc.comPharma major Ranbaxy, which was slapped a  fine of 10.3 million euros (around Rs
80 crore) by the European Commission for blocking supply of a cheaper anti-depressant, is unlikely to
face any big threat to operations.
On Wednesday, the EU antitrust commission  fined nine drug companies, including Ranbaxy, a total of
146 million euro ($195 million) for blocking supply of a cheaper anti-depressant to the market. As per
Reuters, this is the first European sanction against such deals.

“Ranbaxy is disappointed with the decision by the  European commission to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the molecule Citalopram, anti-competitive, and intends to appeal the decision to the general court of the European Union,” the company said in a statement issued to the BSE.

“These events took place over 10 years ago and the company considers that the commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law. It believes it has strong grounds to appeal. Ranbaxy respects, and is committed to conducting its business in compliance with, European law, and is
dedicated to offering high quality, affordable medicines for the benefit of patients, prescribers, customers and the European healthcare system,” it further said.

The company last month pleaded guilty to “felony charges” relating to the manufacture and distribution of adulterated drugs by the USFDA, with Ranbaxy’s US arm agreeing to pay $500 million.
“The issues are different from each other, so there should not be any link drawn between them. While
the $500 million (around Rs 3,000 crore) will have its impact on the company’s revenues, the EU issue is
part of the business. Such cases happen with a lot of companies operating on this platform and a  fine of
Rs 80 crore should not have any impact on the company’s revenue,” said an analyst on condition of
anonymity.

The analyst also said the “Ranbaxy-EU issue” was being blown out of proportion by the media and should be considered a “non-event”.

According to another analyst, the  fine is not going to impact the company’s operations as a whole and would not have any effect in its supply to the European market. Europe accounts for nearly 10-15 per cent of the company’s total portfolio.

BRUSSELS -- Europe's top antitrust enforcer continued a crackdown on drug company efforts to keep low-cost generic versions of their medicines off the market, a campaign that is taking place on both sides of the Atlantic.

On Wednesday, the European Commissionfined a Danish pharmaceutical company and a number of generic producers a total of 146 million euros, or $195 million.

TD
The commission said that  Lundbeck of Denmark colluded with companies like Ranbaxy of India and Merck of Germany in 2002 and 2003 to delay market entry of a less expensive generic version of a blockbuster antidepressant called citalopram. Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for competition, said that  Lundbeck also destroyed significant quantities of the low-cost version of the drug.

''All this occurred at the expense of patients who were deprived of access to cheaper medicines,'' Mr. Almunia said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''It also harmed our public health systems, who for a longer period had to artificially bear the costs of an expensive medicine and one of the most widely
prescribed antidepressants.''  Lundbeck said it had done nothing wrong and would appeal the decision.
''The company acted transparently and in good faith in trying to protect our patents,''  Lundbeck said in
a statement. ''Upon entering the agreements, they were all reviewed by external antitrust experts.''

The case mirrors a decision on Monday by the United States Supreme Court, which empowers the Federal Trade Commission to sue drug makers that engage in so-called pay-for-delay tactics. The Supreme Court decision is likely to increase the number of generic drugs, in that way benefiting consumers. The F.T.C. said that pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.

Many European governments with socialized medical systems buy or help to pay for prescription drugs used by citizens, which means that the blocking of generics affects those nations' budgets. Mr. Almunia said that when generic versions of citalopram became available in Britain, during the second half of
2004, prices there dropped by 90 percent.

The scale of savings in Britain helped to ensure that ''public health systems can remain economically sustainable in these times of difficult budgetary constraints,'' Mr. Almunia said. Peter Kaplan, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, would not comment on the European decision, but he indicated that officials had been coordinating on the issue of drug pricing. ''F.T.C. staffers have had productive policy discussions with their counterparts in the E.U. on the pay-for-delay issue, which is a longstanding enforcement priority at the F.T.C.,'' Mr. Kaplan said.
Similarly, European Union officials said their decision on Wednesday was not timed to follow the
Supreme Court case.

Early this year, the commission accused the drug giants Johnson & Johnson and Novartis of colluding to delay the availability of a generic version of fentanyl, a drug often used to ease severe pain. A year ago, the commission accused the French pharmaceutical company Servier and competitors of delaying the generic entry of perindopril, a cardiovascular medicine. And in 2011, the commission opened an investigation into whether the American pharmaceutical company Cephalon and the generic maker Teva of Israel hindered the entry of the generic version of modafinil, used for the treatment of certain types of sleeping disorders.
Those cases still are pending.

In the Lundbeck case, Mr. Almunia's office said that various generic makers colluded with the Danish company, agreeing to not enter the market in return for ''substantial payments and other inducements from Lundbeck amounting to tens of millions of euros.'' Commission officials said that they had found documents referring to a '' 'club' being formed and 'a pile of $$$' to be shared among the participants.''

The European Commissionfined Lundbeck 93.8 million euros, which amounts to roughly 4.6 percent of its 2012 sales. The regulator can fine companies as much as 10 percent of annual sales.

HD          EU fines Ranbaxy, 8 others for blocking cheaper drugs

Some more bad news for Ranbaxy. The  European Commission has fined the India-based
drug-maker, along with eight other firms, on the charge of delaying launch of cheaper generic drugs in
the market.

Ranbaxy has been fined euro 1,03,23,000 (over Rs 80 crore) for delaying the marketing of its generic version of depression drug citalopram made by Danish company  Lundbeck.

TD
Ranbaxy said it would appeal the decision at a general court in the European Union as it believed it was on a strong ground.

The EC note said: "In 2002,  Lundbeck agreed with each of these companies to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of its branded citalopram, a blockbuster anti-depressant. These agreements violated EU anti-trust rules that prohibit anti-competitive agreements."

The generic companies  fined included Alpharma (now part of Zoetis), Merck KGaA/Generics UK (Generics UK is now part of Mylan), Arrow (now part of Actavis), and Ranbaxy. The  fine imposed by the European Commission on the nine companies totals 146 million.

A Ranbaxy spokesperson said the company was "disappointed with the European Union's decision to rule its patent settlement agreement with  Lundbeck, covering the anti-depression drug, as
anti-competitive."

"These events took place over 10 years ago. And the company considers that the Commission has misunderstood the facts and misapplied the law."

Recently, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $500 million to settle criminal and fraud charges in the US. The company was charged with data falsification, among others.

Denmark-headquartered pharmaceutical manufacturer  Lundbeck announced yesterday (20 June) the launch of its plan "Fit for the future", which consists in the reorganisation of its commercial structure. The firm's operations will be divided into six major regions: Europe, United States, Canada, Asia, Latin America, and Middle East & Global Distribution. This will ensure  Lundbeck focuses on growth markets. In addition, the company is also planning to streamline its European commercial structure in order to
increase its ability to roll-out new products. Activities will be streamlined and aligned across different sites in order to avoid possible duplications of activities. The European reorganisation will provide  Lundbeck with the opportunity of enhancing competences in strategic areas such as market access, marketing, and medical affairs. The company revealed that the reorganisation may bring approximately 50–55 lay-offs in Europe.

TD
Significance:  Lundbeck's plan builds on a previous commercial reorganisation in Europe. International Markets and Europe senior vice president Ole Chrintz said the company wants: "the best possible set-up to ensure the transition of our product portfolio through successful launches of new medicines. With this plan we will have the focus, the structure and the competencies in place to achieve that". Therefore, the company decision represents a strategic move in sight of future product roll-outs. Furthermore, a flexible and streamlined structure will also help reduce expenditures; a cost-saving plan may be required following the EUR93.8-million (USD124-million)  fine that the company has been required to pay by the European Commission over the signing of "pay-for-delay" deals (see Europe: 20 June 2013: ).

The European Commission has fined Lundbeck EUR 93.8 M for having delayed the marketing of generic versions of its antidepressant citalopram (which at the time was the Danish company's best-selling product). The Commission found that  Lundbeck had signed agreements with producers of rival generics (including Alpharma, Merck KgaA/Generics UK, Arrow and Ranbaxy).  Lundbeck paid these companies considerable sums and acquired stocks of generics in order to destroy them. It also offered guaranteed profits through a distribution agreement. For their part, the generic drugs producers were  fined EUR 52.2

European Commission has fined the pharma firm with a Rs 80-cr  fine for unfair trade practices “We can convince the world that we did not delay the launch of generic citalopram,” is Ranbaxy Chief Executive and Managing Director Arun Sawhney’s response to the  fine recently imposed by the European Commission.

The European Commission (EC) fine on Ranbaxy was for allegedly delaying the launch of its less expensive, generically-similar version of citalopram, an anti-depression drug from Danish company Lundbeck.

TD
“The very fact that we are going to appeal is a confirmation that we are not accepting the decision;
that we did not delay the launch,” he says, speaking on legacies of the past catching up with Ranbaxy
in the US and Europe, their repercussions back home, and the road ahead.

Of the nine companies fined by the EC for a total €146 million, Ranbaxy faces a Rs 80-crore  fine for a settlement it forged with Lundbeck on citalopram, about 10 years ago.

There are events in a company’s life that are “unusual” or “not in the normal course”, Sawhney says, categorising its $500-million settlement with the US Department of Justice as one such.

Last month, Ranbaxy decided to settle criminal and fraud charges against it in the US, linked to its manufacturing practices and data falsification. And in the eye of this storm were its plants at Paonta Sahib (Himachal Pradesh) and Dewas (Madhya Pradesh).

On the US regulator making an inspectional observation on its Mohali plant, as well, Sawhney said, “getting a 483 is not a show-stopper”. It does not stop the company from making product-related submissions from Mohali, he added

Pharma businesses get 483 observations from the regulator in the course of business, it is “customary”, he points out. Companies are let off the hook if they rectify violations mentioned in the observations, else it could lead to the issuance of a warning letter.

Responding to industry buzz that Ranbaxy’s Poanta Sahib plant was alive and ticking, he said Poanta is fully occupied and products made here are sold across the world – including Canada, the UK, Germany and South Africa. Similarly, at Dewas, except for the US, it services several world markets, he added.
Road ahead

Sticking to its projection of clocking Rs 12,000 crore sales this year, Sawhney says, Ranbaxy’s international plans continue to power ahead in generic and branded businesses, even as it invests in infrastructure such as a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, for instance.

“We will not feel shy to grow the business inorganically,” he says, on making a big pitch to acquire, if it fuelled growth. Elaborating on its hybrid strategy - where Ranbaxy and its Japanese parent Daiichi Sankyo pursue their generic and innovative strengths in different markets – Sawhney said, the
