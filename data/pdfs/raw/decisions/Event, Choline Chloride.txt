BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to fine members of a vitamin
cartel that includes Dutch chemicals firms Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS), Germany's  BASF AG (BASF.DE)
and Belgium's  UCB (UCBBt.BR), a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.

The Commission will act at its meeting on Thursday to fine some of the  price-fixing cartel involving those companies and three others, which are non-European, the source said.

TD
The Commission's antitrust investigators have found that the companies fixed prices on choline       
chloride, a supplement used in animal feed and pet foods that is also known as  vitamin  B-4.

In June 2003, a U.S. Federal District Court jury found that Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd. (8031.T) and three other companies fixed the price of  choline chloride and fined them $147 million.
The Commission can fine cartel members up to 10 percent of annual sales.

Cracking down on cartels is one of the  Commission's highest competition priorities. In September, it fined Europe's main makers of copper plumbing pipes 222 million  euros for more than a decade of price-fixing.

AMSTERDAM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV (AKZO.AS) said on Tuesday it had not been contacted by the European Commission to pay a fine in relation to an alleged vitamins cartel.

"We have not been contacted by the  European Commission over any sort of fine," an  Akzo Nobel spokesman said.

A source told Reuters earlier that the commission was set to fine companies including  Akzo Nobel
(AKZOY.O), Germany's  BASF AG (BASF.DE) and Belgium's  UCB (UCBBt.BR).

The source said the commission's antitrust investigators had found that those companies and three other non-European firms had fixed prices on  choline chloride - a supplement used in animal feed and pet foods that is also known as  vitamin  B-4.

BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to fine members of a vitamin cartel that includes Dutch chemicals firms Akzo Nobel, Germany's  BASF AG and Belgium's UCB, a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.

The Commission will act at its meeting on Thursday to fine some of the  price-fixing cartel involving those three companies and three non-European companies, the source said.

TD
The Commission's antitrust investigators have found that the companies fixed prices on choline      
chloride, a supplement used in animal feed and pet foods, also known as  vitamin  B-4.
The European Commission had no comment.

A spokesman for BASF said the action was a follow-on to a major vitamin  cartel case from 1999 that had targeted other vitamin  products but delayed action on vitamin  B-4 for reasons unclear to them.

"We have worked closely with the  Commission and given them everything they required," the spokesman said from BASF's headquarters in Ludwigshafen.
RECORD FINES
The United States fined companies a record $725 million in 1999 for the  vitamin cartel. BASF paid
$225 million.
The Commission fined eight companies in 2001 a total of 855 million  euros for the cartel, including a
296 million euro fine paid by BASF.

A spokesman for  Akzo in Amsterdam said that it, too, had co-operated with the Commission, noting that a formal statement of objections was issued in 2003 by the  Commission over the vitamin  B-4 cartel.
"We have not been contacted by the  European Commission over any sort of fine," a second  Akzo
spokesman said. The size of fines is often closely guarded by the  Commission.

Akzo Nobel was fined for its part in a sodium glutamate cartel in 2001, and escaped fines in 2003 after confessing to its part in a 29-year organic peroxides cartel.
A spokeswoman for  UCB said the company had no comment ahead of the decision set for Thursday. In June 2003, a U.S. Federal District Court jury found that Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd. and three other
companies fixed the price of  choline chloride and fined them $147 million.
The Commission, which can fine  cartel members up to 10 percent of annual sales, makes
cartel-busting one of its highest competition priorities.

FRANKFURT, Dec 8 (Reuters) -  BASF (BASF.DE) shares fell almost 2 percent on Wednesday over worries that an expected  cartel fine by the European Commission might cost the firm millions of euros.

By 0858 GMT, shares in the German chemicals company were down 1.3 percent at 51.66  euros, above a low of 51.38, making it the second-biggest decliner in the benchmark DAX index , which was down 0.6 percent.

TD
A source close to the situation said on Tuesday afternoon that the Commission was set to fine members of a vitamin  cartel including BASF, Dutch chemicals firm Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) and Belgium's UCB (UCBBt.BR) on Thursday.
The Commission's anti-trust investigators have found that the companies fixed prices of choline       
chloride, a supplement used in animal feed that is also known as  vitamin  B-4.

"The uncertainty over the amount of the fine is weighing on the stock," said Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg analyst Ulle Woerner. But Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz analyst Silke Stegemann said the impact should not be overestimated.

"We don't expect a strong impact as the EU  Commission mostly fines up to 10 percent of the annual sales," she said, reiterating her "outperformer" rating for the stock.

BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Chemicals firms Akzo Nobel, BASF AG and UCB will on Thursday be fined 66 million  euros ($88 million) by the European Commission for running a vitamin  B-4 cartel, a source close to the case said.

The Commission will fine the Netherlands' Akzo Nobel about 21 million  euros ($27.98 million), Germany's BASF AG about 35 million euros and Belgium's  UCB about 10 million  euros, the source told Reuters on Wednesday.

TD
The Commission will say the companies operated a cartel for vitamin  B-4, a supplement used in animal feed and pet foods also known as choline  chloride.
An Akzo Nobel spokesman declined comment on the expected fine.
"We expect the ruling this week but we will not comment until we get the official  commission
decision," he said.

The decision will be one of the first high-profile actions by new Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who took office last month after enduring heavy criticism in some quarters for her extensive business background.
The Commission is making cartel busting one of its highest competition priorities, and other  vitamin
cartels have already drawn hefty U.S. and  European penalties.

The United States levied a record $725 million of fines for  vitamin  cartels in 1999, including a $225 million charge on BASF.

In 2001 the Commission fined eight firms a total of 855 million  euros, its highest-ever sector fine, including a 296 million euro fine paid by BASF.

In June 2003, a U.S. Federal District Court jury found that Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd. and three other companies fixed the price of  choline chloride and fined them $147 million.

Akzo Nobel was fined for its part in a sodium glutamate cartel in 2001, and escaped fines in 2003 after confessing to its part in a 29-year organic peroxides cartel.

HD         EU Kroes Could Block Portuguese Power, Gas Cos Merging
WC        605 words

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In her first decisions as  European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes is expected Thursday to block a merger between Portugal's power and gas groups, and to slap fines on chemical companies for fixing prices.

In the Portuguese case, Kroes is expected to ask her 24 E.U.  Commission colleagues to block Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) from buying Gas de Portugal SA, according to E.U. observers and news reports.

TD
E.U.  Commission investigators have warned that the deal, which also involves Italy's Eni SpA (E), would give EdP too much control over the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market.
Earlier this month, EdP Chief Executive Joao Talone spoke out against E.U.'s expected veto, saying it
"would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
But Talone's criticism is unlikely to faze Kroes.

Kroes already has instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP.

In particular, E.U. regulators want to discourage consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.
Thursday's Portuguese decision would be the first merger prohibition by  European regulators since
2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at  Europe's Court
of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

With the Monti era over, Kroes inherits a team of officials chastened by those court reversals - but emboldened by a new system ensuring that controversial decisions are more likely to stand up in court.
Kroes also inherits Monti's vigorous campaign to stamp out the worst violations of competition policy -
price-fixing.

On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an animal feed additive called  choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.
Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate  BASF AG (BF)
and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s.  European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide turnover, but fines usually are much smaller.

Kroes also could face questions Thursday about the E.U.'s campaign to force Germany's state-owned banks to restructure along market lines rather than through state subsidies.
Page 14 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Kroes already has warned the banks that any future recapitalization must take place after July 2005 and at proper market rates. But two of the banks, WestLB AG (WLB.YY) and Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale AG (NLB.YY) have sharply criticized those demands.

The current row began earlier this year, when the  Commission asked WestLB and six other German state-owned banks pay back a total of EUR4.3 billion in state subsidies.

Those repayments were previously thought unlikely to weaken the financial situation of the banks because the federal states would immediately reinject the funds through recapitalizations - but now the E.U. and the German banks are quarreling over the conditions.

HD              Europe Is Expected to Fine Members of Vitamin Cartel

BRUSSELS, Dec. 7 -- The European Commission will fine several chemical companies on
Thursday for operating a cartel that fixed the price of  vitamin B4, an animal growth stimulant, people
close to the investigation said on Tuesday.

The size of the fine will be determined by  commission staff members on Wednesday and will figure on the agenda of the commissioners' weekly meeting Thursday -- a procedural sign that a decision against the companies has already been made. Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, will seek the support of other commissioners for the fine.

TD
UCB of Belgium, one of the companies under investigation, confirmed that a ruling was coming. ''We have learned that there will be a decision by the  European Commission on Thursday,'' Laurence Bataille, a  UCB spokeswoman, said. She declined further comment.
The commission declined to comment on the inquiry.

The investigation of  B4 prices began in 1999 and the commission pressed formal charges in May of last year. Other companies involved in the price fixing  include BASF of Germany and  Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands.

The vitamin B4 case is one of about a dozen involving cartels of chemical manufacturers to have come to light in the last five years. Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have waged a running battle to bring the industry into line. But as one case ends, others emerge -- often involving the same companies.

BASF featured prominently three years ago in the biggest  cartel to be prosecuted in the United States and  Europe. The commission fined it almost 300 million  euros for its role in the conspiracy, which fixed the prices of several human and animal  vitamins over a period of 10 years.

Last year, the  commission opened an investigation into a suspected  cartel in the markets for hydrogen peroxide, paints and solvents.  BASF was among the companies under investigation, as were Celanese of Germany, Total of France and Solvay, a Belgian chemical company.

Also last year, the commission fined four chemical companies, including Hoechst of Germany, a total of 138.4 million euros for participating in a  cartel that fixed the price of sorbates, a food additive, for 17 years.

Akzo Nobel and UCB are being investigated in the United States in a parallel inquiry into the  vitamin B4 market there. John de Munnik, an  Akzo spokesman, said the company was cooperating with investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.

The United States Justice Department has already fined Ducoa, based in Highland, Ill., and the Chinook  Group of Canada for their involvement in fixing prices of  vitamin B4 in the United States. Mitsui & Company of Japan was punished for similar  cartel activity in June last year.

Other companies involved in the  European vitamin B4 cartel case are believed to be from outside Europe. The full list of those accused of being involved in the conspiracy has not yet been made public.

On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an animal feed additive called  choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.
Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate  BASF AG (BF)
and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s.  European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide turnover, but fines usually are much smaller.

Kroes also could face questions Thursday about the E.U.'s campaign to force Germany's state-owned banks to restructure along market lines rather than through state subsidies.

Kroes already has warned the banks that any future recapitalization must take place after July 2005 and at proper market rates. But two of the banks, WestLB AG (WLB.YY) and Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale AG (NLB.YY) have sharply criticized those demands.

The current row began earlier this year, when the  Commission asked WestLB and six other German state-owned banks pay back a total of EUR4.3 billion in state subsidies.

Those repayments were previously thought unlikely to weaken the financial situation of the banks because the federal states would immediately reinject the funds through recapitalizations - but now the E.U. and the German banks are quarreling over the conditions.

HD         EU Kroes Could Block Portuguese Power, Gas Cos Merging
WC        605 words

LP
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In her first decisions as  European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes is expected Thursday to block a merger between Portugal's power and gas groups, and to slap fines on chemical companies for fixing prices.

In the Portuguese case, Kroes is expected to ask her 24 E.U.  Commission colleagues to block Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) from buying Gas de Portugal SA, according to E.U. observers and news reports.

TD
E.U.  Commission investigators have warned that the deal, which also involves Italy's Eni SpA (E), would give EdP too much control over the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market.
Earlier this month, EdP Chief Executive Joao Talone spoke out against E.U.'s expected veto, saying it
"would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
But Talone's criticism is unlikely to faze Kroes.

Kroes already has instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP.

In particular, E.U. regulators want to discourage consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.
Thursday's Portuguese decision would be the first merger prohibition by  European regulators since
2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at  Europe's Court
of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

With the Monti era over, Kroes inherits a team of officials chastened by those court reversals - but emboldened by a new system ensuring that controversial decisions are more likely to stand up in court.
Kroes also inherits Monti's vigorous campaign to stamp out the worst violations of competition policy -
price-fixing.

On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an animal feed additive called  choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.
Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate  BASF AG (BF)
and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s.  European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

Turkey bristles at tougher EU conditions

ANKARA/BRUSSELS - Turkey bristled on Tuesday at a toughening of conditions for its bid to open European Union membership talks, including an explicit mention of torture, but Cyprus said the terms were not tough enough.
- - - -
Turkey says "no more conditions" for EU talks
ANKARA - Turkey said on Tuesday the  European Union should open accession talks without setting
Ankara any fresh conditions, and with the clear goal of full Turkish membership.
- - - -
Turkey must move on Cyprus for EU bid-Dutch PM

AMSTERDAM - Dutch Prime Minster Jan Peter Balkenende said on Tuesday Turkey must move towards recognising Cyprus ahead of a  European Union summit next week due to decide whether to start accession talks with Ankara.
- - - -
Turk business has great expectations from EU talks

ANKARA - Turkish business is lobbying hard for EU entry talks, betting that the start of negotiations would attract billions of dollars in fresh investment despite posing big challenges to local firms.

Business chiefs have been at the forefront of Ankara's campaign to persuade  European Union leaders to say "yes" to entry talks when they decide the issue on Dec. 17.
- - - -
EU fails to agree revised work time rules

BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The  European Union on Tuesday failed to agree a revision of rules limiting the hours people can work amid disagreement over closing an existing loophole.

Under the current rules, EU states can break a 48-hour a week limit under certain conditions. The European Commission wants those rules changed so member states can only use this opt-out if agreed under collective labour agreements.

Newspapers, watchdogs clash on EU transparency rules

PARIS - Some  European newspapers could go bust unless companies are forced to publish news in the press along with other media under an EU drive to improve the flow of information to investors, regulators were told on Tuesday.

Newspaper representatives clashed with the watchdogs who are helping the  European Commission to flesh out new rules to ensure investors across  Europe have proper access to information about companies listed in the 25-nation bloc - part of moves to integrate its capital markets.
- - - -
Spain to host EU heavyweights to back constitution

ZARAGOZA - Spain has invited the leaders of France and Germany to hold a summit in Barcelona on Feb. 11 to promote the EU's first constitution, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Tuesday.

Spain is due to hold a referendum on the charter on Feb. 20. The constitution, intended to make it easier for the EU to take decisions following its enlargement to 25 member states last May, requires the approval of all member states.
- - - -
EU lauds newcomers on  euro zone entry efforts

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Tuesday praised efforts of new members states to meet economic criteria that would allow them to adopt the  euro between 2007 and 2010.

EU finance ministers said they were satisfied with progress made by the 10, mostly east  European entrants towards cutting budget deficits, lowering inflation, keeping public debt in check and meeting other euro zone entry criteria.

EU to fine firms for  vitamin  B-4 cartel - source

BRUSSELS - The European Commission is set to fine members of a vitamin  cartel that includes Dutch chemicals firms Akzo Nobel, Germany's  BASF AG and Belgium's UCB, a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.

The Commission will act at its meeting on Thursday to fine some of the  price-fixing cartel involving those three companies and three non-European companies, the source said.

No "Plan B" if Britain rejects EU treaty - Straw

LONDON - Britain stands virtually no chance of renegotiating an EU constitution if it rejects the agreed treaty, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday as he shed light on the government's strategy to win a referendum.

Polls show Tony Blair faces an uphill battle to convince Britons to back the  European Union treaty at a referendum expected in 2006, and a "No" vote could end his premiership.
- - - -
EU ministers back key bank capital, auditing laws

BRUSSELS -  European Union finance ministers on Tuesday backed a raft of financial proposals ranging from radically new bank capital rules to stricter scrutiny of accountants and tougher controls on terrorism financing.

The planned measures are the final building blocks of an ambitious European Union plan to fully integrate its financial services market, but need the green light of the European Parliament before they can become law in the 25-nation bloc.

KRAKOW, Poland - The four largest new EU members from central  Europe will send 100 election observers to help monitor the re-run of Ukraine's presidential election, Poland's foreign minister said on Tuesday.

Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said the Visegrad group - Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia - would send observers to the poll set for Dec. 26. More observers would be sent by each individual country.
- - - -
Latvia govt confident of yes vote on EU Constitution
RIGA - Latvia said on Tuesday it would speed up its planned parliamentary vote on the new EU
constitution, leading to its probable approval by end-January.

Foreign Minister Artis Pabriks told Reuters the document would be submitted to parliament in a week and he was confident of its approval by the end of January.
- - - -
Italian data doubts stoke EU budget tensions

BRUSSELS - A new row over EU budget statistics blew up on Tuesday as Brussels blew the whistle on inconsistencies between Italy's public debt and deficit figures.

The revelations eclipsed signals by the  European Commission that it could next week suspend budget disciplinary action against Germany and France for breaking the  European Union deficit ceiling.
- - - -
EU budget guidelines watered down in summit draft

BRUSSELS - The Netherlands, the  European Union's president, has watered down guiding principles for the bloc's disputed long-term budget to avoid a clash over the issue at the Dec. 16-17 summit, diplomats said on Tuesday.
- - - -
N. Irish divisions laid bare in EU assembly

BRUSSELS - As Britain and Ireland push for a peace deal in Northern Ireland, the scars of the decades-old conflict were laid bare in the  European Parliament on Tuesday.

Dublin and London want to get rival Catholic and Protestant parties to share power in the British-run province and disarm Irish Republican Army guerrillas, closing the chapter on a 30-year sectarian conflict which claimed more than 3,600 lives.
Sinn Fein, political ally of the IRA, held a conference in the EU assembly calling for an investigation
into Catholics murdered by pro-British loyalist Protestant guerrillas, squads which it says were aided by
the British government.

U.S. says time running out in Airbus-Boeing row

PARIS - The United States said on Tuesday it may soon take legal action in a trade row over government help for Airbus and Boeing, particularly as the  European aircraft maker was seeking support for a new project.

Washington and Brussels have so far resisted launching legal action at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in their battle over allegations of illegal subsidies to the aviation rivals, but that option may now be just weeks away.

BRUSSELS - Israel is agonising over whether to conclude a new agreement with the  European Union which would commit it for the first time to a dialogue with the bloc on weapons of mass destruction, diplomats said on Tuesday.

The Jewish state, which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, is widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear weapons arsenal but has never officially acknowledged it.
- - - -
Belgian vote on EU constitution looks ruled out

BRUSSELS - A Belgian referendum on the EU constitution appeared effectively ruled out on Tuesday after a key coalition partner voiced opposition to the move.

Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, said some parties might abuse the referendum to campaign against Turkey's EU bid or to further split linguistically-divided Belgium.
- - - -
EU slaps travel ban on two Belarus officials

BRUSSELS - The  European Union has agreed to ban two senior Belarus officials from its territory as part of sanctions against the former Soviet republic for staging flawed elections, a diplomat said on Tuesday.

They are Lidia Yarmoshyna, head of the Central Electoral  Commission, and Yuri Podbed, chief of the OMON security force that broke up rallies following the Oct.17 general election and a referendum on President Alexander Lukashenko.
- - - -
EU Commission says concerned at Italy figures

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission is concerned at apparent inconsistencies between Italy's public debt and deficit figures and has asked Rome for an explanation, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
But spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the discrepancy was not as serious as the massive
under-reporting of Greece's public deficit for several years for which EU finance ministers rebuked
Athens on Tuesday.
- - - -
EU, Iran to launch nuclear talks next week

TEHRAN - Iran's top nuclear negotiator said on Tuesday that he will meet French, British and German officials next week to launch talks aimed at permanently resolving the standoff over Tehran's nuclear plans.

"Next week there will be a meeting between Iranian and 'EU three' officials in one of the  European capitals," Hassan Rohani, secretary of Iran's powerful Supreme National Security Council, was quoted as saying on Iranian state television.

EU states back ex-trade chief Lamy for top WTO job

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission endorsed former EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy on Tuesday as a candidate to head the World Trade Organisation and said he had broad support of the bloc's 25 member states.
The European Union's preliminary backing for the French Socialist puts him in a race for the coveted
Geneva seat which - at this stage - looks likely to include a Uruguayan, a Brazilian and a Mauritian.

The pound briefly rose above $1.95 yesterday, up more than 1 cent on the day, as currency markets renewed their assault on the dollar, but later closed at $1.9420.

TD
The euro was also pushed to a record level of $1.3470 before paring gains.

The latest assault on the dollar came as markets brushed aside another show of concern over the euro exchange rate from senior EU policymakers. In a joint statement on Monday,  eurozone finance ministers protested at the "excessive volatility and disorderly movements" in currencies.

Oil prices fell as mild winter weather in America hit energy demand. US light crude prices fell to a three-month low, losing $1.31 to $41.67, while London Brent Crude dropped $1.25 to $38.40.

An auction by the UK Debt Management Office of long-dated gilt-edged stock met only modest demand. The auction saw bids worth 1.78 times the value of the gilts on offer -well below the 2.51 figure for the last such sale in October.

Revised figures cut US productivity growth in the third quarter to 1.8 per cent, from an initial estimate of 1.9 per cent and a pace of 3.9 per cent in the second quarter. But analysts said the annual pace of productivity increase remained positive at an unrevised 3.1 per cent.

Fears over the effect of the rising  euro on eurozone activity were eased a little as Germany's ZEW gauge of business conditions edged higher in December to plus 14.4, from a November reading of plus 13.9.

The EU finance ministers' meeting (Ecofin) approved new  European auditing rules designed to prevent the repetition of Parmalat-style corporate scandals. The legislation is planned as  Europe's response to the US Sarbanes-Oxley laws.

The European Commission said that it still had concerns about the accuracy of Italian budget deficit figures, only a week after Greece was challenged over its bookkeeping and possible under-reporting of state borrowing.

EU member states have given wide backing to the potential candidacy of Pascal Lamy, the former EU Trade Commissioner, to take over next year as Director General of the World Trade Organisation.
BANKING & FINANCE DOWN 0.2%

European insurers could appeal against an American jury decision that effectively doubles the cost of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, New York, after Larry Silverstein, the WTC leaseholder, claimed $7 billion (Pounds 3.6 nillion) in damages.

Quintain Estates, the British property firm, is optimistic about winning government support for gaming resorts to be sited near London's Wembley Stadium and Millennium Dome, and has raised its valuation of the two projects.

Minerva, the property company, is understood to be assessing all options for its struggling Allders department store chain as the group seeks to make itself an attractive bid prospect.

Seven months after Swiss Re's "Erotic Gherkin" office tower opened for business in the City, the insurer has finally agreed terms on the first sizeable letting at the property.
CONSUMER GOODS DOWN 0.2%
Colgate-Palmolive, the maker of household products, plans to cut some 4,400 jobs and close a third of its factories under a programme aimed at combating rising costs and focusing on its higher-margin products.
ENGINEERING DOWN 0.3%
Alba, the consumer electronics maker, gave warning of a "significantly" more challenging second half as it reported a 4 per cent increase in first-half profits to Pounds 7.7 million.

Group in November, thanks to strong demand in Germany and a successful A-Class launch.

The United States has agreed to buy up to four million flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceuticals group. America lost almost half its anticipated flu vaccine supply in October when Chiron lost the licence for its UK plant because of contamination problems.

HD      Fines loom in vitamin cartel case

BRUSSELS:

A handful of chemical companies will be fined by the  European Commission on Thursday for operating a cartel that fixed the price of a  vitamin  supplement, one of the companies said Tuesday.

TD
"We have learned that there will be a decision by the  European Commission on Thursday," said Laurence Bataille, a spokeswoman for  UCB, a Brussels-based maker of pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. She declined to comment further ahead of the ruling.

The antitrust authorities are expected to announce that the companies fixed the price of  choline chloride, or vitamin B4, a chemical used as an additive in animal feed to stimulate growth.

The other companies alleged to be involved include BASF of Germany and  Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands. The investigation began in 1999, and the commission brought formal charges against the suspected companies in May 2003. The size of the fines will be set Wednesday, and Neelie Kroes, the new competition commissioner, will then ask her fellow commissioners to support the ruling at the commission's weekly meeting on Thursday, according to one person close to the investigation who asked not to be identified. The  vitamin B4 case is one of about a dozen involving  cartel allegations
against chemical producers to come to light in the past five years. Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been conducting a running battle against the tactic. But as one case ends, others emerge, often involving the same companies.

BASF featured prominently in the biggest  cartel ever to be prosecuted in the United States and in
Europe three years ago. The company was fined almost 300 million, or $403 million, by the  commission
for its role in the conspiracy, which fixed the prices of a number of  vitamins for humans and animals over
a period of 10 years.

Last year the  commission opened an investigation into a possible  cartel arrangement in the markets for hydrogen peroxide, paints and solvents.  BASF, Solvay, a Belgian chemicals producer, Celanese of Germany and Total of France are among the companies under investigation.
Also last year, the  commission fined four chemical companies, including Hoechst of Germany, a total of
138.4 million for participating in a  cartel that fixed the price of sorbates, a group of food additives, over a
period of 17 years.

Akzo Nobel and UCB are both being investigated in the United States in a parallel investigation into the vitamin  B4 market there. John de Munnik, a spokesman for  Akzo, said his company was cooperating with "ongoing investigations on both sides of the Atlantic."

The Justice Department has already fined DuCoa, based in Highland, Illinois, and  Chinook  Group of Canada for their involvement in fixing prices of vitamin  B4 in the United States. The Japanese trading company Mitsui was punished for similar cartel activity in June 2003.

Other companies involved in the  European vitamin B4 case are believed to come from outside the region. DuCoa executives did not return calls seeking comment on the  European case.
The European Commission declined to comment on the  vitamin B4 cartel investigation.

HD         EU Kroes Could Block Portuguese Power, Gas Cos Merging
WC        605 words
PD         8 December 2004
ET          07:00 PM
SN         Dow Jones Emerging Markets Report
SC         EM

LP
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In her first decisions as  European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes is expected Thursday to block a merger between Portugal's power and gas groups, and to slap fines on chemical companies for fixing prices.

In the Portuguese case, Kroes is expected to ask her 24 E.U.  Commission colleagues to block Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) from buying Gas de Portugal SA, according to E.U. observers and news reports.

TD
E.U.  Commission investigators have warned that the deal, which also involves Italy's Eni SpA (E), would give EdP too much control over the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market.
Earlier this month, EdP Chief Executive Joao Talone spoke out against E.U.'s expected veto, saying it
"would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
But Talone's criticism is unlikely to faze Kroes.

Kroes already has instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP.

In particular, E.U. regulators want to discourage consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.
Thursday's Portuguese decision would be the first merger prohibition by  European regulators since
2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at  Europe's Court
of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

With the Monti era over, Kroes inherits a team of officials chastened by those court reversals - but emboldened by a new system ensuring that controversial decisions are more likely to stand up in court.
Kroes also inherits Monti's vigorous campaign to stamp out the worst violations of competition policy -
price-fixing.

On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an animal feed additive called  choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.
Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate  BASF AG (BF)
and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s.  European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide turnover, but fines usually are much smaller.

Kroes also could face questions Thursday about the E.U.'s campaign to force Germany's state-owned banks to restructure along market lines rather than through state subsidies.
Page 40 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Kroes already has warned the banks that any future recapitalization must take place after July 2005 and at proper market rates. But two of the banks, WestLB AG (WLB.YY) and Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale AG (NLB.YY) have sharply criticized those demands.

The current row began earlier this year, when the  Commission asked WestLB and six other German state-owned banks pay back a total of EUR4.3 billion in state subsidies.

Those repayments were previously thought unlikely to weaken the financial situation of the banks because the federal states would immediately reinject the funds through recapitalizations - but now the E.U. and the German banks are quarreling over the conditions.

FRANKFURT, Dec 9 (Reuters) - German blue chips were set to open slightly lower on Thursday with investors likely to focus on tech shares in early trade after chip makers Xilink and Altera cut their revenue forecasts.

The benchmark DAX index was indicated 0.2 percent down at 4,192 points, according to pre-market data from brokers. The DAX had closed at 4,201 points.

TD
The following are some of the main factors expected to move German stocks:
INFINEON (IFXGn.DE), CHIPS

Altera Corp. (ALTR.O) and Xilinx Inc. (XLNX.O), two leading U.S. chip makers and a competitor of Infineon, cut their quarterly revenue forecasts, citing a persistent problem with large chip inventories and a decline in sales into communications markets.
Separately, Banc of America Securities lowered its investment rating on seven semiconductor stocks to
"sell".

The action applies to National Semiconductor Corp. (NSM.N), Altera Corp. (ALTR.O), Actel Corp. (ACTL.O), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI.N), Intersil Corp. (ISIL.O), Semtech Corp. (SMTC.O), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI.N) and Xilinx Inc. (XLNX.O).

Intel Corp. (INTC.O) sounded a confident note on the company's growth prospects next year, but said the chip maker would have trouble meeting a goal of turning its communications business profitable by the end of 2005.

SCHERING (SCHG.DE)

German drug-maker Schering expects mid single-digit percentage sales growth next year similar to that of 2004, sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

Its profit is expected to rise stronger than sales next year, so that Schering could reach its target of a profit margin of 18 percent in 2006, the sources added.

BASF (BASF.DE)

Chemicals giant BASF AG (BASF.DE) will on Thursday be fined about 35 million  euros for running a vitamin  B-4 cartel with peers Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS), and  UCB (UCBBt.BR), a source close to the case said.

FRANKFURT, Dec 9 (Reuters) - German chemicals group  BASF (BASF.DE) says it will decide on taking legal action once it analysed the EU decision on an alleged vitamin  cartel, the company said on Thursday.
Earlier the EU  commission fined BASF and other European chemical companies for fixing prices for
Vitamin B4, an additive used in animal meal.

BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Thursday fined chemicals firms  Akzo Nobel, BASF AG and UCB 66.34 million euros ($88 million) for fixing prices of a  vitamin  used in animal feed.
The three companies formed part of a cartel that in the late 1990s controlled four-fifths of the world's
180-million-euro market for vitamin  B4, the EU's executive said. They agreed on price increases,
divided up markets and allocated clients.

The Commission fined the Netherlands'  Akzo Nobel 20.99 million  euros, Germany's  BASF 34.97 million euros and Belgium's  UCB 10.38 million euros.

Vitamin B4, also known as choline chloride, is added to chicken and pig food to increase animal growth, reduce mortality and improve meat quality.

"I will be steadfast in applying zero tolerance to those who operate cartels to the disadvantage ... of customers and consumers," recently appointed Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.

The Commission said U.S. companies Ducoa, which was acquired by Balchem Corp. in 2001, and Bioproducts, as well as Chinook  of Canada, were also involved, but escaped fines because they left the cartel more than five years before the investigation began.
SIX-YEAR  CARTEL

The cartel ran from 1992 to 1998, the  Commission said. The  European and North American producers agreed to leave each other's markets alone, before the three North American firms left the cartel in mid-1994.

BASF said it would decide whether to take legal action once it had analysed the EU's decision.

In a statement,  Akzo said it had intensified its competition compliance programme in 2000, the year after the probe began.

Akzo said it had fully co-operated with the  Commission and had a "strong and committed policy to crack down on any potential  cartel issues."


Page 50 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A UCB spokeswoman said the company sold the division involved in 2003. "We have divested," spokeswoman Laurence Battaille said. "The entire amount of the fine has been provisioned for so there will be no impact on results."

The decision - first reported by Reuters on Tuesday - was one of the first high-profile actions by the Commission's Kroes, who took office last month after enduring heavy criticism in some quarters for her extensive business background.

Kroes said decisions such as Thursday's would confound critics' charges that she "would be some sort of a pussycat." The  Commission makes cartel-busting one of its highest competition priorities, and other vitamin  cartels have already drawn hefty U.S. and  European penalties.

The United States levied a record $725 million of fines for  vitamin  cartels in 1999, including a $225 million fine for  BASF.

In 2001 the  Commission fined eight companies a total of 855 million  euros, its highest-ever sector fine, including a fine of 296 million  euros paid by BASF.

Akzo Nobel was fined for its part in a sodium glutamate cartel in 2001, and escaped fines in 2003 after confessing to its part in a 29-year organic peroxides cartel.

Bonn (Platts)-9Dec2004/915 am EST/1415 GMT The  European Commission has fined BASF nearly Eur35-mil ($47-mil) for illegal  price fixing  activities in the pharmaceutical sector, a BASF spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. The Ludwigshafen-based company is considering an official response but would not say whether BASF will appeal against the ruling. The Dutch firm  Akzo Nobel and Belgian company  UCB were also fined a total of Eur20.99-mil and Eur10.38-mil respectively for the same offence. The Commission announced that the companies were fined for fixing the price of  BASF's cholene chloride animal feed product (vitamin B4) during the period 1994 until 1997, thereby securing a dominant role in the market.

London (Platts)-9Dec2004/1114 am EST/1614 GMT Belgium-based  UCB said Thursday that it would consider appealing against the Eur 10.38-mil ($13.76-mil) fine for its participation in anticompetitive practices in the  choline chloride market, also called  vitamin B4, an additive used in animal feed. "These charges are old and involve chemical activities that are no longer part of the group.  UCB will analyze the decision of going in appeal. Due to  UCB existing provisions, this fine should have no impact on UCBs results," the company said in a statement. The European Commission has decided to impose fines totaling Eur66.34-mil on  Akzo Nobel, BASF and UCB for operating a cartel in the market for  choline      chloride, the EC announced Thursday. Choline chloride is used mainly as a feed additive for poultry
and pigs. Clients of these three companies are animal feed producers, which in turn supply to  European
farmers.

The level of the fines confirms the commissions determination to crack down hard on companies engaged in cartel practices such as price fixing  and market sharing.

Les trois sociétés faisaient partie d'un cartel qui, à la fin des années 1990, contrôlait les quatre cinquièmes du marché mondial de la vitamine  B4, évalué à 180 millions d'euros, a indiqué l'exécutif  européen.

La Commission a précisé que les sociétés américaines  Bioproducts et Ducoa étaient également concernées, de même que la canadienne  Chinook.  Elles n'ont toutefois pas été sanctionnées car elles s'étaient retirées du  cartel plus de cinq ans avant le début de l'enquête.

Le cartel, a précisé l'exécutif  européen, a fonctionné de 1992 à 1998. Les producteurs d'Europe et d'Amérique du Nord étaient convenus de se limiter à leurs marchés respectifs, avant que les trois sociétés nord-américaines ne se retirent de l'entente au milieu de l'année 1994.

BASF a indiqué qu'il déciderait d'un éventuel recours en justice après analyse de la décision de la Commission. Akzo a déclaré n'avoir aucun commentaire à formuler avant publication d'un communiqué au cours de la journée de jeudi.

Chez UCB, une porte-parole a déclaré que la division concernée avait été vendue en 2003. "Le montant total de l'amende a été provisionné et il n'y aura donc pas d'impact sur les résultats", a-t-elle ajouté.

La décision de la Commission constitue l'une des premières mesures importantes prises par Neelie Kroes, qui a pris ses fonctions le mois dernier. Ellle avait été très critiquée pour avoir siégé dans les conseils de surveillance de nombreuses sociétés.

German chemicals group  BASF could face a further fine from the EU Commission for signing illegal price agreements. The case is said to be linked to the fine of 296.2m euros that was imposed by the EU in 2001, although it is to be handled separately. Akzo Nobel, UCB and several other companies outside Europe are also said to have been involved in the cartel.

A decision is expected on Thursday. The case is said to relate to sales of  vitamin B4 (choline chloride), which is used in animal feed.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission Thursday fined three big chemical companies a total EUR66.3 million for fixing prices on animal-feed  vitamins, signaling the new competition commissioner's priority to fight cartels.
German firm BASF AG (BF) received the largest fine of EUR35 million, while Dutch company  Akzo
Nobel NV (AKZOY) was fined EUR21 million, and Belgium's  UCB SA (UCB.BT) EUR10.4 million.

TD
U.S. company DuCoa and Canada-based  Chinook  were also found guilty of colluding on pricing but escaped fines because the statute of limitations on their actions had expired.

"I have made it crystal clear that the fight against cartels will be one of my top priorities," said new Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "This decision demonstrates that I intend to walk the walk, as well as talk the talk."

The three companies were found guilty of secretly colluding between 1992 and 1998 to set prices and share markets for additive  choline chloride. [ 12-09-04 0542ET ]

The investigation was part of a series of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread rigging of  vitamins prices during the 1990s.

European regulators also investigated and punished the  vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty of EUR462 million on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche subsidiary.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide revenue, but fines usually are much smaller.

In the present case, regulators said the  cartel operators met in secret from 1992 to 1994 to increase worldwide prices and allocate world markets. The North American producers agreed to withdraw from Europe in exchange for the  European producers withdrawing from North America.
From 1994 to 1998, the  European producers met and agreed prices and price increases for specific
European markets.

Because the North American companies no longer participated in  Europe after 1994, their crimes fell outside the five-year period of limitation for the imposition of fines. But regulators warned them not to engage in such behavior in future.

Regulators said the companies involved together controlled about 80% of the world market for the vitamins which are used as a feed additive for poultry and pigs to increase growth. The global market in 1997, the last year of the  cartel's operation, was worth about EUR180 million, with about EUR50 million in Europe.

BRUXELLES, 9 décembre (Reuters) - La Commission européenne  annonce jeudi avoir condamné les sociétés chimiques  Akzo Nobel, BASF et UCB à 66,34 millions d'euros d'amendes pour avoir constitué un  cartel afin de fixer les prix de ventes d'une  vitamine  utilisée dans l'alimentation animale.

Pour leur participation à ce cartel de l'additif B-4, l'exécutif  européen a décidé d'imposer des amendes de 20,99 millions d'euros au néerlandais Akzo, de 34,97 millions à l'allemand  BASF et de
10,38 millions au belge  UCB.

TD
"Le montant des amendes confirme la détermination de la  Commission à s'attaquer aux sociétés qui se livrent à des pratiques de cartel comme l'entente sur les prix et le partage de marché", peut-on lire dans un communiqué de l'exécutif européen.

La Commission a précisé que les sociétés américaines  Bioproducts et Ducoa, aux Etats-Unis, et Chinook,  au Canada, étaient également concernées mais qu'elles n'avaient pas été sanctionnées car elles s'étaient retirées du  cartel plus de cinq ans avant l'ouverture de son enquête. /JYC.

Bruxelles, 08/12/2004 (Agence  Europe) - La Commission (qui se réunit jeudi, au lieu de mercredi à cause du Sommet UE/Chine: voir plus haut) prendra deux décisions concernant "un  cartel et une fusion", a confirmé son porte-parole à la concurrence.

Récemment, les services de la concurrence de la  Commission avaient proposé de rejeter le projet d'acquisition de la compagnie de gaz naturel portugaise Gas de Portugal (GDP) par le fournisseur national d'électricité EDP et la compagnie italienne ENI (EUROPE du 23 novembre). A l'heure actuelle, il semble que les contreparties proposées par EDP n'aient pas évolué et ne suffisent pas à emporter une décision en sa faveur.

Quant à l'affaire antitrust, elle porterait sur un  cartel dans le domaine des vitamines B4. Selon Reuters, qui cite une source proche de l'enquête, plusieurs industries chimiques, parmi lesquelles les européennes, BASF (Allemagne), Akzo Nobel (Pays-Bas) et UBC (Belgique), seront condamnées pour avoir fixé les prix du chlorure de choline  (vitamine B4), un supplément utilisé dans l'alimentation animale.

BRUXELLES, 9 déc (AFP) -

La commissaire européenne  à la Concurrence Neelie Kroes estime avoir fait la démonstration de sa poigne, après le veto prononcé par Bruxelles jeudi à la fusion des groupes énergétiques portugais EDP et GDP et l'amende infligée à trois chimistes accusés de  cartel.

TD
Pour la première fois depuis trois ans, la  Commission européenne  vient d'interdire un mariage d'entreprises, celui de Energias de Portugal (EDP) et Gas de Portugal (GDP).
Le projet de rapprochement prévoyait concrètement qu'EDP prenne, avec l'italien ENI, le contrôle de
GDP, actuellement détenu par le portugais Galp Energia.

Mais l'opération, en renforçant les "positions dominantes" des deux groupes au Portugal, aurait réduit ou empêché la "libéralisation effective des marchés de l'électricité et du gaz" et accru "les prix pour les particuliers et les clients industriels", selon Bruxelles.

Les derniers vetos de la  Commission à des fusions d'entreprises remontaient à la fin 2001: ils avaient empêché les mariages des groupes français d'appareillage électriques Schneider et Legrand puis des groupes d'emballage pour boissons Tetra Laval (Suède) et Sidel (France).
L'exécutif européen a aussi infligé jeudi 66,34 millions d'euros d'amendes aux groupes  Akzo Nobel,
BASF et UCB pour une entente illicite dans le secteur des vitamines pour l'alimentation animale.

Avec ces deux décisions, prises par le collège de la  Commission à son initiative, Neelie Kroes estime avoir montré ne pas être le jouet des entreprises.

"Certaines personnes avaient suggéré que je ne prendrais pas de mesures fortes contre des entreprises (...) et que je serai une sorte de +minou+" ("pussy cat") pour les sociétés  européennes", a déclaré Mme Kroes lors de sa première conférence de presse depuis son entrée en fonctions le 22 novembre.

"J'avais promis de sortir mon sifflet (d'arbitre de la concurrence) quand c'est nécessaire, et aujourd'hui je vous montre que je mets cela en pratique", a-t-elle ajouté.

Soumis cet été à Bruxelles, le cas EDP/GDP avait été instruit sous le mandat du prédécesseur de Mme Kroes, Mario Monti, qui préconisait déjà de bloquer l'opération. Toujours est-il que la commissaire a repris à son compte les réserves des services de la Concurrence, endossant la responsabilité du non.

La nomination de cette ancienne ministre néerlandaise des Transports à la tête de la Concurrence a été très controversée, notamment au Parlement  européen où de nombreux députés voyaient d'un mauvais oeil ses nombreux liens passés avec le privé.

La commissaire, qui a coupé cet été ses liens avec le monde des affaires, a siégé dans de nombreux conseils de surveillance de multinationales, comme le constructeur automobile Volvo, Thales (électronique professionnelle), MMO2 (télécoms) ou le néerlandais Royal P&O Nedlloyd.

Pour parer tout risque de conflits d'intérêts au cours des cinq ans à venir, Mme Kroes sera d'ailleurs obligée de déléguer à ses collègues certaines affaires impliquant des sociétés pour lesquelles elle a travaillé.

Dès la première semaine de son mandat, elle a déjà dû se mettre sur la touche sur un premier dossier de concentration d'entreprises concernant P&O Nedlloyd. Dans les deux affaires tranchées ce jeudi, Mme Kroes était à l'abri de ces conflits d'intérêts.

Ironie du sort, c'est le président de la  Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso, à l'origine de la fusion d'EDP et GDP au temps où il était à la tête du gouvernement portugais, qui a dû faire preuve de discrétion.

BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (AFP) -

The European Commission said Thursday it had imposed fines totalling 66.34 million euros (88 million dollars) on three European pharmaceutical companies it said had colluded to fix animal vitamin  prices.

TD
BASF of Germany was fined 34.97 million  euros, the Dutch-Swedish group  Akzo Nobel 20.99 million and UCB of Belgium 10.38 million, it said in a statement.
The three were accused of secret contacts among themselves to fix prices and divide up the market for
vitamin B4, which is used as a food supplement for poultry and pigs.

It found that from 1992 until April 1994 the producers had met in secret in order to secure an increase in world prices, monitor their competitors and share out the market.

Two US firms and a Canadian company engaged in the initiative escaped without fines because they withdrew from the operation in April 1994, more than five years before the  commission opended its investigation, the statement said.

Brussels, 08/12/2004 (Agence  Europe) - The Commission, which met on Thursday instead of Wednesday due to the EU/China summit (see other article) will take two decisions on "a  cartel and a merger", its spokesperson for Competition has confirmed.

Recently, the  Commission's competition services proposed to reject plans of Portuguese electricity company EDP and the Italian company ENI to acquire the Portugal natural gas company Gas de Portugal (GDP) (EUROPE of 23 November). At the time being, it appears that the actions proposed by EDP to ensure that competition would not be distorted have not materialised, and are not enough to justify a decision in its favour.

The anti-trust case related to a  cartel in the field of  vitamin B4. According to Reuters, quoting a source close to the investigation, several chemical companies, including the  European UBC (Belgium),  BASF (Germany) and Akzo Nobel (Netherlands), will be found guilty of fixing the price of  choline  chlorure (vitamin B4), a supplement used in animal feed.

Edited Press Release
AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Dutch chemicals company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) Thursday said it has acknowledged the decision by the European Commission to impose a fine of EUR 21 million for breaching competition law in the European choline  chloride market between 1992 and 1998.

TD
The investigation by the  Commission commenced in 1999. The Company decided to intensify its competition compliance program in 2000. In view of  Akzo Nobel's strong and committed policy to crackdown on any potential  cartel issues, the Company fully cooperated with the  commission in its investigations.

Partly as a consequence of its intensified compliance program,  Akzo Nobel is still involved in investigations by the authorities in the United States, Canada and the  European Union into several alleged violations of respective antitrust laws. The Company has cooperated extensively with the authorities in all of these cases, which have a tendency to be time-consuming and complicated.

In 2000, the Company took a EUR200 million nonrecurring charge on its balance sheet. Based on the developments in a number of pending cases, in April this year, the Company adjusted its provision. The fine imposed by the Commission for choline chloride has been provided for in full.  Choline chloride, also known as Vitamin B4, is the most widely-used form of supplementing diets for production animals. Mainly used as an essential feed additive, it is indispensable for a number of fundamental processes in the body.

One of five  choline  specialties produced by  Akzo Nobel, the product is produced by the Company's Functional Chemicals business in Delfzijl (The Netherlands), Marano Ticino (Italy) and Yixing City (China).

THE European Commission is expected to fine three chemical firms - Dutch  Akzo Nobel, German BASF AG and Belgian UCB - a total of l66 million today (9 December) for running a  cartel on vitamin B-4, a pet-food supplement.

THE European Commission is expected to block a merger of Portugal’s main power and gas groups, EDP and GDP, today (9 December) because of fears of market domination. EDP and the Portuguese government failed to convince the  Commission that the deal should be considered in the context of the Iberian Peninsula market instead of the Portuguese market alone.

EU EMPLOYMENT ministers were again unable to reach agreement on EU rules on working time on Tuesday (7 December). A blocking minority of France, Belgium, Sweden, Greece and Spain voted down the compromise to allow employees to opt-out of the EU’s maximum 48-hour working week through agreements between their trade unions and employers. But ministers did decide that ‘on call’ time, which often applies to doctors, should not count as working time.

ITALY’S finance ministry said on Tuesday that it was looking into its national accounts after the European Commission said it was not satisfied with Rome’s explanation of why its published deficit levels have been lower than its borrowing requirements. The ministry said the discrepancies, in
2001-03, were due to the way Italy had accounted for public deposits and the transfer of some government holdings to semi-autonomous holdings.

EUROZONE finance ministers published a joint statement calling the rise of the  euro an "unwelcome movement" and calling on "all major countries and economic areas" to "play their part more actively in reducing global imbalances".

EU FINANCE ministers backed a proposal imposing new capital requirements on banks according to the risks that they take. The proposal, which implements the global Basel II accord on banking solvency, has to be approved by the  European Parliament before it can become law. Ministers also approved tightened rules for EU auditors and agreed stricter control on cash payments above _15,000 at places such as casinos and currency exchange bureaux.
EU TRADE chief Peter Mandelson held talks with US Trade Representative

Robert Zoellick in Paris on Monday (6 December) over the issue of subsidies for  Europe’s Airbus and America’s Boeing air carriers, but told journalists that no alternative to a WTO litigation case had been found.

German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group  BASF AG was ordered by the European Commission (EC) to pay a fine of 34.97 mln  euro ($46.4 mln) on charges of  cartel agreements with Dutch Akzo Nobel and Belgian  UCB, the EC said on December 9, 2004.
The three companies are said to have fixed prices on animal-feed vitamin  B-4. Akzo Nobel is to pay
20.99 mln euro ($27.9 mln) and UCB 10.38 mln euro ($13.8 mln). The vitamins are used as a feed
additive for fowl and pigs to increase growth.

TD
BASF said the case was linked to a vitamin  case from 1999 which concerns the product  choline        chloride. BASF was fined $225 mln euro (169.5 mln euro) by the U.S. authorities then, and also paid a 296 mln euro ($392.8 mln) fine to the EC in 2001.

The German group currently mulls whether to take legal action against the EC's decision. As soon as BASF has had a chance to examine the decision, it will make a statement on the question of an appeal, a group spokesperson said.

BRUSSELS:

Neelie Kroes came out swinging Thursday in her first public appearance as  Europe's new competition commissioner, blocking a merger in the energy industry and slapping fines on three chemical companies for running a cartel.

TD
Speaking at a news conference, the Dutch commissioner expressed "zero tolerance" for cartels and spoke out in defense of energy consumers.

In language that contrasted with the measured, academic style of her predecessor, Mario Monti, she sought to lay to rest suspicions that her close ties with the corporate world before taking office would compromise her ability to police industry.

"Some people said I would hold back, that I was too close to business and I'd be some kind of pussycat," she said. "I love it when people say that in private circumstances, but not in business activities. The pussycat won't be here for the next five years."

Kroes, 63, has occupied numerous nonexecutive board positions over the past decade. She resigned from all her board positions in September after she was chosen to replace Monti.

She has promised to recuse herself from any decision involving a company she worked for, and also vowed never to work in the private sector again.

Kroes's proposal to block the acquisition of Gas de Portugal by Energias de Portugal and the Italian energy company ENI was approved Thursday by her fellow commissioners.

Like Monti, who described cartels as "a cancer" on an industry, Kroes promised to make  cartel-busting a priority. "Today's ruling is clear proof that I will be steadfast in applying zero tolerance regarding cartels," she said.

The Portuguese deal would have strengthened Energias de Portugal's already dominant position in the country's electricity market to the detriment of local energy users, because Gas de Portugal competes in the liberalized electricity market, the  commission said.

Portugal's gas market is being opened up to competition. The  commission said the deal would neutralize the effects of the liberalization of the gas market, partly by eliminating Energias as a "most likely entrant" in the gas market, and partly "through the foreclosure of a significant part of gas demand."

"Ensuring effective competition in newly liberalized markets such as energy is a priority for me, to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of new market access," Kroes said.

The commission also imposed fines totaling 66.3 million, or $88.3 million, on the Dutch chemical company Akzo Nobel, BASF of Germany and the Belgium-based  UCB for operating a six-year  cartel in the market for choline  chloride, an animal growth stimulant mainly used with poultry and pigs and

commonly known as vitamin B4. DuCoa, based in Highland, Illinois, and Chinook  Group of Canada were also found to have colluded in setting prices and carving up the European market, but they
escaped a fine because they pulled out of the  cartel more than five years before the  commission began its inquiry.
Both companies, however, were fined by the Justice Department for operating a similar  cartel in the
United States.

BASF received the biggest fine from the commission, just under 35 million, because of its involvement in another vitamins cartel three years ago, the commission explained.

In 2001 BASF was fined almost 300 million by the  commission for serving as the ringleader in the biggest-ever European cartel.

That cartel fixed the prices of a number of  vitamins for human as well as animal consumption over a period of 10 years.

HD          Akzo Nobel acknowledges EU fine for choline chloride cartel

Arnhem, the Netherlands, -  Akzo Nobel has acknowledged the decision by the European Commission to impose a fine of EUR 21 million for breaching competition law in the European choline  chloride market between 1992 and 1998. The investigation by the Commission commenced in 1999.

The Company decided to intensify its competition compliance program in 2000. In view of  Akzo Nobels strong and committed policy to crackdown on any potential  cartel issues, the Company fully cooperated with the  commission in its investigations.

TD
Partly as a consequence of its intensified compliance program,  Akzo Nobel is still involved in investigations by the authorities in the United States, Canada and the  European Union into several alleged violations of respective antitrust laws. The Company has cooperated extensively with the authorities in all of these cases, which have a tendency to be time-consuming and complicated.

In 2000, the Company took a EUR 200 million nonrecurring charge on its balance sheet. Based on the developments in a number of pending cases, in April this year, the Company adjusted its provision. The fine imposed by the  Commission for choline chloride has been provided for in full.

Choline chloride, also known as Vitamin B4, is the most widely-used form of supplementing diets for production animals. Mainly used as an essential feed additive, it is indispensable for a number of fundamental processes in the body. One of five  choline  specialties produced by  Akzo Nobel, the product is produced by the Companys Functional Chemicals business in Delfzijl (The Netherlands), Marano Ticino (Italy) and Yixing City (China).

HD        Chemical Firms Fined, Energy Merger Blocked  by 'Tough'  New EU Competition Commissioner

European Union (EU) Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has signalled that she will take a hardline stance in her new post by vetoing a merger of two Portuguese energy concerns, Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) and Gaz de Portugal (GdP), amid concerns of a monopoly, and issuing three chemical companies with fines for  price fixing.  Germany's Basf, the Dutch-Swedish  Akzo Nobel and Belgium's  UCB were fined for creating an artificialmarket for vitamin  B4, which is commonly used asa food supplement.

TD
The blocking of the proposed merger of electricity companyEDP and gas firm GDP had been expected, but it is the first such rejection of an energy merger for three years.The  European Commission had asked EPD to divest some of its electricity interests in order for the merger to proceed, which it has refused to do.The rejectionis a blow for the Portuguese government, which had strongly backed the move, and has come up against the might of the  Commission on the issue of mergers on previous occasions.

Significance: When Kroes was nominated as competition commissioner, there was criticism that she was unsuitable for the post. She is clearly keen to demonstrate that she can fill the shoes of her predecessor, the Italian Mario Monti, and will take a tough line on anti-competitive issues.

HD        UCB, Akzo and BASF Slapped with EU Fines over Vitamin B4 Cartel

UCB (Belgium),  Akzo Nobel (Netherlands) and BASF (Germany) have been fined by the  European       Commission for anticompetitive activities involving vitamin  B4 for animal feed. The companies were found guilty of operating a  cartel and conspiring to set prices and divide European markets amongst themselves during a three-year period ending in 1997. The fines are 34.97m euro (US$46.20m) for BASF, 20.99m euro for Akzo Nobel and 10.38m  euro for UCB.

TD
Significance:  BASF is examining its options, according to the AFX news agency, while  UCB has issued a statement indicating that the penalty refers to an activity that has since been divested. The Belgian company may yet decide to file an appeal, but has reiterated that the 10.38m  euro fine will not have any material impact on its financial results.  UCB is currently in the process of transforming itself into a pure biopharmaceutical company, leaving behind a past of chemicals, coating and films production. The company has a rich pipeline, especially after the acquisition of British biotech Celltech earlier in the year, and has set itself ambitious product development targets for the next couple of years (see Belgium: 7
December 2004: UCB Reveals Ambitious Product Development Plans in Latest Business Review).

Bruxelles, 09/12/2004 (Agence Europe) - La Commission a décidé jeudi d'infliger une amende de 66,34 millions d'euros à trois sociétés européennes pour s'être entendues sur les prix du chlorure de  choline (vitamines B4) entre 1992 et 1998. Très déterminée lors de sa première sortie devant la presse bruxelloise en tant que Commissaire à la concurrence, Neelie Kroes a d'abord tenu à adresser un message à ceux qui doutaient de son impartialité et "semblaient suggérer qu'aucune action sévère contre les entreprises qui violent les règles de la concurrence" puisse être prise. Satisfaite des deux importantes décisions du jour (voir autre nouvelle sur GDP), Mme Kroes y voit le signe de son indépendance du
monde des affaires et "les preuves que je suis à même de prendre les décisions qui s'imposent le moment venu".

TD
Au terme d'un discours relativement musclé, au cours duquel elle a estimé ne pas avoir l'attitude d'un "chaton" que certains lui prêtaient face au monde des entreprises, elle a prévenu: "il va falloir vous habituer à ma personnalité".

Au terme de son enquête, ouverte en 1999 sur dénonciation, la Commission a conclu à la culpabilité des sociétés Akzo Nobel (Pays-Bas),  BASF (Allemagne),  UCB (Belgique), Bioproducts (Etats-Unis), DuCoa (Etats-Unis) et Chinook  (Canada). Ces sociétés qui détenaient près de 80 % du marché mondial en 1997 du chlorure de choline  (estimé à environ 180 millions d'euros) s'étaient entendues au début des années
90 pour fixer les prix et se partager les marchés de cette vitamine,  utilisée surtout comme additif alimentaire afin de favoriser la croissance des volailles et des porcs, de réduire leur mortalité et d'améliorer la qualité de la viande.

Entre 1992 et avril 1994, l'accord secret a permis à toutes ces entreprises chimiques d'augmenter les prix mondiaux du chlorure de choline  et de se répartir les marchés, les sociétés américaines se retirant du marché européen et inversement. De 1994 à octobre 1998, seules les compagnies  européennes ont continué à s'entendre entre elles au sujet des hausses de prix sur les marchés nationaux de l'Espace économique européen (EEE) et de leurs parts de marchés respectives, ainsi que sur la répartition des clients. Les sociétés nord-américaines qui ont cessé de participer au  cartel en avril 1994 ne se voient pas infliger d'amendes. En se retirant du  cartel cinq ans avant l'ouverture de la première enquête de la Commission, elles bénéficient de la prescription en vigueur pour l'imposition de sanctions financières. Compte tenu notamment de la durée de l'infraction, de la taille des sociétés, de leur coopération à l'enquête et de l'antécédent de  BASF, déjà condamné pour des faits similaires, les amendes de la Commission se répartissent comme suit: 10,38 millions pour  UCB, 20,99 millions d'euros pour Akzo Nobel, et 34,97 millions pour BASF. Cette dernière avait été condamnée à 296 millions d'amendes en
2001, lorsque la Commission avait infligé des amendes record de 855 millions à huit entreprises pharmaceutiques pour un cartel des vitamines.

Dans ce type d'affaire, dont elle fait une priorité pour son mandat, "la  Commission ne tolérera tout simplement pas que les avantages apportés par le marché unique de l'UE soient refusés aux clients à cause d'ententes et d'autres pratiques anti-concurrentielles", a averti Neelie Kroes. Et d'insister sur sa politique personnelle de "tolérance zéro à l'égard de ceux qui opèrent un  cartel au désavantage des consommateurs".

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: 66.34 million EUR in fines for BASF, Akzo Nobel and UCB for cartel on vitamin B4 prices - Exemplary  decision, says Neelie Kroes, who sees this as proof of her impartiality

Brussels, 09/12/2004 (Agence Europe) - On Thursday, the  European Commission decided to impose a fine of 66.34 million EUR on three European companies for having made an agreement about  choline     chloride (vitamin B4) prices between 1992 and 1998. Determined to make a good showing at her first outing before the Brussels press as Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes started by sending out a clear message to all those who have doubts about her impartiality and "seemed to suggest that no firm action against companies which break the rules of competition" would be forthcoming. Very pleased with the two important decisions of the day (on GDP- see other article), Ms Kroes saw this as a sign of her independence from the business world and "the proof that I am capable of making the necessary
decisions when I have to".

TD
At the end of a relatively robust discussion, during which she said that she was not quite the "pussycat" towards the business world various people may have portrayed her as, she said: "you will have to get used to my personality".

At the end of this investigation, which was opened in 1999 further to whistleblowing, the  Commission concluded that the companies  Akzo Nobel (Netherlands), BASF (Germany), UCB (Belgium), Bioproducts (United States), DuCoa (United States) and Chinook  (Canada) were guilty. These companies, which controlled nearly 80% of the world choline  chloride market in 1997 (estimated at around 180 million EUR), agreed in the early 1990s to fix prices and share the market for this  vitamin,
which is mainly used as a food additive to boost the growth of poultry and pigs, reduce their mortality rates and improve the quality of their meat.

Between 1992 and April 1994, the secret agreement allowed all of the above chemicals companies to push up world prices for  choline chloride and to divide up the market between themselves, with the American companies withdrawing from the  European markets and vice versa. From 1994 to October
1998, only the  European companies continued to pursue an agreement between themselves on price increases on the national markets of the  European Economic Area (EEA), on their respective market shares, and on how the individual clients were divided up.

US companies that stopped taking part in the  cartel in April 1994 will not be fined. Withdrawing from the cartel five years before the  Commission probe began, they are not subject to the rules in force at the time imposing financial penalties. Taking into account the period of the infringement, their cooperation in the investigation and the former  BASF, which had already been found guilty of similar irregularities, the
Commission fines are a follows: 10.38 million for  UCB, 20.99 million for Akzo Nobel and 34.97 for  BASF. The latter had already received a 296 million fine in 2001 when the Commission imposed record fines of
855 million on eight pharmaceutical companies involved in a vitamin  cartel.

In this kind of case, which Neelie Kroes is making a priority in her mandate, she warned that the Commission would not tolerate the fact that the advantages in the EU single market are refused to customers due to agreements and other anti-competitive practices. She insisted that her personal policy would be zero tolerance of those operating cartels to the disadvantage of consumers.

BASF, the German chemicals giant, is facing a further demand from the EU Commission for the payment of a fine, to amount to around 35m  euros, in connection with a vitamin  cartel. The EU claims that the German company, Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands and  UCB of Belgium were involved in a pricing agreement for vitamin  B4 between 1992 and 1998. The three North American chemicals companies also said to have participated in the  cartel have not been fined, as they withdrew in 1994.
Earlier, in 2001, a fine of around 297m  euros was demanded of BASF for vitamin price fixing  between
1989 and 1999. The two cases are reported to be separate.

HD         EU moves to bar 'protective' mergers:  Competition commissioner puts interests of consumers first as planned Portuguese energy takeover is thrown  out

Neelie Kroes, the EU's controversial new competition commissioner, yesterday signalled to the French authorities that she would block any attempt to protect France's energy market by engineering a merger between its state-owned electricity and gas groups.

In her first high-profile decision Ms Kroes, a Dutch liberal, threw out a planned takeover by Electricidade de Portugal and Italy's ENI of state-owned Gas de Portugal - the  commission's first ban on a merger
for almost three years.

TD
Aides to the commissioner said the move sent a clear message to France and others that protective national mergers designed to prevent foreign takeovers would be ruled out.

Her decision, accompanied by clear warnings that the interests of consumers would be paramount in such cases, is an effective green light for foreign takeovers of national incumbents in domestic EU energy markets - a longstanding demand of British players such as Centrica, owner of British Gas.

Ms Kroes, who has been accused by her critics of being a lame duck commissioner because of conflicts of interest caused by her extensive business background, hit back by insisting she was no "pussy cat" and would blow the whistle on corporate activity she considers inimical to competition. She set out a policy of "zero tolerance" towards cartels by imposing fines of  euros 66.34m (pounds 45.9m) on Akzo Nobel, BASF and Belgium's  UCB for operating a  cartel in the market for an animal feed vitamin  known as choline  chloride.

But it is her ban on the Por tuguese merger, the first since her predecessor, Mario Monti, beat a retreat after the  European court of justice rescinded three of his vetoes on such transactions in 2002, that underlines the new  commission's tougher attitude towards anti-competitive corporate behaviour.

EDP planned to take 51% and ENI 49% of GDP but Ms Kroes said the takeover would have undermined the benefits of energy liberalisation, due to be completed throughout the EU later this decade, excluded new entrants, meant higher prices for retail and business consumers and eroded the competitive position of Portuguese industry.

Alvaro Barreto, Portugal's economic affairs minister, said he would back any court appeal against the commission, arguing that the deal would help firms compete in a wider Iberian market. But Ms Kroes, who said she had held repeated talks with Mr Barreto, said there was no evidence an Iberian market with Spain would emerge "on a short to medium-term basis".

France, which wants to part-privatise EDF and GDF, its electricity and gas groups, next year, has considered a "Franco-French" merger between the two to prevent any foreign bid for either.

She said: "Effective competition on their home market also ensures that suppliers are efficient and better able to penetrate other markets. Ensuring effective competition in newly-liberalised markets such as energy is a priority for me - to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralise the effects of new market access."

Ms Kroes did, however, wave through the acquisition of British cement-producer RMC by Mexico's
Cemex.

The European Commission has decided to impose fines totalling 66.34 million [euro] on three companies for operating a cartel in the market for  choline chloride--a vitamin  additive used in animal feed.

"The Commission will simply not tolerate that the benefits of the EU's Single Market are denied to customers by cartels and other anticompetitive practices," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

TD
Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands,  BASF of Germany and  UCB of Belgium were found to have colluded with two North American companies to set prices and share markets for  choline chloride within the
European Economic Area (EEA), in violation of EU Treaty rules.
Together the companies involved controlled around 80% of the world market and of the EEA market for
choline chloride.
Market carve-up deal

Between 1992 and April 1994, the  Commission said, the companies met in secret to increase worldwide prices, allocate world markets and control competitors. The North American producers agreed to withdraw from Europe, in exchange for the  European producers withdrawing from North America.
Between March 1994 and October 1998, the  European producers continued to collude on prices in the
EEA, allocating individual clients among themselves and agreeing EEA-wide market shares.
As the North American companies ended their participation in the infringement in April 1994, they
escaped fines as investigations began after a five-year limitation period for imposing fines for  price fixing.
In 1997, the last full year of the infringement, the world market for  choline chloride was worth around
180m [euro] and that of the EEA market over 50m [euro]. (b)

BRUSSELS, Dec. 9 -- Talking tough in her first public appearance since becoming  Europe's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes blocked a merger in Portugal's energy industry on Thursday and set fines on three chemical companies for colluding on prices.

Expressing ''zero tolerance'' for cartels and speaking out in defense of energy consumers both individual and corporate, Ms. Kroes tried to lay to rest suspicions that her close ties to business before taking office would compromise her ability to police that world.

TD
Ms. Kroes, 63, has held numerous nonexecutive board positions in a wide range of companies over the last decade, and before that was transportation minister of the Netherlands.
She resigned all her board positions when she was picked at the end of the summer to replace Mario
Monti as Europe's antitrust chief.

To reassure her critics, she promised to recuse herself from any decision involving a company she worked for, and also vowed never to work in the private sector again.

''Some people said I would hold back, that I was too close to business and I'd be some kind of pussycat,'' she said at a news conference Thursday, adding: ''The decisions taken today are hard evidence to the contrary.''

Ms. Kroes's recommendation to block the acquisition of Gas de Portugal by Energias de Portugal and the Italian energy company ENI was accepted Thursday by her fellow commissioners at their weekly meeting.

The commission said in a statement that the deal would have strengthened Energias de Portugal's already dominant position in the Portuguese electricity market to the detriment of consumers, because Gas de Portugal competes in the newly deregulated electricity market.
Portugal's gas market is in the process of opening to competition. The  commission said the deal
would neutralize the effects of that process -- partly by eliminating Energias de Portugal, which is not in
the gas market at present, as a ''mostly likely entrant'' to that market -- and would result in higher
prices to consumers.

''Ensuring effective competition in newly liberalized markets such as energy is a priority for me, to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of new market access,'' Ms. Kroes said.

Also, the commission imposed a fine of 66.3 million  euros ($88.4 million) on three chemical companies -- Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, BASF of Germany and  UCB of Belgium -- for running a cartel in the market for  vitamin B4, or choline  chloride, an animal growth stimulant given mainly to poultry and pigs.

DuCoa of the United States, now part of Nutreco Holding of the Netherlands, and the Chinook  Group of Canada were also found to have colluded in setting prices and dividing up the European market, but they were not fined because they withdrew from the  cartel more than five years before the commission began its inquiry in 1999. The United States Justice Department fined  Chinook  in 1999 and DuCoa in 2002 for operating a similar  cartel in the United States.

The European cartel ceased operating in 1998 after six years of operation. Among the participants, BASF received the biggest fine, just under 35 million euros ($46.7 million), because of its involvement in another vitamins cartel three years ago, the commission said in a statement. In 2001, BASF was fined almost 300 million euros by the commission for its ringleader role in a European cartel that fixed the prices of a number of vitamins for human as well as animal consumption over a period of 10 years.

''Today's ruling is clear proof that I will be steadfast in applying zero tolerance regarding cartels,'' Ms. Kroes said.

Like her predecessor, Mr. Monti, who described cartels as a cancer on industry, Ms. Kroes promised to make cartel-busting a priority.

The message was clear that the new competition commissioner will try to acquire the tough reputation enjoyed by Mr. Monti. Ms. Kroes's delivery, however, was very different from the measured, academic and rather wooden oratory of her predecessor.

Pursuing the feline metaphor, she said: ''I love it when people say that in private circumstances, but not in business activities. The pussycat won't be here for the next five years.''

"We've had One.Tel - really, really had it," Lars Longreach pondered. "And then there's NewTel and SingTel. Now we've got  CarTel. You'd think that car phones would be quite passe by now. Why is the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission so interested in them?"

TD
The Dobermans tensed. It was early and already it was going to be a bad day.

Fraulein Flenser purred. "Do tell. I'd say that the word  cartel has its root, if you'll excuse me, in the Italian cartello, which means placard - implying a piece of cardboard upon which some agreement is written."
Cardboard, the Fraulein thought, that's one right out of the box for the fiddle exposed at Amcor. The global packaging group bounced its chief executive and the managing director of its
Australasian operations this week after news of the operation of a  cartel in the cardboard box
business broke the surface.

"MoTel," Longreach murmurred. "My father would tell me never to trust a man with a moustache who keeps his small change in a purse. Or was it simply never trust a man with a moustache?"
"Then there's HoTel," he said, but his voice trailed off under the gaze of the Fraulein.

ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel has had a bit to say about cartels before. Two weeks ago, he told a conference that  cartel behaviour was a form of theft and "little different from classes of corporate crime that already attract criminal sentences" though it was not always seen that way.

Further, cartels were a cancer on the economy, damaging business and consumers through "silent extortion".

That warning was reinforced when Samuel said 11 very serious  cartel operations had been exposed since the ACCC's leniency policy was introduced in June last year.

Social welfare and tax cheats can be jailed, the chairman says, so corporate chiefs involved in cartels should face heavy sentences.

Amcor might find a little comfort in its travails due to the leniency policy, under which those blowing the whistle on themselves may face an easier time.
As he ploughs this fertile field, Samuel is promising that there are more busts in the offing. The wrong chemistry

The Dobermans have been sniffing around for examples of this unattractive underbelly of commerce.

Sure, they were familiar with the decades-long protection afforded the don't-call-us-a-cartel International Air Transport Association. IATA operated with immunity from antitrust prosecution and there was no price-fixing when member airlines met, rather it was "tariff co-ordination".

But their sniffing did come up with news of a  cartel caught for fixing the price of something that would make the noble hounds feel better. No, they were not thinking of the Colombia's Medillin cartel and its robust distribution of a cooler coca.

Rather it was the European Commission's imposition this week of fines totalling 66.34 million euros on chemical groups Akzo Nobel, BASF and UCB for operating a  cartel in the choline           chloride market.

Choline chloride, or vitamin B4, is an animal growth stimulant, used mainly as a feed additive for poultry and pigs.
It boosts growth, lowers mortality and improves meat quality.

The latest case is just one of many involving cartels of chemical manufacturers over the past five years, with regulators in  Europe and the US often battling repeat offenders.

BASF of Germany, caught in the latest action, in 2001 was hit with a 300 million  euro fine for its part in a 10-year price-fixing conspiracy involving vitamins for humans and animals.
Oil tanks

"Of course," the Fraulein said, "There's one  cartel we deal with every day, and it's risen to a reasonable level of acceptability, if not respectability."
It is, of course, your favourite acronym, OPEC.

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries hit its straps in the early 1970s, and though it has refined its tactics beyond the clumsy bludgeons of embargo and haphazard supply squeeze, its mutterings seem no more coherent.

According to the  cartel's top producer, Saudi Arabia, OPEC was looking this week for ways to steady falling oil prices, which have dropped by a quarter in the past six weeks.

The Saudis were also hoping to ease the fears of fellow members of a supply surplus, but they faced mounting calls from within the  cartel for a production cut from current record levels through enforcing quota compliance.
OPEC wants to rein in that surge, but the question is: how fast?

It is this  cartel's eternal dilemma. Squeeze supply and advanced economies splutter under the weight of rising prices. If the economies stall, demand drops. Open the spigot too much, and the abundant supply cuts the floor from under prices.

One factor adding to the skew - and one which will ease upward pressure on prices - is the filling of the US's strategic petroleum reserve.

This reserve - some 700 million barrels of crude stored in underground  salt caverns at four sites along the Gulf of Mexico - will be filled to the brim for the first time early next year.

From its creation two years after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, it's taken 29 years and $US20 billion of taxpayers' money to get it to the final top-up.
An ocean of oil, but equal to just two months of the US's imported needs. Showing their mettle
In their indelicate years, the Dobermans did a stretch and many more trotting along the perimeter fence of a scrap metal yard, confident their bite was much worse than their bark and their bark was better to bear than their breath.

It was an honest job, keeping at bay the over-inquisitive while admitting folk who spoke in a nasal drone with an unsettling edge and often came with a trailer full of lead and copper that carpers would say was still warm from the sun on a church roof.

The ACCC had been busy around the scrap metal yards in 2001 when it started a case against a so-called ring of metal workers who colluded at auctions.
On Thursday, the federal court fined five companies and nine individuals a total of $485,000 for the
cartel behaviour of price-fixing and boycotts. Costs will take another $100,000-plus.

The group would nominate a single bidder after agreeing that no one else would bid, and afterwards would hold a mini-auction at a hotel or club.
Pirate power

The lower orders, who rarely think before they speak, are given to uncomfortable utterances such as how the US music and entertainment industries work virtually as a  cartel and eventually will control everything you see or hear.

These same morally moribund miscreants are the type, Fraulein Flenser avers, who think pirates are correct to say copyright really means copy? right!

The US, after years of a softly, softly approach trying to stop piracy of its goods in China, has now set up shop in Beijing aimed at beating the problem.

The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that 90 per cent of the DVDs, CDs and digital games sold by street vendors and in shops in China are pirated. In 2003, American businesses lost $US2.5 billion to copyright theft originating in China, the alliance estimates.

Unfortunately, the illicit trading in these and many other manufactures - like footwear, clothing, prescription drugs and toiletries - forms a significant part of the economy, with thousands of workers. How far the teamwork of the new two best mates goes remains to be seen. Do you copy?
Where there's smoke

Dream of the heat in an opium house, up a steep staircase and close to the rafters, your head on a wooden pillow while a man, stripped to the waist, his torso shimmering with sweat in the light of a hurricane lamp, squats and prepares a pipe with the thick treacle and holds it over the flame. Six pipes, sir, and.
And dream.

Of another  cartel. Of a time when the British East India Company ran what is probably still the biggest price and supply-fixing drug operation in history.
The company traded the opium grown in its commercially cultivated fields in Bengal for tea from
China, bartering misery and dependency for a morning cuppa or more on the other side of the world.

When the Chinese government tried its own brand of regulation, intercepting ships laden with opium and sinking them, the  cartel chiefs went to war.
The Chinese lost the fight. And they lost Hong Kong for 155 years.

When the second Opium War erupted 14 years later, the French joined Britain for the fighting, while the US and Russia joined in the resulting treaties that forced the opium trade on China.

There seemed no problems at that time with these four powerful nations forming a coalition of the killing.

HD       Cartel des vitamines : fabricants proposent un réglement  hors cours (presse) BY      STP

MONTREAL, 11 déc (AFP) -

Les groupes chimiques et pharmaceutiques accusés d'entente illicite sur les prix des  vitamines dans les années 90 ont proposé de payer 132,2 millions de dollars canadiens (108 M USD) pour mettre fin aux poursuites judiciaires lancées contre eux au Canada, rapporte samedi le quotidien National Post.

TD
Selon le journal, les 14 fabricants incriminés, dont le Suisse La Roche, l'Allemand  BASF et le Japonais Daiichi Pharmaceuticals ont déposé vendredi cette proposition de réglement devant des tribunaux des provinces de l'Ontario de Colombie-Britannique et du Québec.

Elle sera examinée par la cour le 8 et 9 mars prochain, en Ontario, le 6 avril en Colombie-Britannique et le 21 au Québec.

Plusieurs groupes de consommateurs, d'associations d'éleveurs et de distributeurs, avaient entamé des recours collectifs contre ces fabricants, réclamant près de 2 milliards CAD (1,64 Md USD) de dommages et intérêts.

Dans les années 1990, Roche avait été le principal instigateur d'un cartel entre grands producteurs mondiaux, qui s'étaient entendus pour maintenir le prix des vitamines à un niveau anormalement élevé, faussant ainsi les règles de la libre-concurrence.

Fin 2001, la Commission européenne  a condamné à une amende record de 855,22 millions d'euros huit producteurs de vitamines coupables d'entente illicite, dont 462 millions pour Roche et 296 millions pour BASF.

Aux Etats-Unis, Roche a été condamné en mai 1999 à 500 millions de dollars d'amende par les autorités anti-trust américaines et  BASF à 225 M USD. Les groupes ont en outre accepté de payer plus d'un milliard de dollars de dédommagement à leurs clients américains.
Au Canada, le tribunal de la concurrence les avait condamnés en 2000 à une amende de 88,4 millions
CAD (72,5 M USD).

HD     ALIMENTATION ANIMALE: AMENDE DE 66 MILLIONS D'EUROS CONTRE UN CARTEL DANS LE SECTEUR DES VITAMINES

LP
La Commission européenne  a décidé le 9 décembre d'infliger des amendes d'un montant total de 66,34 millions d'euros à trois entreprises chimiques pour avoir mis sur pied une entente sur le marché des vitamines animales au sein de l'UE. Les sociétés néerlandaise  Akzo Nobel, allemande BASF et belge UCB sont reconnues coupables d'avoir fixé les prix sur le marché du chlorure de choline,  également appelé vitamine  B4, qui est utilisé comme additif alimentaire pour les volailles et les porcs. Le commissaire chargé de la Concurrence, Neelie Kroes, a souligné, à cette occasion, que la  Commission ne tolérerait pas que les avantages apportés par le marché unique de l'UE soient neutralisés par des sociétés qui se partagent le butin entre elles.

TD
La Commission est parvenue à la conclusion que les trois sociétés s'étaient entendues en secret avec les sociétés américaines  Bioproducts et DuCoa ainsi que la société canadienne Chinook  pour fixer les prix et se partager les marchés du chlorure de  choline  dans l'Espace économique européen. Les sociétés en cause contrôlaient ensemble environ 80% du marché du chlorure de choline  dans le monde et dans l'EEE. En 1997, qui est la dernière année pleine de l'infraction, la valeur du marché mondial du chlorure de choline  s'élevait à environ 180 millions d'euros et celle du marché EEE à plus de 50 millions d'euros.
Les services de concurrence de la Commission ont accusé les sociétés de s'être réunis en secret entre
1992 et avril 1994, afin d'augmenter les prix mondiaux, de se répartir les marchés et de contrôler leurs
concurrents. Les producteurs nord-américains ont accepté de se retirer du marché  européen, les
producteurs européens  se retirant en échange du marché nord-américain. De mars 1994 à octobre
1998, les producteurs européens  ont continué à se réunir et à se mettre d'accord sur les prix et les
augmentations de prix pour des marchés nationaux spécifiques dans l'EEE, à se répartir entre eux des
clients individuels et à se mettre d'accord sur leur part de marché dans l'EEE.

Les sociétés nord-américaines ayant cessé de prendre part à l'infraction en avril 1994, elles ne se verront pas infliger d'amendes, puisque la première enquête de la  Commission a démarré plus de cinq ans
après cette date. Les autorités  européennes les ont néanmoins averties de ne plus adopter ce type de comportement à l'avenir.
Les sociétés européennes n'ont pas eu cette chance.  BASF a écopé de la plus lourde amende, soit
34,97 millions d'euros. La Commission a également infligé une amende de 20,99 millions d'euros
àAkzo Nobel et de 10,38 millions d'euros à UCB.

Le montant des amendes confirme la détermination de la  Commission à frapper lourdement les sociétés qui s'entendent pour se livrer à des pratiques interdites telles que la fixation des prix et le partage des marchés. La Commission a estimé que l'infraction était très grave, en raison de sa nature et de sa
portée géographique. La Commission a également tenu compte de la valeur du marché EEE pour le produit en cause, de la durée de l'infraction, du poids individuel des sociétés parties à l'infraction, de leur taille globale, et de la coopération apportée par chacun des trois producteurs  européens  à l'enquête. BASF a été particulièrement critiquée car elle avait déjà été condamnée pour des infractions similaires auparavant.

Akzo Nobel a indiqué avoir pleinement coopéré lors de l'enquête de la Commission et faire l'objet d'autres enquêtes par les autorités américaines, canadiennes et européennes pour des accusations de violation des règles de concurrence.  BASF et UCB ont indiqué à l'Agence France Presse qu'ils

envisageaient d'attaquer la  Commission en justice mais qu'ils examineraient plus à fond la décision du 9 décembre avant de prendre une décision.

HD     ANIMAL FEED: EU FINES VITAMIN CARTEL EURO 66 MILLION WC     511 words

Three chemical firms have been slapped with a Euro 66.34 million fine for running an animal feed vitamin cartel in the EU. The European Commission said Dutch chemical firm  Akzo Nobel, German chemical giant BASF and Belgian pharmaceutical company  UCB were guilty of fixing prices in the market for choline  chloride - also known as vitamin B4 - which is added to poultry and pig feed rations. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the EU anti-trust watchdog would not allow the benefits of the European Single Market to be neutralised by companies carving up the spoils among themselves.

TD
The Commission said the three companies had colluded with three North American rivals -  Bioproducts and DuCoa from the United States and  Chinook  from Canada - to secretly set prices and carve up the European market. Together the companies controlled 80% of both the world and  European Economic Area market for  choline chloride. In 1997, the last year the cartel was in full swing, the global market
was worth Euro 180 million while the EEA represented more than Euro 50 million.

EU officials have accused the companies of meeting in secret between 1992 and April 1994 to increase world-wide prices, share out the world market and control their rivals. The North Americans agreed to pull out of Europe if the Europeans  would withdraw from America.  European producers held their own meetings between March 1994 and October 1998 to agree prices and price increases for specific national markets in Europe, decide who would take each client and how much market share they would have.

The North American companies escape fines because the  Commission's investigation started in 1999 - more than five years after their alleged crime. But EU authorities have warned them not to fix prices in the future.

The European firms weren't so lucky.  BASF has been fined the most - a hefty Euro 34.97 million.  Akzo Nobel has been ordered to pay Euro 20.99 million and  UCB must hand over Euro 10.38 million. Heavy fines were levied because the Commission said it is determined to crack down hard on companies engaged in cartel practices such as price-fixing and market-sharing. "The  Commission considered the infringement to be a very serious one because of its nature and its geographic scope", it said. It took into account the value of the  European market, the length of time the  cartel ran, how much each company was involved in cartel, their total size and how much they co-operated with the investigation.  BASF came in for particular criticism because this it has been caught in cartels before.

Akzo Nobel said it had fully co-operated with the  Commission's investigations and was still involved in other probes by US, Canadian and EU authorities into several alleged violations of anti-trust laws. BASF and UCB told Agence France Presse they were considering taking legal action against the Commission but would make a final decision when they had examined the December 9 ruling.

The 88hp JXU Stockman, MXU Fieldsman, available either as a 101hp or 116hp, and 144hp MXM Landsman are offered in a standard and plus version. Case IH product specialist Richard Hollins said: "We are committed to providing customers with a great choice of machinery, both in terms of quality and specification. Owners can specify the exact requirements for their farming business and we can build the tractor they need."
Carrot disease

TD
SCIENTISTS at the Scottish Agricultural College have been given funding to find new ways of controlling a disease in carrots. Sclerotinia is estimated to cost UK farmers about £4million annually in production losses. The three-year project, funded by the Horticultural Development Council, aims to identify periods of high sclerotinia risk and effective fungicides. It will also develop a predictive model based on crop growth stage and attempt to get an understanding of the environmental factors influencing fruiting body production and spore infection. SAC said the benefit for growers and consumers should be a reduction in the use of fungicides. The work is being carried out on growers' farms with facilities and sites provided by Kettle Produce, of Cupar.
Chemicals cartel

EUROPE has fined chemical companies Akzo Nobel, BASF and UCB a total of £45.8million for operating a cartel in the market for choline  chloride. Choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4, is used mainly as a feed additive for poultry and pigs, to increase growth, reduce mortality and improve meat quality. A  European Commission spokesman said: "The level of the fines confirms the Commission's determination to crack down hard on companies engaged in  cartel practices such as price fixing  and market sharing."

Fines totalling almost $85 M have been imposed by the European Commission on members of a cartel that fixed  choline chloride prices from 1992 to 1997. Akzo Nobel, BASF, and UCB have been fined over the feed additive. N American firms  Bioproducts, DuCoa, and Chinook  also participated, but their involvement ended more than five years before the investigation began, so they avoided fines. The six companies controlled 80% of the global market, worth about $225 M at the time the  cartel was operating.

Akzo Nobel, UCB and BASF have been fined a total EUR 66.3 M (individual sums in this item) by the European Commission for agreeing the price of vitamin  B4 (choline  chloride). The Commissioner commented that he is determined to stamp out this activity. UCB could appeal, claiming that the offence was a long time ago and that the group no longer owns the activities concerned. The other companies Bioproducts, DuCoa and Chinook,  all from N America, were found guilty and warned not to fix prices again, but as they left the cartel in Apr 1994 and a case against them should have been brought within 5 years, these companies were not fined.

* Dow to Exit Syndiotactic PS

Dow Chemical will idle its 36,000-m.t/year syndiotactic polystyrene (PS) plant at Schkopau, Germany by mid-2005 and exit the market, the company says. The polymer, marketed under the trade name Questra, was used in niche applications, "but didn't experience the broad market penetration that was anticipated," says Scott Moore, product manager of Dow's plastics business. Dow stopped promoting sales of Questra in mid-November, the company says. The polymers are used in automotive, electrical, and electronic markets. Dow says it plans to find a new production use of the Schkopau plant after it is idled.

National Tank Truck Carriers (NTTC; Alexandria, VA) says it has asked the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for an "indefinite postponement" of proposed fingerprint-based criminal background checks for drivers licenses with hazardous materials endorsements. The deadline is January 31, 2005 for new applications and March 31, 2005 for renewals and license transfers. NTTC says TSA's fingerprinting program has many shortcomings, including a failure to address fingerprinting of Canadian and Mexican drivers.
* Arvesta Acquires Clothianidin Rights

Arvesta (San Francisco), a subsidiary of Arysta (Tokyo), says it has received a license agreement granting it exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. and Mexico for the broad-spectrum insecticide Clothianidin for soil and foliar uses from Sumitomo Chemical Takeda Agro (Tokyo).
Cabot Plans Carbon Black Unit in Tianjin
Cabot says it has formed a new joint venture, Cabot Tianjin (Tianjin), with Shanghai Coking and Chemical
(Shanghai), to build a 50,000-m.t./year carbon black unit in Tianjin. The plant is expected online in early
2006. Cabot and Shanghai Coking are also seeking approval to expand this facility for an additional
50,000 m.t./year of capacity. The expansion would be completed in late 2006. Cabot owns 70% of Cabot
Tianjin, and Shanghai Coking owns the remaining 30%. Cabot and Shanghai Coking have an existing Jv
in Shanghai, which operates one of the largest carbon black plants in China.
Honeywell to Open Etchants Plant in February

Honeywell Electronic Materials (EM; Sunnyvale, CA), a division of Honeywell Specialty Materials, says it will open a new etchants plant at Chandler, AZ, in February. The plant will replace an older plant at Chandler, and was part of Honeywell EM's buyout of the three-year old GEM Microelectronics Materials joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical America (MCA; White Plains, NY) (CW, Nov. 24, p. 7). The Jv has two other plants in Texas that together produce waferthinning, performance cleaning, and etchant

materials. "By buying out the Jv, we are clearly investing in the electronics business," says Paul Raymond, v.p. and general manager, Honeywell EM. "And this is not just through acquisitions and new plants; we are looking to increase our R&D as well," Raymond says. Honeywell EM has boosted its R&D spending on
new products from 24% in 2003, to 34% this year. Honeywell has focused much of its attention on growing business in Asia, with startup of a new thermocouple plant in Tokyo last month, and the purchase in April
of a heat spreaders plant in Thailand from Intri-Plex Technologies (Santa Barbara, CA).
EPA Drops EGBE, TBAC from Lists of Regulated Pollutants

EPA says the solvent ethylene glycol mono-butyl ether (EGBE) has been removed from the list of air toxics, and that t-butyl acetate (TBAC) has been exempted from control as a volatile organic compound (VOC). "These reviews concluded that the chemicals pose less risk than previously thought and that reclassifying them would not compromise public health, and may even benefit public health if they are substituted for more toxic or environmentally damaging chemicals," EPA says. The agency last delisted an air toxic, caprolactam, in 1996. EGBE remains regulated as a VOC and will continue to be reported in the Toxics Release Inventory, EPA says. EPA received a petition in 1997 from ACC to delist EGBE. TBAC is used to make pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other products, and can also be used as a solvent in a variety of applications. "After extensive review, EPA has determined that TBAC meets the criteria used to define a compound as 'negligibly reactive'," EPA says.
Bear Stearns Fund Eyes Chemical Deals

Bear Stearns says that its $1.5-billion Merchant Banking Partners II private equity fund has formed a specialty chemicals investment team to pursue acquisitions in that sector. Kumar Shah, formerly senior v.p./corporate development at Noveon, will serve as fund advisor to evaluate chemical deals. The fund, launched in 2001, will pursue deals with transaction values in the $150 million-$ 1 billion range, says Theodore Young, a principal with the fund. It will seek out deals for underperforming specialty assets in North America and  Europe. "We are looking for companies or businesses that have either fallen on
cyclical hard times, or one that management has ignored, to turn around," Shah says. Other areas of focus for the fund include consumer products; industrial products; retail businesses; security and defense; and services.
Bankruptcy Court Approves MissChem's Reorganization Plan

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (Jackson) has approved Mississippi Chemical's (MissChem; Yazoo City, MS) amended plan of reorganization, the company says. The plan calls for MissChem to separate its nitrogen business from its phosphates business, and sell the nitrogen business to Terra Industries (CW, Sept. 8, p. 4). MissChem will spin off its phosphates business to bondholders, and expects to implement the reorganization plan by year end. Terra announced earlier this year that it would buy MissChem's nitrogen business for $268 million (CW, Aug. 18/25, p. 8).
Brussels Fines  Akzo, BASF, UCB for Fixing  Choline Chloride  Prices

The European Commission has imposed fines totaling euro66.34 million ($89 million) on  Akzo Nobel, BASF, and UCB for conspiring to fix the price of choline  chloride (vitamin B4). The companies participated in a global choline  chloride price-fixing cartel between 1992 and 1994, and operated a cartel in Western Europe between 1994 and 1998, the commission says. The companies reached an agreement in 1994 with fellow  choline chloride producers Bioproducts (Fairlawn, OH),  Chinook  Group (Toronto), and DuCoa (Highland, IL) under which the European producers agreed to withdraw from the North American market and vice versa, the commission adds. Trie commission launched its investigation last year after the U.S. Department of Justice fined Chinook  and DuCoa for operating a choline  chloride price-fixing cartel in North America (CW, April 30, 2003, p. 8).  BASF received the biggest fine, euro34.97 million, partly because "it had been condemned for similar infringements before," the commission says. The commission slapped record fines on  BASF and other companies in 2001 for operating pricefixing cartels for 12 products, including nine different types of vitamins. The commission fined Akzo euro20.99 million and UCB euro10.38 million for their participation in the choline  chloride cartel. "I have made it crystal clear that the fight against cartels will be one of my top priorities," says Neelie Kroes,  Europe's newly appointed competition commissioner. "This decision demonstrates that I intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk."
U.K. on Course to Miss CO2 Emission-Reduction Target
The U.K. government will fail to meet a self-imposed target to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 20% by
2010, compared with 1990 levels, unless more drastic action is taken, says U.K. environment secretary
Margaret Beckett. The U.K. is not on track to meet the target, and the government has identified
opportunities to reduce emissions further, she says. Those policies could form part of the second phase of
the European Union's (EU) emissions trading scheme, which starts in 2008, she says. The U.K.

Page 118 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
committed to cutting CO2 emissions 12.5% under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, but it later pledged unilaterally to cut emissions by 20%, drawing criticism from U.K. industry. U.K. prime minister Tony Blair last week launched a review of the government's climate change policies and said he plans to make global warming a priority for the U.K.'s presidency of the G8 group of industrialized nations and EU
next year. Blair drew criticism from environmentalists, however, when the government recently slashed the amount by which U.K. industry will have to cut CO2 emissions under the first phase of the EU emissions scheme, which starts on January 1 (CW, Nov. 3, f. 5).
Air Liquide Announces Gases Projects in China

Air Liquide says it will invest $25 million to build a 300-m.t./day air separation plant at Qingdao, China that will supply an aromatics unit being built there. The air separation plant is due to start up in the third quarter of 2006, Air Liquide says. It will supply Li Dong Chemical, a 90-10 joint venture between LG Aromatics (Seoul) and Red Star Chemical Plant (Qingdao), that is building a benzene, toluene, and xylenes complex with a total capacity of 1 million m.t./year. The complex will cost $400 million and be based on imported naphtha, sources say. Air Liquide says it has signed a 15-year contract to supply mainly nitrogen from the air separation plant to Li Dong. Separately, Air Liquide and Air Products say they will form a 50-50 jv to build a $30-million air separation plant at Beijing for completion in the second half of 2005. The jv will have capacity for 12,000 cu meters/hour of ultra-pure nitrogen, which it will supply to a thin film transistor/liquid crystal display factory planned by Beijing BOE Optoelectronics. The jv will also have capacity for 430 m.t./day of argon, nitrogen, and oxygen which it will supply to other customers in the Beijing area. Air Liquide, meanwhile, has announced a capacity expansion in Germany (f. 18).

Europe's Fine Chemical Producers Form Industry Group

Europe's fine chemical producers have agreed to form an industry association, the  European Fine Chemicals Group (EFCG; Brussels), which will be a subgroup of Cefic. EFCG will be similar to Socma in the U.S., sources say. It aims to have 60-70 members by the end of next year and eventually to have 100 members, sources add. The formation of EFCG was announced at the CPhI fine chemicals exhibition, held last week in Brussels (p. 27).
* Degussa's Nagler Moves to Brazil

Peter Nagler, president of Degussa's synthesis and catalysts unit, has been appointed president of Degussa South America, effective January 1. He will be based in Brazil. Patrik Wohlhauser, head of Degussa's Construction Systems  Europe business unit, will succeed Nagler. Weber Porto, Degussa
South America's current president, is moving to Germany to head up the company's peroxygen chemicals business unit, effective February 1, 2005.
* Victrex, Degussa Plan PEEK Capacity

Victrex (Thornton Cleveleys, U.K.), the leading producer of polyether ether ketone (PEEK), says it has decided to expand PEEK capacity in the U.K. rather than invest in Asia. The company will add 1,000 m.t./year at Thornton Cleveleys that will raise its total there to 3,800 m.t./year. Separately, Degussa has confirmed CWs exclusive report that it is in discussions to sell an oxidation plant at Seal Sands, U.K. that produces 4,4-difiuorobenzophenone, the main raw material for PEEK. Degussa also confirmed plans to enter the PEEK and polyether sulphone (PES) markets through a Jv in China (CW, Nov. 17, p. 15). Degussa has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Jida New Materials (Changchun, China). The Jv plans to expand Jida's units at Jilin, China that have capacity to produce 500 m.t./year of PEEK and 300 m.t./year of PES.
* Three Firms Form Methanol Alliance

Aker Kvaerner, Davy Process Technology, and Johnson Matthey Catalysts (JMC) say they have formed an alliance that offers "a fully integrated service for designing and building methanol plants, and plants producing synthesis gas for methanol and gas-to-liquids applications." The alliance, dubbed One Synergy, "brings together the technology know-how and expertise of each company," they add. Aker Kvaerner is a leading contractor on methanol projects; Davy is a top supplier of methanol process technology; and JMC is a leading supplier of catalysts and technology for methanol plants.

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling EUR 66.34 M ($89 M) on  Akzo Nobel, BASF, and UCB for price fixing  in choline  chloride (vitamin  B4). The companies were involved in a global cartel between 1992 and 1994, and in a cartel in W Europe between 1994 and 1998. The companies made an agreement in 1994 with choline  chloride producers Bioproducts, Chinook  Group, and DuCoa under which the European producers pulled out of the N American market and vice versa. BASF received the biggest fine, EUR 34.97 M, in part because it had earlier been convicted for similar offences. Akzo

BASF, Akzo Nobel and UCB have been fined a total of EUR 66.4 M by the  European Commission for operating a price cartel in the 1990s for choline  chloride (vitamin B4) which is used in animal feed. The fine for BASF was EUR 35 M with EUR 21 M for Akzo Nobel and EUR 10.4 M for UCB. Because Bioproducts, US, DuCoa, US, and Chinook,  Canada, withdrew from the European market in Apr 1994 they were outside the time limits for the European Commission to charge them with anti-competitive activities. However, the three have already been fined by authorities in their own countries. 80% of the global market for  choline chloride was controlled by the  cartel, which ended in 1997. At that time, the global market was worth EUR 180 M/y of which EUR 50 M/y was in the  European Union.

HD     Can You Say Tort? A Washington attorney  wants to export America's legal system around the world.

A Washington attorney is on a crusade to export America's legal system around the world. Call your lawyer.

Michael Hausfeld has built a career pushing the boundaries of American law. In the 1990s his firm wrung a $176 million settlement out of Texaco, then the most ever in a race discrimination case. A leader in Holocaust litigation, he obtained $8 billion from Swiss banks and German industry and government. His firm is now lead counsel in the largest class action in history, representing 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart employees.

TD
Now the 58-year-old lawyer is building an international network of plaintiff lawyers in such diverse places as Great Britain, India, Panama and South Africa. The goal: to export U.S.-style litigation tactics, including contingency fees and class actions, throughout the world. In coming months, he says, he and allied lawyers in various countries plan to file antitrust, product liability, securities and human rights cases.

Hausfeld's plan should terrify corporations already reeling from the U.S. plaintiffs' bar. But he says his plan is for the defendants' own good. By hooking up with foreign law firms he can offer corporate defendants a settlement that will stick in other countries. Now a corporation that settles in the U.S. might still get socked with billions of dollars' worth of claims abroad.

Cold comfort maybe, but he's already naming targets. Parmalat and Marsh & McLennan look ripe for securities actions in the U.K. His British partner firm, Irwin Mitchell, is looking for potential Vioxx claimants against Merck. In India Hausfeld and a partner are investigating filing a claim related to the cleanup of the site of the 1984 Bhopal disaster. And in South Africa Hausfeld and U.K. human rights lawyer Martyn Day are exploring an environmental suit against Anglo American.

Hausfeld and partners at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll have been laying the groundwork for this sort of cross-border work for years. The firm was among the first to use the once-obscure Alien Tort Claims Act in U.S. courts to pursue human rights violations abroad. Over the last few years it also represented in the
U.S. a group of foreign  vitamin  purchasers who sued foreign companies for antitrust violations that had already sent 11 defendants to jail. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Hausfeld's clients in June, sending the case back to an appeals court. The firm also attempted, with mixed results, to obtain powerful lead plaintiff status in securities actions for foreign investors who lost money in Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Royal Ahold and Parmalat.

Hausfeld is tapping into a trend suggesting U.S.-style litigation is already spreading, particularly in the European Union. Recently departed EU competition commissioner Mario Monti has repeatedly stressed the need for private legal action in antitrust cases. And last year the  European Commission hired the London law firm Ashurst to examine ways to encourage more suits. Next year the EU is expected to begin a potentially heated debate on adopting U.S.-style tactics, including allowing contingency fees and monetary damages in class-type suits.

But Hausfeld is fighting immense procedural differences among countries. In the U.K., for instance, each member of a class must be identified, a policy that prevents lawyers from dreaming up cases where there are few identifiable victims. In the U.K., New Zealand and Australia, where legal fees are carefully regulated, lawyers must take on part of the cost risk, and potential plaintiffs often take out insurance policies to cover costs if their cases flop. Securities class actions do not even exist in most of  Europe.
Page 123 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Instead, thousands of claims are "federated" and move forward as a cumbersome mass of individual cases. In Belgium shareholder lawsuits must wait until the outcome of criminal investigations.

Even some of Hausfeld's simpaticos wonder whether U.S.-style litigation will ever take root overseas. At least in the U.K., America's "compensation culture" is frowned upon. Elsewhere people have not historically thought of private litigation as a remedy. "They've always allowed the governments to protect them, and they're used to that," says Paul T. Gallagher, a Cohen, Milstein partner. "In a lot of countries, even when people are given the ability to go into court and prove civil damages, it is difficult to find people who will step up and ask for it."

Meanwhile Hausfeld is planning to exploit the differences in legal systems. Great Britain, Ireland and Cyprus, for instance, all allow limited discovery before potential plaintiffs even file a claim. The U.S. provides greater latitude for digging up evidence once litigation is under way. So under one scenario Hausfeld could pry open corporate secrets in the U.K. with prefiling discovery and follow up with massive document-dredging in the U.S. His network of firms would share information--and fees--and offer defendants court-approved global resolution of claims.

In the next 90 days Hausfeld plans to file a private antitrust case in Great Britain with law firm Irwin Mitchell. Only 60 private antitrust cases in  European history have led to awards. This one will be brought on behalf of an unnamed British company that claims to be a victim of the same global  vitamin cartel that Hausfeld sued in the U.S. (Defendants then included  BASF, Aventis and Roche.) Hausfeld's Washington, D.C. firm already has witnesses and thousands of pages of evidence that will be shared with his partner firm.

If successful, they have a half-dozen other cases lined up, including those related to alleged price-rigging of methionine, an amino acid used in animal feed, and of electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products. Says Hausfeld: "We feel we're at the frontier."

in the past. The US Department of Justice had taken similar action against 6 companies. The  European   Commission did not pursue charges against Chinook,  Ducal and Bioproducts, because they withdrew from the European market in Apr 1994. The choline  ring controlled 80% of the world market. It the last year it operated, the global market was worth EUR 180 M, with EUR 80 M of this in  Europe.

THE European Commission has imposed fines of over £40 million on a number of companies it accused of operating a cartel in the animal feed market.

At issue is the supply of the B4 vitamin  for pig and poultry rations. These are manufactured by three companies, Akzo Nobel, BASF and UCB and sold to feed businesses throughout  Europe.

TD
The vitamin  boosts growth rates, reduces disease levels and improves meat quality, making it an essential ingredient. The Commission says the level of the fines underlines its determination to crack down hard on companies engaged in price fixing  and market sharing.

Hausfeld and partners at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll have been laying the groundwork for this sort of cross-border work for years. The firm was among the first to use the once-obscure Alien Tort Claims Act in U.S. courts to pursue human rights violations abroad. Over the last few years it also represented in the U.S. a group of foreign  vitamin  purchasers who sued foreign companies for antitrust violations that had already sent 11 defendants to jail. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Hausfeld's clients in June, sending it back to an appeals court. The firm also attempted, with mixed results, to obtain powerful lead plaintiff status in securities actions for foreign investors who lost money in Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
Royal Ahold and Parmalat.

Hausfeld is tapping into a trend suggesting U.S.-style litigation is already spreading, particularly in the European Union. Recently departed EU competition commissioner Mario Monti has repeatedly stressed the need for private legal action in antitrust cases. And last year the  European Commission hired the London law firm Ashurst to examine ways to encourage more suits. Next year the EU is expected to begin a potentially heated debate on adopting U.S.-style tactics, including allowing contingency fees and monetary damages in class-type suits.

But Hausfeld is fighting immense procedural differences among countries. In the U.K., for instance, each member of a class must be identified, a policy that prevents lawyers from dreaming up cases where there are few identifiable victims. In the U.K., New Zealand and Australia, where legal fees are carefully regulated, lawyers must take on part of the cost risk, and potential plaintiffs often take out insurance policies to cover costs if their cases flop. Securities class actions do not even exist in most of  Europe. Instead, thousands of claims are "federated" and move forward as a cumbersome mass of individual cases. In Belgium shareholder lawsuits must wait until the outcome of criminal investigations.

Even some of Hausfeld's simpaticos wonder whether U.S.-style litigation will ever take root overseas. At least in the U.K., America's "compensation culture" is frowned upon. Elsewhere people have not historically thought of private litigation as a remedy. "They've always allowed the governments to protect them, and they're used to that," says Paul T. Gallagher, a Cohen, Milstein partner. "In a lot of countries, even when people are given the ability to go into court and prove civil damages, it is difficult to find people who will step up and ask for it."

Meanwhile Hausfeld is planning to exploit the differences in legal systems. Great Britain, Ireland and Cyprus, for instance, all allow limited discovery before potential plaintiffs even file a claim. The U.S. provides greater latitude for digging up evidence once litigation is under way. So under one scenario Hausfeld could pry open corporate secrets in the U.K. with prefiling discovery and follow up with massive document-dredging in the U.S. His network of firms would share information--and fees--and offer defendants court-approved global resolution of claims.

In the next 90 days Hausfeld plans to file a private antitrust case in Great Britain with law firm Irwin Mitchell. Only 60 private antitrust cases in  European history have led to awards. This one will be brought on behalf of an unnamed British company that claims to be a victim of the same global  vitamin cartel
that Hausfeld sued in the U.S. (Defendants then included  BASF, Aventis and Roche.) Hausfeld's Washington, D.C. firm already has witnesses and thousands of pages of evidence that will be shared with his partner firm.

If successful, they have a half-dozen other cases lined up, including those related to alleged price-rigging of methionine, an amino acid used in animal feed, and of electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products. Says Hausfeld: "We feel we're at the frontier."

The European Commission has fined Akzo Nobel, BASF and UCB EUR 66 M ($88 M) for  price fixing  in the animal feed market, for the chemical choline  chloride (vitamin  B4). Separately the companies were fined Akzo Nobel EUR 21 M, BASF EUR 35 M and UCB EUR 10 M. The US and Canadian companies, Bioproducts, Du-Coa and Chinook,  which colluded with the  price fixing  have been exempt from the fines because they exited the cartel in Apr 1994. Together these six companies controlled 80% of the global  choline chloride market, which was valued at EUR 180 M in 1997.

TD
Businesses today must confront an unprecedented international legal challenge. The criminal enforcement of antitrust and competition laws has become a global priority. The complexity, cost, management disruption, and potential jeopardy can exceed nearly any other type of legal proceeding.

The United States has led this effort. U.S. antitrust officials utilize a very successful program to induce voluntary disclosure of potential misconduct and cooperation in return for a promise of complete amnesty from prosecution. This program has led to the detection of numerous international cartels that involved billions of dollars in commerce. Before implementing this program, the U.S. had never previously uncovered and successfully prosecuted an international antitrust conspiracy.

These cases have generated corporate fines and criminal penalties that previously were unimaginable. Within the last decade, more than 40 companies have paid fines in excess of $10 million; six have paid more than $100 million; and one paid $500 million — the highest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States.

Incarceration for executives has now become common, and the average term of imprisonment is steadily increasing. Recent legislative amendments will push these penalties even higher. Of course, the criminal proceeding triggers the inevitable series of private plaintiff damage actions.

Foreign governments have cooperated with the United States in conducting some of these investigations, and several have signed formal cooperation and assistance agreements. Many of these governments have implemented similar amnesty programs and adopted criminal penalties. This has internationalized criminal antitrust enforcement. Now, resolution of an investigation will require independent negotiations with numerous governments and the imposition of criminal penalties in multiple jurisdictions.

The implication for business is clear. Even when no illegal activity has occurred, an international criminal investigation will impose enormous costs and require the effective coordination of defense efforts in several countries. Companies must expend every resource to avoid such an inquiry. If an investigation is commenced, knowledgeable and experienced legal counsel must be engaged immediately, and an aggressive response must be formulated and pursued.
The U.S. Amnesty Program

The U.S. Corporate Amnesty Program has been described as the most effective investigative tool antitrust officials possess for detecting and prosecuting international cartels. This, however, was not always the case.

The original amnesty program, announced in 1978, provided that an applicant was eligible for complete amnesty, but the government would retain significant discretion to determine what level of leniency would be accorded. Very few prosecutorial targets applied for the program, and not a single international  cartel was disclosed.

Page 130 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Antitrust Division changed the amnesty program significantly in 1993, relinquishing much of the discretion it formerly exercised over conferring protection from prosecution. Complete amnesty would be conferred automatically to the first applicant if there was no pre-existing investigation.

Amnesty also became available to the first applicant after the government commenced an investigation, so long as sufficient evidence had not yet been obtained to support a successful prosecution. Amnesty was extended to all of the company's officers, directors and employees who cooperated with the investigation. Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Corporate Leniency Policy (1993), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/lencorp.htm .

The government's revised program promised complete and unconditional amnesty from criminal prosecution to the first company which disclosed evidence of an illegal conspiracy, and to all of that company's representatives who joined in that disclosure. This revolutionized criminal antitrust enforcement. It provided a substantial incentive to disclose information, and created pressure to make a timely decision because the benefit was conferred only on the initial applicant. According to the Antitrust Division, it receives an average of two amnesty applications each month.

With experience, the government extended the program. It became apparent that many companies engaged in anticompetitive conduct in markets other than that which officials were investigating. The "Amnesty Plus" program promised that a company under investigation could obtain a substantial penalty reduction if it was the first to disclose evidence of misconduct in another market.

A company confronted with this problem could receive complete immunity in the second market while reducing the penalty for the conduct already detected in the first. The Antitrust Division has stated that approximately one-half of all international  cartel investigations have been initiated as a result of the Amnesty Plus aspect of the program.

The United States Amnesty Program changed the dynamics for international cartels. It created an incentive for disclosure that had not previously existed, but at the price of complete exoneration for one of the co-conspirators.
The Development of International Cooperation

The investigation of international cartels highlights the importance of international cooperation. Antitrust enforcers soon learned to work together informally.

DOJ's Antitrust Division also has successfully negotiated a series of formal agreements that promote international cooperation. Antitrust Cooperation Agreements have been established with Australia, Brazil, Canada, the  European Union, Germany, Israel, Japan and Mexico. They reflect the working relationship between the antitrust enforcement authorities and establish protocols for continuing cooperation. There is a specific Antitrust Mutual Assistance Agreement with Australia which provides U.S. officials with significant access to evidence in that country.

Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) exist between the U.S. and more than 50 countries. While MLATs do not focus specifically on antitrust enforcement, many contain provisions to foster cooperation in these types of investigations. The most significant assistance is available when the MLAT partner has also enacted criminal penalties for competition offenses.

Cooperation of antitrust authorities has produced tangible results. In  Europe, "dawn raids" are executed by the Director General for Competition. In an investigation of alleged bid rigging on U.S. Agency for International Development contracts, more than 100 German police officers conducted a coordinated seizure of documents and interviews of corporate employees at several locations.

In an investigation of the plastic additives industry, the EC Director General, the Canadian Competition Bureau and the Japanese Fair Trade  Commission coordinated searches and interviews with the U.S. Authorities for at least five countries have executed search warrants on behalf of the U.S. in numerous investigations.

Moreover, cooperation has been extended to include arrests of those charged with antitrust crimes. The U.S. has issued an Interpol "red notice" for several indicted individuals. This is a request for arrest with the possibility of extradition. To display the seriousness of the offense — or officials' absence of measured judgment — this is the same level of notice that applies to Osama bin Laden.

The significant increase in international cooperation reflects world-wide antitrust officials' emphasis on the investigation of cartels. There are approximately 50 grand jury investigations in the U.S. focused on potential international antitrust offenses. In the last five years, about one-half of all corporate defendants in U.S. antitrust prosecutions have been foreign-based. Clearly, there is a strong focus on international misconduct.

Penalties Continue to Increase

Criminal penalties in the U.S. have reflected the expansion of the enforcement program. Since 1997, the U.S. has collected more than $2 billion in criminal fines. Prison terms for executives also have increased substantially.

In 2003, the average jail term was 21 months — and one individual was sentenced to ten years. For fiscal year 2002, at least 30 individuals were sentenced to incarceration for more than one year. Status Report: An Overview of Recent Developments in the Antitrust Division's Criminal Enforcement Program (2004), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guideline/202531.htm .
The Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004, 108 P.L. 237; 118 Stat. 661 (H.R.
1086), intensifies these penalties. The law increased the maximum term of incarceration for an individual
from three years to ten years, and the monetary fine from $350,000 to $1 million. The sponsors of the
legislation contended that these changes were necessary to rectify perceived disparities with the recent
substantial increases for other white collar crimes.

Also, the maximum fine for a corporation was raised from $10 million to $100 million. Even this amount, however, does not define the upper limit. Another sentencing provision provides for a fine calculated at twice the pecuniary gain derived from, or loss caused by, the illegal conduct. It was this provision that provided grounds for a fine of $500 million for a company when the statutory maximum was only $10 million.

Congress also directed the U.S. Sentencing  Commission to revise the Sentencing Guidelines to reflect these statutory changes. Undoubtedly, the result will be another significant escalation in future penalties.
Changes in Civil Damages Will Affect the Amnesty Program

The recent antitrust penalty legislation also includes a significant change in civil damages. A company that is accepted into the Antitrust Division's Amnesty Program and provides the same level of cooperation to private plaintiffs will be liable only for the amount of damages its illegal conduct actually caused.

The other companies involved in the violation, however, will continue to be jointly and severally responsible for three times the amount of the damages caused — the recovery that usually is available in civil antitrust damage cases. This reduction in civil liability should provide an additional incentive under the amnesty program.

Despite the significant penalty reduction for amnesty applicants, civil damage concerns still affect the decision to disclose information to the government. Specifically, a question remains whether damages from entirely foreign transactions can be pursued in U.S. courts. If so, then the amount of potential civil damages could exceed a company's ability to remain financially viable.
The U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed this issue in F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A.,
124 S. Ct. 2359 (2004). The Court held that if a  price fixing  conspiracy causes a domestic antitrust injury
and a separate foreign injury, then the foreign purchasers cannot pursue a claim in U.S. courts.

However, the decision did not address the situation which arises if the domestic and foreign effects of the conspiracy are linked. Until this issue is fully resolved, some concern exists that foreign purchasers will have access to U.S. courts — and representation by the U.S. class action bar.
Foreign Governments Have Become Aggressive

Governments around the world have joined the U.S. in its effort to detect and prosecute international cartels. Several have adopted amnesty programs, and most of these programs incorporate the principal features developed by the U.S. The program in the  European Union now virtually eliminates the discretion of the enforcement authority to impose a penalty on the applicant, and it authorizes full immunity for the
first applicant, even after the investigation has begun.1

The encouragement of disclosure through amnesty implies some form of prosecution for the others involved in the conspiracy. Although the U.S. still leads the world by a wide margin in criminalizing antitrust violations, other countries are pursuing criminal sanctions. Canada, for example, has had a very active criminal enforcement program for more than a decade. In the Enterprise Act of 2002, the United Kingdom imposed criminal penalties for "hard core" competition offenses, with a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

The European Union does not possess the authority to impose criminal penalties, although several of the member states do. The EU, however, has levied substantial monetary fines for  cartel conduct. In the

international vitamin  price fixing  conspiracy, for example, Hoffmann-La Roche paid 462 million [euro]
and BASF paid 296 million [euro].

The proliferation of countries focused on  cartel conduct increases the complexity of these matters at an exponential rate. A potential amnesty applicant, for example, must consider individual applications in each of the relevant countries and must determine the best order in which to approach them. Unfortunately, the application is not standardized and the requirements for acceptance are not uniform.

Also, there are significant procedural differences that must be understood and followed. In much of Europe, for example, the attorney-client privilege applies only to certain categories of lawyers, and often not to in-house counsel. AM&S v.  Commission, Case 155/79, 1982 E.C.R. 1575, 1611.

The complexity and challenge of international  cartel investigations will continue to intensify. Certainly, additional countries will become active, and each will require a separate, and in some instances unique, approach.
Effective Defense Response Is Crucial

The internationalization of criminal antitrust enforcement has transformed the defense approach. The era of defense inactivity while awaiting government action is over. Companies must move aggressively at the first internal hint of a potential antitrust problem — and certainly if there is any indication of government interest. The facts must be gathered, legal vulnerability assessed, and crucial decisions made.

If a company is eligible for amnesty, the appropriate considerations must be reviewed and government authorities must be contacted. Since amnesty is awarded only to the first applicant, a proactive approach is necessary. Simply because the company may be foreclosed from total immunity in the U.S., for example, does not mean that significant advantages cannot be obtained in another country.

Even if amnesty is not available, substantial benefits can be obtained by rapid cooperation with the enforcement authorities if the case does not support a reasonable defense. When the investigation must be defended, the foundation must be laid to represent the defendants through litigation.

The cost, complexity and potential jeopardy of a criminal antitrust enforcement proceeding dictates that avoidance of questionable conduct is paramount. Companies must dedicate substantial resources to antitrust compliance programs, and to periodic and thorough antitrust audits, which should be performed by lawyers knowledgeable in both antitrust law and current enforcement policy. The cost of these programs is insignificant in relation to the cost encountered in even a minor investigation that does not result in a criminal prosecution.

If a problem is detected, knowledgeable and experienced counsel must be engaged immediately. Experience in addressing and defending international  cartel matters can be invaluable. In an era when companies are forced to confront a global threat, they must be prepared to meet the challenge.
Notes

1 At least the following governments have adopted some form of amnesty or leniency program to encourage self-disclosure: Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, the  European Union, France, Germany, Ireland, Korea, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other countries, including Japan, are considering such adoption.

COUNTRY BRIEFING
FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

TD
As the new head of the  European Commission's directorate-general for competition (DG Competition), Neelie Kroes occupies one of the most powerful offices within the  Commission—and also one of the most sensitive ones. She inherits a large in-tray of work from her predecessor, Mario Monti, not least managing last year's significant devolution of competition enforcement to the member states' national
competition authorities (NCAs). The same "modernisation" impulse has been proposed for state aids, and has been applied to merger regulation and to  cartel cases. And it is in this latter field that Ms Kroes will have to show early and decisive intent.

This article, which was drawn from  European Policy Analyst*, first considers how far DG Competition has developed over the last two decades, before making the case that Mr Kroes's first priority should be cartels. By establishing herself as a tough  cartel buster, Ms Kroes will dispel concerns expressed during her European Parliament hearings as to her suitability to be competition commissioner because of her business connections. It will also allow her to build political capital, which she will need when trying to reform the state aid rules or when dealing with sensitive state aid and merger cases.
DG Competition: an almost unalloyed  European success story

When DG Competition was first established in January 1958, even the most damaging anti-competitive business practices, such as  price-fixing cartels, were common practice across  Europe, often explicitly supported by governments. The state, and state-owned industries, interfered in the operation of the economy with little concern for the impact on its competitive processes. Over the following decades DG Competition successfully suppressed cartels and began the process of establishing a legal framework for a competition regime that would encourage competition across the single market.

In the last two decades, under a series of powerful commissioners and a changing intellectual climate, in which faith in market outcomes strengthened, the EU's competition regime has been greatly reinforced. Under Peter Sutherland in the 1980s, DG Competition began to apply competition rules against far more state-owned entities that were denying market access to private competitors. He went on to use these rules to encourage market liberalisation and open up state-dominated sectors to the private sector. His successor, Leon Brittan, oversaw the successful implementation of the EU merger regulation and
one-stop merger-filing for major  European deals. He also took a significant step forward in EU-US antitrust co-operation, with the adoption of the 1991 Competition Co-operation Agreement with the US Department of Justice.

While continuing to apply competition rules against member states and bedding down the operation of the EU's merger assessment practices, Mr Brittan's successor, Karel Van Miert, began the process of modernising the regime in response to a number of criticisms. He also recognised that by the mid-1990s almost every member state had its own competition agency (by contrast, in 1958, when DG Competition was set up, only Germany had a competition agency), and those agencies were now capable of taking a far greater part in the enforcing EU competition law.

At the same time, members of the legal profession criticised the  European Commission for its formulaic approach to the application of its vertical restraints doctrine. Questions also abounded as to whether the procedure, whereby the  Commission examined individual commercial agreements, was worthwhile (between 1963 and 1999 only nine agreements had ever been prohibited via this procedure, yet the Commission had had to examine thousands of such deals); whether there should be a greater focus on more egregious practices, such as  price-fixing cartels; whether the state aid rules needed streamlining; and whether the merger regulation, after almost a decade of operation, needed an overhaul.

Mr Van Miert focused initially on reform of the vertical restraints regime and on refocusing  Commission activities on cartels. These initial steps in the modernisation programme led to the wholesale reform of vertical restraints, including a broader and more flexible block exemption from regulation and guidelines. Mr Van Miert also established a dedicated  cartel uni, and introduced a fines notice, which presaged a higher fining policy for cartels that had been implemented by his successor. His last major act was to publish a white paper which proposed the abolition of the notification procedure and the devolution to NCAs of responsibility for applying competition rules, thereby freeing more resources for  cartel-busting and dealing with other more serious anti-competitive activities.

Mario Monti completed the process of structural modernisation by pushing through the enactment of a new basic competition regulation (Regulation 1/2003), which came into force on May 1st 2004. This abolished the notification procedure for commercial agreements; upgraded the  Commission's enforcement powers; and devolved the power to apply EU competition rules to NCAs. He also adopted a cartel-busting new leniency notice in February 2002, which was directly based on the successful US leniency programme (see below).

In the process of modernising the EU merger rules, Mr Monti was faced with a major crisis, when the EU Court of First Instance (CFI) struck down a series of  Commission merger decisions in Airtours, Schneider/Legrand and TetraLaval/Sidel. This led to a redoubling of efforts to reform the merger rules—streamlining existing procedures, introducing a broader merger test and adopting a series of side measures to minimise the prospect of further court reverses—but also to the establishment of the office of chief economist and the introduction of a "devil's advocate" panel to double-check draft merger decisions. Pressing on with modernisation, Mr Monti established a  European Competition Network between the Commission and the NCAs to allocate work and discuss key competition issues. He also began the process of modernising both the state aid rules and Article 82, which deals with the abuse of a dominant position.
Cartels first: the top priority for Ms Kroes

On both sides of the Atlantic it has been understood that  price-fixing, market-sharing and bid-rigging cartels constitute the most pernicious anti-competitive practices. Cartels stifle innovation, foreclose markets and impose huge direct costs on the rest of the business community, consumers and the public sector. However, it had been thought until recently that cartelistic behaviour was rare. This was supported by the argument that as globalisation took hold and local markets opened up, the conditions to support cartels would disappear.
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has comprehensively demonstrated that the latter theory is wrong.
In August 1993 it introduced a Corporate Leniency Programme The unique feature of the programme was
that the DOJ abandoned its prosecutorial discretion. The first member of a  cartel through the front doors
of the DOJ was guaranteed legal immunity from fines (and prison sentences for its executives) if it
brought in whatever evidence it had of the  cartel. It did not matter how little evidence was given, as
further evidence could be obtained by executing search warrants; the leniency application would be
assessed immediately and, if in order, immunity granted.

This US approach to leniency has been remarkably effective. A low evidence requirement means that even peripheral players in the  cartel can blow the whistle, hence widening the pool of potential whistleblowers; and it is available for a long time, even years (in the largest case ever busted by the DOJ, Vitamins,  the Antitrust Division had been investigating the case for two years before Aventis came forward with the key evidence that convicted the other members of the  cartel). All of these factors increase the risks associated with  cartel participation.

The results have been spectacular. From only one leniency application a year before the adoption of the programme in 1993, the current level of leniency applications is running at around one a fortnight. Over US$1.5bn in fines have been generated by the leniency programme, including fines of US$500m on Hoffman La Roche and US$225 million on  BASF in respect of the  Vitamins  case. There have been 39 cases so far where the Antitrust Division has secured fines of over US$10m, and the majority of these cases involved evidence obtained under the leniency programme. Less than a decade ago the largest fine ever imposed under the Sherman Act was US$5m.


Page 135 of 137 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The success of the Antitrust Division did not go unnoticed in Brussels. The  Commission adopted its own leniency notice in 1996. It also encouraged the modernisation programme to refocus enforcement activities on cartels. However, the 1996 notice did not have the success of the US's Corporate Leniency Programme. In essence, the 1996 notice departed from the lessons of the US programme, since it
imposed a high evidence standard and it did not guarantee immunity to whistleblowers at the beginning of the procedure or to those who applied after the  Commission opened an investigation.

However, in February 2002 DG Competition adopted a new leniency notice based on the US model. It adopted a low evidence standard and immunity was offered at the beginning of the procedure and applied to cases where the  Commission had opened an investigation. This resulted in major change. Between February 2002 and November 2004 the  Commission received over 90 leniency applications (more than double the number recorded in the US over the same period). So far 38 conditional immunity applications have been offered. The  Commission is therefore dealing with more cartels now that it did between
1958-2002 combined.

If Mr Monti's successor can streamline the procedures of DG Competition and deploy additional resources to processing the  cartel cases, she will be able to generate considerable political support for the rest of her term of office and for dealing with the more problematic parts of the modernisation agenda—state aid and merger cases. Imposing fines on cartels in her first 18 months will also provide an answer to the critics of Ms Kroes in the  European Parliament, who fear she would be too soft on industry owing to her extensive business interests up to the time she became Commissioner.

However, the processing of the  cartel cases is likely to prove difficult. DG Competition is significantly under-resourced and has other major regulatory duties, notably dealing with a flood of state aid notifications from the EU's ten new member states. Currently only one of the  cartel cases discovered under the 2002 notice has made it as far as the statement of objections stage of the competition procedure. DG Competition needs to approach the member states for more resources, arguing that it is a victim of its own success. If Ms Kroes can tackle the backlog effectively, she will send a message to European industry that cartels will not be tolerated. This will significantly increase her own credibility and provide her with the political capital to deal with many of the other matters that are at the top of the DG Competition agenda.
Dealing with the in-tray
There are three other major pending issues for Ms Kroes to deal with.

* Carrying on modernisation. The modernisation programme initiated in the early 1990s is far from complete. The new basic competition rules—Regulation 1 and accompanying notices—have to be fleshed out and the competition bar made aware of how  European and national regulators will operate devolved competition procedures. In particular, a number of difficult issues in respect of allocation of cases, procedural rights and leniency remain unclear. There are also a number of follow-on issues from Regulation 1, such as the extent to which the Union wishes to permit damages actions in competition cases. The Commission is already consulting on this issue and is likely to adopt a green paper in the
autumn of 2005 setting out a number of options. For Ms Kroes this file is likely to prove highly contentious with industry, which fears US-style damages claims. There is also a concern that consumer and small business groups seeking procedural reforms will open up the courts to plaintiff competition claims.
Equally difficult is the modernisation of the abuse of dominance provision, Article 82. It has been recognised for some time that the formalistic application of Article 82 does not sit well with the more economic approach to the application of Article 81 or the merger rules.

* State aids. The Commission faces a major burden of dealing with state aid work from the new member states, which, like cartel cases, is likely to inflict a major additional workload on DG Competition. The
core of the state aid problem relates to the command economy of the past, whose legacy has been high levels of state ownership of inefficient industries. As a consequence, aid provision has been greater. This "aid tradition" has been compounded by some states engaging in bidding wars with one another for foreign direct investment (FDI), with aid as one of the chief weapons. As a consequence of the aid tradition, the aid bidding wars, and lax pre-accession state aid surveillance by NCAs, the  Commission, which obtained exclusive jurisdiction over state aids on May 1st, is faced with a very significant increase in its workload in this field of over 40%.

* Merger decisions. Following a number of reversals in the courts regarding its merger-blocking decision—including Airtours, Schneider/Legrand and TetraLaval/Sidel—DG Competition has instituted significant new measures to minimise the risk of future errors, including the establishment of a chief economist role and devil's advocate panel. However, a number of academic commentators and the antitrust bar are not entirely convinced. There have been a number of merger decisions, notably GE/Instrumentarium and Sony/BMG, where the arguments of the  Commission were flawed. In the GE case, for instance, the  Commission was prepared to block the deal even after the offending subsidiary,

where an overlap had existed between target and acquirer, had been sold. Equally, in Sony/BMG there were questions as to the wisdom of the  Commission putting forward a price correlation argument that actually undermined its own case for the deal to be blocked. Ms Kroes and her cabinet need to keep a tight grip on arguments put forward by DG Competition units to impose remedies or block decisions.
