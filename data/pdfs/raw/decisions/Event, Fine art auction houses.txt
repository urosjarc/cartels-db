LONDON, Oct 25 (AFP) -  Christie's  and Sotheby's, the two biggest names in fine-art auctions, each face being fined at least 10 million euros (dollars) by the European Commission for fixing their fees during the 1990s, the Financial Times (FT) reported Friday.

A final decision on the  fines will be taken Wednesday by the  European Union's 20 commissioners -- some of whom are calling for a far higher penalty, according to the business daily's front page story.

TD
The FT said Sotheby's and the  Commission declined to comment when contacted Thursday by the paper while Christie's  was unavailable to give its response.

The EU's executive branch claimed in April that the two firms might have violated EU  antitrust legislation by colluding to fix  commission fees and other terms of sale between 1993 and 2000.

Last December in the United States, a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with Christie's.
Prosecutors said that arrangement had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars.

Christie's  was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against
Sotheby's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is set to issue verdicts Wednesday in two cartel investigations, proving he can still pack a punch despite devastating rulings against him last week.

E.U. officials told Dow Jones Newswires that Japanese video-game maker Nintendo Co. Ltd. (J.NTD) and its European distributors are likely to be fined for illegal sales practices in the mid-1990s. Also, two of the world's largest  auction  houses Sotheby's Holding Inc. (BID) and  Christie's  International PLC will pay for conspiring to fix prices over seven years.

TD
Both cases are considered important to restoring Monti's battered prestige. The  European Court of First Instance eroded his power to block mergers last week when it overturned two merger veto's. But the Europeanantitrust czar can still open investigations against companies he suspects of illegal activities and order dawn raids by investigators to collect evidence. He only needs to gain support of his other commissioners to impose  fines.

"Monti has lost some feathers in blocking mergers," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former senior Commission official and now partner with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Brussels. "But his authority over cartels remains intact."
Nintendo has been targeted for price-fixing. The world's second largest video-game maker is believed
to have collaborated with distributors to limit the cross-border flow of its games in the period 1995-2000.

"The Commission must protect the public against commercial practices which try to artificially maintain prices at a high level," Monti said at the beginning of the investigation in March 2000.

Another aggravating factor is the way Nintendo and other video-game manufacturers tie together their hardware and software. Nintendo games only work with Nintendo software. This makes customers dependent, analysts say.

Although the law is unclear whether Monti could demand breakups of Nintendo or other game makers, this bundling could push him to issue a heavy  fine. Seven other distributors are also likely to face penalties.

Auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's  are expected to get off easier. Both companies already have been fined in the U.S. where they agreed to pay over $512 million.  Sotheby's former chairman Alfred Taubman is serving a one-year jail sentence in the U.S.

E.U. officials said the investigation had uncovered evidence of a widespread agreement between the two houses to raise fees charged to sellers at  auctions, and that the scheme had been agreed by top management. But both  auction  houses cooperated with the investigation.

HD        Brussels brief - A question of (anti) trust. BY        By OUR BRUSSELS STAFF.

On Wednesday the  European Commission rolls out the red carpet for Atef Ebeid, prime minister of
Egypt. It is also an important day for anti-trust cases.

A packed agenda for Mr Ebeid includes bilateral meetings with Romano Prodi,  Commission president and later with Chris Patten, the EU's external affairs commissioner.

TD
Foreign policy will not be discussed. The meetings will. concentrate instead on economic and trade issues - the main preoccupations of a prime minister saddled with reforming an economy stifled by a large bureaucracy, growing illiteracy, and a rapidly rising population.

Another visitor on Wednesday is (Lord) Paddy Ashdown, whose official title is the Office of the High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia, a de facto protectorate, is not in good shape and is still rife with corruption. But after all the scars from the 1990s wars the EU can record one success: Refugees are returning home to their own properties. Attention now needs to turn to jobs.

Mr Ashdown will be spending much time with Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, to discuss, among other things, the EU's police force. This 500-strong force will take up position in January 2003 to train and reform the police in Bosnia.

Competition concerns

Brussels regulators are on Wednesday expected to levy  fines on a number of companies for a series of anti-trust violations.
The more important case involves  Sotheby's and Christie's  auction  houses. The European
Commission is believed to have evidence the two companies fixed the levels of some auction  fees
over a period of seven years. The exact amount of the  fines will be decided on Wednesday morning, but
competition experts say they are unlikely to exceed E10m each.

In a separate case, Nintendo, the Japanese videogame maker, is set to be punished for an agreement with seven of its  European distributors. They face  fines after the  Commission concluded that they carved up markets between them in a bid to keep prices higher. Once again, the exact amount of the fines will not be known until Wednesday morning.

The competition regulators are also expected to unveil new rules to allow companies to receive state aid if they employ disadvantaged workers such as the long-term unemployed and former convicts. The rules are aimed at encouraging companies to hire workers from groups that suffer from
high-unemployment rates.

HD           Sotheby's Fined EUR20.4 Mln For Fixing  Auction Prices

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Wednesday finedSotheby's Holdings Inc. (BID) EUR20.4 million for conducting a seven-year price-fixing conspiracy with Christie's International PLC (U.CTG).
The Commission concluded Christie's  and Sotheby's, two of the world's largest  fine art auction
houses, had formed an anticompetitive cartel in 1993.

TD
The pact affected sales between 1993 and early 2000. It ended fierce competition that had erupted between the two  auction  houses during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Commission said.
The two companies colluded on  auction  terms, including forcing sellers to pay higher commissions.

Christie's  escaped a fine because it was the "first to provide crucial evidence," the  Commission said.

Both companies agreed to cooperate with the  Commission's two-year probe in a bid to keep down the size of the  fines.

In Europe, a company can be fined up to 10% of its global annual sales, though fines have never been that high.  Sotheby's' most recent yearly sales amounted to $336 million. The Commission said its most recent sales figures for  Christie's  were between EUR400 million and EUR500 million.
(CORRECTED 1254GMT)

Sotheby's was fined $48 million by U.S. regulators and both  Sotheby's and Christie's  have agreed to pay $512 million to some 130,000 art buyers and sellers who brought a class-action lawsuit against them for fixing fees at U.S.  auctions.
Unlike in Europe, running a cartel in the U.S. can also carry a prison sentence.

Alfred Taubman,  Sotheby's former chairman, is serving a one-year jail term after being found guilty last December of hatching the conspiracy with his  Christie's  counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant. Taubman must pay a  fine of $7.5 million.
In contrast,  Christie's  Anthony Tennant, who lives in the U.K., has refused to appear in court in
America and can't be extradited for price-fixing.

The investigation into the  auction  houses was opened in January 2000 when  Christie's  approached E.U. regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice. It presented evidence of a cartel, in an attempt to obtain leniency.

Companies fined by E.U. regulators have three months to pay the  fines and two months to decide whether to appeal to the Court of First Instance,  Europe's second highest court.

Sotheby's said the  fine was lower that it had expected. The Commissionfined it 6% of global turnover instead of the maximum 10%. The  auction  house said it will report the EUR20.4 million  fine as a special charge in its third quarter results for 2002.



Page 8 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Sotheby's cooperated fully with the  commission throughout the process and as the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us," said Bill Ruprecht, chief executive of  Sotheby's.

Chistie's declined to comment on the details of the  commission's decision, but a spokesperson said the company "is pleased that this brings this chapter in the art market closer to a conclusion."

HD    Sotheby's fined 12m pounds  by EC for price fixing. BY    GARETH MACKIE.

EUROPEAN Union competition authorities today  fined Sotheby's auction  house 12.75 million pounds for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s.

But it spared rival  Christie's  any fine because the auction  house "was the first to provide crucial evidence" in the case.

TD
The auction  houses broke EU law by agreeing in 1993 to raise their charges to customers instead of competing with each other.

"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand,"  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said today.

The Sotheby's fine equals six per cent of its worldwide annual turnover. Both companies had applied for leniency from the Commission, which had the right to  fine them up to ten per cent of their annual turnover.
The auction  houses have a right to respond and to appeal any  Commission decision to the  European
Court of Justice.

Sotheby's and Christie's,  which between them control 90 per cent of the market, have been under investigation by the EU for months, and had been accused of colluding in a cartel which defrauded art sellers out of #290m by inflating  commission fees.

Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, is already in prison in the United States after being found guilty of price-fixing. He was  fined #4.7m and sent to jail for a year and a day in August. His counterpart at Christie's,  Sir Anthony Tennant, was accused of masterminding the other end of an arrangement which lasted for most of the 1990s.

Sir Anthony lives in Andover, Hampshire, and has refused to go to the US to face trial. He cannot be extradited on anti-trust charges, but American border guards have been told to arrest him if he sets foot on US territory.
The EU investigation began in 2000 when  Christie's  approached the US Department of Justice and the
European Commission in Brussels offering evidence of the cartel between itself and  Sotheby's.
One motive for coming clean was the prospect of leniency in both jurisdictions.
The Commission said earlier this year it was probing a cartel clearly sanctioned at the highest level. A
50-page dossier said the cartel ran from 1993 to early 2000 "when the parties appear to have recovered
their freedom to set prices independently".

It said the special arrangements consisted of an increase in the  commission both auction  houses charged their clients, as well as collusion over advances paid to sellers, guarantees given for  auction results and general payment conditions.

Mr Taubman was named as the mastermind behind the scheme after a US government investigation which lasted four years.

But it was the decision by  Christie's  to come clean which put the two worldwide names in the frame for breaching EU rules banning cartels or other "damaging" business practices.

The two firms later agreed jointly to pay more than #329m to former customers to settle a class action lawsuit in the US.

THE world's two leading  fine art auction  houses are expected to face heavy  fines today for running a price-fixing cartel in breach of European Union rules on fair  competition.

Sotheby's and Christie's,  which between them control a massive 90 per cent of the market, have been under investigation by the UK for months, accused of colluding in a cartel which defrauded art sellers out of
290 million pounds by inflating  commission fees.

TD
An announcement on the size of the  fine is expected later today, and insiders said the companies may have to pay up to #6.3m each for collaborating in the probe, although some of the EU's 20 commissioners are pressing for higher penalties.  Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, is already in prison in the US after being found guilty of price-fixing. He was  fined #4.7 million and went to jail for a year and a day in August.

His counterpart at  Christie's,  Sir Anthony Tennant, is accused of masterminding the other end of an arrangement which lasted for most of the 1990s.

Sir Anthony lives in Andover, Hampshire, and has refused to go to the US to face trial. He cannot be extradited on anti-trust charges, but American border guards have been told to arrest him if sets foot on US territory.
The EU investigation began in 2000 when  Christie's  approached the US Department of Justice and the
European Commission in Brussels offering evidence of the cartel between itself and  Sotheby's.

One motive for coming clean was the prospect of leniency in both jurisdictions. The  Commission offers partial or full immunity from  fines for companies giving "significant" information on price-fixing,
market-sharing or other anti-competitive agreements.

The Commission said earlier this year it was probing a cartel clearly sanctioned at the highest level, designed to end fierce  competition between the arch rival  auction  houses.

A 50-page dossier said the cartel ran from 1993 to early 2000 "when the parties appear to have recovered their freedom to set prices independently".

It said the special arrangements consisted of an increase in the  commission both auction  houses charged their clients, as well as collusion over advances paid to sellers, guarantees given for  auction results and general payment conditions. Mr Taubman was named as the mastermind behind the scheme after a US government investigation which lasted four years.

The two firms later agreed jointly to pay more than #329m to former customers to settle a class action lawsuit in the US.

In April, the Commission concluded Sotheby's and Christie's  had "breached EU  competition rules by colluding to fix commission fees and other trading terms".

The European Commission can levy fines of up to ten per cent of a company's turnover for cartel offences. In the US, fines are based on the size of the market affected.

HD     COMPETITION - COMMISSION SET TO FINE AUCTION HOUSES FOR PRICE-FIXING. BY     By (BEP).

LP
The European Commission is likely to impose large  fines on the world's two largest  auction  houses, Sotheby's and Christie's,  for price-fixing on October 30. The decision, due to be taken at the Commission's weekly meeting, follows a similar ruling in the United States, in which the two  auction houses were forced to pay more than  Euro 500 million for fixing prices and  Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, was sentenced to one year in jail.

In a 50-page document sent to  Sotheby's and Christie's,  the  Commission has outlined its belief that the two companies entered into an anti-competitive cartel agreement in 1993, which lasted until early 2000. The Commission's preliminary investigation showed that the purpose of the cartel agreement was to reduce the fierce competition between the two leading  auction  houses that had developed in the 1980's.

TD
Christie's  and Sotheby's are the world's leading players in the art  auction  market, with a joint market share of around 90% (worth about  Euro four billion).  Christie's  was established in 1776 and has its headquarters in London. It has been a subsidiary of French company Artemis SA since 1998.  Sotheby's, headquartered in New York, was also founded in the 18th century but has since become a publicly-listed company on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.

Brussels sources suggest that both companies will face a  fine on Wednesday, but the exact size of the fine is unclear. Under EU rules, the Commission can impose up to a maximum of 10% of the company's turnover of the previous year, but in practice the fine is usually considerably less.

Christie's  is expected to receive a reduced fine under EU "leniency" rules. In January 2000,  Christie's notified the existence of the cartel to both the European Commission and the US Department of Justice, and applied for leniency in both jurisdictions.

US antitrust regulators have already concluded their investigation of the cartel between Sotheby's and Christie's,  and reached an agreement with the two companies that they should jointly pay a fine of $512 million (Euro 520 million). In addition to this, the former chairman of  Sotheby's, Alfred Taubman, was sentenced to a year in jail for the role he played in the price-fixing agreement.  European legislation on cartels differs from law in the US, where executives can be held directly responsible for an illegal cartel.Neither  Sotheby's nor Christie's  were prepared to comment on the allegations ahead of Wednesday's decision.

Nintendo and seven  European distributors, including Scots firm John Menzies, were  fined a total of
(pounds) 101million today for market rigging to keep prices high.
The fine was imposed by the European Commission.

TD
Nintendo games were cheapest by far in the UK, the  Commission said - and John Menzies acted to keep out cheaper imports.
The aim was to maintain artificially high prices in breach of EU rules.

Distributors in Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Belgium were also part of the price cartel, acting together to prevent "parallel" trade in Nintendo video games from cheaper sources.
The parent company was  fined (pounds) 89m, with a (pounds) 5.2m penalty imposed directly on John
Menzies.
There were smaller fines for the other members of the cartel and Europeancompetition.

Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Families have the right to buy games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer.
"Wwe will not tolerate collusive behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high." The price fixing
covered a seven-year period from 1991 to 1998.

UK prices were generally by far the lowest, which understandably tempted outside traders into re-exporting cheap goods into high-price markets.
A major fine was also imposed on auction  house Sotheby's.
The firm was  fined (pounds) 12m by the Commission for rigging the art market in collusion with rival
Christie's.

Christie's  escaped a fine because company officials provided the Commission with the crucial evidence to prove the operation of a cartel between the world's two leading fine art houses in a scam which defrauded sellers out of (pounds) 290m.
The fine represents
6% of Sotheby's annual turnover.

Former Sotheby's chairman Alfred Taubman has already been jailed in America for a year after being found guilty of price
fixing. He was also  fined (pounds) 4.7m.
His Christie's  counterpart at the time, Sir Anthony Tennant, also named in today's  Commission ruling, is now living in

Hampshire.
He refused to go
to America to stand trial and cannot be extradited on the anti-trust charges he faces.

The fine imposed on Sotheby's includes a 40% reduction in acknowledgement of its co-operation in the investigation.

Sotheby's was fined £12m by the European Commission yesterday for rigging the art market in collusion with rival Christie's.

Christie's  escaped a fine because it provided the Commission with the crucial evidence to prove the operation of a cartel between the world's two leading fine art houses in a scam which defrauded sellers out of £290m. The  fine represents six per cent of the Sotheby's annual turnover.

TD
European Commissioner Mario Monti, in charge of EU  competition policy, said: "This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand."

He said Sotheby's and Christie's  had breached EU  competition rules, acting illegally to operate a price-fixing cartel to set client charges in a market in which both art houses hold a 90 per cent share between them.

The Commissioner said the purpose of the cartel was to reduce the fierce  competition which had built up during the 1980s and early 1990s between two leading players.

The most important aspect of the illegal agreement involved increasing the  commission paid by sellers at auctions - the so-called "vendor's  commission".

But the cartel also involved fixing other trading conditions, including advances paid to sellers and guarantees given for  auction  results.
The Commission said the collusion was set at the highest level in both companies.

Former Sotheby's chairman Alfred Taubman has already been jailed in America for a year after being found guilty of price-fixing. He was  fined £4.7m.

His Christie's  counterpart at the time, Sir Anthony Tennant, also named in yesterday's  Commission ruling, is now living in Andover, Hants, having refused to go to America to stand trial. He cannot be extradited on the anti-trust charges he faces.

The Commission said the two men "entered into secretive discussions at their respective private residences in London and, or, New York".

The first high level meetings in 1993 were followed by regular gatherings and price-fixing meetings between the companies' chief executives at the time - DD Brooks of  Sotheby's, and Christopher Davidge of Christie's.

The Commission investigation into the scam began in January 2000 when  Christie's  first approached the US Department of Justice and the Brussels authorities offering evidence of the cartel.

One motive for spilling the beans was the prospect of leniency in both jurisdictions - which paid off yesterday when no fine at all was imposed on  Christie's.

The Commission said yesterday that the company had received "full leniency" under the terms of a 1996 rule offering full or partial immunity from  fines for companies providing decisive information on price-fixing or market sharing.

The fine imposed on Sotheby's, meanwhile, includes a 40 per cent reduction in acknowledgement of its co-operation in the investigation.

HD     Brussels fines Sotheby's for fixing  fees with Christie's [Corrected 10/30/02] BY      Jitendra Joshi

LP
BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (AFP) - The  European Commission Wednesday finedauction house Sotheby's
20.4 million euros (20 million dollars) for illicitly fixing fees with rival Christie's,  ending a high-profile probe
into the rarified world of  fine art.

The investigation by the  European Union's executive arm began in January 2000, when former  Christie's chief executive Christopher Davidge approached both Brussels and the US Department of Justice with damning evidence of a cartel.

TD
Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic worked closely on the case, EU  Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti said.

Last December in the United States, a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with Christie's.
The cartel was set up in a bid to prevent ruinous  competition between the world's two leading  auction
houses that had developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, according to officials.
US prosecutors said their secret arrangement, lasting from 1993 to 2000, had cost clients of both firms
400 million dollars.

Christie's  was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against
Sotheby's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent.

Christie's  also escaped a fine in Europe after coming forward with "crucial evidence which enabled the
commission to prove the existence of the cartel", the EU investigation found.

The commission's fine levied against Sotheby's amounts to six percent of the  auction  house's worldwide turnover.

"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," Monti said.
"I also would like to underline the good co-operation with our counterparts at the US Department of
Justice in this case, who have pursued the same cartel for its effect in the US," he said.

The European Commission said it cooperated with the Department of Justice "not only as regards substance, but also on the timing of the procedural steps by each authority".

Christie's  was established in 1766 and has its headquarters in London, but has since 1998 been a subsidiary of Artemis -- the private holding company of French billionaire Francois Pinault.

Sotheby's was also founded in the 18th century but is now publicly listed and has its base in New York.

Luxembourg.

HD    EU fines auction  house Sotheby's 20.4 million euros for colluding with Christie's

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Wednesday fined the Sotheby's, the New York-based auction  house, 20.4 million euros (US$20.1 million) for colluding with rival Christie's  to fix commission fees, prices and trading conditions in art sales between 1993 and 2000.

London-based Christie's  escaped a fine because it provided evidence to the  European Union regulators which enabled them to prove the existence of the cartel.

TD
The case turned on fixing commissions for sellers of art works, trading and payment conditions and as well as auction  outcomes.

The EU head office said the cartel was initiated by Alfred Taubman and Sir Anthony Tennant, chairmen of Sotheby's and Christie's  respectively, in 1993 and faithfully executed by senior officials in both companies.
The EU finding follows action in the United States where  Sotheby's was sentenced to pay US$45 million.

Christie's  was also granted an amnesty in the United States for cooperating with investigators although it agreed to share the costs of a US$537 million settlement of price-fixing lawsuits brought by customers of the two houses.

Sotheby's and Christie's  have already agreed to pay US$512 million to some 130,000 art buyers and sellers who brought a class-action lawsuit against the houses for fixing fees at U.S.  auctions.
Unlike in Europe, running a cartel in the United States can also carry a prison sentence.

Taubman is serving a one-year jail term after being found guilty last December of hatching the conspiracy with Tennant, his  Christie's  counterpart. Taubman must pay a US$7.5 million  fine.
The fine for Sotheby's amounts to 6 percent of the company's worldwide turnover last year. Under EU
rules, the maximum antitrust fine cannot exceed 10 percent of turnover.

"No fine was imposed on Christie's  because Christie's  came to the Commission ... and provided decisive evidence," said Amelia Torres, antitrust spokeswoman for the EU Commission.
In a reaction,  Sotheby's stressed it has "cooperated fully" with the EU probe.

"As the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us," said Bill Ruprecht, the company's chief executive said.

A spokesman at  Christie's  said the company was "pleased that this brings this chapter in the art market closer to a conclusion."

The EU Commission said the price fixing and collusion in trading conditions kept the  auction  houses from setting prices individually.

"The purpose of the cartel agreement was to reduce the fierce  competition between the two leading auction  houses that had developed during the 1980s and early 1990s," the  Commission said in a statement.

The deal involved agreed increases in commissions paid to sellers of art works as well as trading conditions, guaranteed  auction  outcomes and conditions of payment.

Christie's  and Sotheby's are the leading players in the global art  auction  market.

Christie's  was established in 1766. It has been a subsidiary of the French Artemis SA company since
1998. Sotheby's, also founded in the 18th century, is publicly listed on the London and New York stock
exchanges. Taubman is its major shareholder.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission fined the Sotheby's auction  house 20.4 million euros ($20.1 million) on Wednesday for colluding with rival Christie's  to fix commission fees, prices and trading conditions in art sales between 1993 and 2000.

The case follows action in the United States, where  Sotheby's was sentenced to pay $45 million and its chairman was sent to jail and  fined.

The collusion between the largest  auction  houses in the global art market involved agreed increases in commissions paid to sellers of art works as well as trading conditions, guaranteed  auction  outcomes and conditions of payment, the EU  Commission said.
"The purpose of the cartel agreement was to reduce the fierce  competition between the two leading
auction  houses that had developed during the 1980s and early 1990s," the  Commission said.

The cartel was initiated by former  Sotheby's chairman Alfred Taubman and his  Christie's  counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant, in 1993 and was carried out by senior officials in both companies, the  Commission said.

The fine for New York-based  Sotheby's amounts to 6 percent of the company's worldwide revenue last year, EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said. Under EU rules, the maximum  fine for antitrust violations is
10 percent of a company's global revenue.

Sotheby's stressed that it has "cooperated fully" with the EU probe.

"As the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us," said Bill Ruprecht, the company's chief executive.

Torres said no fine was imposed on Christie's  because it "came to the  Commission ... and provided decisive evidence" in the investigation.

Christie's  said it was "pleased that this brings this chapter in the art market closer to a conclusion."

London-based Christie's  also was granted an amnesty in the United States for cooperating with investigators, although it agreed to share the costs of a $537 million settlement of price-fixing lawsuits brought by customers of the two houses.

Sotheby's and Christie's  also have agreed to pay $512 million to about 130,000 art buyers and sellers who brought a class-action lawsuit against the houses for fixing fees at U.S.  auctions.

Taubman is serving a one-year jail term after being found guilty last December of hatching the conspiracy with Tennant. Taubman was also  fined $7.5 million.

Christie's  was established in 1766. It has been a subsidiary of the French Artemis SA company since
1998. Sotheby's, also founded in the 18th century, is listed on the London and New York stock exchanges.
Taubman is its major shareholder.

Distinguished British  auction  house Sotheby's has been fined E20.4m by the  European Commission
for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s.

Fellow auctioneer Christie's  escaped sanction even though the EuropeanCommission said in a statement that it had found that the two colluded to fix commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

TD
The Commission said Christie's  escaped fines for being the first to provide crucial evidence that enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.

"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said. Christie's blew the whistle in early 2000, telling both the US Justice Department and the European Commission about the cartel. Both regulators offer immunity from prosecution from the first firm to report such illegal practices.

HD       Sotheby's is fined £12m by Europe for price-fix scam. BY       By HUGH DOUGHERTY.

AUCTION house Sotheby's was today handed a fresh blow as it was  fined £12 million for colluding with rivals Christie's  in a massive bid to rig the art sales market.

The firm was  fined by the European Commission for its price-fixing deal with  Christie's,  which has already cost it more than £247 million in fines and civil settlements in America.

TD
The two auction  houses defrauded sellers out of a total of £290 million during the scam, which ran from
1993 to 2000 after being agreed in secret meetings in oak-panelled boardrooms and airport car parks.

Christie's  decision to confess to the  Commission and American prosecutors, as well as providing the crucial documents detailing the secret deal, meant it has escaped being  fined by Brussels.
The fine piles new pain on Sotheby's, which has collapsed in value since it was found guilty by a court in
New York.

The penalty could have been even larger, as the Commission has powers to fine firms up to 10 per cent of their gross turnover. The maximum fine the Commission could have levied was £20 million but the penalty was limited to six per cent of Sotheby's worldwide turnover because of its co-operation with Brussels investigators. EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand."

The price-fixing deal was masterminded by former  Sotheby's chairman, Alfred Taubman, who is now languishing in jail in the American mid-west, and Diana "Dede" Brookes, its combative chief executive, now under house arrest in her Manhattan apartment after doing a deal with prosecutors which helped convict her former boss.

The former chairman of  Christie's,  Sir Anthony Tennant, who American prosecutors allege colluded in making the deal, faces immediate arrest if he ever sets foot in the US and has been forced to resign from all his City directorships and retire to the country. He cannot be extradited from Britain as his alleged crimes are not criminal offences under UK law.

Sotheby's and Christie's  first broke the law by agreeing to fix the charges to sellers in London and the
16 other cities in which they were rivals. The move sent profits and share prices soaring but, when it was
revealed, both houses slumped into crisis and have footed massive bills for the deal.

Sotheby's has been worst hit, clocking up debts of £153 million which today's  fine is likely to add to, and seeing its value slump.

Taubman, 78, is in talks from his prison cell on selling  Sotheby's, a move which the firm is trying to speed up in a bid to put the disgrace behind it.

The Commission used powers enshrined in European Union law allowing it to act even when offences are not necessarily illegal in a member state - as was the case with the UK.

The Commission also specifically named Sir Anthony in its judgment, saying the "collusive behaviour found its origins at the most senior level".

Page 35 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It said he and Taubman had first started their "secretive discussions" at their "respective private residences", backing the charges made by the American Department of Justice in its indictment against him.

A spokeswoman for  Christie's  said: "We do not have any comment on the  Commission's pleased that it brings this chapter in the of the art market close to a conclusion."

HD      Smoking  Gun antitrust violation brings  Nintendo  EUR149million  fine, Sotheby's fined tooL WC     486 words

The European Commission today imposed heavy fines on Nintendo, the video game s maker, and Sotheby's, the fine arts auction  house. Nintendo and seven of its distributors were  fined for colluding to prevent exports, primarily of Game Boy consoles, from low-priced EU countries - particularly from the UK
- to high-priced ones.  Sotheby's was fined for colluding with  Christie's  for fixing  commission fees and other trading terms.

Nintendo, which has already indicated its surprise at the level of the  fine ( the fifth largest ever imposed for any anti-trust violation), was found to ha ve put pressure on its distributors to make sure that its products did not en d up on the grey market. Its EUR149million  fine was imposed largely because Nintendo allegedly tried to mislead the  Commission and continued in its anti-competitive conduct even after the  European Commission had started its investigation.

TD
Tom Heide, competition law expert at Bristows, commented: "Both cases deal with serious violations of competition law and send a very strong message to companies: don't disregard the  competition rules. Specifically, don't try to restrict parallel trade in the EU and don't price fix.

The fine imposed on Nintendo is somewhat surprising but clearly shows that th e EC is clamping down on anyone ignoring competition law. Restrictions on pa rallel trade in the EU represent one of the most serious infringements of the EC  competition rules, as was recently demonstrated in the  fine levied against Volkswagen for systematically forcing its authorised dealers in Italy to refuse to sell Volkswagen and Audi cars to foreign buyers. Price-fixing between competitors like  Sotheby's and Christie's  should be an obvious no-no, but companies still try to get away with it."

The investigation into  Sotheby's and Christie's  likewise dealt with one of th e most serious forms of anti-competitive conduct, cartel behaviour. Only So theby's ended up being  fined in the investigation because Christie's  went to the European Commission and "spilt the beans", thereby benefiting from the leniency rules providing full immunity from fines in certain circumstances. These rules did not help Sotheby's which ended up with a EUR20.4million fine in the EU. In the US, where the antitrust authorities also investigated the two companies, Sotheby's was also fined, and the ex-Sotheby's chairman tycoon Alfred Taubman, was personally fined $7.5 million and sentenced to a year and a day in jail.
Criminalisation of cartel behaviour is one of the controversial issues that a re currently on the agenda in
UK in the Enterprise Bill.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - European Union competition authorities  fined Sotheby's auction
house a total of 20.4 million euros on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s.

But it spared rival Christie's  any fine because the auction  house "was the first to provide crucial evidence" in the case, the EuropeanCommission said in a statement.

TD
The auction  houses broke EU law by agreeing in 1993 to raise their charges to customers instead of competing with each other.
"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to
high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," said  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
in the statement.

The figure of 20.4 million  euros equals six percent of  Sotheby's worldwide annual turnover, the statement said.
Both companies had applied for leniency for the  Commission, which had the right to  fine them up to
10 percent of their annual turnover.
The auction  houses have a right to respond and to appeal any  Commission decision to the
European Court of Justice.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) -  European Union competition authorities  fined Sotheby's auction
house 20.4 million euros ($20.1 million) on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the
1990s, but fellow auctioneer Christie's  escaped.
The European Commission said in a statement that it had found that the two colluded to fix
commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

TD
The Commission said Christie's  escaped fines for being the first to provide crucial evidence that enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.
"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector from basic industries to
high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
said in a statement.

Christie's  blew the whistle in early 2000, telling both the U.S. Justice Department and the  European  Commission about the cartel. Both regulators offer immunity from prosecution from the first firm to report such illegal practices.

"We aren't commenting on the decision itself, but we're pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art market closer to a conclusion," a spokeswoman for  Christie's  told Reuters in London.

Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, was convicted last December in New York of conspiring with Christie's  former chairman, Anthony Tennant, to fix  auction commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars.

Sotheby's said in a statement it had anticipated a  fine as a result of the  Commission's investigation and said the fine would be reflected as a special charge in the firm's financial statements for the quarter ended on September 30.
COLLUSION

The two firms, steeped in tradition, colluded between 1993 and 2000 to fix fees and trading terms in the world's art, jewellery and furniture  auctions, 90 percent of which the two control.
The firms did not face jail sentences in  Europe because the EU has no criminal anti-cartel rules. Both companies had applied for leniency from the Commission, which had the right to  fine them up
to 10 percent of their annual turnover. The Commission said that the  fine on Sotheby's was equal to
six percent of its annual turnover.

"Sotheby's cooperated fully with the  Commission throughout the process, and as the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us," said Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive officer of  Sotheby's Holdings, in a statement.

After the scandal, the two firms agreed to jointly pay clients $512 million.  Sotheby's also paid $45 million in criminal fines in the United States and $70 million to shareholders.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European            Commission on Wednesday:
- ~- --

TD
ANNOUNCEMENTS

Spokesman Jonathan Faull said  European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy would hold a news conference at 1245 CET/1145 GMT on Wednesday about a  Commission proposal for mechanisms to ensure that drugs intended to combat transmissible diseases in poor countries were not diverted back into the European Union. At 1445/1345 GMT on Wednesday, there will be a VIP corner with  European Commission President Romano Prodi and Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid.
Faull said copies of the  Commission's Work Programme for 2003 would be available from Wednesday.
- ~- --
INSTITUTIONS-DEBATE

Faull said the  Commission was currently holding an intial debate to prepare its position on the institutional questions raised by the Convention on the future of the EU.

A document setting out this position was due to be published in mid-November, Faull said, adding that a news release would be issued if anything concrete came out of Wednesday's debate.

In response to a question, Faull said the structure of the debate was set by a list of questions selected by European Commission President Romano Prodi on the basis of institutional discussions in other forums. - - - -
CARTELS-NINTENDO

Spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the Commission had on Wednesday fined Japanese video game maker Nintendo and its distributors 167.8 million euros for anti-competitive practices during the 1990s.

She said that 149 million  euros of the total fine was imposed against Nintendo, and the rest distributed among seven of its official distributors in Europe for colluding to prevent exports to high-priced from
low-priced countries.

"Every year, millions of  European families spend large amounts of money on video games. They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer," Torres said.
"The Commission will not tolerate... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the  European
single market," she added.

Torres said the  fine was the fifth-largest  fine ever imposed against a cartel by the  Commission and that Ninetendo's 149 million  euro fine was the fourth largest individual sanction.

CARTELS-AUCTIONEERS

Torres said the  Commission had fined Sotheby's auction  house 20.4 million euros on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s, but had let off fellow auctioneer Christie's.
The European Commission said in a statement it had found that the two had colluded to fix
commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

Torres said Christe's had escaped  fines as it had been the first to provide crucial evidence which enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.

"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," she quoted  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti as saying.

Sotheby's former chairman Alfred Taubman was convicted last December in New York of conspiring with Christie's  former chairman, Anthony Tennant, to fix  auction commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars.

Both companies had applied for leniency by the  Commission, which had the right to fine them up to 10 percent of their annual turnover. In reply to a question, Torres said the  fine on Sotheby's was equal to six percent of its annual turnover.

In response to other questions, Torres said the  auction  houses had a right to reply, and to appeal any Commission decision to the  European Court of Justice, but that they did not face jail sentences in Europe because the EU has no criminal anti-cartel rules. Civil lawsuites like those brought by consumers in the U.S. could not be ruled out, she added.
The two firms agreed to jointly pay clients $512 million.  Sotheby's paid a further $45 million in criminal
fines in the United States and another $70 million to shareholders.
- ~- --
CARTELS-GAMES

In reply to a question, Torres said the  Commission had closed an investigation into alleged illegal practices similar to those of Nintendo by games makers Sega and Sony.
- ~- --
CARTELS-DVDs
In response to another question, Torres declined to comment on a  Commission probe of the EU's DVD
retail market.
- ~- --
STATE AID-ITALY
Torres was asked to comment on an article on state aid by Commissioner Mario Monti published in
Italian newspaper Corrierre della Serra.

She said the  Commission had last year identified Italy and Germany as having the highest EU levels of state aid paid to an individual industry. EU leaders had agreed this type of state aid needed to be reduced in favour of less  competition-distorting subsidies, she added.

Torres said overall state aid in the EU had been substantially reduced over the years, but that at 80 billion euros it still remained at a very high level.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) -  European Union competition authorities  fined Sotheby's auction
house 20.4 million euros ($20.1 million) on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the
1990s, but fellow auctioneer Christie's  escaped.
The European Commission said in a statement that it had found that the two colluded to fix
commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

TD
The Commission said Christie's  escaped fines for being the first to provide crucial evidence that enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.
"This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector from basic industries to
high-profile service markets such as the one at hand," EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
said in a statement.

Christie's  blew the whistle in early 2000, telling both the U.S. Justice Department and the  European  Commission about the cartel. Both regulators offer immunity from prosecution from the first firm to report such illegal practices.

"We aren't commenting on the decision itself, but we're pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art market closer to a conclusion," a spokeswoman for  Christie's  told Reuters in London.

Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, was convicted last December in New York of conspiring with Christie's  former chairman, Anthony Tennant, to fix  auction commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars.

Sotheby's said in a statement it had anticipated a  fine as a result of the  Commission's investigation and said the fine would be reflected as a special charge in the firm's financial statements for the quarter ended on September 30.
COLLUSION

The two firms, steeped in tradition, colluded between 1993 and 2000 to fix fees and trading terms in the world's art, jewellery and furniture  auctions, 90 percent of which the two control.
The firms did not face jail sentences in  Europe because the EU has no criminal anti-cartel rules. Both companies had applied for leniency from the Commission, which had the right to  fine them up
to 10 percent of their annual turnover. The Commission said that the  fine on Sotheby's was equal to
six percent of its annual turnover.

"Sotheby's cooperated fully with the  Commission throughout the process, and as the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us," said Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive officer of  Sotheby's Holdings, in a statement.

After the scandal, the two firms agreed to jointly pay clients $512 million.  Sotheby's also paid $45 million in criminal fines in the United States and $70 million to shareholders.

LEADING  auctioneers Sotheby's was fined more than £13million yesterday for a price rigging scandal.

But Christie's  - which joined in rigging the art market - was let off without a  fine after giving crucial evidence against its rivals.

TD
Some of the world's richest people were victims of the £290million fraud by the firms which handle 90 per cent of the  auction  market.

The European Commission, which imposed the  fine under competition rules, said the businesses operated an illegal cartel.

Their then bosses,  Sotheby's Alfred Taubman and  Christie's  Sir Anthony Tennant, hatched the plot at "secretive discussions at their private residences in London and New York" to end fierce  competition between them.

They agreed to fix high  commission charges to clients and colluded over advances to sellers and other payments.

Sotheby's was fined £30million and Taubman jailed for a year after an earlier probe in the United
States. Sir Anthony, of Andover, Hants, has refused to go to the US for trial.

SOTHEBY'S was  fined #13 million by the  European Commission yesterday for colluding with its rival, Christie's,  over the  commission fees charged to clients by the world's two largest  auction houses.

But Christie's  escaped a fine because the commission said that "it was the first to provide crucial evidence" that enabled officials to prove the existence of the illegal agreement.

The commission said that  Sotheby's and Christie's  "entered into an anti-competitive cartel agreement in the course of 1993 which lasted until early 2000".

The penalty imposed by the  commission is the latest blow for  Sotheby's which has already been fined in the United States and seen Alfred Taubman, its controlling shareholder and former chairman, jailed for a year by a New York court. He now wants to sell his holding in the company.

Christie's  has escaped relatively lightly, although it has had to pay out half of a #365 million civil settlement agreed by the two  auction  houses with clients in America who claimed that they had suffered from the collusion deal..

The reason is that  Christie's  was the first to go to the US Justice Department and the  European         Commission with evidence that Christopher Davidge, its former chief executive, had secretly met with Dede Brooks, his opposite number at  Sotheby's, to arrange the deal.

Under competition laws which encourage companies to inform on fellow conspirators, Christie's negotiated an amnesty from criminal prosecution in America and lenient treatment in Europe. Antony Mair, Christie's  lawyer, yesterday described the outcome of the European Commission investigation as "extremely welcome from  Christie's  point of view".

He added: "With the globalisation of  competition law, if you are going to blow the whistle in one particular jurisdiction you have to make sure that you are blowing your whistle in all the others."

Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive of  Sotheby's, said the company had co-operated fully with the commission. He added: "As the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are very pleased to have the investigation behind us."

The decision to collude over charges paid by clients was made in the early 1990s when the two auction  houses were struggling to win major consignments in a contracting art market. Both Mr Davidge and Mrs Brooks later alleged that the conspiracy was the brainchild of Mr Taubman and Sir Anthony Tennant, then chairman of  Christie's.

When the US Justice Department began a general inquiry into the art market in 1997 senior figures at Christie's  assured the company's lawyers that they had nothing to hide. But in 1999 Mr Davidge admitted that he had kept files of documents relating to his meetings with Mrs Brooks.
These were sent to  Christie's  New York lawyers and once in America had to be handed over to the
Justice Department.

SOTHEBY'S was  fined £12 million by the  European Commission yesterday for colluding with
Christie's,  its rival, to rig prices in the art market.

The fine is the final blow in a year of trials and reprimands for the  auction  house that has cost it £247 million and caused its share price to drop sharply.

TD
Although  Sotheby's has been left reeling by the sanction, which represents

6 per cent of its turnover, Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement: "The fine is materially less than it could have been. We are very pleased to have the investigation behind us." Sotheby's and Christie's  were found to have breached  European Union competition rules by operating a price-fixing cartel in the 1990s. The  auction  houses set client charges in a market where they held a 90 per cent share, defrauding sellers out of £290 million.

Christie's  decision to confess to the  Commission and American prosecutors in January 2000, as well as providing the crucial documents detailing the secret deal, meant it escaped a similar  fine.

Lawyers acting for Christie's  said yesterday that the company would have faced a similar punishment had the Commission not been alerted to the scandal at the same time as the US authorities.

The Commission, which had the power to impose  fines of 10 per cent of the companies' gross turnover, said that Christie's  had received "full leniency" because of a 1996 rule offering full or partial immunity from fines for companies providing decisive information on price-fixing or market sharing.

The fine imposed on Sotheby's was reduced by 40 per cent in acknowledgement of its partial co-operation.

Alfred Taubman, 78, the former chairman of  Sotheby's, was convicted of conspiring to fix art sale commissions in America in April and sentenced to a year and a day in prison and a £5 million  fine.

The value of the company, which was  fined £31 million after the US trial, has plunged from £1.8 billion before the price-fixing scandal to £590 million. Two months after his conviction Taubman agreed to sell the auction  house, which he famously bought because it would infuriate the "English snobs".

Sir Anthony Tennant, who was then his counterpart at  Christie's  and was also named in the Commission ruling, has taken refuge in Andover, Hampshire, and is refusing to go to America to stand trial.

HD      European Union - More Big Fines for Anti-Trust Behaviour

WMRC       Perspective
Significance            In one day,       the
Commission meted out the
fourth-highest fine for breaches of EU       competition legislation and agreed to increase co-operation in relation to      merger scrutiny with its trans-Atlantic trade partner.

TD

Implications            Strong       signals were sent out by the

Commission yesterday that competition rules      are there to be abided by and will be enforced with an iron fist. However,      it was not all doom and gloom, as the Christie's/Sotheby's case proved the       whistle-blowing provisions are doing their job.
Outlook                 Increased       co-operation with the US should bring speedier, more convergent decisions       for merger decisions that come under scrutiny in both jurisdictions.      However, this is just the first step and more work is needed.

Yesterday Japanese video game maker Nintendo and seven of its official distributors across the European Union (EU) were hauled over the coals by the  European Commission yesterday. The manufacturer and its seven distributors - John Menzies plc (Nintendo's distributor for the United Kingdom), Concentra, Produtos para criancas S.A. (Portugal), Linea GIG. S.p.A. (Italy), Bergsala AB (Sweden), the Greek unit of Japan's Itochu Corp, Nortec A.E. (Greece), and the Belgian unit of Germany's CD-Contact Data GmbH - were found guilty of colluding to prevent exports to high-priced countries from lower-priced countries between 1991 and 1998. The prevention of parallel imports was enforced by Nintendo by targeting those that did not play ball with smaller shipments, or by boycotting them altogether.

Nintendo bore the brunt of the  fine, a huge 167.8m  euro (US$165.5m) - unsurprisingly really when it was not only the instigator of the illegal practice, but continued to indulge in it despite the ongoing anti-trust investigation, as well as trying to mislead the Commission as to how widely spread the behaviour was. The other seven shared the remainder of the fine between them. The  fine is the fifth highest ever handed down to a cartel - although Nintendo's share is the fourth biggest to a single player - by the  Commission, and possibly the highest penalty for vertical infringement.

Commission Brings Down Hammer on  Auction Houses' Price-Fixing

In another anti-trust case yesterday, the  European Commission ruled that two leading fine arts auction houses, Christie's  and Sotheby's, had failed to abide by the trading bloc's competition rules, particularly Article 81(1) of the EU treaty, which bans agreements or concerted practices that fix prices, limit
production or share out markets. For a period of nearly seven years, the two operated a cartel, colluding in order to fix both  commission fees and trading terms in a bid to reduce the previously fierce  competition between the two world leaders in the field. The offending deal was brokered in 1993 between the then chairman of Sotheby's, Alfred Taubman, and Anthony Tennant of Christie's.  However, once the agreement collapsed in 2000,  Christie's  approached both the US and European anti-trust authorities with proof of the cartel, so securing more lenient treatment under the jurisdictions' whistle-blowing provisions, a move that was subsequently followed by  Sotheby's when it furnished the EU with further evidence of the cartel.

In deciding that the two  auction  houses had infringed the  European rules, the Commission had the power to apply fines of up to 10% of the undertakings' world-wide turnover. However, the Commission decided to fine Sotheby's 20.4m euro, equating to 6% of its world-wide turnover, incorporating a 40% reduction for its co-operation, whereas  Christie's  escaped under the leniency provisions. The two now have three months to pay the  fines, or two months to appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI).

The case, which has already been scrutinised in the US (see US: 7 December 2001:  Sotheby's Chief Found Guilty), is indicative of the kind of co-operation that can work well between the two trans-Atlantic powers. The case was expedited due to an agreement from both  Sotheby's and Christie's  to allow confidential information to be shared between the anti-trust bodies. The level of co-operation looks to be a sign of things to come, with a recent agreement paving the way for increased co-operation between the two in the hope of heading off another GE/Honeywell affair at the pass.
Greater EU-US Co-operation

In a bid to put this new-found co-operation on a more formal footing, the US and the EU published an overview of their best-practice guidelines relating to mergers yesterday. The guidelines are the result of extensive deliberations by a working group comprised of senior members of the two anti-trust agencies. Crucially, the guidelines support tandem scrutiny of mergers, speeding up the process and hopefully ruling out any embarrassing differences of opinion in the future and making the whole procedure more effective. Co-operation is to be increased in other areas as well, including:
The collection and evaluation of evidence. Improved communication between the respective agencies. Outlook and Implications
The Nintendo case demonstrates that behaviour contravening the  competition rules that are in place to safeguard business and consumers alike will not be tolerated. In addition, the imposition of such a hefty fine on the main protagonist, Nintendo itself, shows that the  Commission tries to be even-handed in dishing out punishment, hitting those hardest that coerced such errant practices. Further, the lack of a  fine for Christie's  goes some way towards demonstrating how effective the whistle-blowing provisions are. Without the information that was handed to them on a plate, the authorities would have been unlikely to have uncovered the cartel so quickly and the public and their competitors could have faced years of more damage.

In addition, the publication of guidelines outlining the way the anti-trust authorities in the EU and US should co-operate has been a long time coming. Undoubtedly spurred on by the debacle that was GE/Honeywell, the decision to increase co-operation and try to come to some mutually acceptable decision when scrutinising mergers will be welcomed by any businesses contemplating trans-Atlantic mergers. The increased co-operation should mean more speedy decisions as well.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined Sotheby's Holdings Inc. 20.4 million  euros for conducting a seven-year price-fixing conspiracy with Christie's  International PLC.

The commission concluded the auction  houses, had formed an anticompetitive cartel in 1993. The pact affected sales between 1993 and early 2000. It ended fierce competition that had erupted between the two auction  houses during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the commission said. The two colluded on auction  terms, including forcing sellers to pay higher commissions.

TD
Christie's  escaped a fine because it was the "first to provide crucial evidence," the  commission said.

Brussels, 30/10/2002 (Agence Europe) - The famous fine art auction  houses Christie's  and Sotheby's have been found guilty of infringing European rules of competition under Article 81(1) (ban on concerted agreements or practices with as effect price fixing, limitations on production or sharing out the market). Based on evidence provided by  Christie's  itself in January 2000, the  Commission was able to gather
proof of a cartel consisting in fixing sales commissions and other commercial conditions (notably advances given to salesmen, guarantees relating to the results of  auctions and conditions of payment) and initiated an official procedure two years later, sending to letters of complaint to the interested parties (see  EUROPE of 20 April, 2002, p.10). The cartel lasted from 1993 to early 2000, the parties then having been free to fix their prices individually.

TD
Sotheby's receives a 20.4 million  euro fine (corresponding to 6% of its world turnover), whereas Christie's escapes the penalty for having been the first to provide defining proof that enabled the Commission to establish the existence of a cartel. By co-operating, both parties wanted to limit the ferocious competition they had waged on each other in the 80s and early 90s. The collusive behaviour was decided on at the highest level, involving the presidents of the two companies, Alfred Taubman for  Sotheby's and Anthony Tennant for Christie's.  The Commission is satisfied with the "good collaboration" of the establishments
with both the European and American competition authorities. (the American ministry of justice has already condemned the  auction  houses for the same practices) which allowed for the affair to be settled relatively quickly. According to Commissioner Monti: "this case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high profile service markets such as the one at hand". the Commission also praised the "good co-operation" his services had with their counterparts in the American justice ministry who dealt with the same issue.

Auction house Sotheby's has been fined £13 million by European Union competition authorities for its part in a 1990s pricefixing cartel.

The fine followed the jailing in New York in August of former  Sotheby's chairman Alfred Taubman for his part in the ring that disgraced the  auction  industry.

TD
But while the EU threw the book at  Sotheby's yesterday, its fellow conspirator,  Christie's,  was let off.
The Commission said in a statement that it had found that the two had colluded to fix  commission
fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.
However, Christie's  escaped fines for being the first to provide the evidence that enabled the
Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.

'This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand,' EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti said.

Christie's  blew the whistle in early 2000, telling both the US Justice Department and the  European      Commission about the cartel. Both regulators offer immunity from prosecution from the first firm to report such illegal practices.

A spokesman for  Christie's  said: 'We aren't commenting on the decision itself, but we're pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art market closer to a conclusion.'
Mr Taubman was convicted in New York of conspiring with  Christie's  former chairman, Anthony
Tennant, to fix  auction commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars.
Mr Taubman was jailed for a year and  fined £5 million.

The two firms, which are steeped in tradition, colluded to fix fees and trading terms in the world's art, jewellery and furniture  auctions, 90 per cent of which are controlled by one of the two houses.

The firms did not face jail sentences in Europe because the EU has no criminal anti-cartel rules. Both companies had applied for leniency from the Commission, which had the right to  fine them up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover. The Commission said that the  fine on Sotheby's was equal to six per cent of its annual turnover.

According to figures published by  Sotheby's Holdings in March, the house this house last year had revenues of £215 million.
Accounts for  Christie's,  owned by French retail magnate Francois Pinault, were not available.

The two firms agreed to jointly pay clients £328 million in compensation.  Sotheby's paid a further £29 million in fines in the US plus £49 million to shareholders.

Christie's  escaped a fine because it provided the commission with the evidence to prove the operation of a cartel between the world's two leading fine art houses in a scam that defrauded sellers out of #290 million.  Sotheby's fine represents 6 per cent of the company's annual turnover.

European Commissioner Mario Monti, head of the  European Union's competition policy, said: "This case again shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets such as the one at hand."

He said Sotheby's and Christie's  had breached EU  competition rules, acting illegally to operate a price-fixing cartel to set client charges in a market in which the art houses hold a 90 per cent share between them.

The commissioner said the purpose of the cartel was to reduce the fierce  competition that had built up during the Eighties and early Nineties between the two leading players in the field.

The most important aspect of the illegal agreement involved increasing the  commission paid by sellers at auctions - the "vendor's  commission". But the cartel also involved fixing other trading conditions, including advances paid to sellers and guarantees given for  auction  results.
The commission said the collusion was set at the highest level in both companies.
Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of  Sotheby's, is serving a one-year jail sentence in the United
States after being found guilty of price-fixing. He was  fined #4.7 million.

His Christie's  counterpart at the time, Sir Anthony Tennant, also named in the  commission ruling, is living in Hampshire, having refused to go to the US to stand trial. He cannot be extradited on the
anti-trust charges he faces.

The commission said these two men "entered into secretive discussions at their respective private residences in London and/or New York".

HD          Sotheby's fined £13m for price-fixing scandal with Christie's. BY         By Andrew Osborn in Brussels and Maev Kennedy.

LP
Sotheby's, one of the world's two leading  auction  houses, was yesterday  fined almost £13m by the European commission for operating a massive illegal price-fixing cartel with its arch rival  Christie's  for most of the 1990s.

The most galling outcome for  Sotheby's, since the origin of the price fixing was an attempt by the houses in the early 1990s to end their cut-throat rivalry, is that  Christie's  has escaped with a rap on the knuckles.

TD
It mirrors the outcome of the earlier court cases in the US - where price fixing is a criminal offence - when Christie's  escaped relatively lightly and Sotheby's saw its former chairman Alfred Taubman
jailed and fined £5.4m. His opposite number at Christie's  at the time, Sir Anthony Tennant, re fused to go to America for the trial, and could not be extradited since price fixing is not a criminal offence in the UK.

Yesterday  Christie's  was heavily censured by the  commission but escaped without a  fine as a reward for its decision to blow the whistle on the cartel and hand over evidence.

It is a measure of the massive scale of the international art trade that the huge  fine represents only 6% of Sotheby's an nual turnover. The buyer's premium on just one staggering sale in July, when a rediscovered masterpiece by Rubens, The Massacre of the Innocents, sold at  Sotheby's in London for
£49.5m, a world record for a work of art, would cover well over half of it.

Sotheby's, which issued the briefest and blandest of official statements last night, had been braced for an even heavier fine. A Christie's  spokeswoman said: "We aren't commenting on the decision itself, but we're pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art market closer to a conclusion."

Both houses know the story may be far from over. Lawyers have threatened legal action on behalf of clients including dealers and private collectors, who believe they lost millions through the collusion. In the US they have already agreed to pay £340m to thousands of art buyers and sellers who brought a class-action lawsuit against them.

The commission began investigating the £2.5bn a year art  auction  market in 2000 but it was only yesterday that it concluded that the two companies were guilty of "a very serious violation" of EU competition rules.

It said: "The  commission has concluded that  Sotheby's and Christie's  entered into an anti-competitive cartel agreement in the course of 1993 which lasted until early 2000.
"The purpose of the cartel agreement was to reduce fierce  competition between the two leading
auction  houses that had developed during the 1980s and early 1990s."

Brussels said the multimillion pound scam went right to the top in both firms and that it extended to almost every part of the  auction  business.

An agreement had, it said, been struck between the two not to offer discounts and to keep prices high and fixed. T
Page 85 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission denied that  Christie's  had got off lightly.

"I understand your discomfort that companies can get away with murder," a spokeswoman said. "But what matters for the  commission is that the cartel is eradicated and that companies behave themselves and no longer set prices."

SOTHEBY'S AUCTION house was fined £12.9m by the  European Commission yesterday for colluding with Christie's  to cheat wealthy players in the international art market.

The fine represents 6 per cent of the company's annual turnover and comes after a court case in America which saw its former chairman Alfred Taubman, 68,  fined £4.7m and jailed for a year over the fraud which cost sellers £290m.  Christie's  escaped a fine because it provided the evidence that proved the operation of a cartel between the world's two leading art houses.

Mario Monti, the  European commissioner in charge of  competition policy, said: "This case shows that illegal cartels can appear in any sector, from basic industries to high-profile service markets." He said Sotheby's and Christie's,  which hold 90 per cent of the market, had breached EU  competition rules.

After fierce  competition in the 1980s and early 1990s, a price-fixing agreement was struck in 1993 at the highest level in the two companies, the commission said. The key aspect of the illegal agreement was an increase in the  commission paid by sellers at auctions. But it also involved advances paid to sellers.

The commission said Taubman and his  Christie's  counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant, "entered into secretive discussions at their respective private residences in London and, or, New York". The meetings were followed by regular meetings between the companies' chief executives at the time, D D Brooks of Sotheby's and Christopher Davidge of  Christie's.

Sir Anthony refused to go to America to stand trial for the collusion. He cannot be extradited from Britain on the anti-trust charges he faces.
The European Commission began investigating in January 2000 when  Christie's  approached the
American Department of Justice and Brussels offering evidence in the hope of gaining leniency.

Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive of  Sotheby's Holdings, said it had anticipated the  fine which would be reflected as a special charge in its financial statements.

"Sotheby's co-operated fully with the  Commission throughout and as the  fine is materially less than it could have been, we are pleased to have the investigation behind us," he said. "No current employee of the company was involved in, or aware of, the anti-competitive practices."

A Christie's  spokeswoman said: "We're pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art market closer to a conclusion."

THERE was a trolley dash in Britain's super-market sector this week as the Co-Operative snapped up Alldays for 131 million pounds to become the country's largest convenience store group. Two days later, leading supermarket operator Tesco bought budget outfit T&S Stores for #377m, giving it a five per cent share of the convenience market.

Consignia chairman Allan Leighton was rumoured to have teamed up with Royal Bank of Scotland to table a #3 billion bid for Safeway, but the supermarket chain's trading director Jack Sinclair later dismissed the reports as mere speculation as he unveiled a new #2m marketing campaign.

Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of crippled nuclear power firm British Energy, looked set to leave the East Kilbride-based company - which has seen its shares plunge 95 per cent this year - after it emerged headhunters had been appointed to find his replacement.

Chris Fishwick, the disgraced former head of global closed end funds at Aberdeen Asset Management who denies he is the "unacceptable face of capitalism", told the Treasury Select Committee that 35 controversial split capital investment trusts face collapse.

John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based distributor and baggage handler, was  fined #5.4m by European         competition authorities for its involvement in a cartel organised by Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker, which was itself  fined #94m for keeping prices artificially high outside the UK.

EU commissioners also slapped a #13m  fine on auction  house Sotheby's for a price-fixing scam that defrauded art sellers out of #290m by inflating commission fees, but rival  Christie's,  which colluded in the affair, escaped penalty because it provided the damning evidence.

Perth-based bus and train operator Stagecoach looked set to see its 20-year South West Trains franchise cut to seven years by rail regulators after a string of profit warnings, credit rating cuts and an increased commitment for cash from its troubled US subsidiary.

Industrial and public services firm Serco confirmed it had teamed up with Dutch Railways to bid for the seven-year Scot-Rail franchise when it comes up in March.

The Forum of Private Business said 38.8 per cent of SMEs north of the Border reported growth in the second quarter - the highest rate in almost six years and just 1.4 points behind the rest of the UK, which traditionally outperforms Scotland.

Policyholders who lost money with troubled insurer Equitable Life demanded #4bn in compensation from the Government, claiming it failed to adequately regulate the firm.

Figures showed HBOS more than doubled the amount of loans provided for  European buyouts to #7.3bn, filling the gap created by rivals as they scaled back investments.

Aberdeen oil and gas services firm Wood Group saw its shares fall to their lowest level since its #1bn flotation in May, as BP and Shell unveiled lower third-quarter profits.
Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed the economy will grow at a slower rate than the
Government is forecasting, but said there was no need for Chancellor Gordon Brown to raise taxes.

HD      COMPETITION - COMMISSION FINDS AUCTION HOUSES GUILTY OF OPERATING CARTEL. BY     By (BEP).
WC    549 words
PD     1 November 2002
SN     European Report

CY     (c) 2002 European Report.

The European Commission has, as expected, found  Sotheby's and Christie's,  the world's two largest auction  houses, guilty of operating an anti-competitive cartel between 1993 and 2000. In its decision of October 30, the  Commission fined Sotheby's Euro 20.4 million, but Christie's  escaped any penalty because it was the company that brought the cartel to the attention of the Commission in the first place.

The purpose of the cartel agreement was to reduce the fierce  competition between the two leading auction  houses that had developed during the 1980's and early 1990's. The most important aspect of the agreement consisted of an increase on the  commission paid by sellers at auction  (the so-called vendor's commission). But there were other trade agreements as well, such as advances paid to sellers, guarantees given for  auction  results and payment conditions.

TD
Earlier this year, US regulators found the two companies guilty of operating an illegal cartel, and  fined      Sotheby's $48 million. As in the EU,  Christie's  escaped punishment by being the first one to blow the whistle on the cartel.

Both companies agreed to pay some $512 million in compensation to art buyers and sellers, who brought a civil lawsuit against them for fixing fees at US  auctions. Furthermore, Alfred Taubman,  Sotheby's former chairman, was sentenced to one year in jail for the role he played in the cartel. At present, in the
EU, executives cannot be held directly responsible for the participation of their company in an illegal cartel.

The fine levied on Sotheby's - Euro 20.4 million - was significantly lower than the maximum  fine that the Commission was entitled to impose, and reflected the fact that the company co-operated fully with investigations. Under EU rules, the  Commission is entitled to impose a fine of up to 10% of the company's worldwide turnover, but in practice rarely asks for so much. Sotheby's fine represents 6% of the turnover.

The decision not to impose a penalty on  Christie's  reflects a drive by Competition Commission Mario Monti to stamp out anti-competitive cartels in the EU rather than imposing fines for their own sake. "It is most important to eradicate cartel behaviour, and offering companies leniency in exchange for their
co-operation helps this aim", said a  competition spokeswoman, responding to criticism that, despite participating in the cartel,  Christie's  would not be punished in either the United States or the EU.

Under EU rules, companies who first bring the existence of a cartel to the attention of the  Commission can be granted full immunity from  fines, or be given a reduced  fine. Christie's  may have escaped an EU fine, but the  Commission admits that it could still theoretically suffer recourse from traders or dealers who want to take the matter before the EU courts.

Sotheby's says it had anticipated a  fine from the Commission, and this  fine was reflected in the company's financial statements for the previous quarter.

Christie's  said that it would not comment on the specific decision, but added that it was "pleased that it brings this chapter in the history of the art markets closer to a conclusion".

The genteel world of antiques and  auction  rooms has never seen anything quite like it.

It is a scandal that has heaped shame on two great institutions of the  fine art world, and brought an internationally respected  auctioneers to the brink of bankruptcy.

TD
As reported in the Western Daily Press yesterday,  Sotheby's has been fined a staggering
£12million by the  European Commission for the part it played in a price-rigging scam of epic
proportions.

But the punishment handed down was just the latest sorry episode in a saga which has rumbled on for five long years.

The story, which includes courtroom drama, the humbling of powerful businessmen and corporate betrayal, was always too good an opportunity for Hollywood to miss.

Film star Sigourney Weaver has already agreed to appear in the big screen version of the scandal which has captured the imagination of America.

At the centre of the row is a clandestine deal set up between  Sotheby's and their rivals  Christie's, which saw their customers swindled out of an estimated £200million.

Although the two  auction  houses, both more than 300 years old, control 90 per of the international market in fine art they were still not satisfied.

At the centre of the secret pact between the two companies was the larger-than-life American businessman Alfred Taubman.

His life story reads like a classic rags to riches tale, complete with a tragic Shakespearean conclusion fashioned out of greed, duplicity and the ultimate betrayal of a trusted underling.

The 78-year-old was born into a working class family in Michigan, but he went on to make a personal fortune out of building a series of shopping malls in the 1950s.

Along the way the abrasive Taubman managed to set up a football team, marry a beauty queen and have a string of university departments named after him.
In the early 1990s the bullish businessman turned his sights on the art world and took over
Sotheby's, installing himself as chairman.

He quickly came to the conclusion that the big two  auction  houses were "killing each other on the bottom line" through needless  competition.
A series of secret meetings was held in New York and London and the deal was sealed.

But the whole plot began to unravel badly about five years ago when the authorities started to become suspicious.


Page 98 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Suddenly Taubman found himself before the courts. And his most trusted colleague, Diana Brooks, was there to give evidence against him.

The expensive legal team assembled by the multimillionaire argued Taubman was an out-of-touch executive who usually slept his way through board meetings.

They claimed he was more interested in what was on the menu for lunch than  auction  rooms and prices for sought-after pieces of art. Former presidents, Henry Kissinger, even the Queen of Jordan publicly supported Taubman in his darkest hour.

But Sotheby's glamorous chief executive Dede Brooks effectively blew the case out of the water with her dramatic court testimony.

The New York socialite, one of the most powerful figures in the art world, painted a very different picture from the one given by the defence.

While Taubman refused to take the stand, Brooks was the trial's key witness. She depicted her boss as the mastermind of the fraud. She said he orchestrated a sleazy web of intrigue and was personally involved in dozens of secret meetings.

The judge's verdict was damning. George Daniels described Taubman as a man driven by arrogance and greed who risked everything in the relentless pursuit of money.
Taubman is currently serving a prison sentence of a year and a day and paying off a  fine of
7.5million.

And even though Brooks agreed to turn state's evidence she didn't escape punishment. The elegant high flyer was forced to wear an electronic tag after being ordered to serve six months' home detention. A  fine of £350,000, three years probation and a community service order were also handed out by the judge.
Meanwhile Sir Anthony Tennant, Taubman's opposite number at  Christie's,  has refused to travel to
America to stand trial.
And the famous old  auctioneers escaped punishment in  Europe after agreeing to help with the
commission's investigation into  Sotheby's dealings.

The £12.5million  fine represents around six per cent of  Sotheby's annual turnover and could yet prove to be a fatal blow to a company which is already struggling.

What remains to be seen is whether this week's decision will be the final instalment of the scandal that could have come straight from the pen of a Hollywood scriptwriter.

LONDON; BRUSSELS

Sotheby's was fined more than $30 million Cdn by the European Commission Wednesday for colluding with its rival,  Christie's,  over the commission fees charged to clients by the world's two largest auction  houses.

TD
But Christie's  escaped a fine because the commission said that "it was the first to provide crucial evidence," which enabled officials to prove the existence of the illegal agreement.

The commission said Sotheby's and Christie's  "entered into an anti-competitive cartel agreement in the course of 1993 which lasted until early 2000."

The penalty imposed by the  commission is the latest blow for  Sotheby's which has already been fined in the United States and seen Alfred Taubman, its controlling shareholder and former chairman, jailed for a year by a New York court. He now wants to sell his holding in the company.

Christie's,  although it has had to pay out half of a nearly $890 million civil settlement agreed by the two auction  houses with clients in the United States who claimed that they had suffered from the collusion deal, has escaped relatively lightly.

The reason is that  Christie's  was the first to go to the U.S. Justice Department and the  European       Commission with evidence that Christopher Davidge, its former chief executive, had secretly met with Dede Brooks, his opposite number at  Sotheby's, to arrange the deal.

Under competition laws which encourage companies to inform on fellow conspirators, Christie's negotiated an amnesty from criminal prosecution in the U.S. and lenient treatment in Europe.
Antony Mair,  Christie's  lawyer, described the outcome of the  European Commission investigation as
"extremely welcome from  Christie's  point of view."

"With the globalization of  competition law, if you are going to blow the whistle in one particular jurisdiction you have to make sure that you are blowing your whistle in all the others," he added.

Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive of  Sotheby's, said the company had co-operated fully with the commission. "As the  fine is materially less than it could have been," he said, "we are very
pleased to have the investigation behind us."

The decision to collude over charges paid by clients was made in the early 1990s when the two auction  houses were struggling to win major consignments in a contracting art market. Both Davidge and Brooks later alleged that the conspiracy was the brainchild of Taubman and Sir Anthony Tennant, then chairman of  Christie's.

When the U.S. Justice Department began a general inquiry into the art market in 1997 senior figures at Christie's  assured the company's lawyers that they had nothing to hide.

But in 1999 Davidge admitted that he had kept files of documents relating to his meetings with Brooks. These were sent to  Christie's  New York lawyers and once in the U.S. had to be handed over to the Justice Department.
The commission said that its investigation started in January 2000 when  Christie's  approached the
U. S. Department of Justice and the  European Commission.

Carlsberg and Heineken, two of the world's biggest brewers, are to escape  fines after European
regulators dropped a cartel case against them.

The Danish and Dutch companies had denied the charges and the victory could be a sign that recent court defeats have prompted the Brussels authorities to be more cautious in their  antitrust probes.

TD
A Brussels lawyer said: "This could be a refreshing change. The  Commission needed to lose a lot of its zealotry and be a bit more open-minded on cartel cases".

Carlsberg and Heineken welcomed the decision yesterday. Margrethe Skov, Carlsberg's director of public affairs, said: "We are extremely pleased with the outcome. It is in line with what we've said all along.

"The difficult thing is that one is under suspicion for 18 months and never knowing when a conclusion would be reached."

The European Commission said on Monday it had dropped the case after realising that it did not have fresh evidence of an alleged anti-competitive agreement between the companies.

Brussels sent the brewers a so-called "statement of objections" last March, accusing them of one of "the most blatant forms of anti-competitive practice". A two-year probe had reached the preliminary conclusion that Heineken and Carlsberg had agreed not to compete in each other's home markets - the Netherlands and Denmark respectively - the statement said.

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover - which would have amounted to EUR916m ($912.79m) for Heineken and more than EUR400m for Carlsberg - but it rarely levies the full penalty.

But the  Commission said its evidence dated back to 1995 and was too old to be useful to its investigation, which started in 2000.

EU law says Brussels can  fine companies only if its evidence dates from less than five years from the beginning of the probe.

The Commission said it had raided the companies' offices in August to look for more recent evidence but could not find any.

It is unusual for the Brussels authorities to drop a case so late in their investigations. Mostly, the Commission fines companies a few months after spelling out its preliminary findings in the statement of objections.

In a cartel case against  auction  houses, for example,  Sotheby's received a statement of objections a month after the brewers, and was  fined EUR20.4m last week.

HD           EU fines Sotheby's for price fixing. WC          172 words

European Union competition authorities  fined Sotheby's auction  house 20.4 million  euros (US$20.1 million) on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing cartel during the 1990s, but fellow auctioneer Christie's  escaped.
The European Commission said in a statement that it had found that the two colluded to fix
commission fees and other trading terms between 1993 and early 2000.

TD
The Commission said Christie's  escaped fines for being the first to provide crucial evidence that enabled the Commission to prove the existence of the cartel.

Christie's  blew the

whistle in early 2000, telling both the U.S. Justice Department and the  European Commission about the cartel. Both regulators offer immunity from prosecution from the first firm to report such illegal practices.

Sotheby's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, was convicted last December in New York of conspiring with Christie's  former chairman, Anthony Tennant, to fix  auction commission fees in a scam that cost art sellers tens of millions of dollars. (Reuters).

Carlsberg and Heineken, two of the world's biggest brewers, are to escape  fines after European
regulators dropped a cartel case against them.

The Danish and Dutch companies had denied the charges and the victory could be a sign that recent court defeats have prompted the Brussels authorities to be more cautious in their  antitrust probes.

TD
Carlsberg and Heineken welcomed the decision yesterday. Margrethe Skov, Carlsberg's director of public affairs, said: "We are extremely pleased with the outcome. It is in line with what we've said all along.

"The difficult thing is that one is under suspicion for 18 months and never knowing when a conclusion would be reached."

The European Commission said yesterday it had dropped the case after realising that it did not have fresh evidence of an alleged anti-competitive agreement between the companies.

Brussels sent the brewers a "statement of objections" last March, accusing them of one of "the most blatant forms of anti-competitive practice".

A two-year probe had reached the preliminary conclusion that Heineken and Carlsberg had agreed not to compete in each other's home markets - the Netherlands and Denmark respectively - the statement said.

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover - which would have amounted to Euros 916m ( £583.48m) for Heineken and more than  Euros 400m for Carlsberg - but it rarely levies the full penalty.

But the  Commission said its evidence dated back to 1995 and was too old to be useful to its investigation, which started in 2000.

EU law says Brussels can  fine companies only if its evidence dates from less than five years from the beginning of the probe.

The Commission said it had raided the companies' offices in August to look for more recent evidence but could not find any.

It is unusual for the Brussels authorities to drop a case so late in their investigations. Mostly, the Commission fines companies a few months after spelling out its preliminary findings in the statement of objections.

In a cartel case against  auction  houses, for example,  Sotheby's received a statement of objections a month after the two brewers, and was  fined Euros 20.4m last week.  www.ft.com/consumer

HD   OPINION - Companies  walk a tightrope as EU free trade law begins to bite.
BY    By MARK RITSON, assistant professor of marketing at the London Business School.

LP
The big marketing news last week was not a woman in a bra being used to sell cars. A far more fundamental marketing issue made a reappearance in the headlines.

The European Commission has made no secret of its love of free trade and its hatred of any commercial activities that take advantage of the consumer. Articles 81 and 82 are the innocuous-looking pieces of legislation designed to prevent anti-competitive activity within the EU.

TD
Article 81 prevents any corporate policy that results in 'the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market'.  Auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's  spent much of the 90s in a price-fixing cartel. Console maker Nintendo's offence was aimed vertically down the distribution chain rather than horizontally at competitors. It stipulated that its retailers must sell its products at differential prices across the EU. Despite the fact that there were no legitimate reasons why costs were higher, consumers in Germany paid up to two-thirds more than their UK counterparts for the same product.

There is a subtle line between being competitive and being collusive and these companies stepped over it. The key point to take from this case is not the crime, but rather the punishment. This is not a toothless EU bureaucracy anymore. Companies that are found guilty of any offence can be fined up to 10% of turnover. Sotheby's and Nintendo were  fined 20 million euros ( £12.7m) and 149 million euros ( £94.3m), respectively. John Menzies, implicated as one of Nintendo's guilty retailers, was fined 18 million euros (
£11.4m).

Article 82 has the same anti-competitive end, but targets a different type of malpractice. In this instance a company abuses its 'dominant position' in the marketplace in ways that disadvantage other competitors and, ultimately, consumers. When ECS, a small UK chemical manufacturer, entered a market dominated by Akzo Nobel, the large Dutch multinational reduced its prices below its fixed and variable costs (that is, sold at a loss). Akzo hoped that this act of predatory pricing would encourage ECS to exit the market.

Instead, the EU  fined it 10 million euros. There is, it appears, a second subtle line that marketers must not cross. While Article 81 reminds marketers to always be competitive, Article 82 stipulates that marketers cannot be too competitive.

All of the companies mentioned above have been appalled by the level of the  fine levied against them, and all the signs are these  fines are increasing in severity. Ensure that you maintain a position somewhere between 81 and 82, and more interestingly, treat articles 81 and 82 as key weapons against your competitors. Do you know of examples where your competitors have engaged in price fixing with you or other companies?
Is a competitor currently pricing below cost to eliminate other competitors?

Do you know any organisation that prices differently across the EU for no other reason except it can get away with it? If yes, fax the details to Mario Monti, EC commissioner for  competition on +32-2-295-01-28. He's expecting your call.

$78.3 million at its evening Contemporary sale

NEW YORK, Nov. 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide live and online auction  businesses, art-related financing and real estate brokerage activities, today announced results for the nine months and third quarter ended September 30,
2002. For the first nine months of 2002 the Company reported total revenues of $220.8 million, compared to $225.2 million for the corresponding period of 2001. Net loss for the first nine months of 2002 was ($48.2) million, or ($0.78) per share, compared to a net loss of ($41.3) million, or ($0.68) per share for the corresponding period of 2001.
During the first nine months of 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $35.9 million, or ($0.49)
per share, primarily related to  antitrust related matters ($19.2 million) and employee retention costs ($18.3
million). The  antitrust related charges principally consist of the $20.1 million  European Commission fine,
which was assessed on October 30th and is reflected in our third quarter results. Excluding these charges,
the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.29) for the first nine months of 2002. During the first
nine months of 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $24.0 million, or ($0.25) per share
primarily related to employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans. Excluding these
charges the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.43) for the first nine months of 2001. In
summary, excluding antitrust related charges, employee retention costs and restructuring charges, the
Company's loss per share improved to ($0.29) from ($0.43), a $0.14 per share, or 33%, improvement.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company reported total revenues of $48.4 million, compared to $38.4 million in the corresponding period of 2001, an increase of 26%. This increase is primarily attributable to the July sale in London of Sir Peter Paul Rubens' Massacre of the Innocents for the record price of $76.7 million. The Company's net loss for the third quarter of 2002 was ($43.0) million, or ($0.70) per share, compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2001 of ($33.1) million, or ($0.54) per share. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $26.5 million, or ($0.40) per share, primarily related to the  fine of $20.1 million resulting from the decision of the  European             Commission in its antitrust investigation, as well as $5.8 million in employee retention costs. Excluding these charges, the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.31) for the third quarter of 2002. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $14.1 million, or ($0.14) per share, primarily related the Company's restructuring plans and employee retention costs. Excluding these
charges, the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.40) for the third quarter of 2001.

The third quarter is historically a period of minimal sales activity in the art  auction  market (typically less than 10% of total annual  auction  sales for Sotheby's) and, therefore, the Company traditionally reports a loss in the period.

"Sotheby's results show a significant improvement over the prior year (excluding charges related to antitrust matters, employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans)," said William Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of  Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "Third quarter revenues were up 26% and nine month results were positively impacted by a 7%, or $16.7 million, decrease in operating expenses excluding these charges. Controlling and reducing costs remains a major priority, especially in light of the current economic environment. Excluding pre-tax charges related to  antitrust related matters, employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans, we have attained a 17% or $47.5 million reduction
in total expenses during the first nine months of 2002 as compared to the same period in 2000. We are on track to achieve a reduction of approximately $70 million in operating expenses for the full year versus the
2000 cost base, excluding the pre-tax charges discussed above. We are pleased with these results, as we will exceed our previously stated plan of reducing operating expenses by $60 million.

"Auction sales (hammer price plus buyer's premium) of $1.1 billion for the first nine months of 2002 were in line with expectations. Most notably, sales in  Europe and Asia did well and were up 15% and 7%, respectively. However,  auction  revenues were below expectations, primarily due to margin pressures on high end consignments when compared to the prior year," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "For the quarter, auction  sales were $208.6 million, up 79% over the previous year, as a result of the sale of Sir Peter Paul Rubens' Massacre of the Innocents for $76.7 million.  Sotheby's International Realty continues to benefit from a strong real estate market. Total Real Estate revenues for the first nine months are up 12%."
Impressionist and Contemporary Sale Results

"Sotheby's was the clear market leader in the fall series of Impressionist and Modern art sales held in New York last week with sales totaling just under $100 million," said Mr. Ruprecht. "The highlight of the Impressionist and Modern Art evening sale and the highest price achieved for Impressionist paintings this season was a beautiful and luminous example from Claude Monet's iconic Water Lilies series, Nympheas, which sold for $18.7 million. Another highlight was Amedeo Modigliani's important work Giovanotta dai Capelli Rossi that sold above its presale high estimate for $8.5 million.

"Last night  Sotheby's held its evening sale of Contemporary art in New York which totaled $78.3 million - the highest total for a Contemporary Art sale in over 10 years. The very best works performed superbly
well, as seen in one of Willem de Kooning's rare black and white abstraction entitled Orestes which sold for
$13.2 million, well over the high estimate. Cy Twombly's Untitled from his blackboard series brought $5.6
million and set a record for the artist at  auction.  Overall, it was a successful evening for the Company."

Mr. Ruprecht continued: "The solid results of both the Impressionist and Contemporary sales continue to demonstrate the strong demand for first rate works and the overall durability of the art market despite the uncertainty of the current economic environment."
Fourth Quarter and Upcoming Sales

"In October we offered some extraordinary single and various owner sales, which in turn produced strong results. The Beck Collection of German and Expressionist Art brought over $22 million - the highest total ever for a single owner collection of German 20th Century Art. The corresponding various owner sale fetched $10 million bringing the total of German and Austrian Art sold to over $32 million, further confirming Sotheby's dominance in this market. Other noteworthy single owner sales included: the Property from the Estate of Ogden Phipps held in New York, which brought $9.6 million; the Esmond Bradley Martin Watches and Estate totaled a combined $9.4 million; and the Alexander Davison Collection of Admiral Horatio
Nelson memorabilia which brought $3.3 million.

"Looking ahead to our December 4th American Paintings sale with a low estimate of approximately $30 million, the Arthur G. Altschul Collection which is the centerpiece of that sale includes two major oils on canvas: Everett Shinn's Footlight Flirtation and John Sloan's Gray and Brass. Both paintings have presale estimates of $2.5 to $3.5 million. In January 2003 in New York,  Sotheby's Old Master Paintings sale will offer one of the greatest Old Master paintings remaining in private hands, Andrea Mantegna's Descent into Limbo, estimated to fetch between $20 to $30 million.

European Commission

In a decision issued on October 30th determining that Sotheby's and Christie's  had agreed to fix selling commissions and other trading terms in connection with auctions held in the European Union, the European Commission imposed a $20.1 million  fine on the Company. The fine, which the Company had anticipated, is reflected as a special charge in the Company's financial statements for the third quarter of
2002.
"This is a major step towards finalizing our  antitrust liabilities," said Mr. Ruprecht. Sale Process

On June 3rd A. Alfred Taubman filed an amended Schedule 13D in which he announced his intention to work in cooperation with the Company to explore a possible sale or merger of  Sotheby's or the sale of his Stake in the Company. Mr. Taubman owns approximately 13.2 million shares of Class B common stock of Sotheby's, which gives him 62.9% of the total votes of the Company.

"The coordinated sale effort between Mr. Taubman and  Sotheby's continues to progress smoothly and we will provide an update of any material changes whenever appropriate," said Mr. Ruprecht.

Sotheby's Holdings Inc. (BID) said its third quarter typically produces less than 10% of the company's total annual  auction  sales and ordinarily results in a loss for the period.

The company added that it is on track to reduce 2002 operating expenses by $70 million from expenses incurred during 2000.

Third-quarter  auction  revenues were below expectations, because of margin pressures on high-end consignments when compared to the prior year.  Sotheby's International Realty
continues to benefit from a strong real estate market, with total revenue from the segment up 12%
in the first nine months of 2001.

The antitrust related charges principally consist of the $20.1 million European Commission fine, which was assessed on October 30th and is reflected in our third quarter results. Excluding these charges, the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.29) for the first nine months of 2002. During the first nine
months of 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $24.0 million, or ($0.25) per share primarily related to

employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans. Excluding these charges the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.43) for the first nine months of 2001. In summary, excluding antitrust related charges, employee retention costs and restructuring charges, the Company's loss per share improved to ($0.29) from ($0.43), a $0.14 per share, or
33%, improvement.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company reported total revenues of $48.4 million, compared to $38.4 million in the corresponding period of
2001, an increase of 26%. This increase is primarily attributable to the July sale in London of Sir Peter Paul Rubens' Massacre of the Innocents for the record price of $76.7 million. The Company's net loss for the third
quarter of 2002 was ($43.0) million, or ($0.70) per share, compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2001 of ($33.1) million, or ($0.54) per share. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $26.5 million, or ($0.40) per share, primarily related to the fine of $20.1 million resulting from the decision of
the European Commission in its antitrust investigation, as well as $5.8 million in employee retention costs. Excluding these charges, the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.31) for the third quarter of 2002. During the third quarter of
2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $14.1 million, or ($0.14) per share, primarily related the Company's restructuring plans and employee retention costs. Excluding these charges, the Company's loss per share would have been ($0.40) for the third quarter of
2001. The third quarter is historically a period of minimal sales activity in the art auction  market (typically less than 10% of total annual auction  sales for Sotheby's) and, therefore, the Company traditionally reports a loss in the period.

"Sotheby's results show a significant improvement over the prior year (excluding charges related to  antitrust matters, employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans)," said William Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of  Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "Third quarter revenues were up 26% and nine month results were positively impacted by a 7%, or $16.7 million, decrease in operating expenses excluding these
charges. Controlling and reducing costs remains a major priority, especially in light of the current economic environment. Excluding pre-tax charges related to antitrust related matters, employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans, we have attained a
17% or $47.5 million reduction in total expenses during the first nine months of 2002 as compared to the same period in 2000. We are on track to achieve a reduction of approximately $70 million in operating expenses for the full year versus the 2000 cost base, excluding the pre-tax charges discussed above. We are pleased with these results, as we will exceed our previously stated plan of reducing operating expenses by $60 million.
"Auction sales (hammer price plus buyer's premium) of
$1.1 billion for the first nine months of 2002 were in line
with expectations. Most notably, sales in  Europe and
Asia did well and were up 15% and 7%, respectively.
However, auction  revenues were below expectations,
primarily due to margin pressures on high end

consignments when compared to the prior year," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "For the quarter,  auction  sales were $208.6 million, up 79% over the previous year, as
a result of the sale of Sir Peter Paul Rubens' Massacre of the Innocents for $76.7 million.  Sotheby's International Realty continues to benefit from a strong real estate market. Total Real Estate revenues for the first nine months are up 12%." Impressionist and Contemporary Sale Results

"Sotheby's was the clear market leader in the fall series of Impressionist and Modern art sales held in New York last week with sales totaling just under $100 million," said Mr. Ruprecht. "The highlight of the Impressionist and Modern Art evening sale and the highest price achieved for Impressionist paintings this season was a beautiful and luminous example from Claude Monet's iconic Water Lilies series, Nympheas, which sold for
$18.7 million. Another highlight was Amedeo
Modigliani's important work Giovanotta dai Capelli Rossi
that sold above its presale high estimate for $8.5 million.

"Last night  Sotheby's held its evening sale of Contemporary art in New York which totaled $78.3 million - the highest total for a Contemporary Art sale in over 10 years. The very best works performed superbly well, as seen in one of Willem de Kooning's rare black and white abstraction entitled Orestes which sold for
$13.2 million, well over the high estimate. Cy Twombly's Untitled from his blackboard series brought $5.6 million and set a record for the artist at  auction.  Overall, it was a successful evening for the Company."

Mr. Ruprecht continued: "The solid results of both the Impressionist and Contemporary sales continue to demonstrate the strong demand for first rate works and the overall durability of the art market despite the uncertainty of the current economic environment."
Fourth Quarter and Upcoming Sales

"In October we offered some extraordinary single and various owner sales, which in turn produced strong results. The Beck Collection of German and Expressionist Art brought over $22 million - the highest total ever for a single owner collection of German 20th Century Art. The corresponding various owner sale fetched $10 million bringing the total of German and Austrian Art sold to over $32 million, further confirming Sotheby's dominance in this market. Other noteworthy single owner sales included: the Property from the Estate of Ogden Phipps held in New York, which brought $9.6 million; the Esmond Bradley Martin Watches and Estate totaled a combined $9.4 million;
and the Alexander Davison Collection of Admiral Horatio
Nelson memorabilia which brought $3.3 million.

"Looking ahead to our December 4th American Paintings sale with a low estimate of approximately $30 million, the Arthur G. Altschul Collection which is the centerpiece of that sale includes two major oils on canvas: Everett Shinn's Footlight Flirtation and John Sloan's Gray and Brass. Both paintings have presale estimates of $2.5 to $3.5 million. In January 2003 in New York,  Sotheby's Old Master Paintings sale will
offer one of the greatest Old Master paintings remaining in private hands, Andrea Mantegna's Descent into
Page 138 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Limbo, estimated to fetch between $20 to $30 million.
European Commission

In a decision issued on October 30th determining that Sotheby's and Christie's  had agreed to fix selling commissions and other trading terms in connection with auctions held in the European Union, the  European    Commission imposed a $20.1 million  fine on the Company. The  fine, which the Company had
anticipated, is reflected as a special charge in the
Company's financial statements for the third quarter of
2002.
"This is a major step towards finalizing our  antitrust
liabilities," said Mr. Ruprecht.
Sale Process

On June 3rd A. Alfred Taubman filed an amended Schedule 13D in which he announced his intention to work in cooperation with the Company to explore a possible sale or merger of  Sotheby's or the sale of his Stake in the Company. Mr. Taubman owns approximately 13.2 million shares of Class B common stock of Sotheby's, which gives him 62.9% of the total votes of the Company.

"The coordinated sale effort between Mr. Taubman and Sotheby's continues to progress smoothly and we will provide an update of any material changes whenever appropriate," said Mr. Ruprecht.
