BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The European Commission will on Wednesday  fine some companies involved in a cartel in the synthetic rubber industry for materials used to make tyres and other products, a source close to the case said.

TD
Involved in the case are Bayer of Germany; Dow Chemical of the United States and some of its European subsidiaries; Eni of Italy and its subsidiary Sundial; Shell of the Netherlands and Britain; Kaucuk of the Czech Republic; and Poland-based Stomil.

The Commission, executive arm of the European Union, will rule that the companies agreed to fix prices of butadiene  rubber andemulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, the source said on Friday.
The Commission declined to comment.
Bayer told the Commission about the  cartel and sought immunity, so may escape a  fine.
In 2005, Bayer said "the investigation does not concern Bayer but we will cooperate with the authorities". Also that year a spokesman for UniPetrol, which was Kaucuk's majority owner, denied the accusations. The companies have had an oral hearing in the case.

The amendment to the toll contract between the Czech Republic and Kapsch, which the Transport Ministry made public on Friday, confirms that the contract is disadvantageous for the state. Transport Minister Ales Rebicek wants to avoid similar problems with the deployment of the toll system on first class roads, which Kapsch is to complete next July, and will therefore first submit Kapsch's proposal to the Anti-Monopoly Bureau. (HN 16)

The amendment allows Kapsch to lower the toll collection effectiveness rate to 85 % in the first three months of operation. If the collection success rate exceeds 95 %, Kapsch's compensation will be higher than stipulated in the original agreement. The amendment also includes a provision preventing the state from owning part of the software that will be used to collect tolls on all toll highways once the system is completed. (Saturday's MfD A9)

The European Commission is preparing to levy a  cartel price agreement fine on 5 synthetic rubber manufacturers this Wednesday. They include Czech firm Kaucuk Kralupy. The firms allegedly agreed on the price of rubber used for manufacturing tires. This would make Kaucuk the first Czech firm to be issued a fine by the European Commission. The fine can total up to one tenth of annual turnover. (HN

RWE Transgas will become a shareholder of Store-x Storage Capacity Exchange and use its online platform to begin trading natural gas reservoir capacities online. RWE Transgas will purchase a 12% stake in Store-x from current shareholders VNG and E.ON Ruhrgas. The acquisition of the stake is contingent upon the approval of the Anti-Monopoly Bureau. (CIA)

Vemex, which is wholly controlled by Russian gas giant Gazprom, has secured a second significant contract for the delivery of gas to the Czech market. Its new customer is Ostrava-based Energetika Vitkovice. Competitor RWE Transgas will supply the Ostrava-based firm with more gas than it supplies to its leading client, Prazska Plynarenska. (HN 16)

United Energy will have analyses about the possible construction of a new block of the Komorany power plant in Most at its disposal by the end of this year. According to preliminary estimates, the block's output is to total between 100 and 200 MW. If approved by its management, the firm expects to implement the project in the 2009 - 2011 period. (CIA)
Energy group CEZ interrupts electricity supplies to roughly 6,000 households each month due to
non-payment. Problems with non-payers are no longer growing and the firm is now looking for ways to
lower the number of debtors. During its recent expansion, CEZ also acquired small customers in Bulgaria
and Romania, where the situation is significantly worse. Roughly three quarters of households in the
Czech Republic have their electricity supplies renewed by CEZ after service is interrupted. (HN 17)

Polish BRE Bank, which holds a 50% stake in domestic factoring firm Transfinance, will make a decision about entering the Czech and Slovak markets by the end of this year. The final decision should be made by its owner, German Commerzbank. The mBanka business model that BRE would like to introduce in the Czech Republic is one with a bank without branches. (CIA)

Citibank had denied information published by the media on Friday that its clients fell victim to fraudulent emails. According to GM Javed Kureishi, Citibank has no record of attacks on client accounts and none of its clients have suffered any financial losses. (CIA, Pravo 3)

Some Raiffeisenbank products are already available to the clients of eBanka, which the domestic branch of Austrian bank recently acquired. eBanka clients can now acquire a Raiffeisenbank credit card. The banks are planning to gradually offer all products at the branches of both banks. (HN 17)

The likelihood that the roughly 200,000 clients of 3 bankrupt banks - Union Banka, Plzenska Banka, and Kreditni Banka Plzen - and the PPF group will be compensated in December continues to diminish. The three-month deferral requested by the Deposit Insurance Fund was allegedly supported by an overwhelming majority within the central bank. (HN 17)

Media group CME will request a more than 10% increase in advertising prices on television Nova, which it controls, for next year. CME argues that these prices have not increased in the past five years. According to agencies buying advertising time, the increase should total between 15 and 25 %. According to the estimates of media agency OMD, firms will spend CZK 9.44 bln on television ads this year. (MfD B1)

Agriculture Minister Milena Vicenova intends to replace 5 of the 9 members of the board of trustees of state-owned forest management firm Lesy CR. She commented that the board should be less political with more lawyers and economists present. The Minister's consultant, Roman Sindler, has allegedly also been addressed. The Minister's external consultant, Jiri Jiranek, and agricultural engineer Radek Boska could also be appointed to the board. (HN 19)

Liberec-based Elmarco delivered a contract for the American military last week. The firm delivered a line for the development of nanofiber materials. Nanopeautics, a joint firm with Irish pharmaceutical firm Alltracel, will begin delivering bandages with nanofibers to the market at the beginning of next year. This material should also be implemented as sound insulation in automobiles. It is currently being tested by Skoda Auto. (MfD B2)
Transport firm ICOM Transport has announced a public tender for the delivery of 600 coach buses within
5 years. The buses are to fulfill the Euro 5 emission norm. The expected value of the contract is EUR 75
mln not including VAT (roughly CZK 2.1 bln). Offers must be submitted by 27 December. (CIA)

BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will impose on Wednesday its second largest cartel fine ever against Shell , Dow Chemical , Eni , Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil, a Commission draft document showed.

TD
The document did not specify the level of the  fines on the oil and chemical firms for  fixing  prices of
synthetic rubber, used mainly in tyre production. The Commission declined to comment.

According to the draft seen by Reuters on Tuesday, Germany's Bayer will not have to pay a  fine because it was the first company to inform the EU executive about the  cartel.

The highest  cartel fine the Commission has set by sector was 790.5 million euros ($1.04 billion) on a vitamin industry case in 2001. The second highest was 478.3 million euros, on a  cartel in the plasterboard industry in 2002.

"The statements from Bayer were to a large extent confirmed by the statements given by Dow. At a later stage, Shell also admitted to having participated in the  cartel," the draft document said.
It said Dow's  fine was reduced because of the information it gave but although Shell admitted
participating in the  cartel, its information did not add much value to the Commission's investigation and so
it did not get any reduction.

Shell's  fine, as well as Eni's, was increased from what it would have been under the Commission's normal calculations because it was a repeat offender.
The Commission slapped a 108 million-euro  fine on Shell in September for  fixing  prices of bitumen in the
Netherlands. It also  fined 13 other firms.
The document said the companies met to fix prices between 1996 and 2002.

"The cartel meetings took place in various cities (Milan, Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague and London, among others)," it said.

"During these meetings the participants agreed prices and exchanged information on key customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them."

HD         EU Fines Five Cos EUR519 For Fixing Rubber Prices

LP
Corrected Nov. 29, 2006 07:12 ET (12:12 GMT) [ 29-11-06 1205GMT ]

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices. [ 29-11-06 1217GMT ]

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based petrochemical company Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European   Commission's attention, the Commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the Commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future. [ 29-11-06 1302GMT ]
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. Eni, which will bear the brunt of the  fines, declined comment.
The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing. [ 29-11-06 1331GMT ]

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European   Commission's attention, the commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future.
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said.
In an official statement, Eni and its subsidiary Polimeri Europa said they "reject the European              
commission's charges and reserve the right to appeal".

In the statement, Eni argues that Eni shouldn't be held responsible for its subsidiary's actions. Also, according to Eni, the  fines are "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer."

The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing.

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices.

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.

Shell and Bayer both declined comment. Neither Unipetrol or Trade-Stomil could be reached as of press time.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Bayer AG has escaped a potential 204 mln euro ($268.6 mln) fine by bringing a rubber cartel to the attention of the  European Commission (EC), Bayer reported on November 28, 2006.

The EC fined the remaining participants in the  cartel: Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Italian Eni SpA, U.S. chemical company Dow Chemical Co., Czech petrochemical group Unipetrol AS and Trade-Stomil. The companies were fined a total 519 mln euro ($683.5 mln) for  fixing  the price of  synthetic rubber, a spokesman for EC competition protection authority, Neelie Kroes, said.

TD
According to EC, the subsidiaries of Eni, Shell, Dow Chemical, Unipetrol, Trade-Stomil and Bayer had been involved in the illegal  cartel at least from 1996 to 2002.
The fine is the second-largest EC has ever imposed on a group of companies running a  cartel.

The fine punishes the oil refiners and chemical producers for  fixing  prices and sharing customers for certain types of  synthetic rubber, primarily used for tyre producing, shoe soles, golf balls and floor coverings.

HD             European commission burns rubber cartel with £350m fine

2.30pm: Shell and Italy's Eni among companies penalised by the  European commission for fixing
the price of  synthetic rubber over a period of at least six years. By David Gow in Brussels.

The European commission today stepped up its campaign to stamp out cartels by imposing its second-highest fine - €519m (£350m) - on five companies for  fixing  the price of  synthetic rubber over a period of at least six years.

TD
Anglo-Dutch petrochemical group Shell was  fined €161m while Italian industrial group Eni will have to pay out the highest penalty, €272.3m.
But German group Bayer, which blew the whistle on the  cartel in 2002, escaped a €204m  fine under
EU immunity rules.

The penalties on Shell and Eni (as well as Bayer) were increased by half because of repeat offences under the commission's new get-tough policy; they had already been condemned for cartels in polypropylene, PVC and citric acid.

Shell, which admitted to taking part in the  cartel between at least 1996 and 2002, did not qualify for leniency because its information was insufficiently valuable.
But US chemicals group Dow, the second company to blow the whistle, saw its  fine cut by 40% to
€64.6m.
Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said: "Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and
innovation of European companies."

She added: "The commission has imposed high fines in this case but, if companies continue to indulge in cartel activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in future."
The scale of today's  fines, officials said, reflects the size of the relevant market and brings the EU
total so far this year to €1.84bn - the highest level since 2001.

Synthetic rubber is used primarily to make tyres but is also used in the production of other goods such as shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls.

The commission, which seized documents during dawn raids on the six companies involved, said the firms had met in Milan, Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague and London and agreed prices, exchanged information on key customers and fixed the amount of  synthetic rubber applied to them.
It imposed its highest  fine - €791m - on companies in the vitamin sector five years ago.

Brussels, Nov 29 (CTK) - The European Commission today fined Czech oil group Unipetrol EUR17.5 million (almost Kc0.5bn) for a cartel comprising its rubber-making unit Kaucuk Kralupy, the EC told reporters.
The other companies  fined by the EC are Britain's Shell, US Dow Chemical, Italy's Eni and
Poland's Trade-Stomil. The total  fine is EUR519 million.

This is the second highest  fine that the EC has imposed in its history. The EC punished the companies for a cartel which it said lasted from 1996 to 2002 on the market in  synthetic rubber which is used mainly for tyre production.

This is a big market and therefore the  fine is so high, EC spokesman Jonathan Todd told journalists today.

The highest  fine that the EC imposed for a  cartel agreement was in 2001. It concerned vitamin preparations. The  fine stood at EUR790.5m (Kc22bn).

The other companies fined by the EC are Britain's Shell, US Dow Chemical, Italy's Eni and Poland's
Trade-Stomil. The total fine is EUR519 million.

Ceska sporitelna economist Petr Zahradnik said for public Czech radio station Radio 1-Radiozurnal today that the verdict had to be confirmed by the European Court of Justice. In dozens of cases, this court has overturned the EC's verdicts, he said.

A potential  fine would complicate the sale of Kaucuk Kralupy which Unipetrol wants to complete by the end of the year, CRo said.

This is the second highest  fine that the EC has imposed in its history. The EC punished the companies for a cartel which it said lasted from 1996 to 2002 on the market in  synthetic rubber which is used mainly for tyre production.

adds statement by Unipetrol in paras 2-3

Brussels, Nov 29 (CTK) - The European Commission today fined Czech oil group Unipetrol EUR17.5 million (almost Kc0.5bn) for a cartel comprising its rubber-making unit Kaucuk Kralupy, the EC told reporters.

TD
The other companies fined by the EC are Britain's Shell, US Dow Chemical, Italy's Eni and Poland's
Trade-Stomil. The total fine is EUR519 million.

"We disagree with the  fine", Unipetrol spokeswoman Michaela Lagronova told CTK this evening adding that the company's lawyers are considering steps to be taken.

Lagronova said the company could for example appeal to the court of first instance in Luxembourg. She also pointed to the fact that the  fine concerned the period 1996 to 2002.

Ceska sporitelna economist Petr Zahradnik said for public Czech radio station Radio 1-Radiozurnal today that the verdict had to be confirmed by the European Court of Justice. In dozens of cases, this court has overturned the EC's verdicts, he said.

A potential  fine would complicate the sale of Kaucuk Kralupy which Unipetrol wants to complete by the end of the year, CRo said.

This is the second highest  fine that the EC has imposed in its history. The EC punished the companies for a cartel which it said lasted from 1996 to 2002 on the market in  synthetic rubber which is used mainly for tyre production.

This is a big market and therefore the  fine is so high, EC spokesman Jonathan Todd told journalists today.
Kaucuk has strictly rejected the  fine.

"We have cooperated with the Commission and adjusted our activities to be able to fulfil all economic competition rules. The sum is huge, we will most probably appeal," said Kaucuk's spokesman Rene Keller.

Keller would not give further comments, he only said that the company's management would meet with lawyers late in the afternoon. They should recommend how to act further, he said.

The highest  fine that the EC imposed for a  cartel agreement was in 2001. It concerned vitamin preparations. The  fine stood at EUR790.5m (Kc22bn).

For the first time in its modern history, Czech Airlines (CSA) will rent one of its charter fleet airplanes abroad for the entire winter season. It is specifically an Airbus A321, which will be used in Great Britain and Ireland. The loss-incurring transporter has lost a lucrative contract it had with travel agency CK Fischer - it has started flying with competitor Travel Service. CSA also moved another aircraft to Switzerland for a shorter period - from roughly the middle of November to the middle of December. The firm did not comment on how much money the rentals would generate. (HN 16)

Italian firm Grandi Stazioni has secured all the necessary permits and can begin reconstruction of Ceske Drahy's main railway station in Prague. Construction work is scheduled to begin on 14 December. Work will take five years - the railway station and the metro station will remain fully operational. The investment is worth roughly CZK 1 bln, roughly 50 % of this total will be financed through Zivnostenska Banka and the other half will come from GS' own funds. The work will be undertaken by Metrostav. (CIA, HN 5)

Today the  European Commission will levy the second largest fine in its history. It will be levied on several firms that agreed to create a cartel on the synthetic rubber market. Those punished include Czech firm Unipetrol. The amounts of the fines to be imposed on individual firms are as of yet unknown. The highest  fine levied to date totaled EUR 790.5 mln (roughly CZK 22 bln). (HN 15)

Czech online store Internet Mall placed 30th on the list of the 500 fastest growing high-tech firms in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East assembled by Deloitte. Internet Mall placed third among European firms. The revenues of the firm that is active not only in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary saw its revenues increase by 3,945 % in the past five years, they exceeded CZK 1 bln last year. (HN 15)

Development group ECM has purchased the headquarters of CCS Ceska Spolecnost Pro Platebni Karty in Prague's Liben. ECM rented the largest building right back to CCS for a period of seven years. The entire transaction was worth EUR 9.18 mln (CZK 257 mln). The headquarters include more than 5,000 m2 of office space. (HN 16)

In the initial phase, Telefonica O2 Slovakia, in which Telefonica O2 Czech Republic owns 100 %, will partially offer its mobile services in the network of Slovak T-Mobile. The two firms have signed a national roaming agreement. Telefonica O2 Slovakia will launch commercial operations of its mobile network in the first quarter of next year. According to the firm the potential penetration rate in Slovakia could reach that of the Czech Republic, roughly 115 %, in the next two to three years. (CIA)

The Bonatrans plant for the production of railway wheelsets in Bohumin, which belongs to entrepreneur Karel Komarek, has penetrated the Hong Kong market. Following two years of negotiations, the firm has secured a contract for the delivery of roughly 2,000 metro car wheels worth almost CZK 100 mln. Deliveries will take place in the 2007 - 2009 period. (HN 16)
The revenues of Ferromet Group, the fourth largest steel group in the Czech Republic, totaled CZK 5.2
bln in the first nine months of this year. Revenues had totaled CZK 4 bln for all of 2005. The group did not
post its profits, but those of last year had totaled CZK 81 mln. (HN 16)

Telecoms firm GTS Novera expects its 2007 revenues to be similar to this year's, i.e. roughly CZK 6 bln. With an almost 15 % share of the market following its acquisitions of Contactel, Nextra, and Telenor

Networks, the firm is now the second largest supplier on the fixed telecoms operator market in terms of revenues. First-placed Telefonica O2 Czech Republic has an almost 70% share. (CIA)

Next year Ceska Televize's (CT) advertising income should fall by roughly 26 %. The amount of time allocated to advertisements, currently 1 % of total airtime, is being reduced by half starting in January. CT's budget for this year expected advertising income to total CZK 1.049 bln, the 2007 drop should thus total roughly CZK 270 mln. (LN 16)

Telefonica O2 Czech Republic has 10,000 IPTV customers. The number of such customers has thus increased by 50 % in the past month. Telefonica O2 launched its IPTV service, which is currently available to roughly 1 million telephone lines using the ADSL 2+ Internet technology, on 1 September. (CIA, HN 16)

The chairman of the board of directors and general manager of CSOB Asset Management, Josef Benes, has been elected the chairman of the Association of Funds and Asset Management of the Czech Republic (AFAM CR). One of his goals is to merge the two domestic associations, AFAM CR and the Czech Capital Market Association (AKAT). (CIA)

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (CIA) - The  European Commission fined today five companies EUR 519 mln for forming a cartel, which was setting prices and dividing market with some kinds of  synthetic rubber. Czech Unipetrol was  fined EUR 17.55 mln (CZK 490 mln), according to the press department of EC.

The cartel applied to rubber type BR and ESBR, which are used for the production of tyres, floor covers, and golf balls. According to EC, the  cartel operated at least in years 1996 - 2002. The highest fine was imposed on Italian refinery concern ENI - EUR 272.25 mln.  Fines were imposed also on Shell (nearly EUR 161 mln), American Dow (EUR 64.6 mln), and Polish Trade-Stomil (EUR 3.8 mln).

TD
The investigation was prompted by applications for leniency lodged by Bayer in December 2002. Bayer received full immunity from fines under the Commissionĺs leniency programme. Dow has also admitted its participation in the cartel agreement and EC reduced its original  fine by 40 percent.

EUR519 million for  fixing synthetic rubber prices. [ 11-29-06 0717ET ]

U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based petrochemical company Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European Commission's attention, the Commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its  fine reduced by 40% for helping the Commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future. [ 11-29-06 0802ET ]
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. Eni, which will bear the brunt of the  fines, declined comment.
The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and
2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing. [ 11-29-06 0831ET ]

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the
cartel lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

cartel lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices. [ 11-29-06 0717ET ]

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based petrochemical company Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European    Commission's attention, the Commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the Commission with its investigation.
"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality
and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future. [ 11-29-06 0802ET ]
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. Eni, which will bear the brunt of the  fines, declined comment.
The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing. [ 11-29-06 0831ET ]

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

In the statement, Eni argues that Eni shouldn't be held responsible for its subsidiary's actions. Also, according to Eni, the  fines are "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer."

Shell and Bayer both declined comment. Neither Unipetrol or Trade-Stomil could be reached as of press time.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

(This updates an item published at 1524 GMT, with additional company comment and analysis.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices.

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European   Commission's attention, the commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future.
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said.

In an official statement, Eni and its subsidiary Polimeri Europa said they "reject the  European               Commission's charges and reserve the right to appeal".

In the statement, Eni argues that Eni shouldn't be held responsible for its subsidiary's actions. Also, according to Eni, the  fines are "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer."

The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing.

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.

Shell and Bayer both declined comment. Neither Unipetrol or Trade-Stomil could be reached as of press time.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

BRUSSELS, Nov 29, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Commission said Wednesday it had fined five companies 519 million euros (683 million dollars) for running a cartel in the market for synthetic rubber.

TD
The European Union's antitrust watchdog said the  fine, the second biggest it has ever made against a
cartel, targeted Eni, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil.
Bayer also participated in the  cartel, which operated from at least 1996 to 2002, but was not  fined
because the German company revealed the  cartel to regulators.

The commission accused the companies of breaking EU law by  fixing  prices and sharing customers for some types of  synthetic rubber used for the production of tyres as well as other consumer goods.
"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation
of European companies," she added.
"The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel
activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future."

HD      EU turns anti-cartel crusade to rubber market with huge fine

BRUSSELS, Nov 29, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Union's top competition regulator Neelie Kroes stepped up her anti-cartel campaign on Wednesday by hitting five companies in the  rubber market with the EU's second-highest  fine against a cartel.

TD
The European Commission slapped a fine of 519 million euros (683 million dollars) on Eni of Italy, Shell of The Netherlands, Dow of the United States, Unipetrol of the Czech Republic and Trade-Stomil of Poland.

The commission accused the companies of breaking EU competition law by agreeing on prices and sharing customers for some types of  synthetic rubber used for tyres and other consumer goods like shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls.
Bayer also participated in the  cartel, which operated from at least 1996 to 2002, but was not  fined
because the German company tipped off regulators.

The overall penalty was second only to a 790.5 million euro  fine that the commission imposed on vitamin makers in a landmark 2001 anti-cartel ruling.
"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," Competition Commissioner Kroes said.

"They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies," she added.

The Dutch commissioner has made cracking down on cartels a top priority this year and has targeted about 10 of them, nearly double last year's figure.

Bayer, which received immunity from  fines after tipping off EU authorities, would itself have faced a heavy fine if the cartel had been otherwise discovered, because it has been found guilty for participating in other cartels in the past.

Eni and Shell are also repeat offenders and as a result were slapped with the most painful penalties, receiving 272,250,000 euros and 160,875,000 euros in  fines respectively.
In reaction, Eni rejected the charges and  fine and said it reserved its right to appeal before the European
Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

The group said that "this application of the antitrust regulations is without precedent in  European             Commission rulings".
Meanwhile, a Shell spokeswoman in London said: "Shell has constantly and fully cooperated with the
European Commission investigation."
"We need to study the decision in detail before we can comment and respond further," she added.

Kroes said she would not hesitate to lift the  fines if the companies ignored her ruling against them.
"The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel
activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future," she said.

Wednesday's penalty brings the total amount the commission has  fined in cartel cases this year to 1.843 billion euros, an annual record for EU regulators.

In addition to the  rubber case, the commission has so far  fined cartels in the markets for steel beams, copper fittings, bitumen in The Netherlands, acrylic glass and hydrogen peroxide.

HD     EU fines companies €519 million for illegal rubber cartel

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission fined five oil refiners and chemical producers
€519 million (US$682 million) on Wednesday -- the second-largest  fine ever in a cartel case -- for fixing
the price of  synthetic rubber used to make tires.

Italy's Eni SpA must pay the largest  fine -- €272 million (US$357.6 million) -- while Royal Dutch Shell PLC will have to cough up €160.8 million (US$211 million). Both saw their individual  fines hiked by half for it being a repeat offense.

TD
Bayer AG blew the whistle to EU regulators that the companies were  fixing  prices and sharing
information on customers for certain types of  synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion
styrene butadiene rubber from 1996 to 2002. It got full immunity, escaping a potential €204 million
(US$268 million) fine.

Dow Chemical Co. was  fined €64.5 million (US$84.8 million), getting a 40 percent reduction for supplying regulators with information confirming Bayer's claims. Shell also admitted it was part of the  cartel at a late stage -- but too little and too late to win a lesser  fine.

Czech refiner Unipetrol AS was ordered to pay €17.5 million (US$23 million) and Poland's Trade-Stomil was fined €3.8 million (US$5 million).

"The fines are so high because it's a large market and several of the companies are repeat offenders," said EU spokesman Jonathan Todd.
Regulators said the  cartel agreements were made before or after companies met for talks with a
synthetic rubber industry group in Milan, Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague and London among others.

"During these meetings the participants agreed prices and exchanged information on key customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them," they said.

EU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes said in a statement that cartels struck "at the heart of healthy economic activity."

Eni said the EU was wrong to hold it responsible for the actions of its unit Polimeri Europe, claiming the fine was "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" and saying it would consider appealing the  fine to the EU courts. The behavior at stake -- secret deals with rivals -- would "in no way" have hurt the final consumer, it said.

Customers for the  rubber are tire manufacturers Michelin SA, Pirelli & C. SpA and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., as well as other companies that make shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls. All the cartel players made emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber but butadiene  rubber was only produced by Eni, Bayer, Shell and Dow, the Commission said.

The largest  cartel fine to date charged to a group of companies is a 2001 ruling that  fined eight pharmaceutical makers -- including Roche Holding AG and BASF AG -- €790 million (US$1.04 billion) for fixing  vitamin prices.

HD     EU Fines Dow, Four Others

Dow was among the industrial giants caught by Europen regulators in a price-fixing  scheme.

The European Commission fined five companies a total of $682 million for  fixing  the price of  synthetic rubber used to make tires, including U.S.-based Dow Chemical, according to the Associated Press. The other four companies were Royal Dutch Shell plc, Eni SpA, Unipetrol AS and Trade-Stomil, according to the report.

TD
The fine was the second-largest ever levied on a group of companies running a  cartel, noted the wire service. The five companies are being punished for  fixing  prices and sharing customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber from 1996 to
2002, added AP.

Bayer AG initially blew the whistle on the scheme, so it received full immunity from EU regulators, said the report. Italy's Eni and British-Dutch oil company Shell, on the other hand, had their  fines raised by half because they are repeat offenders.

Dow was fined $84.8 million. What’s more, it received a 40 percent reduction for supplying regulators with information confirming Bayer's claims. Interestingly, this is consistent with the policy of U.S. regulators,
who have recently rewarded targets of probes for cooperating. "The  fines are so high because it's a large market and several of the companies are repeat offenders," EU spokesman Jonathan Todd told the AP.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices. [ 11-29-06 0717ET ]

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based petrochemical company Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European   Commission's attention, the Commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the Commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future. [ 11-29-06 0802ET ]
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. Eni, which will bear the brunt of the  fines, declined comment.
The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing. [ 11-29-06 0831ET ]

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

In the statement, Eni argues that Eni shouldn't be held responsible for its subsidiary's actions. Also, according to Eni, the  fines are "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer."

HD     UPDATE 3-EU fines rubber cartel 519 mln euros

(Adds Shell, Eni statements, lawyer comment, details)

BRUSSELS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The  European Commission imposed its second-largest cartel fine ever on Wednesday -- 519 million euros ($685 million) -- on five companies for  fixing  prices of synthetic rubber used to make tyres and other products.

TD
The size of the  fine reflects the EU executive's growing crackdown on cartels, and Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes vowed to dish out even higher penalties if companies continued to break antitrust law by  fixing  prices.

The Commission fined Eni of Italy 272.3 million euros, the second-highest penalty ever against an individual firm. It fined British/Dutch oil major Shell 160.9 million euros -- the eighth-largest  cartel penalty on a company.
Dow Chemical of the United States received a fine of 64.6 million euros. Czech firm Unipetrol ,
majority-owned by Polish refiner PKN Orlen , was fined 17.6 million euros, and Poland's Trade-Stomil 3.8
million euros.
Germany's Bayer had its  fine -- of 204 million euros -- waived because it was the original whistleblower. "The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel
activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future," Kroes said in a statement.

She has fined companies a record 1.84 billion euros for cartel activities so far this year, and had already imposed four top-10  cartel fines in 2006. The highest cartel fine to date is 790.5 million euros, for a vitamin industry case in 2001.
DENIALS, APPEALS
The rubber cartel, lasting between at least 1996 and 2002, fixed prices for butadiene  rubber and
emulsion styrene butadiene rubber mainly bought by tyre makers such as Michelin , Pirelli and Goodyear ,
the Commission said.

Eni, whose unit Polimeri Europa was investigated, rejected the Commission's decision and said it reserved its right to appeal.

"The EU Commission decision involves Eni as parent company of Polimeri Europa, and -- with no factual evidence -- presumes Eni to be guilty for the conduct of its subsidiaries," it said in a statement.

"Eni believes that this application of the antitrust regulations is without precedent in  European                   Commission rulings."

A competition lawyer, who is not involved in the case and asked not to be identified, said that in the past the Commission has had to show the parent firm had some involvement -- either by knowing of the infringement, encouraging it or through the involvement of one of the parent's directors.

Shell said it needed to study the decision before it could comment, while Bayer said it could not comment yet because it had no written statement on the decision.

Unipetrol's unit Kaucuk, probed by the Commission, said it did not believe it was part of a  cartel, adding that it would release a further statement after consulting with lawyers.

Trade-Stomil's deputy CEO, Piotr Mlodawski, said his company did not agree with the decision and would probably appeal, although it first wanted to analyse the ruling.
Shares in the companies were little changed. PRESSURE ON CARTELS
Kroes has ratcheted up pressure on cartels, kick-starting a debate among the Commission, national regulators and policymakers on making price-fixers compensate the victims of their actions.

She also drew up new guidelines on how the Commission calculates  fines, with the aim of raising penalties in general and especially punishing repeat offenders.

The fines for this cartel fell under the old rules -- as the Commission's investigation started before a stipulated date -- and one Commission official said they would have been much higher had they been calculated under the new rules.

As it was, Dow's  fine was reduced because it gave the Commission some information. But, although Shell admitted participating in the  cartel, its information added little value to the investigation so it received no reduction.

In fact, Shell's  fine, as well as Eni's, was increased from what it would have been under the Commission's normal calculations because of repeat offences.

The European Commission has imposed a fine totalling EUR 519 M on five companies for price-fixing in synthetic rubber. The companies in question belong to Eni Spa, Bayer AG, Shell, Dow Chemical, Unipetrol, and Trade-Stomil. Bayer escaped a  fine because it was first to blow the whistle.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Wednesday  fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic rubber prices. [ 11-29-06 0717ET ]

TD
U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based petrochemical company Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European   Commission's attention, the Commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the Commission with its investigation.
"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality
and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future. [ 11-29-06 0802ET ]
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. Eni, which will bear the brunt of the  fines, declined comment.
The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing. [ 11-29-06 0831ET ]

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

The European Union Wednesday fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic 
rubber prices.

U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Germany's Bayer AG (BAY) escaped a EUR204.2 million  fine by bringing the cartel to the European  Commission's attention, the commission said. Dow Chemical also saw its fine reduced by 40% for helping the commission with its investigation.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Europe's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
Kroes warned if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities they can expect even higher  fines
from the European executive body in the future.
Eni and Shell both saw higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said.
In an official statement, Eni and its subsidiary Polimeri Europa said they "reject the European             
commission's charges and reserve the right to appeal".

In the statement, Eni argues that Eni shouldn't be held responsible for its subsidiary's actions. Also, according to Eni, the  fines are "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer."

The fines represent the second-largest ever on a group of companies running a cartel. Along with fixing  prices, the companies also conspired to share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber known as butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, between 1996 and 2002. These rubbers are mainly used in tire manufacturing.

Dow said it may appeal the  fine, but said it will only decide once it has received written notification of the commission's decision.
The companies have up to two months to appeal the  fines.
The amounts of the  fines were based on the size of the market for the products, how long the  cartel
lasted and the size of each of the firms involved, the commission said.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.
Over the past several years, the commission has been intensifying its efforts to curb price  fixing.

The European Union Wednesday fined five companies a total of EUR519 million for fixing synthetic

U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) will be  fined EUR64.6 million; Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) EUR160.9 million; Czech Republic-based Unipetrol AS (BAAUNIPE.PR) EUR17.6 million; Italy-based Eni SpA (E) EUR272.3 million and Polish-based Trade-Stomil EUR3.8 million.

Though the commission said that the large  fines should help to prevent future cartels, the amount is small compared with the total revenues of the companies involved. For instance, Eni's EUR272.3 million makes up less than 0.4% of the company's 2005 total revenue of EUR73.7 billion.

Including the  rubber cartel fines, the commission has  fined companies a total of EUR1.84 billion for price fixing  so far this year.

HD      EC fines five companies for butadiene  rubber price fixing

The European Commission has fined five companies a total of Eur519 million ($674 million) for participating in a cartel to fix prices and share customers for butadiene  rubber (BR) and emulsion styrene butadiene rubber (ESBR), the Commission announced in a press release Wednesday.

The companies fined were Eni (Eur272.3 million), Shell (Eur160.8 million), Dow (Eur64.5 million), Unipetrol (Eur17.5 million) and Trade-Stomil (3.8 million). Bayer was also in breach but had received full immunity from its  fine (Eur204.1 million) as it was the first company to reveal the  cartel to the Commission.

TD
The EC said these five companies operated the  cartel from at least 1996 to 2002 and were in violation of
Article 81 of the EC Treaty's ban on restrictive business practices.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity. They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies. The Commission has imposed high fines in this case but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities, then they
can expect their fines to be even higher in the future," said EC Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Indeed, the Commission said that it had increased the  fines by 50% for Eni, Shell and Bayer because "they were repeat offenders they had already been condemned by the Commission for cartels in the polypropylene, PVC and citric acid sectors."
The EC said its investigation was prompted by applications for leniency lodged by Bayer in December
2002 and January 2003, leading Bayer to receive full immunity from  fines under the Commission's
leniency program. In March 2003, the Commission carried out an unannounced inspection at Dow, which
subsequently applied for leniency.

The overall fine was the second highest imposed by the Commission in a  cartel case and brings the total amount of cartel fines imposed this year to Eur1.843 billion - a new annual record for the Commission.

Synthetic rubbers BR and ESBR are extensively used for the production of tires as well as for the production of other consumer goods. The main customers for BR and ESBR are the major tire producers (such as Bridgestone Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear). Other customers for BR and ESBR are producers of various types of consumer goods such as shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls. While ESBR was produced or traded by all companies  fined by the EC, BR was only produced by Eni, Bayer, Shell and Dow.

HD      EU hits rubber cartel members with 519 mln euros in fines

BRUSSELS, Nov 29, 2006 (AFP) -
The European Commission said Wednesday it had fined five companies a total of 519 million euros
(683 million dollars) for running a  cartel in the market for synthetic rubber.

TD
The European Union's antitrust watchdog said the  fine, the second biggest it has ever levied against a
cartel, targeted Eni, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil.
Bayer also participated in the  cartel, which operated from at least 1996 to 2002, but was not  fined
because the German company tipped off regulators.

The commission accused the companies of breaking EU law by  fixing  prices and sharing customers for some types of  synthetic rubber used for tyres as well as other consumer goods like shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls.
"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation
of European companies," she added.
"The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel
activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future."

Bayer, which received immunity from  fines after tipping off EU authorities, would itself have faced a heavy fine if the cartel had been otherwise discovered, because it has been found guilty for participating in other cartels in the past.

Eni and Shell are also repeat offenders and as a result were slapped with the most painful penalties, receiving 272,250,000 euros and 160,875,000 euros in  fines respectively.

Kroes has made cracking down on cartels a top priority this year and has targeted about 10 of them, nearly double last year's figure.

Wednesday's penalty brings the total amount the commission has  fined in cartel cases this year to 1.843 billion euros, an annual record for EU regulators.

HD      CARTELS : 519 MILLION EURO FINE FOR SYNTHETIC RUBBER CARTEL WC     496 words

Six companies belonging to the industrial groups ENI, Bayer, Shell, Dow and Unipetrol have been  fined a total of €519 million for taking part in a  cartel in the synthetic rubber sector.

Italy's Eni received the highest  fine of €272,250,000; Shell Netherlands was fined €160,875,000; Unipetrol of the Czech Republic and Poland's Trade-Stomil received smaller fines of €17,550,000 and
€3,800,000, respectively. US firm Dow, after a leniency reduction, was  fined €65,575,000 and Bayer received full immunity.

TD
Fines on ENI and Shell were increased because of their previous involvement in  cartel activity. The European Commission's practice of viewing prior  cartel participation as an aggravating factor' when calculating fines is currently under challenge in the EU Court of Justice by French company Danone. Although a final judgement has not been given, the advocate-general's opinion, given in mid-November, stated that it is legitimate for the Commission to impose increased  fines on repeat cartel offenders (see Europolitics 3192).

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that "Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity. The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future".

The combined fines are the second highest ever imposed by the Commission, bringing the annual total to a new high of €1.843 billion. All  cartel fines are returned to the Community purse.

The materials in question, butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, are used to produce tyres for companies such as Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear and also to make consumer goods as diverse as soles for shoes, floor coverings and golf balls.

The Commission's investigation, kicked off by surprise inspections on Dow's premises in March 2003, found evidence that the companies met in various European cities to agree prices and exchange information on the quantities of orders placed by key customers. The meetings carried on for at least six years from 1996 to 2002.

As often happens in such big  cartel cases, the Commission was first alerted by one of the parties involved: Bayer gave details of the illicit meetings to the Commission in late 2002. Under EU leniency rules, a participant in a  cartel can be granted full immunity from a  fine if they are the first to blow the whistle.

Bayer, therefore, received full immunity and Dow, the second firm to come forward with further information, was given partial 40% immunity.

The EU is currently working on proposals to encourage victims of such cartels to bring damages actions. Not only will this compensate victims, but it will serve as a deterrent and an effective enforcement tool. In this case, therefore, customers of the companies involved could sue for their losses and if the infringements are particularly grave, the amounts awarded can be doubled.

Chemical and energy groups including Shell, Dow, Eni and Bayer were yesterday punished for operating a price-fixing cartel in the market for synthetic rubber, a ruling that triggered the second highest fine yet imposed by the European Commission.

The six members of the cartel were fined a total of Euros 519.1m (Dollars 682.4m), a sum bettered only by the Euros 790.5m fine imposed on a vitamins  cartel more than five years ago. Yesterday's decision means 2006 will be a record year for  cartel fines imposed by the Brussels regulator, taking the total to Euros 1.84bn.

TD
Fines in cartel cases have risen dramatically in recent years, especially for repeat offenders and companies that fail to co-operate fully with investigators.

Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, has been keen to deter future offenders by ramping up the financial pain for  cartel members.
"The Commission has imposed high fines in this case but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel
activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher still," she said.

Eni, the Italian energy group, was hit hardest, receiving a  fine of Euros 272.3m, followed by Shell with Euros 160.9m and Dow, the US group, with Euros 64.6m. Czech group Unipetrol was ordered to pay Euros 17.6m, and Trade-Stomil of Poland Euros 3.8m.
Bayer received immunity from punishment for blowing the whistle on the agreement, escaping what the
Commission said would have been a  fine worth Euros 204.2m.

The Commission said the  cartel lasted at least from 1996 to 2002 and covered two types of  synthetic   rubber - butadine rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber. The materials are used for producing tyres and a range of consumer goods.

The regulator added that the  cartel agreements were struck before or after meetings of an industry association in cities across the EU. "During these meetings the participants agreed prices and exchanged information about key customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them," the Commission said.

Eni said it rejected the Commission's allegations, and reserved its right to appeal. The Italian group said the fines were "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" since the  cartel had not harmed consumers.

Company officials at Unipetrol and Trade Stomil also rejected the ruling, according to Reuters news agency.

The European Commission fined five oil refiners and chemical producers about $682-million (U.S.) yesterday, saying they fixed the price of  synthetic rubber used to make tires. A sixth company that had alerted authorities escaped a  fine. It was the second-largest  fine ever in an EU cartel case. The largest was a fine of €790-million ($1.18-billion Canadian) levied in 2001 against eight pharmaceutical makers for fixing  vitamin prices. The companies ordered to pay  fines were Italy's Eni SpA, Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, Dow Chemical Co., Czech refiner Unipetrol AS and Poland's Trade-Stomil. Bayer AG
told regulators the companies were  fixing  prices and sharing information on customers.

The European Commission yesterday stepped up its campaign to stamp out cartels by imposing its second-highest fine - euros 519m (pounds 350m) - on five companies for  fixing  the price of  synthetic  rubber for at least six years. Anglo-Dutch petrochemical group Shell, which admitted taking part in the cartel, was fined euros 161m, while Italian industrial group Eni was  fined euros 272.3m. German group Bayer, which blew the whistle on the  cartel in 2002, escaped a euros 204m  fine under EU immunity rules. US chemicals group Dow, the second company to blow the whistle, had its  fine cut by 40% to euros 64.6m. David Gow

The European Commission has fined five leading rubber producers a total of EUR 519 M. This is the second largest fine in the commission's history. Bayer, which was part of the  cartel, escaped a fine be because it informed the authorities; it would otherwise have received a  fine of EUR 204 M. The other companies were Italy's ENI, Shell, Dow Chemical, Unipetrol, and Poland's Trade-Stomil. They are said to have fixed prices and shared out customers between themselves in certain types of  synthetic rubber. Eni received the largest  fine at EUR 272.3 M, and Shell the second largest at EUR 160.9 M.

Italy's Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, and Czech Unipetrol were among five firms  fined a total of €519 million ($680 million) by the European Commission on Wednesday for operating a price-fixing  cartel on sales of synthetic rubber. A sixth firm, Germany's Bayer, was let off a €204.2 million fine after cooperating fully with authorities in their investigations.

The fines for Eni, Shell and Bayer were increased by 50% because they were repeat offenders, having already been condemned by the commission for cartels in the polypropylene, PVC and citric acid sectors. In the end Eni was  fined €272.25 million, Shell €160.87 million, and Unipetrol €17.55 million. The commission said Shell admitted its role, but did not qualify for a rebate on its  fine.

TD
The overall fine is the second highest imposed by the commission in a  cartel case, and takes total cartel fines imposed this year to a new annual record of just over €1.84 billion.  Synthetic rubber is chiefly used by major tire producers, but is also used in sports goods and floor coverings.

Eni said later it rejected the commission's charges and reserved the right to appeal. It said the alleged offences took place between 1995 and 2002.

HD          EU Fines Chemical Companies  for Fixing Prices on Synthetic Rubber

European regulators, in slapping five chemical companies with a near-record  fine for rubber
price-fixing,  also exposed what defense lawyers call an increasing problem: the inability in Europe to
plea-bargain with antitrust offenders.

The European Union yesterday fined five companies a total of 519 million euros ($685 million) for fixing prices in Europe on synthetic rubber used to produce tires, shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls. The  fine was second to a 2001 price-fixing  fine of 790.5 million euros against vitamin makers.

TD
Dow Chemical Co. was ordered to pay 64.6 million euros, Royal Dutch Shell PLC 160.9 million euros, Czech Republic petrochemical company Unipetrol AS 17.6 million euros, Italy's Eni SpA 272.3 million euros and Poland's Trade-Stomil 3.8 million euros. Germany's Bayer AG escaped a 204.2 million euro fine by bringing the cartel to investigators' attention, according to the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Dow Chemical also saw its  fine reduced by 40% for helping the commission with its investigation.

Eni and Shell both received higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. In a statement, Eni called the  fines "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" because the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer." Eni added that it rejects the charges and may appeal. The companies have two months to appeal.

Shell also cooperated with investigators, according to a commission statement, but investigators didn't consider the information it provided valuable enough to warrant a  fine reduction. Shell declined to comment. "It's difficult when companies assist an investigation in the hope they will get a substantial fine reduction," said Julian Joshua, a former EU  cartel enforcer now in private law practice. "They provide the commission with a lot of information and essentially deprive themselves of the chance of a defense, and in return they get nothing."

This month, an analysis by the American Bar Association's antitrust section criticized Europe for considering changes the ABA says would discourage companies from coming forward with incriminating evidence of price  fixing.

Under the current program, the first company to make a statement that a price-fixing  scheme is taking place can apply to receive full immunity from  fines in Europe, with the expectation the company will fill in the details later. Under the proposed changes, the EU would require the company to give a full account of the  cartel, including the names of executives who participated and the products and markets affected, upon initial approach.

The European Commission (EC) imposed a 17.55 mln euro ($23 mln)  fine on Czech oil and petrochemicals company Unipetrol, 63 pct-owned by Polish oil group Polski Koncern Naftowy (PKN) Orlen, for participating in a  cartel to fix prices of  synthetic rubber, the EC said on November 29, 2006.

The Commission fined five European sector companies, Anglo-Dutch oil group Royal Dutch Shell Plc, U.S. chemical company Dow Chemical Co., Italian Eni SpA and Polish Stomil Sanok with a total of 519 mln euro ($683 mln), which is the second highest  fine imposed by the EC in a  cartel case. The biggest fine of 790.5 mln euro ($1.04 bln), set by the EC for participating in a  cartel, was imposed to vitamin producers in 2001.

TD
German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Bayer AG does not have to pay its 204 mln euro ($268 mln) fine, because it received full immunity for having been the first company to reveal the  cartel to the Commission. Eni will face the biggest  fine of 272.2 mln euro ($358 mln), while Royal Dutch Shell and Dow Chemical Co will have to pay 161 mln euro ($212 mln) and 65 mln euro ($85.5 mln)  fine, respectively. Stomil Sanok has the lowest  fine of 3.8 mln euro ($5.0 mln).

Mortgage lending rose in October by its largest amount in three years and approvals for new loans also stood at their highest since late 2003. The Bank of England said that mortgage lending rose by Pounds
9.8 billion, the biggest rise since September 2003. Loan approvals rose to 128,000 from 127,000, the highest since December 2003.

Bank of England Rachel Lomax, one of the Bank of England's deputy governors, told the Western Mail that meeting 12 times a year to set interest rates was "over the top". Ms Lomax, who voted against the quarter-point rate rise earlier this month, said she saw no need for the increase, but that her fellow dissenter David Blanchflower had a more pessimistic view of the economy. Page 59 French public deficit The  European Commission recommended that European Union nations drop their action against France over its public deficit level, as excessive overspending had been convincingly corrected. The Commission said the French public deficit had fallen to 2.9 per cent of output in 2005 and was projected to keep falling in 2006 and 2007.

The US economy grew faster than first thought in the third quarter on strong business investment, as the housing sector reported its biggest decline in more than 15 years.

1.8 per cent gain. Sales of new US homes fell by 3.2 per cent in October.
The dollar was pressed in morning trading in London, pushing the pound to a new two-year high of
$1.9545, close to the $1.9550 level last seen when the pound was forced out of the European

government data showed shrinking supplies of crude, gasoline and heating oil. Light sweet crude for

* Five groups pay Euro 519m penalty
* Whistle-blower Bayer is spared  fine

TD
The European Commission has taken a record Euro 1.843 billion (Pounds 1.24 billion) in antitrust fines so far this year after imposing a Euro 519 million penalty yesterday on five groups of companies for operating a  synthetic rubber cartel.

With at least one more major anti-competition decision to be taken this year, the Commission's clampdown on illegal cartels looks set to top Euro 2 billion for 2006, overtaking the previous record of Euro 1.837 billion set in 2001. The total does not include separate action for abuses of dominant position
-the Commission's charge against Microsoft over its Windows operating system.
The penalties, which are paid into the European Union budget, demonstrate the determination of Neelie
Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, to tackle illegal behaviour.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," Ms Kroes said. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."
The fines are the second-highest that the Commission has levied in a  cartel case.
They were imposed on Bayer, of Germany, Dow, of the United States, Eni, of Italy, Shell, of the
Netherlands, Unipetrol, of the Czech Republic, and Trade-Stomil, of Poland, for price-  fixing  and
sharing customers between 1996 and 2002 in a  synthetic rubber market worth Euro 550 million a year.
Their products are used by customers such as Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear to make tyres, shoe soles
and golf balls. The inquiry was launched after Bayer contacted the Commission at the end of 2002,
applying for leniency and offering information on the arrangements. Inspectors found that  cartel
agreements were made after meetings of the European  Synthetic Rubber Association.

"During these meetings the participants agreed prices and exchanged information on key customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them," the Commission said. It also noted that any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive behaviour could apply to national courts for damages.

Under the Commission's leniency programme, Bayer received full immunity from the Euro 204,187,500 fine that it would have had to pay. Dow also co-operated, cutting its  fine by 40 per cent. Penalties on Eni and Shell were increased by 50 per cent because they were repeat offenders.

Ford has said that 38,000 of its unionised workers have agreed to take voluntary redundancy as part of a plan to transform the struggling business.

The carmaker is seeking to cut its US workforce by up to 30,000 staff by 2008 and has offered unionised staff a number of voluntary severance deals. About 46% of United Auto Workers (UAW) union affiliated staff at Ford have now accepted one of these offers.

Wolseley reports strong growth

THE world's largest supplier of plumbing and heating products soothed worries over US trading by reporting further strong growth in the UK.

Wolseley, which owns the Build Center and Plumb Center chains, said it still expected progress over the current financial year, but added that the first half would be the most challenging as a result of a slowing US house market.
In the UK and Ireland, Wolseley said it had seen double-digit revenues growth in the three months to
October 31. However, Wolseley said margins in the UK were slightly lower.
US economy figures revised

THE US economy appears to have coped with a housing slowdown better that expected in the three months to September 30, according to revised figures from the Commerce Department. It now says the US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2% in the third quarter of 2006, compared to its initial calculation of 1.6%.
Companies fined for price-fixing
THE European Commission has fined five oil and chemical companies £519m for price-fixing.

Italy's Eni faces the largest  fine, £183m, while Royal Dutch Shell was fined £108.6m. The EU imposed the fine after learning that five firms were  fixing  the price of synthetic rubber used for tyres.
Dollar recovers against euro

THE dollar has recovered from 20-month lows against the euro ( boosted by a surprisingly large upward revision to US economic growth.

With new figures showing the US economy expanded by a healthy 2.2% in the third quarter of 2006, the dollar gained against the euro to $1.316.

Earlier in the day it had fallen as low as $1.32 after a fall in both the price of US goods and consumer confidence.

Five oil refiners and chemical producers have been fined US$682 million as part of a probe by the European Commission into the price fixing  of synthetic rubber, reports Associated Press Newswires. Of the companies involved Eni SPA was fined 272 million euro (US$357.6 million), Royal Dutch Shell ordered to pay 160.8 million euro, Dow Chemical will pay a penalty of 64.5 million euro, and Unipetrol AS and Trade-Stomil will pay 17.5 million and 3.8 million euro respectively. Another manufacturer involved in the cartel, Bayer, escaped prosecution for bringing the ring to the attention of the Commission, whilst Eni's and Royal Dutch Shell's  fines were raised due to repeat offences.

TD
A spokesperson for the European Union (EU) said that "The  fines are so high because it's a large market and several of the companies are repeat offenders."Significance: Between 1996 and 2002, the group of companies fixed prices and shared customer information on butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, used to produce tyres, as well as other  rubber goods. Amongst the customers for the material were Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear.

ADVERTISING/MARKETING: Some Boston cabs carry high-tech ads

What do you get when you cross a Boston taxicab with a 32-inch liquid-crystal television set? A rolling billboard that can fetch up to $1,750 a month from advertisers --- and, by tuning into navigation satellites, beam a different ad based on what neighborhood or even what street a cab's driving down. Clear Channel Taxi Media, a division of the Texas radio and billboard advertising conglomerate, has outfitted about 20 Boston cabs with what it calls "LCD Digital Smart Tops," the next leap forward from
black-and-white digital banners.

AUTOMOTIVE: Nissan to produce Versa in Mexico

Nashville --- Nissan Motor Co. will begin producing its Versa subcompact car at a second plant in Mexico next year, the company announced Wednesday. The Versa, which is also called the Tiida in international markets, will be exported from Mexico to the United States. The Japanese automaker's Cuernavaca facility will join Nissan Mexicana's other plant in Aguascalientes in making the Versa. Strong demand for the Versa in the U.S. market has led to low inventories since the model was introduced in June, Nissan said in a news release. "Versa's success in the United States and Nissan Mexicana's commitment have given us a great opportunity to add Cuernavaca's craftsmanship and quality to the project," said Shoichi Miyatani, president and general director of Nissan Mexicana.
DEALS: Houghton Mifflin agrees to buyout

LEGAL: Gates may testify once in Iowa case

The company has denied the allegations. In a ruling filed Wednesday, Polk County District Court Judge Scott Rosenberg said that Gates and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer must testify only once.

EC issues fines for rubber price-fixing

The European Commission fined five oil refiners and chemical producers about $682 million on Wednesday, saying they fixed the price of synthetic rubber used to make tires. A sixth company that had alerted authorities escaped a  fine. "The fines are so high because it's a large market and several of the companies are repeat offenders," said European Union spokesman Jonathan Todd. It was the second-largest fine ever in an EU cartel case. The largest  fine of 790 million euros was levied in 2001 against eight pharmaceutical makers including Roche Holding AG and BASF AG for  fixing  vitamin prices.
Partial settlement in Scrushy case

Birmingham --- Fired HealthSouth Corp. Chief Executive Richard Scrushy and the rehabilitation company have settled key claims concerning his multimillion-dollar bonuses during a $2.7 billion fraud and the
legal bills he paid during his subsequent prosecution, which ended in an acquittal. Neither HealthSouth nor an aide to Scrushy would reveal exact terms of the agreement, which they disclosed Wednesday. But HealthSouth General Counsel John Whittington said the agreement resolved both the company's claim seeking about $48 million in bonuses Scrushy received during the fraud and a competing suit Scrushy filed in Delaware seeking some $21 million in attorneys' fees from the company. Still unresolved are HealthSouth's claims that Scrushy wrongly profited during the fraud, and Scrushy's accusation that HealthSouth violated his contract by firing him after the scheme was revealed. "The rest of the lawsuit is still going forward," said Whittington.
MANUFACTURING: Mittal Steel must sell one U.S. mill

The Department of Justice on Wednesday gave Mittal Steel Co. until Jan. 28 to decide which U.S. mill it will sell to settle antitrust issues over its merger with rival Arcelor SA, a union official said. Mittal had planned to sell Canada's Dofasco Inc. as part of its merger with Arcelor, but an independent trust controlling Dofasco said earlier this month it would not allow the sale. That forces a choice between the other tin assets, the former Weirton Steel Corp. in West Virginia's Northern Panhandle or the Sparrows Point mill in Maryland.
RETAIL: Initial online sales beat expectations

Online retailers had a better-than-expected start to the holiday season, according to one Internet research firm that tracks online sales. ComScore Networks Inc. reported Wednesday that online sales rose 26 percent to $608 million on Monday from the same day a year ago. "Cyber Monday" marks the first major spike in spending during the holiday season as people return to work and click onto their computers.

TELECOM: Cingular to offer new Pearl handset

Cingular Wireless on Friday plans to start offering a new handset called the BlackBerry Pearl. Until now, the Pearl has been offered exclusively by a smaller rival in the cellphone business, T-Mobile. Cingular's addition of the Pearl gives the carrier another device capable of handling everything from voice calls to
e-mail to entertainment. Cingular's version of the Pearl also has push-to-talk service. Like the recently

Nokia chief: Net boon for industry

Helsinki, Finland --- Nokia Corp. predicted Wednesday that there will be 4 billion mobile subscriptions globally in 2010, saying the Internet is boosting industry growth faster than expected. "Mobile communications is once again changing even faster than many of us have predicted, and we are still far away from this being a mature market," Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said at a conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

New Orleans --- Phone bills in Louisiana can be used to collect money for a fund to subsidize service to poor and rural customers, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. It ruled that the money is a fee, not a tax, and that the state Public Service Commission may impose it.
TRANSPORTATION: American Airlines, pilots squabble

American Airlines has rebuffed a demand by its pilots' union to immediately negotiate terms of the carrier's proposed service between Dallas and China. Union leaders want concessions on pay for canceled flights and other items in exchange for supporting the airline's bid for the China route.
Italy's Alitalia looks for partner

Rome --- Integrating Italy's Alitalia SPA into a big international group is its only hope for survival, the company's chief executive said Wednesday. Potential partners that have been suggested for the struggling, state-controlled airline include Air France-KLM SA, Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Thai Airways International PCL, Air China and Emirates Airlines.
UTILITIES / ENERGY: Oil prices back above $62 a barrel

HD        Unipetrol says may appeal against EU cartel fine

PRAGUE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Czech oil and petrochemicals company Unipetrol said on Thursday it might appeal against the 17.6-million-euro fine it received from the  European Commission as a result of a cartel investigation in synthetic rubber.

The European Union's executive body imposed its second-largest cartel fine ever on Wednesday -- 519 million euros ($685 million) -- on five companies for  fixing  prices of synthetic rubber used to make
tyres and other products.

TD
"We disagree with the  fine," Unipetrol said in a statement. "We will use all means of legal defence." Unipetrol, majority controlled by Polish refiner PKN Orlen , said its laywers were looking into the possibility of appealing to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
Analysts said the  cartel fine news could hit Unipetrol's shares when the market opens on Thursday. "The fine is approximately one and a half months profit of Unipetrol ... A slight negative reaction could
be expected in the stock price," Tamas Pletser, Erste Bank analyst, said in a morning report to investors.

The Commission had said there was a  rubber cartel, lasting between at least 1996 and 2002, which fixed prices for butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber mainly bought by tyre makers such as Michelin , Pirelli and Goodyear .

The size of the  fine reflects the EU executive's growing crackdown on suspected cartels, with Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes vowing to issue even higher penalties if companies continued to break antitrust law by  fixing  prices.

The European Commission imposed fines of about $682 million (U.S.) yesterday against five companies it said had fixed prices on synthetic rubber used in tires. Those  fined a total of 519 million euros included Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Eni SPA, Dow Chemical Co., Unipetrol AS and Trade-Stomil. A sixth company, Bayer AG, avoided a  fine after blowing the whistle to European Union regulators. The  fine punishes the oil refiners and chemical producers for  fixing  prices and sharing customers for certain types of synthetic rubber.

TD
European regulators, in slapping five chemical companies with a near-record  fine for rubber
price-fixing,  also exposed what defense lawyers call an increasing problem: the inability in Europe to
plea-bargain with antitrust offenders.

The European Union yesterday fined five companies a total of 519 million euros ($685 million) for  fixing prices in Europe on synthetic rubber used to produce tires, shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls. The fine was second to a 2001 price-fixing  fine of 790.5 million euros against vitamin makers.

Dow Chemical Co. was ordered to pay 64.6 million euros, Royal Dutch Shell PLC 160.9 million euros, Czech Republic petrochemical company Unipetrol AS 17.6 million euros, Italy's Eni SpA 272.3 million euros and Poland's Trade-Stomil 3.8 million euros. Germany's Bayer AG escaped a 204.2 million euro fine by bringing the cartel to investigators' attention, according to the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Dow Chemical also saw its  fine reduced by 40% for helping the commission with its investigation.

Eni and Shell both received higher individual  fines for being repeat offenders, the commission said. In a statement, Eni called the  fines "entirely disproportionate and unjustified" because the  rubber cartel "could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer." Eni added that it rejects the charges and may appeal. The companies have two months to appeal.

Shell also cooperated with investigators, according to a commission statement, but investigators didn't consider the information it provided valuable enough to warrant a  fine reduction. Shell declined to comment. "It's difficult when companies assist an investigation in the hope they will get a substantial fine reduction," said Julian Joshua, a former EU  cartel enforcer now in private law practice. "They provide the commission with a lot of information and essentially deprive themselves of the chance of a defense, and in return they get nothing."

This month, an analysis by the American Bar Association's antitrust section criticized Europe for considering changes the ABA says would discourage companies from coming forward with incriminating evidence of price fixing.

Under the current program, the first company to make a statement that a price-fixing  scheme is taking place can apply to receive full immunity from  fines in Europe, with the expectation the company will fill in the details later. Under the proposed changes, the EU would require the company to give a full
account of the  cartel, including the names of executives who participated and the products and markets affected, upon initial approach.

HD      Rubber barons'  $772M fine bounces  EU to record:  Total penalties  to enrich European Union coffers  by at least $2.63B this year

LONDON

LONDON - The  European Commission has taken a record $2.75 billion U.S. in antitrust  fines so far this year after imposing a $772-million penalty yesterday on five groups of companies for operating a synthetic rubber cartel.

TD
With at least one more major anti-competition decision to be made this year, the commission's clampdown on illegal cartels looks likely to top $2.63 billion for 2006, overtaking the previous record of $2.416 billion set in 2001. The total does not include separate action for abuses of dominant position -- the
commission's charge against Microsoft over its Windows operating system.
The penalties, which are paid into the European Union budget, demonstrate the determination of Neelie
Kroes, the competition commissioner, to tackle illegal behaviour.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," Ms. Kroes said. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies."

The fines are the second-highest that the commission has levied in a  cartel case. They were imposed on Bayer of Germany, Dow of the United States, Eni of Italy, Shell of the Netherlands, Unipetrol of the Czech Republic, and Trade-Stomil of Poland, for price-fixing  and sharing customers between 1996 and 2002 in
a synthetic rubber market worth $723 million U.S. a year. Their products are used by customers such as
Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear to make tires, shoe soles and golf balls.

The inquiry was launched after Bayer contacted the commission at the end of 2002, applying for leniency and offering information on the arrangements. Inspectors found that  cartel agreements were made after meetings of the European  Synthetic Rubber Association.

"During these meetings the participants agreed on prices and exchanged information on key customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them," the commission said. It also noted that any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive behaviour could apply to national courts for damages.

Under the commission's leniency program, Bayer received full immunity from the $268,514,286  fine that it would have had to pay. Dow also co-operated, cutting its  fine by 40 per cent. Penalties on Eni and Shell were increased by 50 per cent because they were repeat offenders.

Poland’s biggest downstream oil concern PKN Orlen signed two agreements on credits totalling EUR
1.6bn with a consortium of 8 Polish and foreign banks in order to muster financing for the pending
takeover of Lithuania’s sole refinery in Mazeikiu, the firm said in a communiqué. PKN Orlen also plans to
offer at least EUR 800mn of 7- to 10-year eurobond issue in H1/2007 so as to replace the 1-year credit
which is part of the EUR 1.6bn financing, Orlen’s deputy CEO Pawel Szymanski told journalists. The
concern plans to wind up the purchase of Mazeikiu this December. The consortium includes: ABN AMRO
Bank NV, Bank Handlowy, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, ING Bank NV/ ING Bank
Slaski, KBC BANK NV/ Kredyt Bank, Société Générale SA in Poland and UniCredit Group. On the basis of
the agreement signed in May, PKN Orlen is to buy 53.7% shares in Mazeikiu for around USD 1.492bn.

Moreover, PKN Orlen will buy 30.66% shares from the Lithuanian government for USD 852bn and will receive a 3-year option to buy a further 10% in the refinery for around USD 278mn.

EconMin: Polish energy sector needs PLN 60bn in investment in 10 years. The Polish energy sector needs around PLN 60bn in investment outlays in the next 10 years, announced deputy economy minister Tomasz Wilczak on Wednesday. The most, approximately PLN 30bn is needed to build around 8,000 MW of new power. He added that it was essential to replace old power, of which 74% is over 20 years old. This would cost PLN 20bn, he estimates. According to him, Poland will also need investments of over PLN
10bn in the grid over the coming years. He stressed that investments would only be possible after consolidation of the sector in Poland. The government plans to set up four new energy concerns from a number of companies still in the state hands.

Energy group PGE to be launched with PLN 25bn revenue, PLN 1.5bn profit. The energy group Polska Grupa Energetyczna, which is to come into being by the end of the year on the basis of Polish power grid PSE, the power plant and coal mining concern BOT, 8 distribution companies and the power plant group ZEDO, will have a profit of around PLN 1.5bn on revenue of PLN 25.0bn on the day of its consolidation, PSE's CEO Jacek Socha announced on Wednesday. Socha reported that the created group would have an installed power of 12,000 MW, and net production of 52.5 TWh. The new group's assets will amount to PLN 38.5bn. The new entity will invest an average annual PLM 3bn over the coming 10 years. PSE's CEO also said the transfer of all the separate companies which are to create PGE, into a special company, would be concluded by the end of 2006. The separation of the property of the transport system operator to a new one-man State Treasury company is planned for mid-2007. The treasury ministry announced in August that PGE's public offer would take place in 2008.
EC fines Unipetrol from PKN Orlen's group EUR 17.55mn for participation in  cartel. The Czech
chemical-fuel concern Unipetrol, belonging to Poland's largest downstream oil company PKN Orlen group,
has been fined by the European Commission EUR 17.55mn, along with 4 other companie, for
participation in a cartel to fix prices and share customers for certain types of  synthetic rubber, according
to the Commission's report, which  fined the firms a total of EUR 519mn. "Companies belonging to the
groups Eni, Bayer, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil operated the  cartel from at least 1996 to
2002," the EC's Wednesday communiqué reads.

Meat firm PKM Duda expects to exceed 2006 forecasts, to invest in Ukraine. The meat company Polski
Koncern Miesny Duda expects to exceed the recently revised financial forecasts, assuming profit of PLN
48-50mn, on revenue of PLN 1bn in 2006. The company has announced further takeovers in the fresh and
cooked meat distribution sector and the takeover of a large player on the Ukrainian market. In the next few
months, Duda plans to finalise several transactions, including the takeover of a large player with a similar
profile of activity to PKN Duda's in Ukraine. It can allocate around PLN 40-60mn to this end. It is possible
the transaction to take place still this December. The company also wants to earmark PLN 35-40mn on
the purchase and modernisation of farms. Duda wants to have 5-6 of it own farms in Ukraine and is aiming

Page 125 of 160 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
to breed up to 250,000 pigs. Plans include taking over the whole production chain, which will allow the margins to be maximised. In Q1-Q3, the Duda group posted net profit of PLN 37.2mn on sales of PLN
757.1mn.

TP SA to separate voice services from internet access as of Feb 15. The fixed-line telecom operator Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TP SA) will offer a separate service of broadband internet access – neostrada as of Feb 15, 2007, the Electronic Communications Office (UKE) announced, referring to a letter from TP SA's CEO to the head of the telecom watchdog, in which he made such a declaration. Orders for separate services and cancellations of voice services will be accepted from mid-January. An additional charge is to be made for maintaining the Neostrada connection, but it will be lower than the telephone subscription. Currently, it is not possible to be a user of neostrada, if you do not pay the TP SA telephone subscription fee of a minimum of PLN 49.61 plus VAT. The UKE  fined TP SA PLN 100mn in September for linking their service for internet access to their telephone service without being entitled to do so. The Office threatened TP SA with another  fine, if the services were not separated at the beginning of 2007.

Jeronimo Martins mulls entering pharmacy market; to invest PLN 500-600mn in 2007. Jeronimo Martins, the owner of the discount food-store chain Biedronka, has announced that in 2007 the level of investment will be similar to that in 2006, when it amounted to PLN 500-600mn. At the same time, the company has announced that perhaps towards the end of this year, a pharmacy will be opened, as a test. Jeronimo Martins Dystrybucja's general director Pedro Pereira da Silva also upheld announcements that the company did not rule out entering the Warsaw bourse.

(ČIA, Nov 29, HN-1, 18, Nov 30) On Wednesday the European Commission has levied fines on five companies for forming a  cartel. That set prices and divided the synthetic rubber market. A fine totaling EUR 17.55 mln (CZK 490 mln) has been levied on Czech Unipetrol because its firm Kaučuk took part in the catrel.According to the EC, the  cartel was functional from 1996 to 2002. The  fine, which totals EUR
519 mln, will also be "shared" by Italian refinery concern ENI (EUR 272.25 mln), supranational concern Shell (EUR 161 mln), American Dow (EUR 64.6 mln), and Polish Trade-Stomil (3.8 mln). The sanction could be complicated by the forthcoming sale of Kaucuk to Polish firm Dwory, which is controlled by Polish concern PKN Orlen just like Unipetrol. Unipetrol intends to take action against the  fine and is considering appealing it at the court in Luxembourg.

TD
(HN-16, Nov 27) Dariusz Marzec was appointed the new vice-president of the Unipetrol board of directors last Monday. This former board member is undertaking the position from Marek Mroczkowski, whom the holding's supervisory board dismissed from all functions at the end of October. Marzec, who joined the management board last year, has so far been responsible for investment activities.

(CIA, Nov 27) According to a study by Central European Capital and Cekia, Unipetrol has the lowest market value added (MVA) of all domestic companies listed at the stock exchange. The holding's MVA totals CZK -1.3 bln. The study also points out to the long-term negative amount of the group's economic value added (EVA). Last year Unipetrol's EVA reached CZK -2.61 bln.

(Euro-23, Nov 27) Unipetrol, which intends to raise its existing 51% stake in Ceska Rafinerska by buying more shares from U.S.-based company ConocoPhillips, is unable to supply crude oil to Ceska Rafinerska at lower prices than Russian Lukoil, according to financial company Atlantik FT. Atlantik FT would therefore regard balancing the concern's bid by Unipetrol as overestimation of the stake price. Lukoil is supposedly willing to spend roughly CZK 4.4 bln for ConocoPhillips' stake.

(Pravo-16, Nov 29) The Finance Ministry has exchanged the Cepro supervisory board during a general meeting on 23 November. Mojmir Hampl, who was to become a member of the management body, was later appointed to the Czech National Bank's council by the Czech President.

HD         EC fines five companies for butadiene  rubber price fixing

LP
The European Commission has fined five companies a total of Eur519 million ($674 million) for participating in a cartel to fix prices and share customers for butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene rubber, the Commission said November 29.

The companies fined were Eni (Eur272.3 million), Shell (Eur160.8 million), Dow (Eur64.5 million), Unipetrol (Eur17.5 million) and Trade-Stomil (3.8 million). Bayer was also in breach but had received full immunity from its  fine (Eur204.1 million) as it was the first company to reveal the  cartel to the Commission.

TD
The EC said these five companies operated the  cartel from at least 1996 to 2002 and were in violation of Article 81 of the EC Treaty's ban on restrictive business practices.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity. They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies. The Commission has imposed high fines in this case but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future," said EC Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Indeed, the Commission said that it had increased the  fines by 50% for Eni, Shell and Bayer because "they were repeat offenders they had already been condemned by the Commission for cartels in the polypropylene, PVC and citric acid sectors."
The EC said its investigation was prompted by applications for leniency lodged by Bayer in December
2002 and January 2003, leading Bayer to receive full immunity from  fines under the Commission's
leniency program. In March 2003, the Commission carried out an unannounced inspection at Dow,
which subsequently applied for leniency.

The overall fine was the second highest imposed by the Commission in a  cartel case and brings the total amount of cartel fines imposed this year to Eur1.843 billion - a new annual record for the Commission.

Eni and subsidiary Polimeri Europa rejected the  European Commission's finding. "The EU Commission decision involves Eni as parent company of Polimeri Europa, and with no factual evidence presumes Eni to be guilty for the conduct of its subsidiaries. Eni believes that this application of the antitrust regulations is without precedent in  European Commission rulings and attributes liability purely on the basis of corporate control," ENI said in a press statement in response to the  European                 Commission's findings.

Eni said it reserves the right to appeal its  fine of Euro 272.25 million, "holding that there are no factual and legal grounds for attributing liability to the parent company, which has never been involved, nor could have been involved, in the ordinary conduct of the businesses in question."

"Eni believes, furthermore, that the sanctions imposed are entirely disproportionate and unjustified, in relation both to the gravity of the companies conduct even as reconstructed by the  European                Commission and to the fact that such conduct could in no way have had a negative effect on the end consumer," the company added.

Meanwhile Dow said it had not yet received the decision in writing. "Once we have officially been served the decision, we will carefully review and analyze it and thereafter determine whether we will accept or appeal it," the company said November 29, adding that "the official appeal period is two months upon receipt of the notification."

Synthetic rubbers BR and ESBR are extensively used for the production of tires as well as for the production of other consumer goods. The main customers for BR and ESBR are the major tire
producers (such as Bridgestone Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear). Other customers for BR and ESBR are producers of various types of consumer goods such as shoe soles, floor coverings and golf balls. While ESBR was produced or traded by all companies  fined by the EC, BR was only produced by Eni, Bayer, Shell and Dow.

Brussels, 29/11/2006 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission imposed fines totalling €519 million on five groups of companies for taking part in a cartel to fix prices and share customers for some kinds of synthetic rubber (particularly for motor car tyres) in violation of the ban on this type of practice provided for in the EC Treaty (Article 81). Companies belonging to the Eni, Bayer, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol and
Trade-Stomil operated the  cartel from 1996 to 2002 at least. Bayer (Germany), although a repeat offender, was granted a 100% reduction in its share of the  fine for having informed the Commission, and Dow was granted a 40% reduction for its cooperation. The facts justify such a fine, the highest for five years (and only exceeded once, by the €791 million  fine imposed on the vitamins cartel in 2001), because of the length of time it lasted and the importance of the market, said Jonathan Tod, spokesman for the Competition Commissioner.

HD     EU to put brakes on talks with Turkey

After the failure of talks on Cyprus organized by the current Finnish presidency of the EU, Turkey has been warned that without progress on the issue it is risking the suspension of negotiations with the EU.

As is widely known, Turkey is refusing to open its ports to Greek Cypriot ships despite the fact that this was one of the most pressing requests of the EU besides modification of Turkish regulations on freedom of the press and other serious concerns.

TD
Turkey opposes any linkage between EU negotiations and the question of Cyprus. Ali Babacan, the economy minister heading the Turkish negotiation team with the EU, has stressed that his country tried before to settle the dispute but was rejected by Greek Cypriots. He observed that while the EU did not wait for Cyprus to solve the problem before that country entered the EU in 2004, it now considers the question one of crucial importance.

In Turkey recent events and statements from various European countries appear to be making the public lose faith and support for possible EU accession. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan referred to the planned suspension of talks as simply unacceptable for his country.

Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner for enlargement, has proposed not to open further detailed membership talks with Turkey on eight of a total 35 policy areas. Foreign ministers of the member states will have the chance to reach a decision on the issue at their meeting on Dec. 11.
Commission fines rubber
producers €519 million

Last week the European Commission imposed the second biggest fine ever at one time on six groups of companies of the synthetic rubber industry that were found guilty of fixing  prices in a cartel, in contravention of EU rules.

Acting as the competition authority, commissioners made a long investigation to collect data about companies belonging to the groups Eni SpA (Italy), Bayer AG (Germany), Royal Dutch Shell (the Netherlands), Dow Chemical Co. (U.S.), Unipetrol (Czech Republic), and Trade-Stomil (Poland), which operated a cartel from at least 1996 to 2002. The  cartel agreed to restrict business practices and fixed the price of synthetic rubber, the basic component of tyres as well as shoe soles and floor coverings.

Although the EC reduced the  fines in the case of Bayer (100% reduction) and Dow (40%) as a consequence of their cooperating with the commission, the €519 million total  fines are added to this year’s annual record of  fines now amounting to €1.843 billion. The biggest groups have several affiliated companies operating in Hungary, in the gas sector, oil retail or petrochemicals.
Council of Ministers finds reforms still a little slow
Innovation, employment and integrated electricity and gas markets are keys to establishing a competitive
EU, according to European economy and finance ministers who gathered together last week in Brussels.


Page 132 of 160 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The conclusions they reached about the oft-cited Lisbon Strategy at first seem encouraging, but again concrete actions are missing. The Council of Ministers reviewed the national reform programs of the
EU-25 countries for the 2005–2008 period aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the bloc, and found that countries recognized the need for reform and had made progress. Despite the rejoicing, however, the EU is still very far from reaching its 70% target for employment across the continent, or its target for R&D spending of 3% of GDP.

Ministers did agree, however, that during the updating of broad economic policy guidelines early next year, where the framework will be set for economic policy coordination in the EU, country-specific recommendations would be worked out by the  European Commission and the member states.

The treasury ministry does not rule out the consolidation of the chemical companies Ciech and Zaklady Chemiczne Police, although at present such an option is not being considered, according to statements made on Friday by treasury minister Wojciech Jasinski. Ciech has declared interest in capital involvement in Police on many occasions - Ciech's CEO Miroslaw Kochalski upheld it in the first half of November.

transferred to KW last year to improve Kompania's liquidity. In July 2005 the government decided that
Kompania Weglowa would be capitalized with assets worth over PLN 900mn, including 36.68% of shares
in the chemical firm Ciech, a stake in Weglokoks and PLN 200mn in cash from the Enterprise
Restructuring Fund.

TP SA to separate voice services from internet access as of Feb 15. The fixed-line telecom operator Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TP SA) will offer a separate service of broadband internet access - neostrada as of Feb 15, 2007, the Electronic Communications Office (UKE) announced, referring to a letter from TP SA's CEO to the head of the telecom watchdog, in which he made such a declaration. Orders for separate services and cancellations of voice services will be accepted from mid-January. An additional charge is to be made for maintaining the Neostrada connection, but it will be lower than the telephone subscription.

2007. The Electronic Communications Office (UKE) decided last week that GTS Energis was to receive

PPWK Group eyes PLN 50bn revenue in 2008. The PPWK group, after taking over the mobile technologies firm EL2, wants to post over PLN 50mn in revenue in 2008 and to achieve an EBITDA margin of 20%, the publisher's representatives announced on Monday. PPWK's takeover transaction of EL2 should be concluded by April 2007. PPWK's CEO Rafal Berlinski said the rise in results would be
achieved thanks to the fact that EL2 acts in a very long-term perspective market. In the view of EL2's CEO Andrzej Zieminski, the market for added services for cell-phone telephony in Poland (e.g. higher value text messages, voice and localising services) may rise at a rate similar to Western Europe's. In Q1-Q3 PPWK posted a net profit of PLN 2.54mn versus PLN 2.19mn loss in the same period of 2005 on revenue of PLN
10.29mn versus PLN 9.53mn, respectively.

The European Commission has fined five petrochemical companies $682 million for their involvement in the price-fixing  of butadiene and styrene-butadiene  rubber from 1996-2002.

Italy's Eni S.p.A. received the biggest  fine, $358 million, followed by Royal Dutch Shell P.L.C., $212 million; Dow Chemical Co., $85 million; Poland's Trade-Stomil S.p. z.o.o., $23 million; and the
Czech Republic's Unipetrol A.S., $5 million.

TD
Germany's Bayer A.G., the world's largest SR producer during the time of the investigation, blew the whistle on the activity in 2002 and received full immunity from EC regulators as a result, thereby avoiding a fine of up to $269 million. Bayer since has spun off its SR activities into Lanxess A.G.

"Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "They undermine competition, raise prices for consumers and reduce the diversity, quality and innovation of European companies. The commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if
companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future."

The EC said it based its decision on evidence gathered from documents, corporate statements and witness interviews provided by the leniency applicants, together with meeting notes discovered by the commission during on-site inspections.
The cartel agreements were made before or after the official meetings concerning BR and emulsion
SBR of the European  Synthetic Rubber Association in various European cities, the EC said.
During these meetings, the participants agreed on prices and exchanged information on key
customers and the amounts of  synthetic rubber supplied to them.

The EC considers these practices a "very serious infringement" of EC Treaty competition rules banning cartels and restrictive business practices. In  fixing  the fines, the commission took into account the size of the European market for the products the duration of the  cartel and the size of the firms involved.

The commission said it increased the  fines for Eni, Shell and Bayer by 50 percent because they were repeat offenders, since they already had been condemned by the commission for cartels in the polypropylene, PVC and citric acid sectors. Dow's  fine was reduced by 40 percent in return for its voluntary participation in the investigation.

The commission's action opens the door for persons or firms affected by the accused companies' actions to seek damages through the courts of the European Union's member states, the EC said.

The accused companies have a right to appeal the decision to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

The European Commission has imposed an overall fine of EUR 519 M on 5 groups for their part in a price-fixing  cartel affecting certain types of synthetic rubber (butadiene rubber, and emulsion styrene butadiene rubber). The companies  fined were Bayer, Dow, Eni, Shell, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil. Eni was fined EUR 272 M, Shell EUR 160 M and Bayer EUR 204 M. Bayer was granted immunity for having been the first to disclose the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and Dow's  fine has been cut by
40% to EUR 64.5 M. Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil were fined EUR 17.5 M and EUR 3.8 M respectively. This fine is the second largest ever imposed by the European Commission for price-fixing.

HD      EU soon to impose 660 mln euros in cartel fines

BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will impose 660 million euros ($879 million)
in cartel fines over the next seven weeks, a top official at the EU executive said on Tuesday.

Competition Director General Philip Lowe's announcement, made at a conference for lawyers, underscored moves by the Commission to impose increasingly tough  fines against cartels.

TD
"There are five or six decisions in the queue and some will only come out in January," he said after his speech at the conference, sponsored by consultant CRA International.

The EU's executive arm this year has already levied a record 1.843 billion euros in  cartel fines. The most recent was 519 million euros imposed late last month in a  synthetic rubber case, the second-highest Commission cartel fine on record.
Lowe said he expected to exceed 2 billion euros by year's end, with roughly another 500 million in
January.

Those likely to be  fined include some members of an elevator  cartel, two sources familiar with the case said.
The Commission raided several elevator manufacturers in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg in 2004. The companies involved in that  cartel case include Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United
States, ThyssenKrupp of Germany, Schindler of Switzerland and Kone of Finland.

When the firms were raided, they said they would cooperate with the Commission but denied wrongdoing.

Rubber companies Eni, Bayer, Shell, Dow, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil have been fined a combined EUR
519 M ($679 M) by the European Commission (EC) for operating a styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) and
emulsion styrene butadiene rubber cartel during 1996-2002. Eni, Shell, and Bayer were found to be
repeat offenders, and their fines were raised by 50%. Bayer, which was  fined EUR 204.2 M, was given
immunity for providing information on the  cartel in Dec 2002 and Jan 2003. Dow also sought immunity
and cooperated with the commission, thereby obtaining a 40% reduction in its  fine. Dow was fined EUR
64.6 M, Eni EUR 272.2 M, Shell EUR 160.9 M, Unipetrol EUR 17.5 M and Trade-Stomil EUR 3.8 M. Eni,
which denies the allegations, along with other firms intends to appeal the EC decision.

HD       Czech Republic/Poland industry: Synthetic rubber maker Kaucuk to appeal fine for cartel activity

COUNTRY BRIEFING
FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

TD
Synthetic rubber maker Kaucuk, a unit of leading local petrochemicals group Unipetrol, which is controlled by Polish oil and gas concern PKN Orlen, has been  fined €17.5m ($23.2m) by the European Commission for allegedly participating in  cartel activity aimed at price fixing  on the synthetic rubber market. As part of the anti-trust action, the Commission has also levied fines against subsidiaries controlled by Royal Dutch/Shell (Netherlands-UK), Dow Chemical (US) and ENI (Italy) totalling €519m. Chemicals major Bayer (Germany), which the Commission also alleges was involved in price-fixing activities, was granted immunity for assisting in the investigation.

Kaucuk has denied the allegations that it was involved in  cartel activity and has indicated it will appeal the decision. The  fine must first be upheld by the European Court of Justice. The other companies  fined have also denied involvement in the price  fixing cartel, which the Commission says was in operation from 1996–2002, if not longer.
Observers say the ruling could complicate the planned sale of Kaucuk to  synthetic rubber maker Dwory
(Poland) for Kc4.1bn ($194.4m).

The planned sale of Kaucuk has generated controversy since PKN Orlen acquired Unipetrol last year and subsequently broke off a questionable agreement, signed before the sale of Unipetrol was finalised, under which PKN Orlen was to sell the  synthetic rubber making unit to local fertiliser maker Agrofert at a knock-down price if PKN Orlen successfully acquired Unipetrol.

HD       New Brussels cartel amnesty comes into force Friday
BY       By David Lawsky
WC      452 words
PD       7 December 2006
ET       04:50 PM

BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Changes designed to make it easier for companies to blow the whistle on cartels in which they participate take effect on Friday, after winning approval from the  European              Commission.

"We need heavy sanctions to deter cartels and an efficient leniency policy providing incentives to report them," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement announcing the changes on Thursday.

TD
She said the changes would "offer clearer guidance for business".

The European Union executive has been levying increasingly heavy  fines and these will become even higher under guidelines announced earlier for new cases, which usually take three to four years to complete.

The Commission late last month imposed 519 million euros ($690 million) in  fines, its second-highest amount on record, against a  synthetic rubber cartel.
Director General Philip Lowe said this week that the Commission would levy another 660 million euros in
fines for five to six cases by the end of January.

The Commission has been flooded with information about cartels since it decided in 2002 to give amnesty to the first member of such a group to blow the whistle. The new approach smoothes some of the wrinkles in the earlier plan.

The system provides for "markers", which allow firms to win first place in the line immediately but give information later.

The new plan also spells out specifically what information the Commission needs. An official said that from 2002 through 2005 the Commission conditionally accepted 51 amnesty applications but rejected 23. Another 30 were pending.

The new notice makes it clear amnesty depends on high-qualify information, and corroboration is important. A second or other participant can gain  fine reduction only if they provide other information or corroboration the Commission needs to make its case.
The notice also allows a company to continue participating in a  cartel even after informing the
Commission, so other conspirators will not become suspicious and destroy evidence.

It makes clear that firms may provide information orally. That will encourage confessions without leaving a paper trail open to subpoena by private litigants who want to win damages in follow-on cases. That problem is acute in the United States.

The EU's 25 member states have agreed to a voluntary, model plan to adopt similar rules across Europe. In the two months since the member states agreed, Britain and Portugal have proposed plans for
leniency that match the EU-wide plan.

It will take time for others to come on board, an official said, adding: "We will evauluate at the end of two years."

Six companies belonging to the industrial groups ENI, Bayer, Shell, Dow and Unipetrol have been  fined a total of €519 million for taking part in a  cartel in the synthetic rubber sector.

Italy's Eni received the highest  fine of €272,250,000; Shell Netherlands was fined €160,875,000; Unipetrol of the Czech Republic and Poland's Trade-Stomil received smaller fines of €17,550,000 and
€3,800,000, respectively. US firm Dow, after a leniency reduction, was  fined €65,575,000 and Bayer received full immunity.

TD
Fines on ENI and Shell were increased because of their previous involvement in  cartel activity. The European Commission's practice of viewing prior  cartel participation as an aggravating factor' when calculating fines is currently under challenge in the EU Court of Justice by French company Danone. Although a final judgement has not been given, the advocate-general's opinion, given in mid-November, stated that it is legitimate for the Commission to impose increased  fines on repeat cartel offenders.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that "Cartels strike at the heart of healthy economic activity. The Commission has imposed high fines in this case, but if companies continue to indulge in  cartel activities, then they can expect their fines to be even higher in the future".

The combined fines are the second highest ever imposed by the Commission, bringing the annual total to a new high of €1.843 billion. All  cartel fines are returned to the Community purse.

The materials in question, butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, are used to produce tyres for companies such as Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear and also to make consumer goods as diverse as soles for shoes, floor coverings and golf balls.

The Commission's investigation, kicked off by surprise inspections on Dow's premises in March 2003, found evidence that the companies met in various European cities to agree prices and exchange information on the quantities of orders placed by key customers. The meetings carried on for at least six years from 1996 to 2002.

As often happens in such big  cartel cases, the Commission was first alerted by one of the parties involved: Bayer gave details of the illicit meetings to the Commission in late 2002. Under EU leniency rules, a participant in a  cartel can be granted full immunity from a  fine if they are the first to blow the whistle.

Bayer, therefore, received full immunity and Dow, the second firm to come forward with further information, was given partial 40% immunity.

The EU is currently working on proposals to encourage victims of such cartels to bring damages actions. Not only will this compensate victims, but it will serve as a deterrent and an effective enforcement tool. In this case, therefore, customers of the companies involved could sue for their losses and if the infringements are particularly grave, the amounts awarded can be doubled.

Fines totalling EUR 519 M have been imposed by the European Commission on six companies which participated in a  cartel in the synthetic rubber sector. The largest fine of EUR 272,250,000 was imposed on Eni, Italy, with Shell Netherlands being fined EUR 160,875,000. A fine of EUR 17,550,000 was imposed on Unipetrol, Czech Republic, and one of EUR 3,800,000 on Trade-Stomil, Poland. Full immunity was granted to Bayer because it was the first to draw attention to the cartel. Dow was granted a 40% leniency reduction because of the information it provided and was given a fine of EUR 65,575,000. Because Eni and Shell had been involved in  cartel activity previously, their fines were increase. In a case involving Danone, the European Union Court of Justice is expected to rule that the Commission may impose higher fines on companies with repeated  cartel activity.

TD
The six companies were found guilty of  fixing  prices for butadiene  rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene rubber, both used in manufacture of tyres and other consumer goods.

Not only will this compensate victims, but it will serve as a deterrent and an effective enforcement tool. In this case, therefore, customers of the companies involved could sue for their losses and if the infringements are particularly grave, the amounts awarded can be doubled.

Six of the top 10 heaviest  fines imposed by the European Commission on price-fixing  cartels involved companies that are either in the petrochemicals or chemicals industries, figures released by the Commission, Wednesday, have shown. By sector, four of the five largest  fines have been imposed on chemicals/petrochemicals companies.

Cartels are defined by the EC as "an illegal secret agreement concluded between competitors to fix prices, restrict supply and/or divide up markets." The agreement may take a wide variety of forms but often relates to sales prices or increases in such prices, restrictions on sales or production capacities, sharing out of product or geographic markets or customers, and collusion on the other commercial conditions for the sale of products or services, the EC said.

The existence of such cartels was highlighted earlier this quarter when the EC announced, November 29, its largest  fine in history of Eur519 million ($685 million using a 1.32 exchange) for five groups of companies who participated to fix prices and share customers for certain types of  synthetic rubber, butadiene rubber and emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber markets.

The companies that were  fined were Bayer, Dow, Eni, Shell, Unipetrol and Trade-Stomil. Bayer had its fine wiped out and Dow's reduced by 40% for co-operation with the investigation. This left Eni facing the second largest fine in EC's history, in any sector, of Eur272.25 million. Eni has denied the claims and has reserved the right to appeal the decision.

As well as these  fines on synthetic rubber cartel, five of the other largest 10  fines were meted out to BASF (Eur237 million in 2001 for cartel relating vitamins), Arkema (Eur219 million in 2006 relating to acrylic glass), Solvay (Eur167 million in 2006 relating to bleaching chemicals) and two to Shell (Eur 161 million and 108 million, both in 2006 relating to butadiene  rubber-emulsion styrene butadiene  rubber, and road bitumen respectively). Appeals have been lodged by Arkema, Solvay and Shell (for bitumen).

"The money raised by the  fines is paid into the community budget," the EC said in its statement, "helping to finance the European Union and reduce the tax burden on individuals." --newsdesk@platts.com
