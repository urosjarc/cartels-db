BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and world No.1  cablemaker  Prysmian will be charged along with France's Nexans and several Japanese  cable firms next month by the EU for operating an industry price-fixing cartel, four people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.

The European Commission's competition authority launched the case with raids on the companies more than five years ago. It can  fine wrong-doers up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules.
"The Commission's decision is expected to come before Easter (April 20)," one of the sources said. Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already levied million-dollar  fines against cable
companies for anti-competitive practices, and the United States Department of Justice is also
investigating the industry.

Goldman Sachs, which acquired Italy's Prysmian via one of its private equity funds in 2005, declined to comment. It has since sold its holding. Prysmian, which makes  cables for the power and telecom industries, declined to comment. The company has made a 199-million-euro ($274.27 million) provision for a possible fine.

World No. 2 cablemakerNexans,  which set aside a 200-million-euro provision three years ago for a possible fine, said it did not have any information as to when the  European Commission would give its ruling or what the ruling would be.

A spokeswoman for Nexans said the last exchange the company had had with the European Commission dated from late 2013, at which point it had not been informed of any fine or when a ruling would come.

The European Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, also declined to comment.

The sources said that Swiss engineering group ABB alerted the  cartel to the Commission, and would not face sanctions. The Swiss engineering group declined to comment.
The sources said the other cablemakers expected to be penalised include Japanese  cable firms
Exsym Corporation, J-Power Systems Corporation and Viscas Corporation, and Korean peer LS  Cable
& System.

J-Power Systems is controlled jointly by Hitachi Metals Ltd and Sumitomo Electric Industries .. Mitsubishi Cable Industries is a shareholder in Exsym.
It was not clear if Danish industrial group NKT Holding , South Korean firm Taihan Electric Wire and
General Cable Corp which received the EU charge sheet in July 2011, will face  fines.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined 11 producers of high-voltage  power cables a total of
300 million euros for operating a  cartel that secretly split up the global market.

"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined 11 producers of high-voltage  power cables a total of
300 million euros for operating a  cartel that secretly shared out the global market.

"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

TD
The EU said six European, three Japanese and two Korean firms -- that all make up the world's biggest high voltage cable producers -- of sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves.

The companies involved in the scheme were Japanese companies VISCAS and JPS, Nexans of France and Italian company Prysmian, which was previously owned by investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Swiss company ABB received full immunity, having been the first company to reveal the existence of the
cartel.

The investigation began with surprise raids on the companies in January 2009 and revealed that the producers had entered into agreements from 1999 that guaranteed home markets.

"Whenever Japanese and Korean companies received requests from European customers, they would notify their European counterparts and decline the bid," the commission said in a statement.

According to the EU, the firms met regularly in hotels across Europe and south-east Asia and agreed price levels to ensure that the allocated company would bid the lowest price and the others offer a bid that was unattractive to the customer.

The equipment involved in the case are  cables used to connect generation capacity, such as wind farms, to an electricity grid or to connect national grids between different countries.

HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 02, 2014--
TD
General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) announced today that the European Commission has issued a decision on the liability of producers of submarine and underground high voltage power cables for infringement of European competition law. The  Power Cables Case was initiated by a Statement of Objections or preliminary complaint in June 2011 addressed to twelve (12) company groups involving twenty-seven (27) companies alleging that the companies had participated in a  cartel to restrict competition on submarine and underground high voltage projects from 1999 to 2009. The Statement of Objections further alleged that two subsidiaries of General  Cable, its Spanish subsidiary, Grupo General Cable Sistemas, and its French subsidiary, Silec  Cable, had participated in the  cartel for different periods of time. In particular, the Commission claimed that Grupo General  Cable Sistemas was involved from January 2003 to May 2007, and that Silec  Cable was involved for ten (10) months after its acquisition
from Safran SA by General  Cable in December 2005.

Following formal responses to the Commission's Statement of Objections and a hearing, claims of infringement against Grupo General Cable Sistemas have been dismissed for lack of evidence of alleged cartel activity. With regard to Silec Cable, the Commission's decision imposed a  fine of 1,852,500 Euros (approximately $2.5 million) related to the period Silec  Cable has been owned by General  Cable. This fine was based on participation that allegedly commenced well before Silec  Cable was acquired by General Cable.

General Cable is currently reviewing the  European Commission's decision and is considering whether to appeal the Commission decision based on established precedent. General  Cable will also continue to pursue its rights to claim full indemnification for the Silec  Cable fine under the previously disclosed terms of the acquisition agreement with Safran SA executed in 2005.

General Cable (NYSE:BGC), a Fortune 500 Company, is a global leader in the development, design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum and fiber optic wire and  cable products for the energy, industrial, construction, specialty and communications markets.

By Tom Fairless
BRUSSELS--European Union antitrust authorities slapped  fines totaling EUR302 million ($417 million)
on 10 producers of high-voltage  power cables for operating a global  cartel.

The European Commission, which acts as the central competition authority for the 28-member bloc, said the companies "shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost
world-wide scale" for nearly a decade, starting in 1999.

Most of the biggest companies in the sector participated in the  cartel, including six European producers, three Japanese and two Korean companies, the commission said.

"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, said in a statement.

The cartel's participants were ABB, Nexans, Prysmian SpA, J-Power Systems, VISCAS, EXSYM, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS  Cable and Taihan, the commission said.

Prysmian received the highest  fine at EUR104.6 million, while ABB wasn't  fined because it revealed the cartel's existence to the commission.
High-voltage power cables are used to connect generators to a country's electricity grid, or to connect
power grids in different countries.
The commission launched the investigation with unannounced inspections in 2009.

Also on Wednesday, the commission said it had  fined producers of steel abrasives EUR30.7 million for operating a cartel.

Danish industrial conglomerate NKT Holding A/S (NKT.KO) said Wednesday that the  European          Commission has concluded its investigation concerning alleged price-fixing  activities within the power cables industry and decided to  fine NKT EUR3.9 million.

TD


MAIN FACTS:
-The case involves 26 cable producers, including NKT  Cables and its parent company NKT Holding
A/S.
-Overall, the Commission's  fines in the case total EUR301 million.

-From the start of the investigation, NKT has disagreed with the Commission's view on the company's conduct. In light of this, NKT will be appealing the Commission's decision.

-NKT's CFO Michael Hedegaard Lyng, says: "In our view, there is no substance to the Commission's allegations. Our internal rules in this area are extremely clear. On top of that, we have had the opportunity to thoroughly examine the evidence that the Commission has produced and this has not provided us with any reason to change our view of the case."

-The fine will be included as part of the 2014 financial year, and as a result, NKT expects that the profit for the year will be reduced by DKK29 million.
-The expected operational Ebitda-margin in standard metal prices for 2014 remains unchanged at
9%-9.5% compared to 8.4% in standard metal prices in 2013.
-At 1129 GMT shares traded 5.2% higher at DKK342.90.

General Cable Announces Decision by  European Commission in Power Cables Case


HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 02, 2014--
TD
General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) announced today that the European Commission has issued a decision on the liability of producers of submarine and underground high voltage power cables for infringement of European competition law. The  Power Cables Case was initiated by a Statement of Objections or preliminary complaint in June 2011 addressed to twelve (12) company groups involving twenty-seven (27) companies alleging that the companies had participated in a  cartel to restrict competition on submarine and underground high voltage projects from 1999 to 2009. The Statement of Objections further alleged that two subsidiaries of General  Cable, its Spanish subsidiary, Grupo General Cable Sistemas, and its French subsidiary, Silec  Cable, had participated in the  cartel for different periods of time. In particular, the Commission claimed that Grupo General  Cable Sistemas was involved from January 2003 to May 2007, and that Silec  Cable was involved for ten (10) months after its acquisition
from Safran SA by General  Cable in December 2005.

Following formal responses to the Commission's Statement of Objections and a hearing, claims of infringement against Grupo General Cable Sistemas have been dismissed for lack of evidence of alleged cartel activity. With regard to Silec Cable, the Commission's decision imposed a  fine of 1,852,500 Euros (approximately $2.5 million) related to the period Silec  Cable has been owned by General  Cable. This fine was based on participation that allegedly commenced well before Silec  Cable was acquired by General Cable.

General Cable is currently reviewing the  European Commission's decision and is considering whether to appeal the Commission decision based on established precedent. General  Cable will also continue to pursue its rights to claim full indemnification for the Silec  Cable fine under the previously disclosed terms of the acquisition agreement with Safran SA executed in 2005.

General Cable (NYSE:BGC), a Fortune 500 Company, is a global leader in the development, design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum and fiber optic wire and  cable products for the energy, industrial, construction, specialty and communications markets.

Brussels, April 2 (Jiji Press)--The  European Commission on Wednesday imposed fines totaling 302 million euros on 10 firms including three Japanese ones for their participation in a price cartel for high voltage power cables.

TD
The three Japanese companies are J-Power Systems Corp., Viscas Corp. and Exsym Corp.

The executive body of the European Union said that from 1999 to 2009, the 10 companies regularly met each other in hotels in Southeast Asia and Europe to set price levels to "ensure that the designated power cable supplier or 'allottee' would bid the lowest price," so that they could allocate projects successfully.

Switzerland's ABB received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the commission, avoiding a fine.

BRUSSELS, April 2 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, the world's top  cablemaker Prysmian, Nexans and eight other cable firms were fined a total of 302 million euros ($416 million) by European regulators for running a cartel.

The power cable cartel, made up of six European companies, three Japanese and two Korean firms, ran for almost 10 years from 1999, with the companies sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves, the European Union's antitrust authority said on Wednesday.
Prysmian received the biggest penalty from the EU at 104.6 million euros, which included a joint  fine of
37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via one of its private
equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.
Prysmian said it would appeal against the European Commission's decision, as did Danish company
NKT Holding which received a much smaller fine. Goldman Sachs said it may challenge the ruling.

The Italian company said it "believes that the decision is based on a superficial and erroneous analysis of the relevant facts and, therefore, considers the decision unlawful."

Its shares rose more than 3 percent because the  fine was less than the 199 million euros the firm had set aside to pay it.

European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Goldman Sachs played an active management role at Prysmian during the  cartel years.

"We had evidence during our investigation of the direct involvement of Goldman Sachs in the management decisions of the company Prysmian," he told a news conference.

Goldman Sachs said: "It is important to recognize that the Commission has chosen to hold GS jointly and severally liable with Prysmian solely under its parental liability doctrine.

"Notably, there is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the purported collusive behaviour."
U.S. PROBE

Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already levied million-dollar  fines against cable companies for anti-competitive practices, and the United States Department of Justice is also investigating the industry.

The EU watchdog handed a 70.7 million euro  fine to French cable manufacturer Nexans, which said it would consider an appeal.
Page 20 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Denmark's NKT Holding was  fined 3.9 million euros.

"We do not believe that there is evidence in the Commission's allegations. We have not in any way been involved in any form of cartels. Therefore, we disagree with the decision and we will appeal," Chief Executive Michael Lyng said.

France's Safran,  fined 8.6 million euros, said this would not have a significant impact on its results as it had set aside a provision.

Other cartel members include Japan's Exsym Corporation and J-Power Systems Corporation and Korean peer LS  Cable & System . None of the Asian companies were immediately available to comment outside normal business hours.
Swiss engineering firm ABB alerted the Commission to the  cartel and, as a result, escaped a  fine. For a full list of the companies  fined by the European Commission, click on

PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - French cable manufacturer Nexans said on Wednesday it would consider appealing a European Commission decision to fineNexans France 70.67 million euros after an
anti-trust probe.

"Nexans will review the voluminous decision in detail to determine its next course of action which could include appeal," it said in a statement.

"The Group will evaluate the consequences of the decision for possible follow on claims as well as the impact of this decision and other recent developments in the other ongoing competition authority investigations in the same  cable sector in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia and Korea, which consequences as previously reported could have a material adverse effect on the results of Nexans and its financial situation.
"The Group will communicate further at the time of its first semester results."

Investment bank Goldman Sachs GS.N, the world's top  cablemaker  Prysmian PRY.MI, Nexans NEXS.PA and eight  cable firms were fined a total of 302 million euros ($416 million) by the  European Commission on Wednesday for running a cartel.

<span style="font-size:11pt;">The Commission today concluded its investigation concerning alleged
price-fixing  activities within the  power cables industry. The case involves 26 cable producers, including
NKT Cables and its parent company NKT Holding A/S. Overall, the Commission’s fines in the case total
301 mEUR (2,260 mDKK), whereas the  fine issued against NKT is 3.9 mEUR (29 mDKK). From the start
of the investigation, NKT has disagreed with the Commission’s view on the company's conduct. In light of
this, NKT will be appealing the Commission’s decision.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">NKT’s Group Executive Director and CFO, Michael Hedegaard Lyng, disagrees with the decision, stating:</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">“In our view, there is no substance to the Commission’s allegations. Our internal rules in this area are extremely clear. On top of that, we have had the opportunity to thoroughly examine the evidence that the Commission has produced and this has not provided us with any reason to change our view of the case. On this basis, we have very clearly and unequivocally expressed our complete disagreement with the Commission’s interpretation of the material. We have communicated this not only in writing, but also at an oral hearing in Brussels.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">The Group Executive Director also emphasizes that NKT management maintains this view despite the fact that NKT has received a substantially smaller  fine than the other producers - reflecting that NKT’s role was significantly lesser than the other participants in the alleged cartel:</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">“We disagree with the Commission’s decision and are therefore preparing an appeal”, says Michael Hedegaard Lyng.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">The  fine will be included as part of the 2014 financial year, and as a result, NKT expects that the profit for the year will be reduced by 29 mDKK. The expected operational
EBITDA-margin in standard metal prices for 2014 remains unchanged at 9-9.5% compared to 8.4% in standard metal prices in 2013.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;">NKT has previously published announcements about the case and has regularly informed the market in its interim and annual reports - latest in the annual report for 2013. See www.nkt.dk for details.</span>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Michael
Hedegaard Lyng on telephone +45 4348 2000.</span>

Many of the world’s biggest producers of high-voltage  power cables have been slapped with  fines totalling 302m ($416m) for operating a  cartel that illegally rigged supplies to the offshore wind market - a plan the European Commission (EC) claimed investment giant Goldman Sachs also shares liability for.

The EC said the  cartel involved 11 producers of underground and submarine  cables and operated for almost a decade from 1999. Six are from Europe, three from Japan and two from Korea.

TD
"Part of this plan was to allocate important high voltage  power cable projects in the European Economic
Area (EEA), including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms."

Under the arrangement,  cable producers in Europe and Asia agreed to "stay out of each other's home territories and most of the rest of the world would be

The European Commission has fined ten copper cable-makers, including Nexans and Prysmian, for rigging underground and sub-sea cable supply tenders and colluding to carve up sales in regional
markets. The EC investigation is part of a worldwide probe into a pricing ring operated by  cablemakers for nearly ten years starting from 1999. Six European, three Japanese and two South Korean companies
were fined on Wednesday April 2, after a five-year investigation by the commission. "These producers entered into mutual agreements according to which the European and Asian producers would stay out of each other's home territories and most of the rest of the world would be divided amongst them," the commission announced on Wednesday. Acting on a tip-off from  cartel member ABB, the commission raided the offices of a dozen companies in 2009, and formally charged the companies with allocating markets and fixing  global copper cable prices in 2011.

TD
After defences were heard in 2012, the scope of the investigation was scaled back to exclude investigation of cartel activities in markets other than the underground and subsea  cable markets. Italy-based
cable-maker Prysmian set aside €207 million in provisions for risks and charges related to investigations launched by the EC and other regulators in the USA and Canada. Prysmian, along with former owners Pirelli and Goldman Sachs, was ordered to pay €104 million on Wednesday. The investment bank, which bought, floated and sold out of Prysmian between 2005 and 2010, is jointly liable for €37.3 million, the commission said. Prysmian also faces an investigation in Brazil that it has not provisioned for, according to its last annual report. Nexans, the France-based  cable-maker, set aside €200 million in provisions, and since the 2009 raid it has warned investors that an adverse ruling could have a material effect on the financial position of the group, even excluding the potential  fine imposed by the EC. The company was fined €70.7 million by the commission on Wednesday. Its shares rose as much as 5.5% following the announcement.  Nexans has not made provisions for potential  fines arising from related investigations in Australia, South Korea, the USA, Brazil and Canada. The eight other companies  fined by the commission were J-Power Systems (previously Sumitomo Electric and Hitachi Metals), VISCAS (previously Furukawa Electric and Fujikura), EXSYM (previously SWCC Showa and Mitsubishi  Cable), Brugg, NKT, Silec (previously Safran), LS Cable and Taihan. ABB received immunity from €33 million in  fines for revealing the existence of the cartel. J-Power Systems and its parents Hitachi Metals and Sumitomo Electric received a 45% reduction of the fine for co-operating with the investigation. Rigging tenders The investigation revealed that whenever the Japanese and South Korean cartelists received supply quotes from European customers, they would notify their European counterparts and decline to bid. The cartelists met regularly at hotels in Southeast Asia and Europe and communicated regularly by email to organise their activities, which also included agreeing on price levels to bid in tenders held by buyers of sub-sea
and underground cables, the commission said on Wednesday. Through a forensic investigation, the commission also found evidence that a Nexans employee had deleted several thousand electronic documents, most of which were closely linked to the activities of the  cartel. The EC case follows on from an investigation launched by French competition authorities which concluded in 2007 with Prysmian, Nexans and other copper  cable makers being fined €20 million for colluding in  cable sales tenders run by French power supplier EDF. The French authorities found that between June and May 2004, the  cable makers made sophisticated arrangements to rig the results of the EDF deals, including organising prior simulations of the bidding process on the day before tenders took place. In the <a href="http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/1688375/Search/French-competition-authority-fines-European- cable-cartel.html" target="_blank">French case</a>, Nexans France was  fined almost €10 million, Prysmian Energies  Câbles et Systèmes almost €5 million, Safran almost €4 million, Draka Paricable

€675,000, and Grupo General  Cable Sistemas €900,000. In its notice on Wednesday, the commission
said that the parties were "well aware" that they were breaking competition rules, as proven by evidence of
meetings where the advantages and disadvantages of forming a  cartel were discussed. "It would be tough
unless the pie for each company increases and the merits exceed the risk of having  cartel," one party
wrote in a note about the meeting. Mark Burton <a

Eleven power cable manufacturers have been  fined a total of €300 million (£250 million) for running a
cartel, the European Commission announced on Wednesday.

Six European, three Japanese and two Korean companies were found to have made illegal agreements to fix prices for almost ten years from 1999. All received  fines except for ABB, which blew the whistle on the cartel.

TD
The companies, which make underground and subsea high voltage  cables, allocated customers between them on a global scale.

Competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy. Despite this and through joint efforts by several competition authorities around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive agreements and brought them to an end."

The producers had agreed to stay out of each other's home markets and divide the rest of the world between them, the Commission found. They met regularly and agreed on price offers to make sure the designated supplier for a particular tender bid the lowest price.
The investigation kicked off when the Commission made surprise raids on the companies in January
2009. It used forensic IT to recover several thousand documents deleted by Nexans.

There was evidence the companies knew they were breaking the rules. For example, one meeting note read: "It would be tough unless the pie for each company increases and the merits exceed the risk of having cartel".

Prysmian (€105 million or £87 million) and Nexans (€71 million or £59 million) received the heftiest  fines. J-Power Systems, Viscas, Exsym, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS  Cable and Taihan were also punished for their involvement.
Any firm affected by the  cartel's actions may seek damages.

HD        EC fines cable producers Eur302 million after cartel probe

The European Commission has found that 11 producers of underground and submarine high-voltage power cables operated a cartel, and has imposed fines totaling Eur301.639 million ($415.96 million), the EC said on April 2.

"Most of the world's largest high-voltage  power cable producers, namely ABB, Nexans, Prysmian (previously Pirelli), J-Power Systems (previously Sumitomo Electric and Hitachi Metals), VISCAS (previously Furukawa Electric and Fujikura), EXSYM (previously SWCC Showa and Mitsubishi  Cable), Brugg, NKT, Silec (previously Safran), LS  Cable and Taihan, participated in the illegal agreements," the EC said in a statement.

TD
Such cables are typically used to connect generation capacity to the electricity grid or to interconnect
power grids in different countries.

For nearly 10 years, starting in 1999, "these companies shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost worldwide scale," the EC said.

Part of this plan was to allocate important high-voltage  power cable projects in the European Economic Area, including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms, it added.

"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," said Joaquin Almunia, the EC's vice president in charge of competition policy. "Despite this, and through joint efforts by several competition authorities around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive agreements and brought them to an end."
Six European, three Japanese and two South Korean producers of submarine or underground power  
cables were involved in the  cartel, the EC said.

Several companies that took part in the infringement and later merged their activities into joint ventures have also been held liable, as well as parent companies of the producers involved, because they exercised a decisive influence over them, it noted, adding: "This includes the investment company Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian."

The investigation revealed that from 1999 to the inspections carried out by the EC in January 2009, these producers entered into mutual agreements, according to which the European and Asian producers would stay out of each other's home territories and most of the rest of the world would be divided among them, the EC said.

"In implementing these agreements, the  cartel participants allocated projects between themselves according to the geographic region or customer," it said. "In particular, the European companies agreed to allocate projects within the European Economic Area."




Page 29 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The cartelists "regularly met each other in hotels in Southeast Asia and Europe and maintained further contacts by means of e-mails, faxes and telephone calls," the EC said, adding that the companies "were well aware that they were breaking competition rules."

The fines were set on the basis of the EC's 2006 guidelines on  fines, "taking into account the very serious nature of the infringement, its scope, its implementation and its duration," it said.

The two largest  fines were imposed on Prysmian (Eur104.613 million) and Nexans (Eur70.67 million). Of the total Prysmian  fine, Eur67.310 million is "jointly and severally liable" with Pirelli and the remaining Eur37.303 million was "jointly and severally liable" with Goldman Sachs, the EC said.

Prysmian plans to appeal the  fines imposed on it, the company said on April 2. "Prysmian believes that the decision is based on a superficial and erroneous analysis of the relevant facts and, therefore, considers the decision unlawful," the company said in a statement. "Accordingly, Prysmian intends to bring an appeal before the Tribunal of the European Union."
'Voluminous decision': Nexans

France's Nexans said in a statement it would "review the voluminous decision in detail to determine its next course of action, which could include appeal." The company said it would "evaluate the consequences of the decision for possible follow-on claims, as well as the impact of this decision and other recent developments in the other ongoing competition authority investigations in the same  cable sector in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia and Korea."

These consequences "could have a material adverse effect on the results of Nexans and its financial situation," Nexans warned.

"The commission, regrettably, did not take into account the lack of effect on customers, which it is not required to find in order to apply sanctions," Nexans CEO Frederic Vincent and Chief Operating Officer Arnaud Poupart-Lafarge said in a joint statement.
The company stressed it is "fully committed to compliance with competition laws."
ABB was granted full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the EC, thereby avoiding a
fine of Eur33 million for its participation. J-Power Systems and its parents Hitachi Metals and Sumitomo
Electric received a 45% reduction of the fine for cooperating with the investigation under the EC's
leniency notice.

The latter three companies also received partial immunity for the first two years of their cartel involvement, as they were the first to submit evidence to the EC on the existence of the cartel during that period.

One company invoked its inability to pay the  fine, but having assessed this claim, the EC said it decided not to reduce the  fine.

HD         Goldman faces heavy EU fine over subsea cable investment

Goldman Sachs is to be hit with a multimillion euro  fine on Wednesday as part of an EU  cartel case on subsea power cables that will underline the legal risks faced by buyout groups.
The European Commission is preparing to fine up to a dozen groups including Prysmian, the Italian
cablemaker  formerly owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the investment bank's buyout arm.

TD
While it is common for Europe's top antitrust authority to  fine parent companies when offshoots are embroiled in cartels, it is rare to penalise a primarily financial investor, especially for periods where it held a minority stake.

"The issue of parent company liability has received a lot of attention in the private equity community," said Jay Modrall, a partner at Norton Rose. "Private equity firms tend to think of their funds and investments as siloed, rather than as part of a single group."
Goldman's buyout unit bought Prysmian from Pirelli in 2005 for €1.3bn including debt, floated the
cablemaker  in 2007 - leaving it with a 43 per cent holding - and by 2010 had fully sold down its stake.

The bank told the commission it was unaware of the effort to rig prices and carve up markets, which started several years before it bought Prysmian.

The commission decision is a warning to buyout groups over legacy legal risks and underscores their responsibility as owners for rooting out and ending any wrongdoing in the business, even when the expertise they bring to the board is primarily financial.

"The implications of the commission's practice of imposing  fines based on group-wide liability goes beyond the financial exposure," saidy Mr Modrall. "Private equity firms may want to look at their standard M&A contract language to see how this exposure is addressed."

Courts have largely backed the commission's approach to penalising parent companies and have made no significant distinction for private equity buyers. Goldman is the most prominent financial investor to suffer such a  fine.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>An EU charge sheet sent to the US investment bank covers from 2005 to 2009, including a period of more than a year where Goldman's stake in Prysmian was under 50 per cent.

The commission argues that the buyout unit is liable to pay a share of Prysmian's  fine because it exercised a decisive influence on Prysmian that went beyond a pure financial investment, including through nominating individuals to the board.

Mario Mariniello of Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels, said the case tests the point where investors carry direct legal risks from antitrust infringements.

"Investment with no control cannot entail direct legal liability. It would make little economic sense: regardless of what an investor knows, its investment already carries extra risk as ultimately shareholders pay cartel fines," he said.

"Investment with control should directly be punished. The likelihood of a  fine affects your incentives to ensure profits are legally made and to stop infringements. The notion of control is key here - it might be possible to have a decisive influence without direct control."
A successful legal challenge to the grounds for the commission inspections mounted by Prysmian and
Nexans has limited the scope of the case to high-voltage  cables.

In a 2012 ruling, the EU General Court found the commission raids mounted in 2009 had no reasonable grounds for extending its search to information relating to all  cables and electrical products.

Goldman Sachs was fined €37m on Wednesday as part of an EU cartel inquiry into subsea power     
cables that highlights the legal risks faced by buyout groups.

The European Commission hit 11 groups with penalties totalling €301m for price rigging, including Prysmian, the Italian cablemaker  formerly owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the investment bank's buyout arm.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU antitrust chief, said Goldman was liable for part of the  fine because it exercised a decisive influence on Prysmian for more than three years.

"The implications of the commission's practice of imposing  fines based on group-wide liability goes beyond the financial exposure," said Mr Modrall. "Private equity firms may want to look at their standard M&A contract language to see how this exposure is addressed."

A spokesperson for Goldman said it was "important to recognise" that the commission chose to hold the bank jointly and severally liable with Prysmian "solely under its parental liability doctrine".

"There is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the purported collusive behaviour. Goldman Sachs is considering its rights of appeal," the spokesperson added.

The commission fined 10 cable firms €302m for running a  cartel that lasted for nearly 10 years from
1999. It involved six European, three Japanese and two Korean manufacturers.

Prysmian's penalty was the biggest and was shared between Goldman and Pirelli, its former owner. Nexans, the world's second biggest  cablemaker,  was fined €70m. ABB will not be  fined, because it blew the whistle on the  cartel to the EU.

General Cable Corporation:Says European Commission issued a decision on the liability of producers of submarine and underground high voltage power cables for infringement of European competition law.The Statement of Objections further alleged that two subsidiaries of General Cable, its Spanish subsidiary, Grupo General  Cable Sistemas, and its French subsidiary, Silec Cable, had participated in the cartel for different periods of time.Commission claimed that Grupo General Cable Sistemas was involved from Jan. 2003 to May 2007, and that Silec  Cable was involved for 10 months after its acquisition from Safran SA by General  Cable in Dec. 2005.Following formal responses to the Commission's Statement of Objections and a hearing, claims of infringement against Grupo General Cable Sistemas have been dismissed for lack of evidence of alleged  cartel activity.With regard to Silec Cable, the Commission's decision imposed a fine of 1,852,500 euros ($2.5 mln) related to the period Silec Cable has been owned by General Cable.Fine was based on participation that allegedly commenced well before Silec  Cable was acquired by General  Cable.

The European Commission has fined ten copper cable-makers, including Nexans and Prysmian, for rigging underground and sub-sea cable supply tenders and colluding to carve up sales in regional markets.

The EC investigation is part of a worldwide probe into a pricing ring operated by  cablemakers for nearly ten years starting from 1999. Six European, three Japanese and two South Korean companies were fined on Wednesday April 2, after a five-year investigation by the commission.

“These producers entered into mutual agreements according to which the European and Asian producers would stay out of each other's home territories and most of the rest of the world would be divided amongst them,” the commission announced on Wednesday.
Acting on a tip-off from  cartel member ABB, the commission raided the offices of a dozen companies in
2009, and formally charged the companies with allocating markets and  fixing  global copper cable
prices in 2011.

After defences were heard in 2012, the scope of the investigation was scaled back to exclude investigation of  cartel activities in markets other than the underground and subsea  cable markets.

Italy-based  cable-maker Prysmian set aside €207 million in provisions for risks and charges related to investigations launched by the EC and other regulators in the USA and Canada.
Prysmian, along with former owners Pirelli and Goldman Sachs, was ordered to pay €104 million on
Wednesday. The investment bank, which bought, floated and sold out of Prysmian between 2005 and
2010, is jointly liable for €37.3 million, the commission said.

Prysmian also faces an investigation in Brazil that it has not provisioned for, according to its last annual report.

Nexans, the France-based  cable-maker, set aside €200 million in provisions, and since the 2009 raid it has warned investors that an adverse ruling could have a material effect on the financial position of the group, even excluding the potential  fine imposed by the EC.
The company was fined €70.7 million by the commission on Wednesday. Its shares rose as much as
5.5% following the announcement.



Nexans has not made provisions for potential  fines arising from related investigations in Australia, South Korea, the USA, Brazil and Canada.

The eight other companies  fined by the commission were J-Power Systems (previously Sumitomo Electric and Hitachi Metals), VISCAS (previously Furukawa Electric and Fujikura), EXSYM (previously SWCC Showa and MitsubishiCable), Brugg, NKT, Silec (previously Safran), LS  Cable and Taihan.

ABB received immunity from €33 million in  fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel. J-Power Systems and its parents Hitachi Metals and Sumitomo Electric received a 45% reduction of the fine for co-operating with the investigation.
Rigging tenders

The investigation revealed that whenever the Japanese and South Korean cartelists received supply quotes from European customers, they would notify their European counterparts and decline to bid.

The cartelists met regularly at hotels in Southeast Asia and Europe and communicated regularly by email to organise their activities, which also included agreeing on price levels to bid in tenders held by buyers of sub-sea and underground  cables, the commission said on Wednesday.

Through a forensic investigation, the commission also found evidence that a Nexans employee had deleted several thousand electronic documents, most of which were closely linked to the activities of the cartel.

The EC case follows on from an investigation launched by French competition authorities which concluded in 2007 with Prysmian, Nexans and other copper  cable makers being fined €20 million for colluding in cable sales tenders run by French  power supplier EDF.

The French authorities found that between June and May 2004, the  cable makers made sophisticated arrangements to rig the results of the EDF deals, including organising prior simulations of the bidding process on the day before tenders took place.

In the French case, Nexans France was  fined almost €10 million, Prysmian Energies  Câbles et Systèmes almost €5 million, Safran almost €4 million, Draka Paricable €675,000, and Grupo General Cable Sistemas €900,000.

In its notice on Wednesday, the commission said that the parties were “well aware” that they were breaking competition rules, as proven by evidence of meetings where the advantages and disadvantages of forming a  cartel were discussed.
“It would be tough unless the pie for each company increases and the merits exceed the risk of having
cartel,” one party wrote in a note about the meeting.

BRUSSELS—European Union antitrust authorities slapped fines totaling €301.64 million ($416 million) on a group of cable makers and Goldman Sachs Group for fixing  the prices of high-voltage  power     cables.

The European Commission, which acts as the central competition authority for the 28-member bloc, said the companies "shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost
world-wide scale" for nearly a decade, starting in 1999.

TD
"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, said in a statement.

The power-cable cartel involved most of the biggest companies in the sector, including six European companies, three Japanese and two Korean, the commission said.

Goldman Sachs shared a €37.3 million  fine with Prysmian SpA, an Italian  cable maker that the U.S. investment bank's private equity arm bought in 2005, but has since sold.

Mr. Almunia said the commission had evidence of Goldman's "direct involvement" in management decisions at Prysmian during the period in which the  cartel was operating.

"Goldman Sachs was adopting real management decisions orienting the management of this company" during the time of the  cartel, the commissioner said. He stressed that financial investors have a responsibility to look closely at the way their portfolio companies comply with EU law.
A spokeswoman for Goldman said the bank is considering appealing the commission's decision. "There is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the
purported collusive behavior," the spokeswoman said.

Besides Prysmian, the cartel's participants were ABB, Nexans, J-Power Systems, VISCAS, EXSYM, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS Cable and Taihan.

Prysmian received the highest  fine at €104.6 million, part of which was shared with Goldman and part with its former owner Pirelli & C SpA. ABB wasn't  fined because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the commission.
High-voltage power cables are used to connect generators to a country's electricity grid, or to connect
power grids in different countries.

Also on Wednesday, the commission said it had  fined producers of steel abrasives €30.7 million for operating a cartel.


Page 38 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fines come two weeks after the commission levied a combined €953 million in  fines on five companies for a cartel in car and truck ball bearings, the fourth-highest ever  fines issued by the authority over a cartel, as part of a broader investigation into competition breaches in the auto-parts market.

HD     EU fines European, Asian companies for power cable cartel

Brussels (dpa) - A group of European, Japanese and Korean  power cable producers has been fined more than 300 million euros (414 million dollars) for illegally divvying up operation areas among themselves, the European Union's executive said Wednesday.

"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

TD
"Utilities and governments were deprived of the genuine possibility to choose between different providers when planning important energy infrastructure projects," he added. "Cartels make markets less efficient and stifle innovation."
The largest  fine - 104.6 million euros - was slapped on Prysmian, a worldwide company headquartered in
Italy.

The US financial giant Goldman Sachs is liable for 37.3 million euros of that penalty because it used to own Prysmian and was directly involved in management decisions, Almunia said.

"Investment companies ... should take a careful look at the compliance culture of the companies they invest in," he added.

Large fines were also slapped on the French company Nexans at 70.7 million euros, the Japanese company VISCAS at just under 35 million euros and the Japanese firm J-Power Systems at 20.7 million euros.

The Switzerland-based ABB escaped a fine of 33 million euros for having blown the whistle on the illegal set-up. Other companies had their fines reduced for cooperating with the EU in its probe.
The 11 producers involved in the underground and submarine cable cartel from 1999 to 2009 included
"most of the world's largest high-voltage  power cable producers," the European Commission said.

"Part of (their) plan was to allocate important high-voltage  power cable projects in the European Economic Area, including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms," it noted.

The producers agreed to "stay out of each other's home territories," while dividing projects in the rest of the world. They would rig bids to make sure a particular company would be chosen, according to the commission.

Also on Wednesday, the EU's executive  fined three producers of steel abrasives a total of 30.7 million euros in a settlement to end an investigation into price-fixing.  Steel abrasives are used by different industries to clean metal or cut hard stones.

The companies involved in the six-year  cartel were the US-British firm Ervin, the French company Winoa, and the German firms Metalltechnik Schmidt and Eisenwerk Wuerth. Ervin escaped a  fine by revealing
the arrangement.

HD          EU Issues Total of $416 Million  in Fines for Power Cable Cartel -- Update

BRUSSELS--European Union antitrust authorities slapped  fines totaling EUR301.64 million ($416 million) on a group of  cable makers and Goldman Sachs Group for  fixing  the prices of high-voltage power cables.

The European Commission, which acts as the central competition authority for the 28-member bloc, said the companies "shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost
world-wide scale" for nearly a decade, starting in 1999.

TD
"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, said in a statement.

The power-cable cartel involved most of the biggest companies in the sector, including six European companies, three Japanese and two Korean, the commission said.
Goldman Sachs shared a EUR37.3 million  fine with Prysmian SpA, an Italian  cable maker that the
U.S. investment bank's private equity arm bought in 2005, but has since sold.

Mr. Almunia said the commission had evidence of Goldman's "direct involvement" in management decisions at Prysmian during the period in which the  cartel was operating.

"Goldman Sachs was adopting real management decisions orienting the management of this company" during the time of the  cartel, the commissioner said. He stressed that financial investors have a responsibility to look closely at the way their portfolio companies comply with EU law.
A spokeswoman for Goldman said the bank is considering appealing the commission's decision. "There is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the
purported collusive behavior," the spokeswoman said.

Besides Prysmian, the cartel's participants were ABB, Nexans, J-Power Systems, VISCAS, EXSYM, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS Cable and Taihan.

Prysmian received the highest  fine at EUR104.6 million, part of which was shared with Goldman and part with its former owner Pirelli & C SpA. ABB wasn't  fined because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the commission.
High-voltage power cables are used to connect generators to a country's electricity grid, or to connect
power grids in different countries.

Also on Wednesday, the commission said it had  fined producers of steel abrasives EUR30.7 million for operating a  cartel.

The fines come two weeks after the commission levied a combined EUR953 million in  fines on five companies for a cartel in car and truck ball bearings, the fourth-highest ever  fines issued by the authority over a cartel, as part of a broader investigation into competition breaches in the auto-parts market.

Many of the world’s biggest producers of high-voltage  power cables have been slapped with  fines totalling €302m ($416m) for operating a  cartel that illegally rigged supplies to the offshore wind market – a plan the European Commission (EC) claimed investment giant Goldman Sachs also shares liability for.

The EC said the  cartel involved 11 producers of underground and submarine  cables and operated for almost a decade from 1999.

HD        Commission fines power cables cartel €301.6m

LP
The European Commission has ruled that 11 producers of underground and submarine  power cables operated a cartel for ten years from 1999, and has  fined ten of them a total of €301.6 million. The investigation found that the companies, which include most of the world’s largest makers of high-voltage power cables, had agreed to stay out of each other’s home markets.

Announcing the decision yesterday (2 April), Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for competition, said that the companies knew that what they were doing was illegal. A note of one of their meetings recorded that they had discussed whether “the merits exceed the risk of having a  cartel”. The companies had acted “with great secrecy”, Almunia (pictured) said. The Commission had recovered thousands of documents that had been deleted from a computer by an employee of Nexans, one of the companies fined.

TD
Prysmian, a company which used to be part of Pirelli, has been  fined the largest amount, €104.6m. Part of the fine, €67.3m, is being imposed on Goldman Sachs, which had a stake in the company through its private-equity business while the  cartel was in operation. Almunia justified that  fine on the grounds that Goldman was directly involved in the management of the company at the time. He added that applying the fine to a parent company in  cartel cases was an important signal to investment companies to “take
a careful look at the companies in which they invest”.

The companies involved were: Brugg, Nexans, NKT, Prysmian, Safran, Silec, Sumitomo, Hitachi, JPS, Furukawa, Fujikura, VISCAS, SWCC Showa, Mitsubishi, EXSYM, LS  Cable and Taihan. ABB took part in the cartel but was given full immunity as it had informed the Commission about the agreement.

In a separate decision, the Commission has  fined four companies €30.7m for operating a  cartel for steel abrasives. The companies – Ervin, Winoa, Metalltechnik, Schmidt and Eisenwerk Würth – agreed to apply a surcharge to their prices to compensate for fluctuations in the price of metal scrap and energy, and agreed not to compete on price. Ervin was not  fined as it had informed the Commission about the agreement.

The European Commission announced its decision today to fine Silec Cable, a former subsidiary of Sagem, concerning a cartel on high-voltage underground power cables from November 2001 to December 2005.

This fine follows an inquiry initiated by the European Commission in 2009, concerning a  cartel between the main players in the underground and submarine high-voltage power cable sector, from 1999 to 2008.

The Commission took into account Silec  Cable's limited participation in the  cartel, setting the amount of the fine at 8,567,000 euros.

This fine will not have a significant impact on the Group's results because of provisions that were previously set aside.
Safran, formed by the merger of Snecma and Sagem in 2005, sold Silec  Cable to General  Cable in
December 2005, and was totally unaware of the practices that have been incriminated.

Safran confirms its commitment to strict compliance with all competition laws and regulations. Right from its creation, Safran deployed a legal department including a unit dedicated to competition law.

The S&P/ASX200 is likely to close slightly lower today.
Markets were mildly higher in Europe, the UK and US.

On the NYSE where 3225 issues traded there were 1,787 issues higher, 1,323 issues down and 115 unchanged. On Nasdaq where 2755 issues traded there were 1,493 issues higher, 1,170 down and 92 unchanged.

Metals were higher, crude was down a touch, gold rose. The $A is at 92.46US c, up a few from last evening.
"Ceiling will be 5433. Floor will be 5355. Close at 5390, down 13.3 points'

Daniel Goulding, the author of "The Sextant Market Report" said, "Our market looks set to open higher with the local futures contract up 18 points.
"A number of bearish tells are present, both in our market and in the US.

"Here, index leadership was bearish again yesterday in our market. And retail, the canary in the coalmine, is struggling.

"Over in the US there are a number of index divergences and a lot of the market bellwethers I follow are experiencing significant distribution.

"The problem is that you often don't know whether bearish tells are signalling the imminent end of the bounce/rally or whether it is still a few weeks to months away.

"I am sticking with the view that we are caught in a downtrend to 5180 to 5250 (with emphasis on the upper part of that range) before one final run to a high and my forecast will be largely based on that.

"But the alternative scenario of an immediate spike into 5580 to complete probably the final top is gaining some credence.
" The ceiling will be 5433. The floor will be 5355. When the dust has settled, the market will have closed at
5390, down 13.3 points'.

*China takes steps to cut taxes for small businesses, speed up railway constr

Reuters reported China acted for the first time this year to steady its stumbling economy by cutting taxes for small firms on Wednesday and announcing plans to speed up the construction of railway lines. The

Chinese cabinet said after its weekly meeting that it will accelerate the construction of rail projects that have been approved, and increase the total length of lines being laid this year by 18 percent compared to
2013. The government also said it would lower tax rates for smaller companies by relaxing the criteria that allows them to halve their income taxes. This policy will be extended to the end of 2016, the government said.

The measures mark the first concrete action being taken by China this year to boost its economy, and come after Premier Li Keqiang last week sought to reassure jittery markets that Beijing was ready to provide support.

Projects are now overseen by China Railway Corp, which won approval on Tuesday to sell 150 billion yuan worth of bonds, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
*Australia must lift education of the workforce to lift productivity, ability to compete.

Federal Treasury Secretary Dr Martin Parkinson in a speech given to the Sydney Institute last night outlined the need for lifting the skills of the workforce, encouraging innovation and competition to be able to lift productivity and compete on the world stage. He suggested lowering income tax, which would mean less burden on the low paid and less incentive for tax minimisation by the wealthy while raising GST. Also as the population ages, despite higher workforce participation by older Australians, this will reduce growth in the future revenue base and also create additional demands on government spending, particularly in health, aged care and pensions.
If productivity is not lifted - by enabling a higher skilled work force - then future living standards would fall. Aussie stocks

Trading points:
*AAI/AWC: Nomura cuts 2014 earnings estimates to 14c from 28c a share

Alcoa fell 1.5% intra day after analysts at Nomura cut the company's 2014 earnings estimate to 14c a share from 28c a share. Analyst Curt Woodworth said in a note, "We see significant downside risk to 2014
EPS estimates as LME aluminium values continue to free fall", MarketWatch reported.
*BHP: Pros and cons: demerged entity may see full separation of UK, Aussie entities

Tony Boyd in "Chanticleer" quoting UBS analyst Glynn Lawcock, said the demerger option is the leastrisky way to dispose of assets compared to the alternatives such as a trade sale, IPO or carve out.

However the assets up for sale have patchy earnings outlooks, and most of the non core businesses being considered for demerger are in the UK listed or plc structure which could cause problems.
Assuming all issues are resolved and the demerger is successful, shareholders in the UK will still own
40% of the group and be entitled to more than $2.5 billion in dividends each year. With only a few UK
listed assets remaining in the group it will be very costly to fund this liability from Australia. That suggests
that the demerger might require the collapse of the DLC structure and a complete separation of BHP
Billiton Ltd and BHP Billiton Plc.
*DOW/IMF: Settlement with Downer EDI now unconditional

The Board of Directors of Bentham IMF Ltd referred to the announcement of February 27 and confirms the settlement with Downer EDI has become unconditional. It is estimated that IMF will generate revenues of
$11.3 million and a profit after capitalised overheads but before tax of about $10 million which will be recognised in the second half of full year 2014. (Apr 2)

Noni B Ltd announced sales on a comparable store basis for the three months to March 31 was 14%

This sales decline reflects consumer expectations of substantial discounts when buying clothes, which the company has tried to resist to maintain the higher margins achieved in the first half. Additional discount promotions are being planned for the 4th quarter.
The company currently has no bank borrowings and costs remain under control. (Apr 2)

HD     (AE) COMPETITION: Fines for producers of high-voltage power cables

Brussels, 02/04/2014 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 2 April, the European Commission imposed fines totalling nearly €302 million on producers of underground and submarine high voltage power cables for operating a  cartel at almost global level between 1999 and January 2009.

“These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy”, explained EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. The  European          Commission has gathered together several thousand documents deleted by an employee of the Nexans company. The other producers involved are ABB, Prysmian (formerly Pirelli), J-Power Systems (formerly Sumitomo Electric and Hitachi Metals), VISCAS (formerly Furukawa Electric and Fujikura), EXSYM (formerly SWCC Showa and Mitsubishi  Cable), Brugg, NKT, Silec (formerly Safran), LS  Cable and
Taihan.

TD
ABB received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission, and its parent companies, Hitachi Metals and Sumitomo Electric, received a 45% reduction of the  fine for cooperating with the investigation under the Commission's Leniency Notice. This reduction reflects the timing and level of their cooperation and the extent to which the evidence they provided helped the Commission to prove the cartel. In addition, the latter three companies received partial immunity for the first two years of their cartel involvement, as they were the first to submit evidence to the Commission on the existence of the cartel during that period of time. One company invoked its inability to pay the  fine, but the Commission refused to reduce it. Investment company Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian, is held liable
and has been fined around €36 million.

The companies divided up projects among themselves according to geographical region and also fixed prices. (EL)

The European Commission has found that 11 producers of underground and submarine high voltage power cables operated a cartel, and has imposed fines totalling 301 639 000. Such  cables are typically used to connect generation capacity to the electricity grid or to interconnect  power grids in different countries. From 1999 onwards and for almost ten years, these companies shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost worldwide scale. Part of this plan was to allocate important high voltage power cable projects in the European Economic Area (EEA), including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms.

TD
Most of the world´s largest high voltage  power cable producers, namely ABB, Nexans, Prysmian (previously Pirelli), J-Power Systems (previously Sumitomo Electric and Hitachi Metals), VISCAS (previously Furukawa Electric and Fujikura), EXSYM (previously SWCC Showa and Mitsubishi  Cable), Brugg, NKT, Silec (previously Safran), LS  Cable and Taihan, participated in the illegal agreements. ABB received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice as it was the first to reveal the cartel to the Commission. Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy. Despite this and through joint efforts by several competition authorities around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive agreements and brought them to an
end." Six European, three Japanese and two Korean producers of submarine or underground  power        cables were involved in the  cartel. Several companies that took part in the infringement and later merged their activities into joint ventures are also held liable, as well as parent companies of the producers involved, because they exercised a decisive influence over them. This includes the investment company Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian. The investigation revealed that from 1999 to the inspections carried out by the Commission in January 2009, these producers entered into mutual agreements according to which the European and Asian producers would stay out of each other's home territories and most of the rest of the world would be divided amongst them. In implementing these agreements, the  cartel participants allocated projects between themselves according to the geographic region or customer. In particular, the European companies agreed to allocate projects within the European Economic Area (EEA). The evidence in the Commission's file shows that these agreements were in place for almost ten years. In internal communications the cartelists referred to themselves as the "R", "A" and "K" companies, meaning European, Japanese and Korean companies.

The European Commission Wednesday decided to fine 11 Europe- and Asia-based producers of underground and submarine high voltage electricity cables a total of about Eur302 million ($416 million) for acting as a almost-worldwide  cartel for nearly 10 years starting in 1999.

The European and Asian companies agreed not to compete in each other's home markets and the European companies agreed to collude in allocating new projects between them in Europe, EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters Wednesday in Brussels.

TD
"As a result of ... these illegal agreements, utilities and governments were deprived of a genuine possibility to choose between different providers when planning important energy-infrastructure projects," Almunia said.

Fined were six European companies: ABB, Nexans, Prysmian, Brugg, NKT and Silec; Japan's
EXSYM, J-Power Systems and VISCAS; and two Korea-based companies, Taihan and LS  Cable.

Fines range from Eur750,000 to Eur105 million, depending on the gravity and duration of the  cartel
behavior.

The largest individual fine, of about Eur105 million, was for Prysmian (formerly Pirelli), and comprised an about Eur37 million fine for investment bank Goldman Sachs, which held 100% of Prysmian shares for two years during the cartel period, Almunia said.

The fine imposed on Goldman Sachs made it clear that "investment companies should take a close look at the compliance culture of the companies they invest in," he said.

ABB avoided a potential  fine of Eur33 million by being the first to reveal the  cartel behavior to the EC, Almunia said.

In a statement Wednesday, France's Nexans said it "will review the voluminous decision in detail to determine its next course of action, which could include appeal."

The company added it would "evaluate the consequences of the decision for possible follow-on claims, as well as the impact of this decision and other recent developments in the other ongoing competition authority investigations in the same  cable sector in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia and Korea."

These consequences "could have a material adverse effect on the results of Nexans and its financial situation," the company said.

"The commission regrettably did not take into account the lack of effect on customers, which it is not required to find in order to apply sanctions," Nexans CEO Frederic Vincent and Chief Operating Officer Arnaud Poupart-Lafarge said in a joint statement.
The company stressed that it is "fully committed to compliance with competition laws."

Underground and submarine cables are used to connect  power plants and offshore wind farms to grids, as well as to interconnect grids across borders.

In November 2011, the EC estimated that the EU needs to invest more than Eur100 billion in electricity interconnectors, offshore grids and other onshore transmission in order to help meet 2020 goals to boost renewable energy use and cut carbon emissions.

HD          Cable producer Prysmian  to appeal fine

Milan-listed cable producer Prysmian SpA plans to appeal  fines totaling Eur104.613 million ($144 million) that the European Commission imposed on it and its affiliates following an investigation into an alleged cartel in the underground and submarine high-voltage  power cable sector, the company said Wednesday.

"Prysmian believes that the decision is based on a superficial and erroneous analysis of the relevant facts and, therefore, considers the decision unlawful," the company said in a statement. "Accordingly, Prysmian intends to bring an appeal before the Tribunal of the European Union."

TD
Following an investigation that started in January 2009, the EC issued a decision Wednesday (story,
1151 GMT) that 11  cable manufacturers -- including Prysmian's Italian affiliate Prysmian Cavi e Sistemi
-- participated from February 18, 1999 through January 28, 2009 in anticompetitive practices in the
terrestrial high-voltage  cables and submarine cables European markets.
The EC found Prysmian Cavi e Sistemi jointly liable with Pirelli & C. S.p.A. for the period from 18
February 1999 to 28 July 2005, ordering them to pay a Eur67.31 million  fine, and Prysmian Cavi e
Sistemi jointly liable with Prysmian SpA and The Goldman Sachs Group for the period from July 29,
2005 to January 28, 2009, ordering them to pay a Eur37.303 million  fine, the company said.

Since 2011, Prysmian said it has recognized balance sheet reserves totaling around Eur200 million in relation to the risks linked to the antitrust investigations the the EC and antitrust authorities of the US, Canada and Australia launched.
Prysmian reported a net profit of Eur154 million on sales of Eur7.273 billion in 2013.

The EC handed down  fines totaling Eur301.639 million in its ruling Wednesday, saying six European, three Japanese and two Korean producers of submarine or underground  power cables were involved in the cartel.

For nearly 10 years starting in 1999, "these companies shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost worldwide scale," the EC said Wednesday.

The Prysmian group was hit with the highest  fines. France's Nexans, second on the list with a  fine of Eur70.67 million, said Wednesday (story, 1330 GMT) it would review the decision "to determine its next course of action, which could include appeal."

Goldman Sachs was  fined €37m yesterday as part of an EU  cartel inquiry into subsea  power cables
that highlights the legal risks faced by buyout groups.

The European Commission hit 11 groups with penalties totalling €301m for price rigging, including Prysmian , the Italian cablemaker  formerly owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the investment bank's buyout arm.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the EU antitrust chief, said Goldman was liable for part of the  fine because it exercised a decisive influence on Prysmian for more than three years.

He said the groups in the  cartel "knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy".

While it is common for Europe's top antitrust authority to  fine parent companies when offshoots are embroiled in cartels, it is rare to penalise a primarily financial investor, especially for periods where it held a minority stake.
Goldman's buyout unit bought Prysmian from Pirelli in 2005 for €1.3bn including debt, and floated the
cablemaker  in 2007, leaving it with a 43 per cent holding.
By 2010 it had fully sold down its stake.

Goldman said that it was "important to recognise" that the commission chose to hold the bank jointly and severally liable with Prysmian "solely under its parental liability doctrine".

Penalty of €37m over Prysmian stake
Goldman Sachs was  fined €37m yesterday as part of an EU  cartel inquiry into subsea  power cables
that highlights the legal risks faced by buyout groups.

TD
The European Commission hit 11 groups with penalties totalling €301m for price rigging, including Prysmian , the Italian cablemaker  formerly owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the investment bank's buyout arm.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU antitrust chief, said Goldman was liable for part of the  fine because it exercised a decisive influence on Prysmian for more than three years. He said the groups in the  cartel "knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy".

While it is common for Europe's top antitrust authority to  fine parent companies when offshoots are embroiled in cartels, it is rare to penalise a primarily financial investor, especially for periods where it held a minority stake.
Goldman's buyout unit bought Prysmian from Pirelli in 2005 for €1.3bn including debt, and floated the
cablemaker  in 2007, leaving it with a 43 per cent holding. By 2010 it had fully sold down its stake.

The bank told the commission it was unaware of the effort to rig prices and carve up markets, which started several years before it bought Prysmian.

The commission decision is a warning to buyout groups over legacy legal risks and underscores their responsibility as owners for rooting out and ending any wrongdoing in the business, even when the expertise they bring to the board is primarily financial. Courts have largely backed the commission's approach.

An EU charge sheet sent to Goldman covers 2005-09, including more than a year where Goldman's stake in Prysmian was under 50 per cent.

The commission said the buyout unit was liable to pay a share of Prysmian's  fine because it exercised a decisive influence on Prysmian that went beyond a pure financial investment, including through nominations to the board.
The commission fined 10 cable firms €302m for running a  cartel that lasted for nearly 10 years from
1999. It involved six European, three Japanese and two Korean manufacturers.

Prysmian's penalty was the biggest and was shared between Goldman and Pirelli, its former owner. Nexans, the world's second biggest  cablemaker,  was fined €70m. ABB will not be  fined because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

Goldman said it was "important to recognise" that the commission chose to hold the bank jointly and severally liable with Prysmian "solely under its parental liability doctrine".

"There is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the purported collusive behaviour. Goldman Sachs is considering its rights of appeal," it added.

Eleven companies including Brugg, ABB, and NKT were  fined by the European Commission a total of EUR 301,639,000 for operating a cartel for a period of almost 10 years starting in 1999. The cartel involves high-voltage power cables for underground and submarine applications. Goldman Sachs was also fined since it previously owned Pyrsmian, which is included in the  cartel. Markets were shared and customers were allocated among the companies. ABB will have full immunity from the  fines as it was the first to inform EU authorities of the  cartel.

INVESTMENT bank Goldman Sachs, the world’s top  cablemaker  Prysmian, Nexans and eight  cable companies were fined a total of 302 million euros (US$416 million) by EU antitrust regulators yesterday for running a cartel.

The power cable cartel ran for almost 10 years from 1999, with the firms sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves, the European Union antitrust authority said.

TD
Prysmian received the biggest penalty at 104.6 million euros, which included a joint  fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company through one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.
The European Commission said other cartel members included Japanese cable firms Exsym Corp,
J-Power Systems Corp and Viscas Corp, Korean peer LS  Cable & System and General  Cable Corp via
its subsidiary Silec.

“Part of this plan was to allocate important high voltage  power cable projects in the European Economic Area, including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms,” the commission said.

Danish company NKT Holding, which received a 3.9-million-euro penalty, said it would challenge the decision in court.

Release date - 03042014

The European Commission announced its decision today to fine Silec Cable, a former subsidiary of Sagem, concerning a cartel on high-voltage underground power cables from November 2001 to December 2005.

TD
This fine follows an inquiry initiated by the European Commission in 2009, concerning a  cartel between the main players in the underground and submarine high-voltage power cable sector, from 1999 to 2008.

The Commission took into account Silec  Cable’s limited participation in the  cartel, setting the amount of the fine at 8,567,000 euros. This  fine will not have a significant impact on the Group’s results because of provisions that were previously set aside.

Safran, formed by the merger of Snecma and Sagem in 2005, sold Silec  Cable to General  Cable in December 2005, and was totally unaware of the practices that have been incriminated. Safran confirms its commitment to strict compliance with all competition laws and regulations. Right from its creation, Safran deployed a legal department including a unit dedicated to competition law.

Safran is a leading international high-technology group with three core businesses: Aerospace (propulsion and equipment), Defence and Security. Operating worldwide, the Group has 66,200 employees and generated sales of 14.7 billion euros in 2013. Working alone or in partnership, Safran holds world or European leadership positions in its core markets. The Group invests heavily in Research & Development to meet the requirements of changing markets, including expenditures of 1.8 billion Euros in 2013. Safran is listed on NYSE Euronext Paris and is part of the CAC40 index.

European Commissionfines of €302 million on Korean, European and Japanese companies for operating a cartel in underground and submarine high voltage  power cables might not normally get the pulse racing.

However, when those  fined includes Goldman Sachs, it gets interesting. The bank has been punished because at the time of the offences, one of the miscreants, Prysmian, an Italian  cable producer, was owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the bank's buyout arm.

TD
The case has huge implications for private equity. It is the first in which a private equity fund has been punished for cartel offences by one of its portfolio firms. Before, a couple of cases involving German and Slovak investors aside, the Commission had not done this.

Its motivation is clear. As Simon Holmes, head of competition at the law firm King & Wood Mallesons SJ Berwin notes, because  fines are levied as a proportion of a miscreant's turnover, attributing liability up the corporate structure lets the Commission raise the punishment. It may also encourage buyout firms to take a greater interest in the conduct of portfolio companies.
Another precedent set by this case is that Goldman was still  fined despite no longer owning a stake in
Prysmian. The bank is appealing. Private equity firms everywhere will hope it is successful.

It is not without reason that Mark Barnett, the Invesco Perpetual fund manager saddled with succeeding Neil Woodford, was yesterday being compared with David Moyes, the under-fire Manchester United manager.

Both have succeeded long-running, much-garlanded predecessors and, just as results have not gone well for Mr Moyes at United, Mr Barnett has also lost mandates. Yesterday he had to look on as St James’s Place, the wealth manager, took £7.7 billion worth of business away from Invesco Perpetual.

TD
But there the comparison ends. Adding insult to Mr Barnett’s injury, SJP has handed half of the funds it has taken from him to Mr Woodford’s new venture. At least Sir Alex Ferguson sits behind Mr Moyes in the stands, rather than in the opposing team’s dugout.

And Mr Barnett has also been hurt by other factors. Last week, Invesco Perpetual moved the High Income fund previously run by Mr Woodford and now by Mr Barnett from the Investment Management Association’s UK Equity Income sector and into the IMA’s UK All Companies sector, amid fears that it would no longer be able to hit the former category’s three-year yield target. This is likely to have have spurred many other investors to take their money elsewhere.

So perhaps the most apposite comparison, then, is not between Messrs Barnett and Moyes but between Invesco Perpetual and the Glazer family.

An own goal

Page 77 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
England fans visiting Brazil this summer should not ask locals about the cost of living. The central bank raised its main policy rate late on Wednesday, from 10.75 per cent to 11 per cent, its ninth increase since last April.
The rises may now be over but this will console few in an economy that has barely grown in two years
— as noted by Standard & Poor’s, which last week cut Brazil’s credit rating to “junk” — and where
inflation, after a drought-induced food price spike, is almost 6 per cent.

It’s not all Brazil’s fault. Ultra-low US interest rates after 2008 sent hot money into Brazil, stoking inflation. Brasilia’s attempts to deter these flows then sent it the other way, just as it was needed to fund long overdue infrastructure work.

But the pain is also self-inflicted. The mentality of past hyper-inflation lingers which, combined with sclerotic labour laws, emboldens workers to push for inflationary pay deals in a tight market. Adding to this is government spending on populist measures, introduced after last year’s riots, ahead of the World Cup.

None of this will change until after October’s presidential election. Best stick to chatting about the weather or footy.
French fancy

Mr Bricolage, company history states, was born in the 1960s when a group of French do-it-yourself entrepreneurs ganged up on suppliers by sharing their addresses.

There is sense in Kingfisher now tapping into that combined address book. While market share is not the be-all-and-end-all, Mr Bricolage would take the B&Q owner from second to first place, giving it further buying  power and, crucially, taking it into town-centre and convenience formats in which its existing French outlets, Castorama and Brico Dépôt, do not operate. It is possible some of those formats, particularly where they are loss-making, could be converted into those of Kingfisher.

At the mooted price, Sir Ian Cheshire, the Kingfisher chief executive, could also be getting of a bargain, as Mr Bricolage’s market capitalisation and debt is worth only 6.8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared with 9.1 times for Kingfisher.
Trade secrets

It says a lot about how low expectations — or the UK Listing Authority’s standards — have fallen that some in this newsroom considered it not bad going that the prospectus for Just Eat landed at 2.30pm yesterday. Why, the shares had only been changing hands for six and a half hours by then.
In the old days, investors, analysts and independent commentators had much more information
before a company’s flotation than now. As with so many bad things in the London market, this issue of
access to pre-float information appears to have come from the US, where lawyers have long held
sway.

Just Eat’s whacky valuation could also have come from the US. Its enterprise value is now 15 times that of last year’s sales. The same metric for Ocado, itself a stock many regard as dangerously
over-valued, is just 3.5 times sales.

HD       Goldman fine demonstrates need to be alert

From Mr Simon Holmes.

Sir, We were pleased to see the FT's coverage of the European Commission's €37.3m  fine on Goldman Sachs for its connections with companies found to have operated a cartel in subsea power    cables ("Goldman  fined for EU cable cartel link", April 2). The possibility that private equity investors could be held liable for the actions of their investee companies is something that has received coverage in the specialist world of private equity but it is a risk and concern that deserves wider attention.

TD
First, there was no suggestion that either Goldman or its employees had knowledge of, or involvement in, the anti-competitive behaviour.

Second, it is not necessary for the investor to have either 100 per cent control or even control in the normal sense of corporate law. The commission says it is sufficient for the investor (for example a fund manager) to have "decisive influence" over the commercial policy of the investee company. This might be conferred by, for example, voting rights, rights to appoint senior management and/or veto rights over matters such as the annual budget or business plan.

This is not the first time investors have been  fined, but with Goldman receiving a  fine of this magnitude it is clearly something to which investors can no longer afford to turn a blind eye. An investor (whether private equity or trade) needs to be alert to competition law risks relating to their investments. This holds true both when conducting due diligence and subsequently by ensuring that competition compliance programmes sit alongside other regular audits.

HD      Commission Holds Goldman Sachs Liable For Former Portfolio Company’s Antitrust Infringement

In its decision of 2 April 2014 in relation to the underground and submarine high voltage  power cables    cartel case, the European Commission (Commission) held the parent companies of the producers involved liable, on the basis that they had exercised decisive influence over the producers. One of the businesses found liable was Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian, which is one of the companies that allegedly participated in the  cartel. This case confirms that, in principle, the Commission does not view private equity funds differently to other businesses for the purpose of the application of the parental liability doctrine.

TD
In its decision of 2 April 2014 in relation to the underground and submarine high voltage  power cables    cartel case (COMP/39610), the  European Commission (Commission) held the parent companies of the producers involved liable, on the basis that they had exercised decisive influence over the producers. The fines levied by the Commission in this case totalled €301.6 million. One of the businesses found liable was Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian, which is one of the companies that allegedly participated in the  cartel.

This case has important implications for private equity funds. It confirms that, in principle, the Commission does not view private equity funds differently to other businesses for the purpose of the application of the parental liability doctrine.
Parental Liability

Under the parental liability doctrine, the Commission can attribute liability to a parent company that exercises a "decisive influence" over a subsidiary entity. Decisive influence is presumed for a
wholly-owned subsidiary, and it is extremely difficult for parent companies to rebut the presumption in practice. Any economic, organisational or legal link between the parent and the entity would, in principle, be sufficient to meet the decisive influence test, which is why portfolio companies of private equity funds fall within its scope.

Parental liability may arise even after the disposal of a subsidiary or portfolio company. Goldman Sachs acquired Prysmian in 2005 through its private equity fund and completely divested it in 2010. The fact that Goldman Sachs' private equity fund no longer owned Prysmian did not prevent the Commission from
fining Goldman Sachs, as it was the entity ultimately exercising decisive influence over Prysmian at the time of the alleged infringements.

This is not the first time that the Commission has imposed  fines on private equity funds for alleged infringements by their portfolio companies. In 2009, the Commission  fined the German company SKW Stahl-Metallurgie (SKW) and its former parent companies, amongst which the investment company Arques Industries, for alleged participation in the calcium carbide  cartel from 2004 to 2007. During that period, SKW was owned by several parent companies and the Commission held each one liable for its
respective period of ownership. The Commission's decision was confirmed by the EU General Court in 23
January 2014.
Next Steps
In order to minimise potential risks, private equity firms should take the following steps:


Page 80 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Determine whether or not their due diligence processes are sufficient to cover potential antitrust law infringements by prospective subsidiaries.

Ensure that existing and prospective subsidiaries have in place tailored and effective antitrust compliance programmes and codes of ethics, and that these are rigorously implemented. Such programs and codes should, amongst other things, provide for the dismissal of employees and directors who fail or refuse to comply with antitrust rules. In Parker ITR and Parker-Hannifin v Commission T-146/09 (currently under appeal), the General Court dismissed Parker's argument that the conduct of its subsidiary's directors prevented Parker from exercising its control over the subsidiary. The General Court held that there was nothing to prevent Parker from dismissing the directors who deliberately ignored the group's code of
ethics which, amongst other things, prohibited its employees from taking part in collusive activities.

Consider the feasibility of contractual arrangements that provide for allocation of liability between infringers and parent companies, and/or indemnity. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that such clauses might be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions.

Private equity funds are well advised to consider carefully the potential implications of the conduct of their portfolio companies as they may be exposed to potential significant liabilities in case of antirust infringements. The fact that private equity funds are only involved in the high level strategy and commercial policy of their portfolio companies does not exclude them from liability under the parental liability doctrine.

HD      EU Decision  May Expand Competition Law Exposure  For Private Equity And Financial  Investors

On 2 April 2014, the European Commission announced significant  fines involving what it described as a global cartel in the high-voltage power cable industry. In itself, this is not major news; the fact of an investigation in this industry has long been known. But the decision did make news in one potentially significant respect -- holding that a leading financial investor was liable for having allegedly exercised decisive influence over one of the companies allegedly participating in the  cartel.

This is potentially a very significant step for the Commission, and if upheld on appeal (if that takes place) and followed in the future, it would substantially increase the risk exposure for private equity and financial investors that hold controlling voting rights in companies that become entangled in antitrust proceedings
in Europe.

TD
In the power cable case, the European Commission refused to differentiate the temporary financial investor from an industrial parent company. It concluded that the presumption of "decisive influence" that rests with any parent holding 100 percent of shares in a company applies equally to financial investors unless rebutted, and in this case concluded that the presumption had not be rebutted.

The Commission's findings in this case follow recent developments at the level of the General Court. In the 1.garantovana case (2012), the Court upheld the Commission's decision finding a financial investor company liable for a breach of competition law by its affiliate. The Court ruled that a purely financial investor "holds shares in a company in order to make profit, but...refrains from any involvement in its management and its control." The Court confirmed its case law that the parental liability must be
assessed on the basis of the economic, organizational and legal links that exist within a group which vary from case to case and are not exhaustive. In the  power cable case, the Commission concluded that the investor was not a purely financial investor because, in the Commission's view, it had sufficient involvement in the management of the company found to have committed the violation.

This decision has serious potential consequences for private equity investments in companies that operate in Europe (and thus are subject to EU competition laws). A case by case determination is effectively no standard at all, and certainly not a predictable one for financial investors who do not want to assume this kind of exposure. In addition, placing the burden of proof on the investor, when there are no well-defined standard or criteria, means as a practical matter that no financial investor can know whether
it is likely to have direct exposure to Commission sanctions until the Commission issues its final decision. This uncertainty creates significant issues for financial investors, not only with respect to the governance issues related to the company in which it is investing but in how to evaluate and describe the potential risks it is undertaking with the investment.

If this approach is affirmed on appeal (assuming there is one) or otherwise stands, private equity and other financial investors will have to take great care in exactly how they monitor their investments, so that they do not get trapped into potential direct financial exposure where they never in fact intended to exercise direct operational control over the company in which they invested. It is not clear that the Commission has fully considered all of the consequences of this approach, which likely does not enhance the deterrence or appropriate punishment of competitive misconduct but may deter desirable financial investments.

preliminary complaint concerning 12 company groups involving 27 companies, alleging that the
companies had participated in a  cartel to restrict competition on submarine and underground high voltage
projects from 1999 to 2009. It was found out that the Company's subsidiaries participated in  cartel for
different periods of time, with the Grupo General  Cable Sistemas participated from January 2003 to May
2007, while Silec Cable participated for more than 10 months since December 2005. The full analyst

HD        European Commissionfines 10 copper cable producers

LONDON — The  European Commission has fined 10 copper cable producers, including Nexans SA and Prysmian SpA, €310 million ($426.5 million) for allegedly rigging underground and subsea  cable supply tenders and colluding to carve up sales in regional markets.

The commission’s investigation is part of a worldwide probe into a pricing ring operated by  cable producers for nearly 10 years beginning in 1999. Six European, three Japanese and two South Korean companies were fined April 2 after a five-year investigation.

TD
"These producers entered into mutual agreements according to which the European and Asian producers would stay out of each other’s home territories and most of the rest of the world would be divided amongst them," the commission said.

Acting on a tip-off from Swiss  cartel member ABB Ltd., the commission raided the offices of a dozen companies in 2009 and formally charged the companies with allocating markets and  fixing  global copper cable prices in 2011.

After defenses were heard in the European Commission’s case in 2012, the scope of the investigation was scaled back to exclude the investigation of cartel activities in markets other than the underground and subsea cable markets.

Italy’s Prysmian set aside €207 million ($284.8 million) in provisions for risks and charges related to investigations launched by the commission and other regulators in the United States and Canada. The company, along with former owners Pirelli & C. SpA and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was ordered to pay
€104 million ($$143.1 million) April 2. The investment bank, which bought, floated and sold out of
Prysmian between 2005 and 2010, is jointly liable for €37.3 million ($51.3 million), the commission said.

Prysmian also faces an investigation in Brazil for which it has not provisioned, according to its last annual report.

France’s Nexans set aside €200 million ($275.1 million) in provisions, and since the 2009 raid has warned investors that an adverse ruling could have a material effect on the group’s financial position, even excluding the potential  fine imposed by the commission. The company was  fined €70.7 million ($97.3 million) by the commission April 2. Its shares rose as much as 5.5 percent following the announcement.
Nexans has not made provisions for potential  fines arising from related investigations in Australia, South
Korea, the United States, Brazil or Canada.

The eight other companies  fined by the commission were J-Power Systems Corp., Viscas Corp., EXSYM Corp., Brugg Kabel AB, NKT Holding A/S, Silec Cable, LS Cable & System Ltd. and Taihan Electric Wire Co. Ltd.

ABB received immunity from €33 million ($45.4 million) in  fines for revealing the existence of the  cartel. J-Power Systems and parent companies Hitachi Metals Ltd. and Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. received a 45-percent reduction of the  fine for cooperating with the investigation.

HD       Cartel Fines: Liability Of Private Equity Funds

The European Commission has held Goldman Sachs jointly and severally liable for a  cartel infringement committed by Prysmian, an Italian  cable maker formerly owned by Goldman Sachs' private equity arm. The decision is a stark reminder that EU competition law allows the corporate veil to be readily pierced and that private equity companies are no exception.
The Power Cables Decision

TD
The European Commission has found that 11 producers of underground and submarine high voltage
power cables operated a cartel; it has imposed  fines totalling EUR 302 million.1

Goldman Sachs (GS) has been held liable for the infringement. There is no allegation that GS actually participated in, or was even aware of, the alleged  cartel. Rather, the Commission imposed a  fine on GS purely on the basis of its parental liability doctrine because GS, through its private investment fund GS Capital Partners, held a stake in Prysmian, a  cable manufacturer, at the time of the alleged  cartel infringement.2

The Commission has frequently been successful in imputing, in case of a  cartel infringement, the illegal conduct of a subsidiary to its parent. The  fine imposed on GS makes clear that EU competition law allows the corporate veil to be readily pierced and that private equity companies are no exception.
Parental Liability - Principles Applicable in the European Union

In the EU, it is established case law that, in case of a  cartel infringement, the conduct of a subsidiary may be attributed to the parent company even if the parent did not participate in, or was not aware of, the alleged cartel. This is particularly the case where the parent exercises "decisive influence" over the conduct of its subsidiary.3 In practice, the test is easy for the Commission to satisfy. Liability may be imputed to the parent even if its influence only has to do with high level strategy or commercial policy.

The Commission cannot, however, merely find that the parent is in a position to exercise decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary; it must also check whether that influence was actually exercised.4Where a parent company holds (almost) all of the capital in a subsidiary, there is a rebuttable presumption that the parent exercises decisive influence over its subsidiary.5 In the absence of a (nearly)
100% shareholding, the Commission must adduce evidence of the exercise of decisive influence.6

The so-called "100% presumption" is rebuttable. A parent company may rebut the presumption of exertion of decisive influence "by demonstrating that it exercised restraint and did not influence the market conduct of its subsidiary."7 But the rebuttal has proven a "very difficult onus to discharge."8
The "Pure Financial Investor" Defence

A number of parents have avoided liability for  cartel infringement by their subsidiaries, successfully arguing that they behaved like pure financial investors.9 However, private equity companies cannot expect the "pure financial investor" argument to succeed each time.

A "pure financial investor" is an investor who holds shares in a company in order to make a profit, but who refrains from any involvement in its management and in its control.10 In Calcium Carbide and Magnesium11, the Commission held Arques, a private equity company specializing in the acquisition and

Page 90 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
restructuring of companies in distress, jointly and severally liable for the illegal behaviour of its subsidiary, SKW.12 The Commission relied on the parental liability principles to attribute the illegal  cartel behaviour of the portfolio company to the parent company.

Arques argued that, as a financial investor, it focused on strategic decisions and never took any business decision, given its lack of know-how and experience of the operative business. The private equity company conceded receiving information on turnover, result, cash-flow and liquidity planning or on the progress of the restructuring process of the subsidiary, but did not consider this to be an indicator of
influence over its subsidiary's conduct. The Commission and the General Court dismissed the arguments, pointing out in particular that (i) Arques closely monitored the restructuring process and (ii) the private equity company had the interests of the group in mind when taking decisions in relation to its portfolio company such as whether the subsidiary should be sold and for which price.13

This precedent confirms the difficulty of successfully asserting the "pure financial investor" defence. Private equity funds may be at risk whenever they exercise decisive influence over the conduct of one of their portfolio companies, even where their interests in their subsidiaries have subsequently been divested. Accordingly, it is important that private equity funds and investors devise mitigating strategies
What to Do to Avoid Risks?

Prevention is key. Robust and effective competition compliance programmes should be implemented to (i) disseminate adequate knowledge within the parent and portfolio companies of how to avoid infringements of competition law and (ii) encourage internal reporting for employees to speak up when they are confronted with questionable situations.

Thorough due diligence process on competition risks must be undertaken when considering any potential investment.

Appropriate antitrust warranties and indemnities and other contractual provisions, though not constituting cast-iron guarantees, should be considered when acquiring portfolio companies, such as contractual allocation clauses that enable recourse to the seller if a  fine is imposed. The provisions would ideally need to survive after the private equity fund has exited the investment.

If practically possible, ensure that no decisive influence is exercised over portfolio companies, i.e., the private equity house should not exercise any operational, commercial and/or strategic influence over the business.

The decision serves as a salutary reminder that private equity funds may find themselves punished for the activities of their subsidiaries. The notion of control will be key and it is possible to have a decisive influence without direct control.

HD      Statnett alert to cartel issues

Alerted by the  European Commission of possible cartel activity among  cable suppliers, Norwegian transmission system operator Statnett is reviewing its own  cable purchases to see whether it has paid
too much for some deliveries. Announcing this in a recent press release, the state-owned TSO said that if it could prove that Statnett had paid an “excessive price" for some deliveries in the past as a result of "illegal price cooperation", it would seek redress from the suppliers concerned. Recalling that Statnett is "about to undertake large purchases" in connection with its grid upgrade plans, executive vice president Haakon Borgen said: "We are also aware of this type of risk [cartel price fixing]  when we enter new negotiations.”

TD
The European Commission on April 2 fined 11 cable manufacturers €302 million for acting as an international cartel for nearly 10 years from 1999. The European and Asian companies agreed not to compete in each other's home markets and the European companies agreed to collude in allocating new projects between them in Europe, EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

"As a result of these illegal agreements, utilities and governments were deprived of a genuine possibility to choose between different providers when planning important energy-infrastructure projects," Almunia said.

Fined were six European companies: ABB, Nexans, Prysmian, Brugg, NKT and Silec; Japan's EXSYM, J-Power Systems and VISCAS; and two Korea-based companies, Taihan and LS  Cable. Fines range from €750,000 to €105 million, depending on the gravity and duration of the  cartel behavior.

The largest individual  fine, of about €105 million, was for Prysmian (formerly Pirelli), and comprised an about €37 million fine for investment bank Goldman Sachs, which held 100% of Prysmian shares for two years during the cartel period, Almunia said.

ABB avoided a potential  fine of €33 million by being the first to reveal the  cartel behavior to the EC, Almunia said. Meanwhile France's Nexans said it "will review the voluminous decision in detail to determine its next course of action, which could include appeal."

LP
2014 APR 16 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Newsweekly -- General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) announced that the European Commission has issued a decision on the liability of producers of submarine and underground high voltage power cables for infringement of European competition law. The  Power Cables Case was initiated by a Statement of Objections or preliminary complaint in June 2011 addressed to twelve (12) company groups involving twenty-seven (27) companies alleging that the companies had participated in a  cartel to restrict competition on submarine and underground high voltage projects from 1999 to 2009. The Statement of Objections further alleged that two subsidiaries of General  Cable, its Spanish subsidiary, Grupo General Cable Sistemas, and its French subsidiary, Silec  Cable, had participated in the  cartel for different periods of time.

TD
In particular, the Commission claimed that Grupo General  Cable Sistemas was involved from January
2003 to May 2007, and that Silec  Cable was involved for ten (10) months after its acquisition from Safran
SA by General  Cable in December 2005.

Following formal responses to the Commission's Statement of Objections and a hearing, claims of infringement against Grupo General Cable Sistemas have been dismissed for lack of evidence of alleged cartel activity. With regard to Silec Cable, the Commission's decision imposed a  fine of 1,852,500 Euros (approximately $2.5 million) related to the period Silec  Cable has been owned by General  Cable. This fine was based on participation that allegedly commenced well before Silec  Cable was acquired by General Cable.

General Cable is currently reviewing the  European Commission's decision and is considering whether to appeal the Commission decision based on established precedent. General  Cable will also continue to pursue its rights to claim full indemnification for the Silec  Cable fine under the previously disclosed terms of the acquisition agreement with Safran SA executed in 2005.

General Cable (NYSE:BGC), a Fortune 500 Company, is a global leader in the development, design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum and fiber optic wire and  cable products for the energy, industrial, construction, specialty and communications markets.

European Commissionfines power cable producers for participation in  cartel

TD
Click hereThe European Commission has imposed fines totalling €302 million on 11 producers of underground and submarine high voltage power cables for their involvement in a market and customer sharing cartel that lasted for ten years and operated throughout most of the world. Most of the world's largest high voltage power cable producers participated in the illegal agreements, including ABB, Nexans, Prysmian, J-Power Systems, VISCAS, EXSYM, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS  Cable and Taihan. ABB received full immunity from fines under the Commission's Leniency Notice since it was the first to reveal the  cartel to the Commission. J-Power Systems (and its parents) received a 45% reduction of the  fine for cooperating with the investigation under the Commission's Leniency Notice. They also received partial immunity for the first two years of their cartel involvement, since they were the first to provide the Commission with evidence of the cartel during that time. .

The Commission found that the companies had, over six years, colluded to discuss key components of their prices in the EEA and had also agreed not to compete on price for certain customers. Three  cartel participants received 10% reductions in their  fines based on their agreement to settle the case with the Commission. A fourth  cartel participant received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's Leniency Notice. .

The Advocate General considered that the ECJ should dismiss Nexans' claims which allege that the General Court wrongly rejected Nexans' argument that the dawn raid was insufficiently precise and overly broad in its geographic scope. Rather, AG Kokott considered that the Commission had sufficiently specified the subject-matter and purpose of the inspections. .

TFEU had been infringed was the Commission's Decision of 3 December 2003, and that once the time for the appellant to appeal against that Decision had expired (on 13 February 2004), the respondents had

HD      Background Note - The EU Power Cables Case: Antitrust Parental Liability Of Private Equity
Management Companies
BY      Thomas Verstraeten

On 2 April 2014, the  European Commission imposed fines totalling EUR 301.6 million on eleven producers of underground and submarine high voltage power cables for their participation in an alleged bid-rigging scheme. (Please click here for the Commission's press release). The decision is striking in that the Commission has significantly expanded its "parental liability" doctrine by applying it to a private equity management company in respect of an infringement committed by a portfolio company: it held fund manager Goldman Sachs Capital Partners jointly and severally liable for part of the EUR 104.6 million
fine it imposed on Prysmian, an Italian  cable maker that was acquired, for part of the alleged
infringement period, by GS Capital Partners V, a fund managed by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. This
note sets out the background of this decision and suggests various ways to mitigate this new antitrust
risk.
The Commission's Parental Liability Doctrine

TD
In the EU, competition rules are addressed at "undertakings", that concept being defined as entities or groups of entities (companies or otherwise) that operate as a single economic unit. (This holds true both at central EU level and under the national competition rules of the 28 EU member states.)

Where an infringement of the competition rules is committed by a company that is part of a group, the Commission and EU national competition authorities have drawn on this technical definition to impose fines not only on that company, but also, under joint and several liability, on its ultimate parent company. This approach, which is referred to as the "Parental Liability Doctrine", aims at enhancing the deterrent effect of  fines and at preventing the parent company from allowing the subsidiary to go bankrupt in order to escape the  fine.

Although this approach results in a situation where the corporate veil between the subsidiary concerned and its parent companies is pierced, the latter are not  fined because of any independent, direct or indirect, involvement in or awareness or encouragement of the infringement, but merely because the parent companies are part of the same "undertaking" as the subsidiary that directly committed the infringement. This approach has been validated from the outset by the EU Courts (see, e.g., Case
107/82, AEG v. Commission [1983] ECR 3151, para. 50) and is automatically applied, in antitrust cases involving subsidiaries, by all EU competition authorities, i.e. both by the Commission and by the EU's 28 national competition authorities.
Expanding the Parental Liability Doctrine

A parent company and its subsidiaries will constitute a single economic unit when the parent can exercise "decisive influence" over the subsidiary, the standard of proof being that the subsidiary carries out, in all material respects, the instructions of the parent company.

In principle, it is not sufficient for an EU competition authority to merely find that the parent company is in a position to exercise decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary: it must demonstrate that influence was actually exercised. In practice, however, this test is relatively easy to satisfy: liability may be imposed on the parent even if its influence only relates to high level strategy or commercial policy and does not entail day to day instructions on how to run the business.

This doctrine has already been expanded in various ways.
Page 101 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
First, under a rebuttable presumption rule recognized by the EU Courts, a 100% or near-100% shareholding gives rise to the rebuttable presumption that the parent has indeed exercised decisive influence over its subsidiary (Case C-97/08 P, Akzo Nobel and Others v. Commission [2009] ECR I-8237, para. 60). As a result, it is sufficient for the competition authority to prove that (almost) all of the capital in the subsidiary is held by the parent to attribute parental liability. (In the absence of a near 100% stake, the competition authority must prove the actual exercise of decisive influence). That presumption can in principle be rebutted by showing that the subsidiary has actually acted quite independently from its
parent, but such a defence has so far never been accepted by the EU Courts.

Secondly, the EU Courts have accepted that, where the infringing company is a joint venture, parental liability can be applied to both joint venture partners, allowing for the strange reasoning that the joint venture acts as a single economic unit with both of its parents (See Cases C-171/12 P Du Pont de Nemours/Commission and C-179/12 P Dow Chemical/Commission).

Thirdly, the text for an EU Directive on antitrust damage claims voted on 17 April 2014 by the EP also refers, when it comes to defining the claims concerned, the word "undertaking", which is certain to open the door for parental liability claims in private damage cases. (Please click here for the text voted by the EP).
The Parental Liability Doctrine applied to Financial Investors and Private Equity Companies

In a first step to expand its Parental Liability Doctrine to entities that participate in a company for financial reasons only, the Commission targeted financial investors.

In the Calcium Carbide Case, the Commission held Arques and 1. garantovaná, private equity companies specializing in the direct acquisition and restructuring of companies in distress, jointly and severally liable for infringements committed by their respective subsidiaries SKW and NCHZ (Commission decision of 22
July 2009 in Case COMP/39.396). Both companies argued that they acted as pure financial investors and were not involved in management decisions of SKW and NCHZ, but these arguments were dismissed by the Commission and, on appeal, by the EU General Court (Case T-392/09, 1. garantovaná a.s. v. Commission, not yet published, para. 52; and Case T-395/09, Gigaset AG v. Commission, not yet published), para. 26 a.f.).

Arques argued that it focused on strategic and restructuring decisions and did not engage in portfolio company business decisions, because it lacked the know-how to do so. It did receive information on turnover, results, cash-flow, liquidity planning and it monitored the restructuring process, but did not consider this decisive influence. The Commission and the General Court, however, dismissed these arguments, indicating that (i) Arques closely monitored the restructuring process and (ii) the private equity company had the interests of the group in mind when taking decisions in relation to its portfolio company such as whether the subsidiary should be sold and for which price.

In earlier cases, however, investor companies have been able to escape parental liability by arguing that they behaved like pure financial investors, without actively becoming involved with the business decisions of the portfolio company (See, e.g., Commission decision of 20 October 2004 in Case COMP/38.238 - Raw Tobacco Spain, para. 383).

The next step is to look at portfolio management companies. In the Shrimp Case, in which it  fined three North Sea shrimp traders for a total of EUR 28.7 million, a fourth  cartel member having received immunity, the Commission refrained from imposing a  fine on private equity company Gilde Buy Out Partners in relation to the behaviour of portfolio company Heiploeg (Case COMP/AT.39633 - Shrimps). It has now crossed the Rubicon in the  Power Cables Case.
The Parental Liability Doctrine applied to GS Capital Partners in the  Power Cables Case

GS Capital Partners V is an investment fund managed by GS Capital Partners, a full Goldman Sachs subsidiary. Under a management agreement with the fund, GS Capital Partners exercises the voting
rights in respect of the fund's portfolio companies. Another Goldman Sachs entity also invests in the fund, having committed $ 2.5 billion, or 30%, of the fund's total capital.

In July 2005, the fund acquired Prysmian SA from Pirelli. In 2007, Prysmian held an IPO, reducing the shares held by the fund to 31.8%. In 2009, the fund sold its last shares.
In its decision, the Commission takes the view that Prysmian has participated in a  cartel that lasted from
1999 to 2009. It applies the Parental Liability Doctrine to GS Capital Partners. Although the decision has
not been made public and cannot, therefore, be analysed in detail, the Commission points at the following
elements in its press release:

During the period 2005-2007, GS Capital Partners held 100% of the voting rights in Prysmian, which enabled it to remove and nominate the board of directors at any time;

The decisive influence is deemed to continue even after GS Capital Partners reduced its stake to 31.8% in 2007 because it still had employees, rather than representatives, sitting on Prysmian's board of directors;
This board representation and certain voting rights still enabled GS Capital Partners to be involved in
Prysmian's management decisions; and
GS Capital Partners was regularly updated on Prysmian through monthly reports.

In his speech introducing the decision, Competition Commissioner Almunia issued a clear warning to financial investors and private equity management companies:

"I would like to highlight the responsibility of groups of companies, up to the highest level of the corporate structure, to make sure that they fully comply with competition rules. This responsibility is the same for investment companies, who should take a careful look at the compliance culture of the companies they invest in."
(Please click here for the full text of the speech.) Open issues
This decision and similar decisions that are pending in various EU member states raise various issues.

First, GS Capital Partners will certainly challenge the question of principle whether a private equity portfolio manager (as opposed to a private equity company that invests itself in a subsidiary) can indeed be deemed to operate as a single economic unit with the portfolio companies of the fund it manages. The company only manages the fund on behalf of the investors. It may exercise certain voting rights in order
to protect the financial interests of the fund, but usually does not involved itself with core business decisions or coordinate the market behaviour of various portfolio companies.

If that hurdle is overcome, the case also raises specific issues relating to the concept of "decisive influence": was it enough for GS Capital Partners to have certain voting rights, or was the nomination of GS employees as Prysmian board members decisive in attributing parental liability? Can a distinction be drawn, in relation to the voting rights, between active voting rights requiring the portfolio manager to
agree with certain decisions, and negative voting rights, enabling it to intervene in certain specific cases? Can a distinction be drawn, in terms of representation in two-tier systems, between the managing board and the supervisory board?
How can private equity portfolio management companies protect themselves?

Pending clarification of these issues, private equity firms should consider appropriate risk mitigation strategies for dealing with the antitrust risk relating to portfolio companies.

To prevent is always better than to cure. Effective competition compliance programmes should be implemented both at the level of the private equity management company and at the level of its portfolio companies.

Risks can also be mitigated by avoiding the near-100% area where a competition authority can rely on the rebuttable presumption that there has been decisive influence, by avoiding to appoint employees as board members and by preferring negative control rights above positive control rights.
In the selection of potential investments, a thorough competition risk due diligence should be undertaken. Warranties and indemnities and other contractual provisions should be tailored to account for anti-trust
risks.

Portfolio management companies may choose to take out a separate insurance covering theses same risks.
