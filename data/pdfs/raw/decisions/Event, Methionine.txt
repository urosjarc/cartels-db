Degussa, the German chemical group, its French rival Aventis and Japan's Nippon Soda face
multi-million euro fines from European regulators for a long conspiracy to fix the price of a chicken
feed additive.

The European Commission is believed to be in the final stages of a probe into allegations that the three companies fixed prices for  methionine - a protein  supplement used in animal food - for more than a decade.

TD
The exact amount of the  fines will be decided over the next few weeks but competition lawyers said that similar offences could trigger penalties of at least EUR20m ($19.5m) per company.

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover but it usually levies much smaller penalties.
The commission declined to comment.

The Brussels regulators will have to weigh up the severity and length of the  cartel with the fact the companies did not contest the main charges and also provided the authorities with information.

Under European Union competition rules, companies that co-operate with the authorities can benefit from large discounts on  fines levied against them.

In this case, it is understood that Aventis is likely to receive a significant reduction in the penalty because it was the first company to alert the  Commission to the existence of the  cartel.
Degussa and Nippon Soda should also receive a discount for their co-operation. The three companies account for the bulk of world  methionine production.
Degussa, the world's number one producer of  methionine, said it had made "adequate provisions" for the fines but declined to comment on the specific size of the provisions. Aventis said it had co-operated with the investigation, but declined to say whether it had made provisions for the  fines.
Nippon Soda was unavailable for comment.
The two European producers also face a number of lawsuits from  methionine customers in the US. Aventis sold its animal nutrition business to CVC Capital Partners last year but retained liability for
anti-trust issues related to  methionine. Since last year, the Brussels authorities have renewed their
efforts to crack down on various cartels.
Several recent decisions have focused on markets for chemicals and food, including the largest ever
fine - a EUR855m penalty on eight companies for fixing the prices of vitamins.

Mr Monti imposed the record  fine last November and strongly criticised BASF of Germany and Roche, its Swiss rival, for leading the nine-year conspiracy.

BRUSSELS, June 26 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to  fine Degussa AG and Nippon Soda Co Ltd next week for fixing the price of a chemical used to promote growth in pigs and poultry, a source close to the case said on Wednesday.
A third company - Aventis - was also implicated in the price-fixing case involving the amino acid      
methionine, the source said.

TD
Aventis has avoided  fines in other price-fixing cases by taking advantage of an amnesty provided by both Brussels and Washington to the first firm to report a  cartel, which may also happen in this case.
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Degussa said the firm had made an adequate provision for a  fine
in this case. That provision was mentioned in its annual report earlier this year.
"Purely as a precaution, the annual financial statements contain adequate provisions for possible
fines and claims for compensation," the firm said in its report.
Nippon Soda acknowledged in March it was under investigation by the  Commission.

On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Aventis at its Strasbourg headquarters declined comment on the case.

Earlier this year, the  Commission said that it was looking into a  cartel on methionine, which is added to animal feed to promote growth.
"The Commission is investigating the existence of a suspected  cartel in the methionine market,"
European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told reporters in March.
The methionine investigation has also been taken up by private firms.

In August, DuCoa LP investment fund and general partner DCV sued the predecessor firm to Aventis, as well as Degussa, Mitsui & Co. Ltd , Nippon Soda and related entities for alleged  price-fixing of methionine, according to papers filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.

At the time, DuCoa said the defendant companies and their affiliates accounted for 88 percent of the worldwide production of  methionine, which "exceeds $1 billion a year."
DCV, successor in 1997 to a joint venture of the DuPont Co. and ConAgra Foods Inc. , uses
methionine in animal feed and nutrition products it sells throughout the United States.
Mitsui & Co said earlier this year it was not under investigation by the EU for fixing the price of
methionine.

On 2 Jul the  European Commission will announce its decision regarding  price-fixing on the methionine market, an affair involving Degussa, Aventis and Nippon Soda. These 3 groups control 88% of the world market (which is estimated at $1 bn+). In Aug 2001 the investment fund DuCoa and General Partner DCV lodged complaints with the Delaware court sparking off an enquiry. Degussa has already indicated it expects to be fined by the European Commission. Meanwhile US company Novus has announced that the Commission is to take no action against it. Although it has sold its animal nutrition sector to CVC Partners and has cooperated with the  Commission, Aventis is still liable for any wrong-doing. Brussels imposes fines of up to 10% of turnover on companies found guilty of  price-fixing, although  fines may be reduced it the company cooperates.

OFT Director-General, John Vickers, examines the close bond between sound competition policy, effective competition and ultimately consumer gain
ABSTRACT

TD
Competition policy and consumer interests have long been presumed divergent. However, sound policy ensures effective competition and ultimately consumer benefits. The Competition Act has given the OFT powers to dismantle cartels and ban anti-competitive practice with clear consumer gains. Some interventions achieve less tangible, albeit equally important results. Competition policy must, however, be flexible and recognise that co-operation can bring benefits in some cases. It must also acknowledge that real consumer choice fosters competition.

There was once a time when they inhabited different worlds, moved in different political and social circles, and read different newspapers, or at least different sections of the newspaper. They seemed to be subject to different aspects of public policy and remained largely ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and feelings.

On the one hand, there was competition policy, the province of industrialists, lawyers and investment bankers, both unfathomable and irrelevant for the man on the street. Consumer policy, on the other hand, had its own audience - the general public - and own staunch defenders in the shape of consumer bodies. Indeed, once upon a time, it was even suggested that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) itself was a
double-headed hydra, with some staff wearing competition hats and others consumer hats.

But things are now changing and for the better. Competition is increasingly being recognised as a core consumer issue. This is a positive trend, but there remains much ground to cover. This paper(11 sets out the reasons why competition policy and consumer interest should, and indeed, must be seen as inextricably linked and interdependent.

In November 2001, following a two-and-a-half year investigation, the European Commission fined Hoffman-La Roche and seven other international pharmaceutical companies a total of 855 million euros - over (pound)500 million - for their part in a series of secret  price-fixing and market-sharing cartels relating to vitamin products between 1989 and 1999.
In the words of Competition Commissioner Mario Monti:[2]

`This is the most damaging series of cartels the  Commission has ever investigated due to the sheer range of vitamins covered which are found in a multitude of products from cereals, biscuits and drinks to animal feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The companies' collusive behaviour enabled them to charge higher prices than if the full forces of competition had been at play, damaging consumers and allowing the companies to pocket illicit profits. It is particularly unacceptable that this illegal behaviour concerned substances which are vital elements for nutrition and essential for normal growth and maintenance of life.'

One indication of the scale of the illicit profits and the damage to consumers is that, for vitamin C alone, it is estimated that annual  European revenues more than halved from 250 million  euros to 120 million

euros after the  cartel was broken up. The EuropeanCommission action followed the unearthing of the cartel by the US authorities, in part thanks to its leniency programme for whistle-blowers. The US convicted 11 companies and 13 individuals for vitamin  cartel activities, with the companies reportedly having paid private damages in excess of $1 billion as well as  fines, and a number of the individuals having served custodial sentences.
The Competition Act in force

There was a time when the UK lagged some way behind other countries in respect of powers to investigate and penalise - and consequently deter -  cartel activity (and other competition violations). The Competition Act 1998, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market positions, came into force just two years ago on 1 March 2000. Any anti-competitive conduct prior to that date is not covered by the prohibitions in the Act.

The OFT has since been investigating a number of suspected cartels, and in January 2002 we took our first action against a  cartel under the new Competition Act. Financial penalties, including a substantial
sum for deterrence, were imposed on two bus operators for a  market-sharing agreement on routes in the Leeds area. Since the operators had co-operated under our leniency programme, the financial penalties were reduced - to zero for the first firm to come to us.

Another recent example from the UK concerns branded over-the-counter (OTC) medicines (such as cold remedies, pain relievers and indeed vitamins): a market worth some (pound)1.6 billion annually. Until May last year, OTC medicines had enjoyed a legal exemption from the general ban (which existed for decades) on resale price maintenance (RPM) - the practice whereby the manufacturer fixes the retail price of its product. Among other things, RPM prevents price competition between retailers.

The OFT challenged the exemption of medicines from the RPM ban before the Restrictive Practices Court, and succeeded in ending it. The positive outcome of the Court's verdict for consumers was immediate and striking. Within hours some supermarkets announced price reductions on leading brands of 25 per cent
and more. Some prices were even halved overnight, and the lower prices have endured. Bearing in mind that each percentage point off average prices for the products in question equates to an annual saving of (pound)16 million for consumers, this is a substantial gain and the benefits of more affordable medicines of course go beyond the purely financial.

A third example comes from the recent Competition Act case, the first of its kind, concerning Napp Pharmaceuticals. The company supplies a pain-- relieving drug called MST for use by, among others, cancer patients. The OFT found that Napp had abused a dominant position in the market for sustained release morphine by pricing anti-competitively to exclude competition in supply to hospitals - a key gateway to the wider market for its rivals - while charging excessively high prices for supply to patients in the community.

In January of this year, the Competition  Commission Appeal Tribunal rejected Napp's appeal against this decision (though it did reduce the  fine imposed by the OFT). As a result, subject to any further appeal by Napp, Napp's anti-competitive conduct must now end, and the firm is also required to slash prices. In this case alone, the application of competition law should save the NHS - and by extension the general public - around (pound)2 million a year. At the same time, it should make more affordable a drug that is crucial in coping with the acute condition of the patients concerned.

Moreover, the immediate customer gains described above are just the tip of the iceberg. Freeing competition opens the way for the dynamic benefits in terms of greater efficiency, innovation and choice.
The invisible successes

Nothing demonstrates how the consumer benefits from competition - and from the effective enforcement of robust competition law - better than successful outcomes in cases such as those illustrated above. However, the consumer benefit of competition policy successes are not always as visible as, say, the outcome of the medicines case.
The lysine cartel

Firstly, a great deal of  cartel and other anti-competitive behaviour takes place in markets that are not directly consumer-facing. I suspect that most people, if told that the global lysine  cartel had been uncovered and disbanded, would be less likely to say `Good: that will help reduce my family food bill', than
`What is lysine?'. (The answer, incidentally, is a key  amino acid used in animal foodstuffs.) Yet, the first response is nonetheless right, and to the tune of the many, many millions of pounds that the cartellists had been illegally expropriating from customers. An invisible gain is still a gain, just as an invisible crime is still
a crime.

Christie's and Sotheby's

Secondly, some consumer-facing markets sit outside the experience of most of the general public.  Fine art auction houses are a topical example, with the criminal trial of individuals involved in the concerted commission fixing between Christie's and Sotheby's recently in the news. The trial, of course, took place across the Atlantic, since criminal penalties for  cartel perpetrators do not yet exist in the UK, and it followed civil suits there that had won considerable damages for victims of the  cartel.

The admirably robust US attitude to cartels is not always echoed here. Thus for Brian Sewell, art critic for the Evening Standard - though evidently not versed in the workings competition law - there was no misdeed at all.[31 Rather, the agreement on auction commissions, in his words, `put an end to some very
disagreeable preliminaries to business'. After all, `no seller loses a penny by it, no buyer has had to pay an extra penny', and `in English law neither Christie's nor Sotheby's has committed even a minor misdemeanour'. It would seem, then, that the Competition Act has yet to be universally appreciated.
Mergers

Thirdly, even in markets experienced by the majority of everyday consumers, the gains from competition policy intervention can be intangible. This does not, however, make them any less real or important. To cite two recent merger cases, I believe that consumers are likely to get better deals from the beer industry than if Interbrew had been allowed unconditionally to acquire Bass Brewers, rather than having to divest Carling, which brought a major new entrant into the market. I also believe that the market for banking services is likely to work better for consumers than if Lloyds TSB had been allowed to acquire its competitor Abbey National last year.
Competition at work

Competition is good for consumers for the simple reason that it impels producers to offer better deals-- lower prices, better quality, new products, and greater choice. Self-interest, as Adam Smith observed, can ultimately work for the greater good: `It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the
baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest'. When a market functions competitively, the interest of each producer is to serve consumers better than its rivals. This rivalry benefits consumers both directly, in terms of better deals, and further over time, as producers strive to
increase their efficiency and to conceive new and better ways of doing things, and as those that are better at serving customer needs gain business from others.

It is the role of competition policy to protect this process against two principal hazards. In the first instance, some firms manage not to compete hard, or indeed at all. Members of a  cartel may simply agree not to compete. Collusion is generally more profitable than competition, so if producers could get away with it, they would usually have a strong commercial incentive to agree not to compete.

Anti-competitive agreements are therefore a prime target of competition policy. It needs to be sufficiently strong, both in terms of investigative powers and penalties in order to ensure that commercial incentives (and the personal interests of potential perpetrators) discourage colluding to give customers a bad deal and encourage competing to offer good deals.

Some mergers can equally undermine competition by eliminating healthy competition between the merging parties and reducing industry rivalry more generally. On the other hand, the merged entity might conceivably be a more efficient and effective competitor than the sum of its parts. Policy attention therefore needs to focus on (the minority of) mergers that might substantially lessen competition, and to secure remedies where they are needed to safeguard conditions for effective competition.

Collusive agreements and mergers are not the only means by which competition can be weakened. Whether or not by design, circumstances might be such that firms can achieve more or less collusive outcomes without explicit co-operation. In such instances, the task for competition policy is to undermine the circumstances that facilitate collusion and to promote conditions conducive to rivalry. I will return later to the role of consumers in this process.

The second main obstacle to competition is that rivals to established firms are impeded in their efforts to offer customers good deals. Impeding rivals in this way is bad for competition and consumers, and of course for competitors, though it is debatable whether this is actually of any genuine relevance. By contrast, there is nothing anti-competitive if, say, a new firm is frustrated simply because others are able to offer customers better deals. A key task for competition policy, then, is to distinguish the instances where the competitive process is actually being impeded from the everyday situation where some competitors have simply been out-competed in the business of serving customers.

So, who is in a position to impede competition? In some circumstances, firms with market power can hinder competition. Guarding against such forms of anti-competitive behaviour is a prime purpose, though
Page 16 of 64 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
not the only one, of the prohibition in competition law of the abuse by a firm of a dominant market position. Firms that collectively possess market power, for example via a trade association, can also stifle competition. In the absence of market power, however, it should be presumed that business behaviour is not impeding competition.

Yet business behaviour is by no means the beginning and end of the problem. Anti-competitive effects can just as easily stem from government laws and regulations. A growing theme in competition policy work worldwide is to question impediments to competition arising from branches of government, and I welcome the new emphasis on this in the UK.
Policy in the consumer context

Competition is not, of course, an end in itself, but a process that contributes to the goal of economic well-- being, both for business and ultimately for consumers. This is reflected in competition law. Hence, the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements is not absolute: there is scope for exemption from the prohibition if it can be shown that certain conditions are met. In particular, under the UK Competition Act (which itself mirrors EU law), an agreement that prevents, restricts or distorts competition can be exempted from the prohibition of such agreements if it:
(a) contributes to
(i) improving production or distribution, or

(ii) promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit;
(b) but does not

(i) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of those objectives, or

(ii) afford the undertakings concerned the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.

It is important to note in these conditions the reference to consumer benefit. For an anti-competitive agreement to be exempted, it is necessary not only that consumers benefit - they must also get a fair share of the resulting benefit.

Secondly, it is also necessary that the agreement be indispensable to attaining the benefits. Thus, even where there is an overall benefit, and consumers obtain their fair share of it, an anti-competitive agreement still infringes competition law if the benefit could be achieved without the anti-competitive
aspects of the agreement. Moreover and importantly, the agreement must not risk eliminating competition.

These legal exemption criteria accord with common sense. The ban on anti-competitive agreements is subject to pragmatic qualifications. If an agreement is necessary to bring benefits which are fairly shared by consumers, then it would be perverse for competition policy to outlaw it, since the primary purpose of competition policy is to benefit consumers. However, the benefits of competition should not lightly be forgone - loss of competition should be tolerated only when it is genuinely necessary to bring about greater benefits.

So how do the exemption criteria work in practice? Two recent examples illustrate the need for competition policy to be flexible where consumer benefit is manifest.
LINK machines

The first concerns the cash machine network operated by LINK, which involves co-operation among banks and allows customers of one bank to withdraw cash from machines run by the others within the network. This clearly benefits consumers by expanding the number of cash machines that will yield them cash. There is a risk, however, that via the collective fixing of transfer prices within the network, the banks could disadvantage consumers, for example by colluding to set excessive cash machine charges. Ideally the network benefits can be achieved without that possibility presenting a genuine risk.

LINK notified the OFT of its agreement, which it had just amended, when the Competition Act came into force. Following the logic of the legal exemption criteria described above, the OFT decided to exempt the agreement. [41 It was important - for example in relation to indispensability - that the agreement provided for the transfer prices within the network to be properly cost-reflective. Competition law ultimately allowed the agreement and hence ensured its benefits for consumers, while guarding against any potential risk.
Travel card schemes
Page 17 of 64 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The second example comes from the realm of public transport. Competition between bus operators, and indeed other public transport operators, can benefit consumers in just the same way as competition does generally. Since competing operators are likely to offer better deals to passengers than a monopoly would, competition can also promote further benefits that public transport may bring by easing congestion and pollution problems.

Yet, there are further advantages for consumers beyond those brought by competition. Various forms of co-operation between operators can be of benefit to the travelling public. Joint travel card schemes are one such example, giving people the freedom to travel on any bus within a city, irrespective of which operator is running it. The conundrum is how to attain the benefits of co-operation without forgoing the benefits of competition.

The OFT has had to resolve this dilemma with the `block exemption' for public transport ticketing schemes, whereby schemes meeting certain conditions are exempted from the Competition Act ban on anti-competitive agreements. In essence, the decision was reached, again in keeping with the legal exemption criteria discussed before, to allow co-operation subject to limits and conditions that safeguard competition.

For example, it is accepted that parties to certain travel card schemes are permitted to agree the travel card price, but competition must continue to govern their ordinary single and return fares. Similarly, while operators may time services (including by agreement) to provide convenient onward travel connections, such as connecting bus services for arriving or departing train passengers, they are not allowed to agree to limit the frequency or set the timing of the services which each operator runs. Schemes must also have open access to all operators, including new entrants to the market.

In summary, competition law, with its flexible exemption criteria, reflects the fact that competition is not an end in itself, but a means to economic well-- being, ultimately for the general public as consumers.
Consumer orientation

It is important to keep in mind this consumer orientation of competition law and policy, especially since the consumer interest in competition matters is generally less able to voice its concerns than some producer interests. To see how a consumer perspective can be helpful in guiding competition analysis, consider the following (invented) example.

Suppose that a government regulation decreed that only self-employed individuals could own and run shops selling bread. This would probably result in a proliferation of independently owned bread shops, which, in some respects, might appear highly 'competitive' by the standards of some of the classic models found in economics textbooks.

The regulation would, however, be profoundly anti-competitive, since it discriminates against and disallows all other ways of supplying bread to the public. To the extent that those other forms of supply might reduce costs and improve value for money, consumers would stand to gain from deregulation. Moreover, unleashing competition in this manner would in no sense undermine those independent bread shops that were delivering a good service and meeting consumers' needs.

The general lesson here is that the presence of lots of suppliers in any given market does not necessarily translate into consumer benefit or mean that the public is well served. If other kinds of supplier are shut out of the market, deregulation - along with the new avenues of competition that it opens up - might well serve consumers better.

The consumer orientation of competition law and policy must always be borne in mind when considering complaints from, and more generally the views of, competitors to the firm or firms under consideration. In merger appraisal, for instance, the competitors to the merging firms sometimes express opposition to the proposed merger. Broadly speaking, there are three possible attitudes to adopt in the face of such views.

The first, and obviously naive, attitude would be to suppose that the interests of competitors and competition are aligned, and that since the competitors are against the merger, it is likely to be bad for competition. The second attitude would be the opposite-- if the competitors are against the merger, then it should be presumed to be good good for competition. For why would the competitors be worried unless
the merger meant lower prices? In fact there are possible reasons for competitors' concerns, for example if the merger seriously threatened to raise rivals' costs. So this second approach, though the thinking behind it is plausible and generally worth considering, is too hasty. The most sensible approach is to pause to consider the reasons why competitors are expressing concerns. Is it because the merger might substantially lessen competition, to the detriment of consumers, or are their motives essentially
self-serving?
The role of productivity
Page 18 of 64 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The discussion so far has not focused on the importance of competition for productivity, a theme stressed in government proposals to take further the reform of UK competition policy. Michael Porter of Harvard University has proposed that productivity growth should be the standard adopted by competition law.[5] Leaving aside the practical operability of such a standard, there remains the fundamental question of whether consumer-oriented and productivity-- oriented views of competition policy converge.

The answer is that they fit naturally. Productivity, like competition, is not an end in itself, but a means of improving the economic well-being of the public. Higher productivity means more and better goods and services - hence greater consumer satisfaction - for the same input of effort. Higher productivity is therefore desirable precisely because it serves the public.

Spurring productivity growth is a prime means by which competition benefits consumers. Productivity growth and the interests of consumers are indisputably at one.
Consumers foster competition

Until now, I have been examining what competition can do for consumers. But it is equally important to consider what consumers can do for competition. The answer is potentially a great deal, since demand conditions can exert a major influence on the nature of competitive interaction between suppliers.

It matters in particular how much business a supplier stands to gain if it improves the value for money offered to customers, or, of course, lose if it offers a poorer deal. The more the fortunes of each supplier are sensitive to the value for money that it offers, the greater the incentives for all suppliers to offer consumers better deals, to innovate, and to improve efficiency. This incentive will obviously be more powerful when customers are aware and footloose-- so that they vote with their feet - than when they are ignorant and inert.

This observation directs attention to the very topical issues of customer information and switching costs. In some markets, buyers are relatively well-- informed and unimpeded, and therefore able to switch among suppliers with comparative ease. Competition will tend naturally to work for them. However, if, as in some consumer markets, customers cannot properly compare the deals in the marketplace, or if they are somehow locked into an agreement with their existing supplier, then the competitive pressure exerted by customers - their buyer power so to speak - will inevitably be weak. It may be that the individual consumer can do very little about this.

There is nevertheless a potentially important role for policy measures to strengthen the position of consumers by improving the information available to them and taking action to root out prohibitive switching costs.

A recent paper by Michael Waterson of Warwick University provides an interesting discussion of these issues in relation to a number of markets, notably both the financial services and utility sectors.[6] He concludes that `the role of competition authorities might usefully be extended to encompass actions designed to spur consumers into forcing industries to operate more effectively'.

In summary, an important way to make markets work more competitively is to improve the basis for consumer choice. It is the very essence of effective competition policy and a key element of the work of bodies like the OFT. Just as competition is good for consumers, enhancing the power of consumer choice is good for competition.
Conclusion
Competitive market forces are forces that work for the benefit of consumers. More effective competition -
to deliver what customers want and need - makes for better-served consumers. It is the role of competition
policy to ensure that competition is indeed effective and operating for consumers. To this end, competition
policy stops, penalises and deters anticompetitive actions by suppliers. It also extends to the removal of
unnecessary restrictions on competition stemming from government laws and regulation. Finally and
crucially, a fully effective competition policy also embraces measures to make markets work more
competitively by enhancing the power of consumer choice.

The European Commission is expected to  fine Degussa, Aventis and Nippon Soda for being part of a cartel to fix the price of methionine. A number of class actions and individual legal actions are being brought by N American customers. Degussa says that it has made provisions for any fines. Aventis has not indicated whether it has made provisions. The company could benefit from a European Union policy which allows a company's fines to be reduced when it is the first to alert the authorities. Although CVC Capital Partners acquired Aventis' animal nutrition business in 2001, Aventis is still responsible for anti-trust issues.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS FINED Degussa AG $118 million and Nippon Soda Company Ltd
$9 million for participating in a price-fixing cartel in methionine together with Aventis SA.

Aventis (formerly Rhone-Poulenc) was granted full immunity from  fines because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the  Commission and provided decisive evidence on its operation.

TD
Methionine is one of the world's most important amino acids used mainly in feed for poultry and pigs.
The cartel operated for nearly 13 years until 1999.

"The behavior of Aventis, Degussa and Nippon Soda has shown a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat which paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition," says Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "The Commission hopes that like Aventis other companies will feel encouraged to come clean and denounce any such illicit behavior whose sole purpose is to rip off consumers."

The Commission found that the  cartel agreed on price targets, implemented price increases and exchanged information on sales volumes and market share.
During the infringement period, the annual market was worth around $260 million in the  European
Economic Area -- the 15 EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

The companies held regular meetings both at top level -- so-called "summit" meetings -- and at a technical level -- "managerial" or "staff" level meetings.

During these meetings, the participants exchanged sales volumes, which would then be compiled and used in the discussions to determine the target prices to be fixed.

The difference in the fines reflects the variance in the market shares of Degussa, the world's biggest producer of methionine, and Nippon Soda, almost five times smaller in terms of 1998 market shares figures.

Nippon Soda and Degussa cooperated with the  Commission and were therefore granted reductions in penalty.

Brussels, July 2 (Jiji Press) - The European Commission Tuesday fined Japan's Nippon Soda Co. 9 million euros and Germany's Degussa AG 118 million euros for fixing the price of a food additive to promote growth in pigs and poultry.
The two companies allegedly manipulated the price of the  amino acid, methionine, from 1986 to
1999 by setting price targets, implementing price increases and exchanging information on sales
volumes, according to the executive organ of the  European Union.

TD
The commission did not fine Aventis SA, which was also implicated in the  price-fixing case, as the French company reported the conspiracy and provided decisive evidence on the practice to the commission.

Two other companies involved in the case, Japan's Nippon Soda Co Ltd and Franco-German drugs group Aventis SA , got off lightly, the paper said, giving no figures.
A source close to the case told Reuters last week that the  Commission had been expected to  fine
Degussa and Nippon Soda, while Aventis was also implicated.

Degussa said last week it had made adequate provision for a  fine in this case. The provision was mentioned in its annual report earlier this year.

Nippon Soda acknowledged in March it was under investigation by the  Commission, while Aventis declined comment last week.

Aventis has avoided  fines in other price-fixing cases by taking advantage of an amnesty provided by both Brussels and Washington to the first firm to report a  cartel, which may also happen in this case.
Degussa is majority owned by power giant E.ON AG , which is in the middle of a complicated
3.9-billion-euro deal designed to transfer ownership of the firm to coal group RAG.

FRANKFURT, July 2 (Reuters) - Germany's Degussa AG declined to comment on Tuesday on a newspaper report that the European Commission would fine it more than 100 million  euros ($98.33 million) in an amino-acids price-fixing investigation.

"We don't know the decision, a decision has not yet been conveyed to us," a Degussa spokeswoman said, declining further comment.

German business daily Handelsblatt, citing  Commission sources in Brussels, said the EU would  fine the specialty chemicals group on Tuesday for its role in fixing the price of a chemical used to promote growth in pigs and poultry.

According to the report, the EU has designated specialty chemicals group Degussa as the driving force in a cartel for fixing the price of amino acidmethionine.

Two other companies involved in the case, Japan's Nippon Soda Co Ltd and Franco-German drugs group Aventis SA, got off lightly, the paper said, giving no figures.

Degussa said last week it had made adequate provision for a  fine in this case. The provision was mentioned in its annual report earlier this year.
A source close to the case told Reuters last week that the  Commission had been expected to  fine
Degussa and Nippon Soda, while Aventis was also implicated.

Nippon Soda acknowledged in March it was under investigation by the  Commission, while Aventis declined comment last week.

Aventis has avoided  fines in other price-fixing cases by taking advantage of an amnesty provided by both Brussels and Washington to the first firm to report a  cartel, which may also happen in this case.

By 0930 GMT, Degussa shares were up 0.75 percent at 36.23  euros compared with a 0.82 percent fall on the pan-European DJ Stoxx chemicals index.

Traders said the stock was rising toward 38  euros as many investors expected a takeover offer for at least 51 percent of the group priced at that level to go through.
Degussa is majority owned by power giant E.ON AG, which is in the middle of a complicated
3.9-billion-euro deal designed to transfer ownership of the firm to coal group RAG.

Last week Degussa endorsed the ownership change, which is contingent upon the German government's approval of E.ON's acquisition of the country's leading gas supplier Ruhrgas.
The government is widely expected to clear the deal with some conditions this week.

and Nippon Soda Co Ltd 9 milion euros on Tuesday for fixing the price of a chemical used to promote
growth in pigs and poultry.

The Commission did not fine Aventis , which was also implicated in the  price-fixing case involving the amino acid methionine, because it reported the conspiracy.

The Commission said it levied the  fines because the firms showed "a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat who paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition."
The Commission said that it gave full immunity to Aventis because it revealed the  cartel's existence.

A spokeswoman for Degussa said last week the firm had made an adequate provision for a  fine in this case. That provision was mentioned in its annual report earlier this year.

BRUSSELS, July 2 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined Degussa AG 118 million  euros and Nippon Soda Co Ltd nine milion euros on Tuesday for fixing the price of a chemical used to promote growth in pigs and poultry.

The Commission did not fine Aventis, which was also implicated in the  price-fixing case involving the amino acid methionine, because it reported the conspiracy.

TD
The Commission said it levied the  fines because the firms showed, "a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat who paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition."

Degussa said it would appeal against the  fine because, "the scale of the imposesd  fine is unacceptable in Degussa's view."
The Commission said that it gave full immunity to Aventis because it revealed the  cartel's existence. The Commission said it had been investigating the case since 1999 and had found the  cartel lasted
from 1986 to 1999.

"They agreed on price targets, implemented price increases and exchanged information on sales volumes and market shares for  methionine," the  Commission said in a statement.
It noted that during the time of the  cartel the annual market for the product ran about 260 million
euros in the 15 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

The Commission said that the companies met at "summits" to determine their prices and to exchange sales volumes. They also met at a technical level, the  Commission said.

The Commission said the difference in the size of the  fines was accounted for by the disproportionate share of the market held by Degussa, the world's biggest producer of  methionine.

"The Commission takes into account the effective capacity by market leaders to cause greater damage than smaller players as well as the need to ensure that the penalties have a sufficiently deterrent effect" the  Commission said.
It said that Nippon co-operated with the investigation and was granted a 50 percent reduction in its
fine, while Degussa got a 25 percent reduction because of its lesser co-operation.

A spokeswoman for Degussa said last week the firm had made an adequate provision for a  fine in this case. That provision was mentioned in its annual report earlier this year.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-
Europe's top antitrust watchdog Tuesday fined Germany's
Degussa AG (G.DGX) and Japan's Nippon Soda Co. Ltd. (J.NSD) a total of
EUR127
million for fixing prices of a key animal feed ingredient called
methionine.
The Commission said it granted France's Aventis SA (AVE) complete immunity
because it lifted the lid on the cartel's existence and provided proof of the
unlawful operation. The cartel had operated for 13 years until 1999.

TD

In a statement, the
Commission said the behavior of the three companies "has shown a complete disregard for their customers."
Dow Jones Newswires revealed the existence of the investigation March
18.
Methionine is a protein substitute added mainly to poultry and pig feed. The
global methionine market is worth at least $1.3 billion annually, according to
U.K.-based industry analysts Animal Pharm Reports.
The cartel members met to fix minimum prices, coordinate price increases,
exchange sales information, and agree on charges to individual customers, the
E.U. said.
The high level of collusion meant it was consumers who were gouged at the
dinner table, E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said. "Ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat ... paid more for the products
concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition,"
Monti said.
Aventis avoided a fine in the EUR100 million-range by being the first to alert
the Commission and for providing "decisive information" about the cartel. Nippon Soda won a 50% reduction in its fine by providing handwritten notes
taken during cartel meetings. The notes confirmed that collusion was under way
prior to 1990, the E.U. said.
Degussa saw its fine cut by only 25%. The company made denials which the

Page 31 of 64 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commission didn't believe, and most of its information wasn't "provided voluntarily."
Degussa's EUR118 million fine beats the previous European penalty slapped on a
single feed additive company.
Archer Daniels Midland Co. (AMD) of the U.S. paid EUR47.3 million in
2000 for
fixing the prices of a similar substance called lysine, used mainly in pig
feed. Total fines in the lysine case reached EUR110 million.
Shortly after Tuesday's announcement, Degussa called the level of its fine "unacceptable" and said it would challenge the decision. Degussa didn't
give any further details.
The E.U. Commission said its latest agrofood investigation "left no doubt" as
to the companies' intent to rig the market for methionine.
It quoted from a note submitted by Nippon Soda allegedly showing the companies
setting methionine prices in Portugal, Spain and the U.K. in June 1993. The methionine case is part of a larger global crackdown on collusion among
chemical powerhouses. Lawyers say cartels flourish in the sector because products are hard to differentiate by quality, in turn offering a
greater
temptation for producers to collude on prices.
In the methionine case, Brussels lawyers say regulators also originally targeted Japan's Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. (J.SUC) and privately held U.S.
company Novus International Inc.
Novus officials and lawyers close to Sumitomo told Dow Jones Newswires earlier
this year that their cases had been dropped in February 2002.

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Degussa AG (G.DGX) Tuesday declined to comment on a newspaper report that the  European Union Commission will fine the specialty chemicals company more than EUR100 million for allegedly leading a price-fixing cartel for amino acids.

"We haven't been informed of the E.U.'s decision and so long as we don't have this decision we can't say anything on the subject," said Degussa spokeswoman Hannelore Gantzer.

TD
Earlier Tuesday, German business daily Handelsblatt reported that Aventis S.A. (AVE) is expected to get off lightly because of its cooperation with the E.U. investigation, citing unnamed E.U. sources.

Earlier this year, Brussels-based lawyers close to the probe said  European antitrust officials are investigating Degussa and Aventis for allegedly fixing the prices of a key animal feed ingredient called methionine.

A hearing was held in January and a final decision, which could include  fines, is expected before the end of this year.

HD     EU to fine Degussa 100 mln euros for fixing  prices of animal feed: report

FRANKFURT, July 2 (AFP) - The European Commission in Brussels is to  fine German specialty chemicals maker Degussa 100 million euros (99 million dollars) for fixing prices of animal feed, the business daily Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday.

Quoting commission sources, the newspaper said that Degussa was being  fined because it was the driving force in an amino acid cartel which had used price-fixing to systematically carve up the market for animal feed for a decade.

TD
It was the second steepest  fine ever imposed by Brussels on a German company, the newspaper said.

Another company involved in the affair, the Franco-German life sciences giant Aventis, received a much smaller fine because it cooperated as a witness during the course of the enquiry, Handelsblatt said.
The third firm, Japanese Nippon Soda, also got off lightly.

A spokeswoman for Degussa refused to comment on the report, saying that the  Commission had not yet officially announced its decision, expected later on Tuesday.
But the group had already said in its annual report that it expected to receive a  fine. spm/hd

CORRECTION: ATTENTION - RECASTS, ADDS details of  fine, appeal //

LP
FRANKFURT, July 2 (AFP) - The German specialty chemicals maker Degussa said Tuesday it was  fined
118.125 million  euros (116.9 million dollars) by the  European Commission for fixing prices of animal
feed, but added that it would appeal the  fine.

"We received notification of the EU decision to impose a  fine of 118.125 million  euros," Degussa said in a statement.

TD
The German company was accused of contravening EU competition law in the distribution of the animal feed additive  methionine between 1986 and 1999, the statement said.
But Degussa said it would appeal against the size of the  fine, which it described as "unacceptable". Degussa, along with Franco-German life sciences giant Aventis and Japanese firm Nippon Soda are
accused of forming an amino acidcartel which used price-fixing to systematically carve up the market
for animal feed.
Aventis was spared a  fine because it cooperated as a witness during the course of the enquiry and
Nippon Soda, also got off lightly with a nine-million-euro fine.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Dow Jones/AP) -  Europe's antitrust watchdog Tuesday  fined Germany's Degussa AG and Japan's Nippon Soda Co. Ltd. 127 million  euro (dlrs 126 million) for fixing prices of a key animal feed ingredient called  methionine.

The European Commission said it granted France's Aventis SA immunity because it had lifted the lid on the cartel's existence and provided proof of the unlawful operation. The  cartel had operated for 13 years until 1999.

TD
In a statement, the  European Union's head office said the three companies through their behavior had displayed "a complete disregard for their customers."
Dow Jones Newswires revealed the existence of the investigation March 18.

Methionine is a protein  substitute added mainly to poultry and pig feed. The global  methionine market is worth at least dlrs 1.3 billion annually, according to industry analysts Animal Pharm Reports in Britain.

The cartel members met to fix minimum prices, coordinate price increases, exchange sales information and agree on charges to individual customers, the EU said.

The high-level of collusion meant it was consumers who were gouged at the dinner table, said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

"Ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat ... paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition," said Monti.

Aventis avoided a  fine in the 100 million euro- (dlrs-) range by being the first to alert the  commission and for providing "decisive information" about the cartel.
Nippon Soda won a 50 percent reduction in its  fine by providing handwritten notes taken during  cartel
meetings. Those notes confirmed collusion was underway prior to 1990, the EU said.

Degussa saw its fine cut by only 25 percent. The company made denials the  commission didn't believe, and most of its information wasn't "provided voluntarily."
Degussa called the level of its  fine "unacceptable" and said it would challenge the decision. (dj/pfg)

HD        COMPANIES &FINANCE EUROPE - Degussa hit with Euros 118m cartel penalty. BY        By FRANCESCO GUERRERA and BETTINA WASSENER.

Degussa, the German chemicals group, has been  fined Euros 118m ( $118m) by European antitrust regulators - the fourth-largest penalty ever imposed by Brussels - for a 13-year conspiracy to fix the price of an animal-feed additive.

The Japanese group Nippon Soda was also  fined, but just  Euros 9m because its share of the market for methionine, an additive given to chickens and pigs, was smaller than Degussa's.

TD
Aventis of France escaped without a  fine, in spite of playing an important part in the conspiracy, because it alerted regulators to the existence of the  cartel and co-operated with the probe.

Degussa said it would appeal the penalty in the  European Court of Justice. But the company said it might have to make extra provisions because of the size of the  fine.

Mario Monti,  European competition commissioner, said the three companies had "shown a complete disregard for customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork, who paid more for the products concerned". The heavy  fines for the cartel - predicted by the FT last week - are a further sign of Mr Monti's determination to crack down on illegal  price-fixing, which he has dubbed "the cancers" of a market economy.

He praised Aventis for its whistle blowing and urged other companies to "come clean and denounce such illicit behaviour whose sole purpose is to rip off consumers".

The probe found that between 1986 and 1999, the three companies fixed prices, agreed on price increases and exchanged information on sales figures, in breach of  European competition laws.

The cartel was driven forward by regular meetings between senior and middle managers of the companies.
"The documents found by the  commission leave no doubts about the intent to rig the market," the
Brussels authorities said.

Methionine is an important  protein  supplement, essential to the diets of chickens and pigs.

During the period of the  cartel, the European market for the product was worth about  Euros 260m a year, the commission said.
Degussa said the fine was excessive. London Edition 1.

Eurofighter Wins

TD
Contract to Supply
24 Jets to Austria
Austria awarded  Eurofighter GmbH a key victory, selecting the multinational manufacturer to supply 24
Typhoon combat aircraft for a 1.79 billion  euro ($1.77 billion) contract.  Eurofighter is owned by
European Aeronautic Defense & Space, or EADS, Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Finmeccanica. A
spokesman for the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign-arms sales, said
the U.S. was disappointed Austria had chosen the Typhoon over Lockheed Martin's F-16 fighter but
added it would continue close defense cooperation with Austria.
The Typhoon also beat out the Gripen fighter made by BAE and its Swedish affiliate, Saab. Natexis to Buy U.S. Brokerage Firm
Natexis Banques Populaires said it agreed to buy U.S. brokerage firm Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder in an
all-stock deal valued at $105 million, beefing up the French bank's equities business. As part of the deal,
Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder's existing shareholders will take a 2.6% stake in Natexis, the
investment-banking arm of French mutual bank Banque Populaire. Natexis said the New York brokerage
firm would be renamed Natexis Bleichroeder. The deal, which requires U.S. regulatory approval, is
expected to be completed this fall. A&SB, the parent of Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder, said it will continue
with its asset-management business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder
Advisers.
DeGussa, Nippon Soda  Fined by EU

The European Commission fined German chemicals company Degussa and Japan's Nippon Soda a total of 127 million euros (US$125.7 million) for fixing prices of a key animal-feed ingredient called methionine. The European Union executive body said it granted France's Aventis complete immunity because Aventis lifted the lid on the  cartel's existence and provided proof of the unlawful operation, which the commission said operated for 13 years until 1999. Degussa said the level of its 118 million euro fine was "unacceptable" and it will challenge the decision. It didn't give any further details. Nippon Soda won a 50% reduction in its  fine, which totaled nine million  euros, by providing evidence of collusion prior to 1990.
Poland's Finance Minister Resigns

Polish Finance Minister Marek Belka resigned, telling reporters he was "burned out" and potentially complicating efforts to bring Central  Europe's largest economy into the  European Union. Mr. Belka, a

Western-trained economist, was seen as the eight-month-old government's leading fiscal moderate. There was no immediate successor named for Mr. Belka.
Ahold Reiterates Argentine Exposure

Investor fears that a possible debt default by the Argentine joint-venture partner of Dutch supermarket retailer Ahold could cost Ahold almost $500 million and force it to miss its target of 15% growth in earnings per share this year -- excluding currency effects and goodwill amortization -- sent Ahold shares down 9.6% in Amsterdam trading. Ahold reiterated that it could lose as much as $496 million if its
joint-venture partner, Velox, defaults on its debt obligations, as Argentina's financial crisis continues to ravage business there.
BRIEFLY:
-- Orange said it will buy a 71.25% stake in Egypt's MobiNil Telecommunication for 324 million  euros
($321 million) from the  European wireless operator's parent, France Telecom.

-- Spanish utility Endesa said it will divide its operations into a  European natural-gas and electricity business and a Latin American power business as part of its strategic refocus.

-- Irish real-estate company Green Property said it agreed to a 1.05 billion  euro ($1.04 billion) management-led buyout through a company called Rodinheights. Green's independent directors will recommend the offer.

THE AMERICAS
Mexican Ex-President Is Questioned

A former Mexican president was called before a prosecutor to answer questions about two massacres during the country's "dirty war" against leftist insurgents. The summoning of 80-year-old Luis Echeverria, president in 1970-76, marked the first time a Mexican president was required to appear before a prosecutor. Mr. Echeverria was questioned in a closed hearing about two student massacres in 1968
and 1971. The special prosecutor, Ignacio Carrillo, spent about six hours detailing the complaints from a committee of survivors and adding questions of his own as part of an investigation. Mr. Echeverria asked to respond in writing within 30 days, his lawyer said. Mr. Echeverria's traditional ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party held power for 71 years until Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party, won the
2000 presidential election. Mr. Fox later ordered an investigation of dirty-war crimes during the 1970s and '80s.
Donors Agree on World Bank Aid

Donor governments have agreed on a plan to increase World Bank funds for the world's poorest countries, with a larger share of the money distributed as grants. The World Bank's International Development Association will provide about $23 billion over the next three years to 79 countries in which the majority of people live on less than $2 per day, the bank said. The accord was struck despite disagreements between the U.S. and  Europe over how much of the money should be released to countries in loans and how much as grants. The U.S. had asked that 50% of IDA funds be in grants. The final compromise allows for between 18% and 21% of IDA aid to be distributed as grants. About half of the IDA money will be targeted at Africa.
U.S. Court Sets Montemayor Hearing

A U.S. District Court judge in Houston set a July 17 hearing for Rogelio Montemayor, the former head of Mexico's state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, after U.S. prosecutors said they weren't ready to accept his surrender on corruption charges in Mexico. Judge Nancy Atlas agreed to give U.S. officials more time to sort out the unusual case.
BRIEFLY:

-- Ecuador's first-quarter gross domestic product contracted 0.9% from the prior quarter, the central bank said. The GDP contraction could challenge the bank's forecast of 4% growth this year. GDP last year increased 5.6%.
-- Colombia will cut its projection for economic growth this year to between 1% and 2%, from between
2.5% and 3% currently, National Planning Director Juan Carlos Echeverry said.

Australian Trade Deficit Widens

Australia's trade deficit in May widened to a seasonally adjusted 623 million Australian dollars (US$350 million), from A$333 million in April, as imports grew 2%, while exports were unchanged. The trade deficit was wider than economists' consensus forecast of a A$400 million deficit. The May trade deficit was the widest since August 2000. Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS Warburg, said the trend pointed to monthly deficits averaging about A$500 million in the months ahead.
Credit Lyonnais, Xiangcai Seek Link

Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, a unit of French bank Credit Lyonnais, and Chinese brokerage firm Xiangcai Securities have applied to set up a joint venture in Shanghai that will be capitalized at 500 million yuan ($60.4 million), a Xiangcai official said. The application was the first to be sent to the China Securities Regulatory  Commission since new rules governing Sino-foreign securities firms took effect Monday, official media said.
BRIEFLY:

-- Canadian insurer Manulife Financial said it agreed to take on MetLife's in-force life-insurance business in the Philippines, effective immediately. Financial terms weren't disclosed. MetLife, New York, said in February it would close its Philippines unit.

-- The Tokyo Stock Exchange is considering tightening its listing standards this year to require companies to have a market capitalization of at least one billion yen ($8.3 million) in a move aimed at boosting investor confidence, an exchange official said.

-- Philippine Vice President Teofisto Guingona, locked in a policy dispute with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo over U.S. training of Philippine counterterrorist troops, has resigned from his second post as foreign secretary, according to a joint statement. Mr. Guingona declined to comment. No replacement was named.

(EDS: ADDING STATEMENT BY NIPPON SODA)

The European Union's (EU) antitrust watchdog on Tuesday  fined Germany's Degussa AG and Japanese chemical maker Nippon Soda Co. for fixing prices of a key animal feed ingredient called methionine.

TD
The European Commission said it ordered Degussa to pay 118 million  euros and Nippon Soda 9 million euros, but it granted France's Aventis SA immunity because it had lifted the lid on the  cartel's existence and provided proof of the unlawful operation.

The commission said executives at the three companies met to fix minimum prices and coordinate price increases between 1986 and 1999 in violation of EU antitrust rules.

Methionine is a protein  substitute added mainly to poultry and pig feed.
The methionine market for the 18-nation European Economic Area (EEA) was worth 260 million
euros a year during the cartel period, the EuropeanCommission said.
The EEA consists of the 15-nation EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

Nippon Soda issued a statement saying it regrets that the EuropeanCommission has accused it of being involved in the  cartel, adding it will carefully consider how to handle the order.
The Tokyo-based company incurred a one-time loss of 2 billion yen from legal expenses related to the
cartel case for the year ended March 31.

TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - Japanese chemical company Nippon Soda Co Ltd said on Wednesday the European Commission's decision to  fine it for a price-fixing case will have little impact on its earnings for this financial year ending next March.

The European Commission on Tuesday fined Nippon Soda nine million euros ($8.87 million) and Degussa AG 118 million euros ($116.3 million) for fixing the price of amino acid methionine, used to promote growth in pigs and poultry.

TD
An official at Nippon Soda said the company had not decided whether to appeal the EC's decision. But the company said in a statement it had already set aside about 2.0 billion yen ($16.7 million) for special losses related to the case.

"We have only received a summary of the decision. We are still waiting for the full document," the official said.
Degussa has said it would appeal, saying the scale of the  fine was unacceptable.
Shares of Nippon Soda closed down 0.76 percent at 262 yen on Wednesday, while the benchmark
Nikkei average rose 1.79 percent. ($1=1.015  Euro) ($1=119.96 Yen).

The European Commission has imposed fines of EUR 118 M on Degussa AG and EUR 9 M on Nippon Soda for cartel activities. Over the period 1986-1990 the two companies had mutually agreed the price of methionine, an amino acid used in cattle feed. At this time the turnover of  methionine in Europe was EUR 260 M.

HD   CHEMICALS - COMMISSION FINES DEGUSSA AND NIPPON SODA FOR PRICE-FIXING. BY    By (BEP).

The European Commission has fined chemical giants Degussa of France and Nippon Soda of Japan for co-operating to fix the price of methionine, a protein  supplement that is added to animal feed to promote growth. Fines were set at Euro 118 million and Euro 9 million respectively. The third company in the cartel, Aventis, was granted full immunity from  fines because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the
Commission and provided decisive evidence on its operation. Two other companies - one of which is
Novus International, located in America - were cleared of all involvement in the  cartel earlier this year.

TD
According to the  Commission's decision of July 2, the  cartel operated between 1986 and 1999, and aimed to fix target and minimum prices of  methionine, implement concerted price increases, exchange information on sales figures, and agree on prices to individual customers. The companies held regular meetings at both top management and technical level. Participants at these meetings exchanged information on sales volumes, which were then used in discussions to determine the target prices to be fixed.

The significant differences in the fines reflects the disproportion in the market shares of Degussa, the world's biggest producer of methionine, and Nippon Soda, almost five times smaller in terms of 1998 market share figures.

The Commission granted both companies appropriate reductions in  fines because of the detailed information they provided during the course of the investigation. Nippon Soda received a 50% reduction in its fine as it provided the  Commission with crucial documents for the investigation, including hand-written notes taken during  cartel meetings and valuable information confirming the existence of the  cartel prior to
1990. The reduction in Degussa's  fine was less generous (25%), reflecting the fact that most of the information Degussa provided was not given voluntarily and that Degussa contested its participation in the cartel prior to mid-1992 and after 1997.The  Commission granted Aventis full immunity from fines because it was the first company to come forward and report the existence of the price-fixing ring. The Commission hopes that more companies will be encouraged by the Commission's willingness to grant leniency and therefore be more prepared to blow the whistle on a cartel which they have been involved in. Although the  Commission recently changed its antitrust rules to make it easier to grant full immunity to companies who co-operate in  cartel investigations (see  European Report 2659, same section), the methioninecartel was examined using the old 1996 rules because the case was opened three years before the new changes.This is not the first time that Aventis has escaped full punishment by the Commission for its role in a price-fixing ring. In November last year, Aventis became the first company ever to be granted full immunity from the Commission for speaking out against a vitamins  cartel. The other companies in the cartel received a record fine of Euro 855.2 million, and Aventis got away with just paying five million Euro for its minor role in another vitamin cartel.

The decision is further indication of the  Commission's determination to get tough on cartels. Competition Commission Mario Monti commented: "The behaviour of Aventis, Degussa and Nippon Soda has shown a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat which paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition."

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - Degussa and Nippon Soda fined for forming pet food cartel - Aventis escapes fine.

Brussels, 02/07/2002 (Agence  Europe) - The Commission has fined Germany's Degussa EUR 118 million and Japan's Nippon Soda Company Ltd EUR 9 million for their involvement in a  cartel in the methionine market. The France company Aventis was also involved in the  cartel, but in line with a 1996
Communication, it was exempted from any  fines for having revealed the existence of the  cartel and provided the Commission with decisive proof of how it operated. It would otherwise have been subject to a fine similar to the one imposed on Degussa.

TD
The European Executive opened an indepth inquiry in 1999 on this agreement. It discovered that the three companies in question had, by common accord, applied price increases between 1986 and 1999 and had exchanged information on their sales volumes and their market shares concerning  methionine, one of the main amino acids used essentially in feed for poultry and pigs. During the thirteen years of the agreement, the partners exchanged confidential information on their sales figures, data that was then compiled and used during discussions on indicative price determination. The most senior officials took part at these meetings, held at regular intervals. Such behaviour constitutes very serious infringement of competition rules and the Commission has therefore penalised the companies in relation to their market shares for the product concerned. Degussa, the world's leading  methionine producer, received the largest  fine given the injury that its dominant position in the sector caused to the smaller operators. Nippon Soda, which holds market shares five times smaller, received a smaller  fine. For having collaborated in one way or another in the inquiry, the two companies were nonetheless granted appropriate reductions. Nippon Soda, which provided the Commission with hand-written notes drafted at the meetings and other valuable information thus saw its fine reduced by half. Degussa, which did not collaborate voluntarily, did however have its  fine reduced by 25%. Finally, Aventis received full immunity for having pointed out the existence of infringement and for having fully cooperated in the investigation. The  Commission hopes other companies will be encouraged, after the fashion of Aventis, to cease such practices and to denounce any illegal practice of
the same kind that is aimed wholly at misleading consumers, said Mario Monti. The  Commission again severely denounced such practices. He said "the behaviour of Aventis, Degussa and Nippon Soda has shown a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat who paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition", he stressed. Degussa, for its part, was highly critical in a press release about the  Commission's decision and declares that it will appeal before the Court of Justice.

The European Commission on Tuesday imposed fines totalling [euro]127 million on two leading animal feed companies after it emerged that they had operated a thirteen-year-long  cartel to fix prices for feed ingredients.
German firm Degussa AC was  fined some [euro]118 million, while the Nippon Soda Company Ltd of
Japan must pay [euro]9 million.

TD
Aventis SA (formerly Rhone-Poulenc) also participated in the cartel, but was granted full immunity from fines by the Commission because it had blown the whistle on the cartel's existence and provided decisive evidence to Commission investigators

Cartel operation

Between 1986 and 1999, the three companies had operated a policy through which they had agreed on price targets, implemented price increases and exchanged information on sales volumes and market shares for methionine - an essential amino acid which is widely used as a component of pig and poultry feed.

The Commission revealed that the three companies held regular meetings both at top managerial level and at a technical level to exchange information and fix target prices.
During the infringement period, the annual market for the product in western  Europe was worth around
[euro]260 million.
"Disregard" for consumers

"The behaviour of Aventis, Degussa and Nippon Soda has shown a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pigmeat who paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition," declared Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

"The Commission hopes that like Aventis other companies will feel encouraged to come clean and denounce any such illicit behaviour whose sole purpose is to rip off consumers.
The three companies' conduct was a very serious infringement of EU competition rules, the  Commission
said in its statement.
Aventis granted amnesty

However, Aventis had been granted full immunity from  fines for alerting the Commission to the operation of the price-fixing agreement and for providing information about the cartel. "Otherwise it would have received a fine similar to the one imposed on Degussa," the Commission noted.

The difference in the  fines imposed reflects the fact that Degussa's share of the market in 1998 was almost five times greater than that of Nippon Soda.

In addition, Nippon Soda was granted a 50% in its initial  fine amount by virtue of its subsequent cooperation with the  cartel investigation, while Degussa - whose input into the investigation was "not provided voluntarily", according to the  Commission - was granted only a 25% rebate. (b)

(EDS: ADDING STATEMENT BY NIPPON SODA)

TD
The European Union's (EU) antitrust watchdog on Tuesday  fined Germany's Degussa AG and Japanese chemical maker Nippon Soda Co. for fixing prices of a key animal feed ingredient called  methionine.

The European Commission said it ordered Degussa to pay 118 million  euros and Nippon Soda 9 million euros, but it granted France's Aventis SA immunity because it had lifted the lid on the  cartel's existence and provided proof of the unlawful operation.

The commission said executives at the three companies met to fix minimum prices and coordinate price increases between 1986 and 1999 in violation of EU antitrust rules.

Methionine is a protein  substitute added mainly to poultry and pig feed.

The methionine market for the 18-nation European Economic Area (EEA) was worth 260 million  euros a year during the cartel period, the European Commission said.
The EEA consists of the 15-nation EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

Nippon Soda issued a statement saying it regrets that the EuropeanCommission has accused it of being involved in the cartel, adding it will carefully consider how to handle the order.
The Tokyo-based company incurred a one-time loss of 2 billion yen from legal expenses related to the
cartel case for the year ended March 31.

The European Commission last week fined Degussa AG and Nippon Soda Company Ltd 118 million euros and 9 million euros, respectively, for participating in an alleged  cartel with Aventis SA to fix prices for the feed ingredient methionine. Methionine, an amino acid used in compound animal feeds and premixes, is commonly fed to poultry and increasingly added to pig feed and specialty animal feeds. The commission granted Aventis full immunity from  fines because it acted as a whistleblower, revealing the alleged cartel's existence and providing decisive evidence.  European Antitrust Commissioner Mario Monti said the firms had "shown a complete disregard for their customers and, ultimately, consumers of chicken and pork meat, who paid more for the products concerned than if the companies had engaged in healthy price competition."

A fine of EUR 9 M was imposed on Nippon Soda for the same reason. No fine was levied on Aventis, which also participated in the  cartel, because it reported the situation to the authorities and gave decisive evidence.

On 3 Jul 2002, Degussa announced that it is to lodge an appeal with the Court of First Instance of the European Court of Justice against the European Commission's fine of EUR 118 M, imposed after Degussa was found guilty of participating in a price fixing  cartel for methionine, the animal feed additive.

Degussa is appealing in the  European Court against what it says is an excessive EUR 118 M fine by the European Commission for its part in fixing the price of  methionine. The Commission also fined Nippon Soda EUR 9 M for its part in a worldwide  cartel, which operated from 1986 to 1999. Aventis avoided a  fine because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the Commission. Degussa made what it thought was
sufficient provision in the 2001 accounts for a Commission fine and damages arising from legal actions by customers in the US and Canada. It will now have to make additional provisions, probably in 2Q 2002. Degussa cannot understand why the  fine is so high, as it cooperated fully with the  Commission from the start. Also, the Commission did not take account of the fact that  methionine prices fell continuously from
1993. The Commission says that although Degussa did cooperate, most of the information it supplied was not provided voluntarily.

And as it also contested its part in the  cartel before mid-1992 and after 1997, despite evidence to the contrary, its  fine was cut by only 25%. Nippon Soda provided detailed information and its  fine was cut by
50%.

Degussa has been fined EUR 118 M for entering into a  price-fixing agreement with other manufacturers of methionine. This is one of the highest  fines ever imposed by the European Commission. Degussa is to appeal against the decision which it considers unacceptable. Aventis escaped a fine by revealing the existence of the  cartel. Methionine is used in the production of animal feeds.
