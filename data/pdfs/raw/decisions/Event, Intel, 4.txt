The fight between Microsoft and the European Union over how to bring greater  competition to the internet browser market erupted afresh late yesterday as the software company sought to pre-empt stringent anti-trust action being planned by Brussels.
Microsoft issued a unilateral statement saying that its Windows 7 operating system, due to be launched
in October, would be made available in Europe without the Internet Explorer browser included. The move
was designed to reduce the legal uncertainties around the launch of Windows 7 in Europe and "the risk
of large fines", Microsoft said.

The move drew a cool response from the European Commission, which has been preparing more stringent action against the software company to bring greater competition to the browser market. While the commission said it noted Microsoft's move "with interest", one official said that for consumers, "rather than more choice, Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less".

Thomas Vinje, a lawyer representing ECIS, a grouping of technology companies opposed to Microsoft, said: "This is a step in the right direction, but it is far from enough."

Microsoft's move comes as the European regulators have been preparing action against Microsoft that would include a requirement for it to give personal computer users a choice of which browser they use
on their PCs. The unusual remedy would mark the most direct intervention yet by European regulators to promote consumer choice in technology markets.

The EU has been expected to push ahead with its action later this summer, along with a penalty that some legal observers say could approach the record €1.06bn ($1.49bn)  fine recently levied on Intel.

Rather than wait for the expected sanctions, however, Microsoft said yesterday that Windows 7 would be released in Europe without a browser, and that PC makers and consumers would be free to install one themselves.

The move echoes an earlier European action against Microsoft, when regulators forced the company to sell a version of Windows without a media player "bundled" into the software.

HELSINKI, June 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian browser maker Opera ASA said on Friday that Microsoft's plan to ship its Windows operating system in Europe without its Internet Explorer web browser was not enough to restore  competition.

On Thursday the world's top software maker Microsoft, countering pressure from European regulators, said it plans to ship the newest version of Windows in Europe without its Internet Explorer web browser. [ID:nN11506625]
"I don't think what Microsoft announced is going to restore  competition," Opera's Chief Technology
Officer Hakon Wium Lie told Reuters.
"I don't think its going to be enough, I don't think it will get them off the hook," he said.

Shares in Opera leapt more than 6 percent to a three-year high on the news of Microsoft's plans and expectations for an upcoming announcement from the company, an analyst said.

Microsoft's abrupt reversal comes shortly before the  European Commission is due to rule on antitrust charges brought against the company in January, claiming that it abuses its dominant position by bundling its Explorer browser, shielding it from head-to-head  competition with rival products.
EU WATCHDOG

Until now, Microsoft has claimed that the browser was an integral part of the operating system and should not be pulled out, but it now plans to do that for a European version of Windows 7, due to be rolled out later this year.

A European Commission official said the EU watchdog will examine the conditions under which Microsoft will ship Windows 7 without browsers to manufacturers and suppliers, warning that the Commission will find out if there are any conditions attached.

"We never suggested that they have to sell Windows without Internet Explorer. We suggested that they might have to give the possibility to customers to chose between different browsers," the official said.

The official added that it was in Microsoft's interest to inform the Commission of any conditions attached to the rollout.

The Commission, which enforces  competition rules in the 27-nation European Union, said it planned to decide shortly on its latest case against the U.S. tech giant.
It has to date  fined Microsoft nearly $2 billion for various offenses. The Commission can impose a  fine
of up to 10 percent of a company's turnover and other remedies if found to have breached EU rules.

Last month, it slapped a record $1.49 billion  fine on the world's biggest chipmaker  Intel for anti-competitive practices.
