BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to decide on Wednesday whether to fine chemical firms Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) and Total SA (TOTF.PA) for  price-fixing in industrial chemicals, an EU spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

European Union competition regulators are investigating whether the firms colluded to fix the prices of organic peroxides - chemicals used to make polystyrene and other plastics.

TD
"The Commission is expecting to make a decision tomorrow,"  Commission spokeswoman Amelia
Torres said.

No decision had been made on whether the firms would be  fined or how much to fine them, Torres added.

Chemical company Elf Atochem, now part of oil major Total, in 1992 pleaded guilty in a U.S. antitrust case over price fixing  in the monochloroacetic acid and organic  peroxides market.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators Wednesday  fined five European companies nearly euro70 million (US$85 million) for fixing the prices of key industrial chemicals, following similar action by U.S. authorities.

Regulators concluded the companies colluded over sales of organic  peroxides, which are used to make plastics and polystyrene for products like containers and packaging.

TD
Atofina S.A., a unit of Total S.A., was fined euro43.5 million. Degussa U.K. Holdings Ltd. and Peroxid Chemie GmbH & Co. KG were fined euro16.7 million, with an additional  euro8.8 million levied on Peroxid Chemie for actions before it was acquired by Degussa.

Smaller penalties were levied against two other companies:  euro500,000 against Peroxidos Organicos S.A. and euro1,000 against AC Treuhand AG. Akzo Nobel NV escaped  fines for being the first company to tell cartel busters about the collusion.

Total has already been punished by U.S. regulators for fixing the organic peroxides market. Total unit Elf Atochem paid US$8.5 million in 2002 for colluding over sales of the peroxides and for rigging markets for a substance called MCAA, which is used in products ranging from pharmaceuticals and herbicides to plastics.
In 2001, Akzo Nobel paid US$12 million to U.S. regulators for MCAA offenses.

In a statement, the European Commission said the producers operated a cartel between 1971 and the end of 1999. The cartel was founded by Akzo, Total and Peroxid Chemie, the Commission said. The other companies joined later.

BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had imposed a fine of nearly 70 million  euros on a group of firms for running a  cartel in industrial chemicals known as organic peroxides.

It said in a statement that the firms were Atofina, part of Total (TOTF.PA), Peroxid Chemie, Laporte, which is now known as Degussa UK Holdings, Perorsa and consultancy AC Treuhand AG.

BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had fined a group of firms 70 million  euros ($86 million) for running a cartel in the market for organic peroxides for 29 years, the longest illegal co-operation deal it has uncovered.

In a statement it said the four chemical firms were Total (TOTF.PA) unit Atofina, Peroxid Chemie, Laporte, now known as Degussa UK Holdings (DGXG.DE) and Spain's Perorsa. It also  fined consultancy AC Treuhand AG, while Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) escaped a penalty.

TD
The market for the chemicals, used to make polystyrene and other plastics, is worth 250 million  euros
a year, it added.

The fine would also have been much higher had not Akzo, which also participated in the price fixing agreement, received full immunity for being the first to confess its existence to the Commission in early 2000.

It said Akzo and Atofina were the market leaders for the chemicals in  Europe, with shares of 43 percent and 25 percent respectively. Perorsa is the market leader in Spain.

Atofina was  fined 43.4 million euros, Peroxid Chemie 8.83 million  euros while Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie were fined 16.73 million. Perorsa received a penalty of 500,000  euros.
The consultancy was  fined 1,000 euros because it played a key role in the cartel from the end of
1993, organising meetings and hiding incriminating evidence, the Commission said.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Spokesman Reijo Kemppinen said that following the midday briefing on Wednesday, there would be a press conference by Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio on new energy package.
Following the  Commission meeting on Wednesday, there will be a meeting between Czech Prime
Minister Vladimir Spidla and Commissioners.
At 1500/1400 GMT on Wednesday, there will be a VIP Corner between  Commission President
Romano Prodi and Spidla. At 1745/1645 GMT on Wednesday, there will be a VIP Corner between Prodi
and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende who will be accompanied by Finance Minister Gerrit
Zalm, Foreign Affairs Minister Bernard Bot and Secretary of State for  European Affairs Atzo Nicolai.

At 1230/1130 GMT on Thursday, there will be a press conference by Prodi ahead of EU heads of states and governments meeting (Dec 12-13). - - - -

COMMISSION-AGRICULTURE

Kemppinen said that the  Commission had adopted on Wednesday a draft regulation which would introduce the minimus state aid in agriculture and fisheries.

"This means that a national aid for farmers and fishermen of up to three thousands  euro over three years would no longer need a prior notification by the  Commission," he said.

He added that the  Commission had also adopted a regulation which simplify the agricultural state aid regime by granting a bloc exemption for various state aid for SMEs.

"The new bloc exemption system brings also more transparency as all aid which fall under the bloc exemption will be published on the internet before the pay out," he said.
- ~- --

COMMISSION-VAT

Spokesman Jonathan Todd said that the  Commission had decided to propose to allow nine Member States to continue to apply for an additional two years (until 31 December 2005) the reduced rates of Value Added Taxes (VAT) they currently apply to specified labour-intensive services such as renovation of private dwellings, hairdressing, window-cleaning and small repairs.

Directive 1999/85/EC allowed those Member States that so chose to apply a reduction of VAT on these services for an experimental period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002 (later extended to end
2003), in order to test the impact of such a reduction in terms of job creation and of combating the black economy.

HUMAN RIGHTS

Spokesman Diego De Ojeda said that Wednesday was the World Human Rights Day which marks the signature, 55 years ago, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 10th anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights, which adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (VDPA) as well as the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Principles on National Human Rights Institutions.

He added that on the occasion of the World Human Rights day, the  Commission was reiterating its commitment to the defence and promotion of Human Rights and democracy, which lie at the foundation of the EU.

COMMISSION-SYRIA

De Ojeda said that the  Commission managed on Tuesday in Damascus to reach an understanding with Syrian side on all remaining issues in the negotiations for  Euro-Mediterranean association agreement.

"We will now have to consult with Member States with a view to initialising the agreement as soon as possible. Hopefully before the end of this year... The agreement with Syria was the last one because we already have concluded Euro-Mediterranean association agreements with all of the other  Euro-Med partners. It is a very good news," he said.

London (Platts)-10Dec2003/1051 am EST/1551 GMT EC fines 5 chemical companies $86-mil for  price  fixing cartel The European Commission has imposed fines of nearly Eur70-mil on: Atofina; Peroxid Chemie; Degussa UK (previously know as Laporte); Perorsa; and AC Treuhand AG for operating a  cartel for organic peroxides used in the manufacture of plastic and rubber. The  cartel is the longest lasting cartel ever uncovered by the Commission and the fine would have been much higher had Akzo, which also participated in the price-fixing agreement, not received full immunity for being the first to confess its existence to the commission. Swiss-based consultancy company, AC Treuhand organized meetings between the producers and was seen to be hiding incriminating evidence from the end of 1993, an EC press release said Wednesday. It was also found to have violated EU law.

TD
The evidence gathered by the Commission, between Jan 1971 and the end of 1999 showed the main producers of organic peroxides had conspired to raise prices and share out the Eur250-mil/yr market for organic peroxides.

London (Platts)-10Dec2003/1054 am EST/1554 GMT The EC imposed  fines of: Eur43.47-mil to Atofina; Eur8.83-mil to Peroxid Chemie; Eur8.83-mil to Degussa and Peroxid Chemie, both jointly and severally; Eur16.73-mil to Peroxidos Organicos; Eur0.5-mil to AC Treuhand; Eur1,000 to Akzo. The  fines for Atofina, Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie were increased significantly to take into account that it had previously been found to be operating as part of a  cartel. Atofina was involved in four other cartels before: Peroxygen products (1984); Polypropylene (1986); LDPE (1988); PVC (1988 and 1994). Laporte (now Degussa) and Peroxid Chemie were also part of the peroxygen  cartel. The sanction against AC Treuhand is limited in amount because of the novelty of the approach, the EC said. AC Treuhand produced "pink" and "red" papers with the agreed market shares which could not be taken outside AC
Treuhand's premises and even reimbursing the travel expenses of participants to avoid leaving any traces about the illegal meetings.

London (Platts)-10Dec2003/1056 am EST/1556 GMT The 29 year  cartel was the longest running ever uncovered by the Commission. The cartel was founded by Akzo, Luperox (later absorbed by Atochem which, in the meantime, has been renamed Atofina), and Peroxid Chemie. Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa) of Spain joined the  cartel in 1975 and Laporte (bought by Degussa and renamed as Degussa UK Ltd. in
2001) joined in 1992, after it took full control of Peroxid Chemie. The  Commission found that the  cartel was a serious violation of Article 81(1) of the  European Union Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The companies were awarded a reduction in the fine for co-operating in the investigation. Akzo and Atochem are the largest producers of organic peroxides in the world. In  Europe, Akzo's market share is around 43%, Atochem's around 25% and Laporte's around 20%. Perorsa only has a market
share of around 3% in  Europe but is the market leader in Spain.

Dutch drugs, chemicals and coatings company Akzo Nobel NV has not been  fined by the European    Commission (EC) for making price agreements for organic  peroxides, it was reported on December
10, 2003.

EC decided on December 10, 2003 to impose  fines totalling nearly 70 mln  euro ($85.5 mln) to five companies, namely the oil companies French Atofina, German Peroxid Chemie, German Laporte, Spanish Perorsa and Swiss consultancy AC Treuhand AG, for operating a  cartel in the market for organic peroxide products, a chemical used in the plastic and rubber industries.

TD
Akzo Nobel, being also a member of the  cartel was given full immunity for being the first to admit the cartel's existence to the EC. Akzo Nobel approached the  Commission in early 2000 with key information on the  cartel. The cartel was founded by Akzo Nobel, Luperox (currently Atofina) and Peroxid Chemie.

It is the longest-lasting  cartel ever uncovered by the Commission. There are evidence that in the period from January 1971 to the end of 1999 the six companies conspired to raise prices and share out markets for organic  peroxides. The market for organic peroxides, used in the production of plastic and rubber, is worth some 250 mln  euro ($305.4 mln) a year in the European Economic Area.

E.U. Fines Companies EUR70 Million For Fixing Chemicals Prices

European Union regulators Wednesday fined five companies a total of
EUR70 million for fixing the prices of key industrial chemicals. Regulators concluded the companies had colluded over sales of organic peroxides, used
to
make plastics and polystyrene for products like containers and packaging. Total SA's (TOT) unit Atofina was fined EUR43.5 million, Degussa SA's (DGX.XE) U.K. subsidiary was fined EUR16.7 million and Peroxid Chemie was fined EUR8.8 million. Smaller penalties were levied against two other companies - EUR500,000 against Perorsa and EUR1,000 against AC Treuhand AG.

Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) escaped a fine as it was the first company to tell cartel busters about the collusion.

Germans, Dutch in spat over EU budget policy

BERLIN/BRUSSELS - Germany and the Netherlands clashed on Wednesday over whether freshly flouted EU budget rules should be given judicial backing in a constitution the bloc's leaders are due to approve this week.
Germany said a Dutch-inspired proposal to enshrine in the charter a right of recourse to the  European
Court of Justice over the enforcement of budget deficit limits went too far.

Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, angry after finance ministers suspended disciplinary action against France and Germany two weeks ago, said an amendment tabled by the EU's Italian presidency did not go far enough.

EU Commission fears constitution "left-overs"

BRUSSELS - Two days before a crucial  European Union summit, the executive  European                 Commission voiced fears on Wednesday that squabbling leaders may adopt a weak constitution or leave core issues unresolved.
"Under no circumstances should there be any leftovers in this negotiation," chief  Commission
spokesman Reijo Kemppinen said after the EU executive reviewed the state of negotiations.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who will chair the talks, said he had devised a compromise that might solve a key dispute over member states' voting rights that pits heavyweights Germany and France against Spain and Poland.

EU's neutrals inch towards collective defence pact

BRUSSELS - The  European Union's four non-aligned states inched towards backing a collective defence clause on Wednesday after winning assurances their neutrality would be recognised in the bloc's first constitution.

But, two days before a crucial summit on the treaty, there was still no green light from Ireland, Finland, Austria and Sweden on an issue which stands in the way of a broader package on defence arrangements for an enlarged EU.

The package, drawn up after tortuous negotiations between France, Germany and Britain and viewed with suspicion by the United States as a potential challenge to NATO, includes the creation of a core group of nations for defence cooperation.

French trawlers protest at EU fishing quota cut
PARIS - French fishermen blockaded major ports on Wednesday to protest hefty proposed cuts in EU
fishing quotas they say threaten an already stricken industry.

Trawlers blocked the Channel ports of Calais, Le Havre, Dunkirk, Boulogne and Cherbourg for several hours, one irate British road haulier complaining the action would cost British industry over one million pounds ($1.74 million).

In the south, Marseille and Martigues were brought to a halt but the fisheries ministry said by late afternoon only two out of nine French ports involved were still affected. A symbolic protest was also staged at Belgium's major Antwerp facility.

EU productivity growth down since mid-1990s - study

LONDON - Labour productivity growth, a measure of output per worker, slowed in about 80 percent of European Union industrial sectors since the mid-1990s as U.S. productivity soared, a study showed on Wednesday.
The study, carried out for the EU  Commission, said a slowdown in productivity growth was evident in
45 of 56 industrial sectors across the EU.

Only a small number of sectors who either produce or intensively use information and communication technology bucked the trend, it said. Even in areas of positive growth, the rate was less than in the United States.

Germany rejects Dutch EU budget policing proposals

BERLIN - Germany sees little support for Dutch proposals to include recourse to the  European Court of Justice over breaches of the bloc's budget rules in a  European Union constitution, a government source said on Wednesday.

"We don't think anything of it and we would not support these proposals in the intergovernmental conference," a senior German official told journalists. "I can't imagine that these proposals will be supported by many member states."

Italy, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, published a new draft constitution on Tuesday for an EU summit on Friday which includes for the first time the possibility of recourse to the EU's highest court if the bloc's budget disciplinary procedure is not applied or improperly applied.

Berlusconi promises last gasp offer on EU charter

ROME - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Wednesday he had prepared a compromise solution over the EU constitution that he hoped would persuade doubters Spain and Poland to sign up to the new charter.

"I have in my pocket a formula which I believe gives Poland and Spain recognition as great countries," said Berlusconi, who will chair a December 12-13 summit of EU leaders that is supposed to result in a deal on the EU rulebook.

"I will pull it out at the last minute and we will see if it will be accepted by these two countries," he told reporters.

"I am very hopeful about the outcome of this marathon effort, but I am also conscious of the difficulties that lie ahead," he added.

EU approves 487 mln  euros of Italian railway aid

BRUSSELS - Italian plans to plough 487.5 million  euros ($597 million) of government aid into the railway sector over the next 17 years won approval from the  European Commission on Wednesday.

Competition regulators at the EU's executive said the aid was legal as the full costs which road transport imposed on society did not show up in the price of transporting goods and people by trucks and cars.

UK soothes energy industry fears over EU charter

LONDON - The British government said on Wednesday it had allayed concerns in the oil industry that a planned European Union constitution could hand Brussels sway over North Sea resources.

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told parliament that amendments, circulated by EU president Italy late on Tuesday, added an assurance stating that a member state's right to exploit its energy resources should not be affected.
"(It) provides protection for a nation state's use of its own resources," Straw said.

"We have to be eagle-eyed on this to ensure that this text finds its way into any final treaty to which we sign up. I promise the House that I shall ensure that we do so."

Britain publishes draft  euro referendum bill

LONDON - The British government published on Wednesday a draft bill to prepare the ground for a possible referendum on joining  Europe's single currency - something most pundits rule out before a general election, expected in 2005.

Polls consistently show most Britons want to keep the pound and many  euro supporters and opponents see the draft bill as little more than a cosmetic bid to keep the hopes of  euro enthusiasts and key European allies alive over Britain's entry.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced the publication of the draft bill - which had been expected and sets out the referendum question and eligibility to vote - in his pre-budget report to parliament on Wednesday.

EU to query U.S. limits on Iraq deals at WTO

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it was investigating whether a U.S. decision to exclude Iraq war opponents from bidding for contracts to rebuild the country meets world trade rules.

"We are now going to start looking into the 26 contracts in order to make sure that limitations to competition for these public procurement contracts to certain countries is compatible with World Trade Organisation rules,"  European Commission spokeswoman Arancha Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez, noting that the contracts were worth $20 billion, said the  Commission expected to have some results from its inquiry in the coming weeks.

INTERVIEW-Irish aim to soothe US/EU friction after Iraq

DUBLIN - Ireland plans to use its upcoming presidency of the  European Union to help improve relations between  Europe and the United States after the strains provoked by the Iraq war.

"With no particular axe to grind over the war, Ireland could play the part of honest broker between both sides,"  Europe Minister Dick Roche said on Wednesday.

"The huge amount of kinship, friendship and bonds of blood between both countries mean we share the same objectives," he told Reuters in an interview.

The next EU-US summit will take place in  Europe towards the end of the Irish presidency and Roche said he hopes then to invite President George W. Bush to Dublin.

Labour costs hurt Greece more than high  euro-Alpha
Page 15 of 48 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ATHENS - The  euro's strength poses less of a threat to the Greek economy's competitiveness than unit labour costs, which are rising faster than elsewhere in the  euro zone, one of the country's main banks said on Wednesday.

"The economy's competitiveness deteriorates when unit labour costs in Greece rise at faster rates than in other competing countries in the  euro zone," said Alpha Bank's (ACBr.AT) economic research division in its weekly bulletin.

Citing EU  Commission data, it said unit labour costs in Greece rose by 4.5 percent last year versus an average 2.3 percent in the single currency club as a whole. The rate of increase remained higher this year as well - 3.4 versus 2.3 percent.

Finland leans towards Italy's EU defence proposal

HELSINKI -  European Union member Finland, which has always refused to participate in military alliances, indicated on Wednesday it would support a compromise proposal from EU president Italy on the bloc's common defence.

Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Austria have objected to a proposed clause in the EU's first constitution which would bind member states to help each other in the event of an armed aggression, arguing it would undermine their neutrality.

The military status of the four is one of several issues that must be solved to bring negotiations on the constitution to a successful conclusion at this weekend's EU summit in Brussels.

Power shock for France and Germany in new  Europe
PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - In the past, when France and Germany pulled together, the rest of  Europe
followed.

But their once-meek neighbours are fed up with being shoved around and have turned negotiations on a landmark EU constitution into a tug of war.

The stakes at an EU summit starting Friday could not be higher as Paris and Berlin fight to preserve a constitution draft that would bolster their central role in a bloc due to grow from 15 to 25 members next year.

Whatever the outcome of the Brussels meet, analysts say the two have already had a foretaste of the new power dynamics in an enlarged EU and have hurt their case with tactical blunders and a
high-handed approach to its rules.

EU thrashes out deal for "single sky" air traffic

BRUSSELS - The  European Union has moved a step closer to forming a single sky of harmonised air traffic control zones after a deal between EU parliamentarians and member states, officials said on Wednesday.

The deal was struck late on Tuesday and ended differences over how to agree on new, larger air traffic control zones and on military and civilian cooperation. Parliament is expected to pass the bill in
January to come into effect by the end of 2004.

Governments will still have the main say in deciding the new air traffic blocs, but any disputes can be settled by a panel chaired by the  European Commission.

EU budget pact still alive but needs overhaul-CEPS

BRUSSELS - The EU's budget rulebook is not dead, even though finance ministers recently suspended its disciplinary procedures, but it needs an overhaul to make it more effective, a think tank said on Wednesday.



Page 16 of 48 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Centre for  European Policy Studies' Macroeconomics Policy Group suggested changing the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure countries' did not allow their structural deficits, which exclude the impact of economic swings, to grow in good times.
It also called for sanctions to bite earlier in a discipline process which is launched against states that
top the EU deficit cap of three percent of gross domestic product, as Germany and France expect to do
for the third year running in 2004.

EU approves BA, Iberia alliance

BRUSSELS - British Airways (BAY.L) and Spanish airline Iberia (IBLA.MC) have won a six-year approval for an alliance across the  European Union, the  European Commission announced on Wednesday.

British Airways and Iberia asked the  Commission in mid-2002 for antitrust exemption so they could share profits, agree on prices, combine sales forces and ground staff and coordinate connecting flights, all on a route-by-route basis.

"The Commission initially had concerns that the alliance would reduce consumer choice and increase prices on a number of routes where the two partners have a strong position," regulators at the EU's executive said in a statement.

Polish PM in deep freeze to get fit for EU summit

WARSAW - Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller is undergoing super-cooling treatment in a bid to recover from spinal injuries and attend a summit on  Europe's future, his doctor said on Wednesday.

Miller is spending a two-minute session twice each day in a cryogenic cell at minus 100 degrees Celsius. The therapy is meant to ease swelling caused by the fracture of two vertebrae when his helicopter crashed last week.

"This is an anti-inflammatory process which is also intended to ease pain," said Dr. Marek Durlik, head of the elite Interior Ministry Hospital in Warsaw where Miller is staying.
"It speeds up a person's metabolism and rehabilitation - and is often used by athletes."

EU in breakthrough with Syria on cooperation pact

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Wednesday announced a breakthrough in talks with Syria on a political and economic cooperation pact, underlining its determination to engage with a country Washington has sought to isolate.

"We managed yesterday in Damascus to reach an understanding with the Syrian side on all remaining issues in the negotiations for a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement," said Diego De Ojeda, a spokesman for the executive European Commission.

"We will now have to consult with member states with a view to initialling the agreement as soon as possible, hopefully before the end of this year," he told a news briefing.

Spain, Poland face test of wills at EU summit

MADRID/WARSAW - An alliance between Spain and Poland in defence of hard-won  European Union voting rights is about to be put to a stern test and the outcome could decide whether the EU can agree on a new constitution this week.

So far, Madrid and Warsaw have maintained a united front in their campaign to protect the voting rights they won at Nice three years ago, despite increasing frustration from EU power brokers France and Germany and current EU president Italy.

But Brussels-based diplomats detect signals that Poland is ready to compromise, putting the spotlight firmly on Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at the crucial EU summit beginning in Brussels on Friday.

Blair, Chirac, Schroeder to meet before EU summit

LONDON - Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will meet early on Friday, ahead of a crunch EU summit, in a bid to iron out differences threatening to jam negotiations over a new constitution.

Blair's official spokesman said the meeting would take place in Brussels as heads of government gather to thrash out a deal on a constitution for an enlarged bloc of 25 members.
Some British newspapers saw the meeting as an attempt to align positions over the thorny question of
EU voting rights.

"You do have to have the agreement of all 25 to move forward but, equally, it's important if some of the differences between countries as significant as these three can be ironed out in advance," Blair's spokesman told reporters.

EU slaps 70 mln euro fine on chemicals cartel

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had imposed a fine of nearly 70 million euros on a group of firms for running a  cartel in chemicals known as organic peroxides, used to make polystyrene and other plastics.

It said in a statement that the four chemical firms were Atofina, part of Total (TOTF.PA), Peroxid Chemie, Laporte, which is now known as Degussa UK Holdings, Perorsa and consultancy AC Treuhand AG.
Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) escaped a  fine.

EU banks see fragile recovery, no  euro fx worry
BRUSSELS - The  European Banking Federation said on Wednesday it expects  euro zone growth of
1.7 percent in 2004 and that the  euro's exchange rate was not yet a concern.

"The European economy is picking up, but the recovery is fragile," the federation said as it released its poll of the views of its economists based in  European Union member states.

The poll's growth forecast is in line with that of Paris-based OECD, which last month forecast euro zone growth of 1.8 percent next year compared with only 0.5 percent in 2003. The European Commission is forecasting the same for 2004.

Brussels, 10/12/2003 (Agence Europe) - The Commission has imposed fines totalling 70 million EUR on companies which were part of a cartel producing organic peroxides, chemicals used by the plastics and rubber industry. Atofina was fined the most, 43.47 million EUR, Peroxid Chemie 8.83 million, Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie, jointly and severally, 16.73 million, Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa) 0.5 million, and AC Treuhand 1000 EUR. This is the longest-lasting  cartel ever discovered (29 years), said
the Commission, and the  fine would have been much higher had Akzo Nobel, which also took part the agreement, not had full immunity for being the first to confess its existence to the  Commission. The cartel began in 1971, and continued until 1999. During this time, its members agreed on price increases
and to divide up the organic  peroxides market, which represents some 250 million EUR a year. Akzo and
Atochem are the world's biggest producers of organic  peroxides.

TD
Akzo has a 43% market share in  Europe, Atochem around 25% and Laporte around 20%. Perorsa has
3%, but is the market leader in Spain. The consultancy AC Treuhand played a key part in the agreement,
setting up meetings and producing information on market shares. It was  fined as well but to a lesser
extent, as the approach followed is quite a new one. The Commission is, however, sending out a clear
message: "organisers or facilitators of cartels, not just the cartel members, must fear that they will be
found out and heavy sanctions imposed from now on".

HD        European Commission fines five chemical  companies for price fixing

The European Commission has imposed fines of nearly Eur70-mil on five companies for forming and operating a cartel, which was allegedly used for  price fixing  purposes. The companies are Atofina, Peroxid Chemie, Degussa UK (previously called Laporte), Perorsa and AC Treuhand AG. They are accused of operating a  cartel for organic peroxides used in the manufacture of plastic and rubber.

TD
The cartel is the longest lasting  cartel ever uncovered by the Commission and the fine would have been much higher had Akzo, which also participated in the price-fixing agreement, not received full immunity for being the first to reportedly confess its existence to the commission.

Swiss-based consultancy company AC Treuhand allegedly organized meetings between the producers and was seen to be hiding incriminating evidence from the end of 1993, the EC reported Dec 10. It was also found to have violated EU law. The evidence gathered by the  Commission, between Jan 1971 and the end of 1999 showed the main producers of organic peroxides had conspired to raise prices and share out the Eur250- mil/yr market for organic peroxides.

The EC imposed  fines of Eur43.47-mil to Atofina; Eur8.83-mil to Peroxid Chemie; Eur8.83-mil to Degussa and Peroxid Chemie, both jointly and separately; Eur16.73-mil to Peroxidos Organico, Eur0.5-mil to AC Treuhand and Eur1,000 to Akzo.
The fines for Atofina, Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie were increased significantly to take
into account that it had previously been found to be operating as part of a  cartel. Atofina was involved in
four other cartels before: Peroxygen products (1984); Polypropylene (1986); LDPE (1988); PVC (1988
and 1994). Laporte (now Degussa) and Peroxid Chemie were also part of the peroxygen  cartel. The
sanction against AC Treuhand is limited in amount because of the novelty of the approach, the EC said.
AC Treuhand produced ``pink'' and ``red'' papers with the agreed market shares which could not be
taken outside AC Treuhand's premises and even reimbursing the travel expenses of participants to avoid
leaving any traces about the illegal meetings.

The alleged 29 year  cartel was the longest running ever uncovered by the  Commission. The cartel was allegedly founded by Akzo, Luperox (later absorbed by Atochem which, in the meantime, has been renamed Atofina), and Peroxid Chemie. Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa) of Spain joined the  cartel in
1975 and Laporte (bought by Degussa and renamed as Degussa UK Ltd. in 2001) joined in 1992, after it took full control of Peroxid Chemie.

The Commission found that the  cartel was a serious violation of Article 81(1) of the European Union Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The companies were awarded a reduction in the fine for co-operating in the investigation.

Akzo and Atochem are the largest producers of organic  peroxides in the world. In  Europe, Akzo's market share is around 43%, Atochem's around 25% and Laporte's around 20%. Perorsa only has a market share of around 3% in  Europe, but is the market leader in Spain.

HD     CHEMICALS: COMMISSION FINES ORGANIC PEROXIDES CARTEL WC    559 words

LP
The European Commission imposed almost Euro 70 million of fines on Atofina, Peroxid Chemie, Laporte (now known as Degussa UK Holdings), Perorsa and AC Treuhand AG for their involvement in a cartel carving up the market for organic peroxide, a chemical used in the plastic and rubber industries. Between January 1971 and the end of 1999, the main  European manufacturers conspired to raise prices and share out markets for organic  peroxides, or double oxygen bond organic chemical products for the production of plastic and rubber. This makes it the longest-running cartel ever to be uncovered by the Commission, in a market worth around  Euro 250 million a year in the European Economic Area.
The total  fine would have been much higher had not Akzo, which also participated in the price-fixing
agreement, received full immunity for being the first to confess its existence to the Commission.

TD
The Commission imposed the following  fines:
* Atofina -  Euro 43.47 million
* Peroxid Chemie - Euro 8.83 million
* Degussa UK Holdings Ltd. and
Peroxid Chemie GmbH & Co KG (jointly and severally) -  Euro 16.73 million
* Peroxidos Organicos S.A (Perorsa) -  Euro 0.5 million
* AC Treuhand AG -  Euro €1,000
* Akzo (Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals B.V,
Akzo Nobel N.V, Akzo Nobel Chemicals International B.V) -  Euro 0

The fines for Atofina, Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie were increased significantly to take into account that this is not the first time that they have been caught in  cartel agreements.

AC Treuhand is not a producer but a Swiss-based consultancy company. Because it played a key role in the cartel from the end of 1993, organising meetings and hiding incriminating evidence, it was also found to have violated EU law. The Commission wants to send out a clear message that organisers or facilitators of cartels, not just the cartel members, must fear that they will be found and heavy sanctions imposed. Akzo Nobel Chemicals was the first to approach the Commission in early 2000 with decisive information on the  cartel and, therefore, escaped a fine, according to the Commission's approach on leniency. Atochem (Atofina) also approached the Commission with information but could not get full immunity because it was not the first to do so. Instead it got a reduction of the  fine as did other participants for co-operating in the  Commission's investigation.

Akzo and Atochem are the largest producers of organic  peroxides in the world. In  Europe, Akzo's share is around 43%, Atochem has around 25%, Laporte has around 20%. Perorsa has a market share of around 3% but is the market leader in Spain. The  cartel was founded by Akzo, Luperox (later absorbed by Atochem which, in the meantime, has been renamed Atofina) and Peroxid Chemie. Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa) of Spain joined the  cartel in 1975 and Laporte (bought by Degussa and renamed as

Page 25 of 48 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Degussa UK Ltd. in 2001) joined in 1992, after it took full control of Peroxid Chemie. Swiss consultancy
AC Treuhand played a key role in the  cartel from 1993 organising meetings, often in Zurich, producing
'pink' and 'red' papers with the agreed market shares which could not be taken outside AC Treuhand's
premises and even reimbursing travel expenses of participants to avoid leaving any traces about the
illegal meetings.

On 10 Dec 2003, the  European Commission announced that a total of EUR 70 M in  fines had been levied against Atofina, Perorsa, Laporte (now part of Degussa) and Peroxid Chemie in relation to an organic peroxides cartel. Akzo Nobel was not  fined, even though it participated, because it related details of the cartel to the EC.

LP
The European Commission has fined Atofina, Peroxid Chemie, Laporte (now Degussa UK Holdings), Perorsa and AC Treuhand AG a total of EUR 70 M for running an organic peroxides price-fixing cartel. Lasting for 29 years, the  cartel was the longest-running ever discovered by the Commission and the overall fine would have been higher if Akzo Nobel (which also participated in it) had not obtained full immunity in return for having told the Commission of its existence. The  European organic peroxides market is worth about EUR 250 M. The cartel was formed by Akzo, Luperox (eventually taken over by Atochem which later became Atofina) and Peroxid Chemie. Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa) joined in 1975 and Laporte in 1992 after taking control of Peroxid Chemie. AC Treuhand is a Swiss consultancy firm which played an essential role in the  cartel since end 1993.

TD
By company the  fines were: EUR 1000 for AC Treuhand; EUR 43.47 M for Atofina; EUR 16.73 M for Degussa UK and Peroxid Chemie together; EUR 8.83 M for Peroxid Chemie; and EUR 0.5 M for Peroxidos Organicos. Akzo and Atochem are the world's leading organic  peroxides producers. Akzo
controls 43% of the  European market and Atochem 25%. Laporte has a 20% market share in  Europe and
Perorsa 3%.

Air Liquide (AL) has confirmed CW's exclusive report that it will supply oxygen and nitrogen to Dow Chemical's sites at Seadrift, TX and Taft, LA (City Dec. 10, p. 6). AL says it has also reached agreement to supply Dow's Plaquemine, LA site. Seadrift and Taft, former Union Carbide facilities, had previously operated their own air separation plants. AL says it will supply approximately 5,000 tons/day of oxygen and nitrogen to Dow, and invest $40 million "to optimize supply." AL will build a new pipeline to link Seadrift to its existing pipeline, and integrate oxygen and nitrogen operations at Taft into its network.

Environmental engineering firm CH2M Hill (Denver) says it has acquired engineering firm Lockwood Greene (Spartanburg, SC) for $95.5 million. CH2M Hill says that Lockwood Greene's revenues are roughly $600 million/year, and it employs 2,500. Further details were not disclosed.
* CIDX Names New Director

The Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) has named JoAnne R. Norton executive director, effective January 1, 2004, for a two-year term. She will replace Jeff Frayser, who has served as acting executive director since August. Frayser is also CIDX cybersecurity standards director. Norton, a senior executive manager/information technology (IT) at DuPont, has most recently been on special assignment at the Department of Homeland Security (Washington) helping the agency align IT activities across its 22 directorates, CIDX says.
Rogerson Named President and CEO of Hercules

Hercules says its board has elected Craig A. Rogerson as president and CEO. Rogerson has been acting president COO since the departure of former Hercules chairman and CEO William Joyce in October. He was formerly president of Hercules' FiberVisions and Pinova divisions. The company says that John K. Wulff will remain as nonexecutive chairman of the Board. Hercules says Rogerson's selection followed a three-month search conducted with the assistance of Spencer Stuart (New York). "Based on this extensive process, it is clear to us that Craig is the best person for the job," says Joe Wyatt, an outside director at Hercules and chairman of its corporate governance, nominating and ethics committee. Joyce left Hercules to become chairman and CEO of Nalco, which was recently acquired from Suez by a group of private equity capital firms (CW, Oct. 15, p. 8).

PolyOne to Close Engineered Films Plant in New Jersey

PolyOne says it will close its engineered films plant at Burlington, NJ in mid-February, resulting in the elimination of approximately 115 jobs, less than 2% of its total. "This business unit has felt the effects of raw material inflation and offshore competition in some of its key markets," says PolyOne CEO Thomas A. Waltermire. The Burlington plant makes vinyl calendered film products used in decals, window shades and wallcoverings, and other thin-film products. PolyOne says it will move many of these products to sites with excess capacity, including Lebanon, PA and Winchester, VA. The closure will yield an annualized pre-tax savings of $5.5 million. PolyOne said last month it would close plants at DeForest, WI and Wynne, AR as part of a restructuring in its elastomers unit. The company says the plants will close by the end of the year, and will result in the elimination of 230 jobs, 3% of its total. Elastomers is one of three businesses put up
for sale by PolyOne last month. PolyOne says restructuring expense associated with the shutdowns is estimated at $15 million, of which approximately $7.5 million will be noncash and related to asset
write-offs.
Solvay to Continue American Soda Bicarbonate Operations

Solvay subsidiary American Soda (Parachute, CO) says it will continue to operate its sodium bicarbonate plant at Parachute. The company says it is on track to raise operating rates at the 150,000-tons/year plant from 50%-55%, to 67% next year to feed a projected increase in demand for its USP-grade product. American Soda says it is still evaluating options for its soda ash plant at Parachute. The plant will continue to operate through at least January, the company says. American Soda says bicarbonate demand will
grow 3%-5% in 2003, and is likely to increase 3%-6% next year. A 1-cts/lb price increase, about 4%, announced by several producers is looking "favorable," but there has been no settlement as yet, the company says. A soda ash price increase of $7/ton announced by several producers for 2004 contracts has been "very successful, far more so than the past year," a company official says. The success of the price increase is largely due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the American Soda plant, which sources say is losing money.
OM Group to File Delayed 10-Q This Week

OM Group (OMG) says it plans to file its third-quarter 10-Q with SEC on or before December 19. OMG delayed the filing because of the sale of its precious metals business during the quarter (CW, Dec. 3, p. 6). OMG says that adjustments in the filing will include an increase in the gain on the sale of its precious metals business, previously reported at $53.7 million. OMG says other adjustments will include a restatement of third-quarter 2003 restructuring and other charges, and a reclassification to continuing operations of the company's electroless nickel business, which had previously been classified as a discontinued operation. "The adjustments will increase previously reported income from operations and
net income, but have no material effect on the company's results from continuing operations before restructuring and other charges," says OMG chairman and CEO James Mooney.
Brussels Fines Producers for  Peroxides Price-Fixing

The European Commission has handed out fines totalling almost  euro70 million ($85 million) to four companies for conspiring to fix the price of organic peroxides between 1971 and 1999. Atofina received the heaviest  fine, euro43.47 million. Degussa was fined a total euro25.56 million, of which  euro8.83 million relates to Peroxid Chemie (Pullach, Germany), a founding member of the cartel, and the rest to Laporte, which joined the  cartel in 1992 when it acquired Peroxid Chemie, the commission says. Degussa acquired Laporte in 2001. The  commission slapped fines of euro500,000 and euro1,000 on Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa; Barcelona) and AC Treuhand (Zurich), respectively. AC Treuhand is a consulting firm, which "organized meetings" of the price-fixing cartel members, and "hid incriminating evidence," the  commission says. "This is the longest-lasting cartel ever uncovered by the commission
and the fine would have been much higher had not Akzo Nobel, which also participated in the price-fixing agreement, received full immunity for being the first to confess its existence," the commission says. The commission estimates the value of  Europe's organic peroxides market at euro250 million/year. Akzo
has a 43% share, Atofina 25%, Degussa 20%, and Perorsa 3%, the commission says. The U.S. Department of Justice  fined Akzo and Atofina in 2002 for operating an organic peroxides cartel.
Bayer HealthCare Cuts Jobs in Biotech and Urology R&D

Bayer HealthCare says it will shift biotech research and development activities now performed at Berkeley, CA and Kyoto, Japan to other sites. Bayer says the move will result in the elimination of 190 jobs at Berkeley and 75 at Kyoto Japan. Bayer says that its biological products division will maintain R&D and production at Berkeley. Bayer says that urology research activities currently conducted at Kyoto will be moved to Wuppertal, Germany in first-half 2004. Bayer says that biotechnology projects at Berkeley will transferred its R&D centers in West Haven, CT and Wuppertal. Separately, Bayer Chemicals says it plans to expand its  fine chemicals sales from the current  euro420 million/year ($508.2 million), to about
euro500 million/year in the next 2-3 years. That will be achieved mainly by increasing its position in

pharma intermediates, including a possible entry into production of proteins using mammalian cell fermentation, the company says (p. 23).
Bain Capital Confirmed as Buyer of Brenntag

Deutsche Bahn (DB; Berlin) has, as expected, selected private equity capital company Bain Capital to acquire Brenntag (CW, Nov. 19, p. 37). Bain will also purchase steel trading business Interfer Stahl
(Essen, Germany) from DB as part of a combined  euro1.4-billion ($1.7 billion) deal. The transaction will be effective January 1 and Bain will take over the two businesses in February or March, DB says. Bain has spent an estimated $1.2 billion buying chemical assets from Atofina, Celanese, and Rhodia during the
past year, and is reportedly bidding jointly with Permira to acquire Dynamit Nobel from Mg Technologies
(CW, Dec. 10, p. 13).
Modest Recovery Forecast for Germany

Growth in chemicals output in Germany will accelerate from 0.5% in 2003, to 1.5% in 2004, says industry association VCI (Frankfurt). The improvement is based on a predicted increase in exports, which grew 4% in 2003, to  euro84.7 billion ($102.8 billion), VCI says. Industry sales growth will remain static in 2004 at
1.5%, VCI says. Industry sales total  euro135.6 billion this year, VCI says. Chemicals output, meanwhile, grew 5% in the Netherlands in 2003 and sales grew 4%, to  euro34 billion, says industry association VNCI (Leidschendam). VNCI did not issue forecasts for 2004.
Lenzing Sues Zimmer over Lyocell Patent

Lenzing says it has filed a lawsuit in a Frankfurt court against Zimmer and Zimmer's Alceru Schwarza (Rudolstadt, Germany) subsidiary, alleging infringement of a Lenzing lyocell fiber patent. Alceru Schwarza operates a lyocell unit at Rudolstadt and offers planning and construction services for lyocell projects. Zimmer says the plant uses the company's proprietary technology and that it contests Lenzing's patent. Lenzing, meanwhile, says it has restarted its lyocell plant at Heiligenkreuz, Austria that was damaged by a fire earlier this year (CW, Oct. 29, p. 7).
* Sibneft May Sell Majority Stake

Roman Abramovich, owner of Sibneft (Moscow), would most likely attempt to sell a majority stake in the company to an oil multinational if he goes ahead with plans to withdraw Sibneft from a planned merger with Yukos (Moscow) (CW, Dec. 10, p. 7). Abramovich owned 92% of Sibneft prior to the merger. ChevronTexaco and ExxonMobil would be interested in buying a stake in Sibneft, sources say. Those companies earlier expressed an interest in buying a stake in the company that would have been created by the Yukos-Sibneft merger. Total would also be interested in buying into Sibneft, sources say. Sibneft operates an aromatics complex at its Omsk, Russia refinery.
* Ciba Directs R&D Funds to Asia

Ciba Specialty Chemicals is refocusing its R&D activities and has increased R&D spending 2% this year, to SF300million ($231 million), says CEO and chairman Armin Meyer. The company says it increased funds for "high risk-high reward" projects from SF10 million, to SF15 million, as part of the higher spend. Ciba's R&D budget will increase only slightly in 2004, but the company will direct more of its resources to developing technologies for products that will serve fast-growing markets, particularly India and China. Ciba will expand its Bombay R&D center, the company says. Products less than five years old should account for one-third of the company's sales "in the medium term," Ciba says. It did not disclose how much they currently account for.
* Ems Boss Gets Seat in Swiss Cabinet

The Swiss parliament has voted Ems-Chemie CEO and majority owner Christoph Blocher into the country's sevenmember cabinet. It follows the victory of Blocher's far-right People's Party (SVP) in Switzerland's recent general election (CW, Oct. 29, p. 7). Blocher will resign as Ems CEO and board member when he takes office on January 1. His daughter, Magdalena, an Ems board member, will take over as CEO.

Chemical industry news items are presented in brief. Among other news, Hercules says its board has elected Craig A. Rogerson as president and CEO. Rogerson has been acting president COO since the departure of former Hercules chairman and CEO William Joyce.

LP
The European Commission has imposed almost EUR 70 M of  fines on Atofina, Peroxid Chemie, Laporte (now known as Degussa UK Holdings), Perorsa and AC Treuhand AG for their involvement in a  cartel carving up the market for organic peroxide, a chemical used in the plastic and rubber industries. Between Jan 1971 and the end of 1999, the main  European manufacturers conspired to raise prices and share out markets for organic peroxides, or double oxygen bond organic chemical products. This makes it the
longest-running cartel ever to be uncovered by the  Commission in a market worth around EUR 250 M/y in the European Economic Area. The total  fine would have been much higher had not Akzo, which also participated in the price-fixing agreement, received full immunity for being the first to confess its existence to the Commission.

TD
The following  fines were imposed: Atofina EUR 43.47 M; Peroxid Chemie EUR 8.83 M; Degussa UK Holdings Ltd and Peroxid Chemie GmbH and Co KG (jointly and severally) EUR 16.73 M; Peroxidos Organicos SA (Perorsa) EUR 0.5 M; AC Treuhand AG EUR 1000; Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals BV, Akzo Nobel NV and Akzo Nobel Chemicals International BV EUR 0. The  fines for Atofina, Degussa UK Holdings and Peroxid Chemie were increased significantly to take into account that this is not the first time that they have been caught in  cartel agreements. AC Treuhand is not a producer but a Swiss-based consultancy company. Because it played a key role in the  cartel from the end of 1993, it was also found to have violated EU law. Akzo and Atochem are the largest producers of organic  peroxides in the world. In Europe, Akzo's share is around 43%. Atochem has around 25%, Laporte has around 20%. Perorsa has a market share of around 3% but is the market leader in Spain.

Five companies found guilty of operating a European cartel for organic peroxides have been fined a total of around EUR 70 M by the European Commission. The cartel had been operating for 29 years.
43% of the  European market was held by Akzo Nobel which led the cartel. By disclosing the activities of the cartel to the authorities, the company gained complete immunity. A fine of EUR 43 M was levied on Atofina with Peroxid Chemie being  fined EUR 9 M. A  fine of EUR 17 M is shared between Peroxid Chemie and Degussa UK. AC Treuhand, Switzerland, was also  fined. Peroxidos Organicos (Perorsa), Spain, and Laporte were also members of the  cartel. Degussa now owns Laporte. An appeal may be launched by Degussa, Perorsa and Atofina.

Akzo Nobel has been given full immunity by the European Commission for breaching competition rules after the company was the first to confirm the existence of an organic peroxides cartel. The price-fixing agreement, which ran from 1971 to 1999, involved a number of other companies, who were recently fined a total of EUR 70 M by the  Commission for their malpractice. The  fines imposed ranged from EUR 1000 to EUR 43 M, but Akzo Nobel, which has reinforced its compliance efforts over the last few years, was granted exemption from any financial penalties after volunteering details about the  cartel in 2000.

European Commission decision adopted on 10 Dec 2003. The Commission has decided to prohibit a cartel aimed at reducing competition on the market for organic peroxides. Under Article 81 of the EC Treaty, the  Commission adopted a decision imposing  fines totalling almost EUR 70 M on Atofina SA, Peroxid Chemie GmbH, Degussa UK Holdings Ltd, Peroxidos Organicos SA and AC Treuhand AG. The cartel lasted 29 years (1971-1999) making it the longest-lasting  cartel ever to be uncovered by the Commission. Akzo, which also took part in the price-fixing agreement, was granted full immunity for having been the first to reveal the cartel's existence. The Commission found that the addressees of the decision took part in a secret cartel covering the market in the European economic area, whereby they agreed to reduce competition in their interests. Their complex and long-term agreement constituted by its nature a very serious infringement of  European competition law.

* Bayer Settles Polyols Investigation

Bayer Corp. says it has reached agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to settle charges related to allegations that Bayer engaged in anti-competitive activities from February 1998 through December 2002 involving adipic-based polyester polyols. Under terms of the agreement, Bayer agreed to plead guilty, and to pay a $33-million  fine. Bayer says it will set up a respective provision in the third quarter of 2004. Bayer says it has cooperated with the DOJ during the investigation.

* Cytec Settles  Price-Fixing Suit

Cytec Industries says it has agreed pay $7 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that it engaged in fixing carbon fiber prices. "While we deny all charges of wrongdoing, and in fact believe we would have been a victim of any conspiracy among carbon fiber manufacturers, the costs of further defending ourselves far outweighed the cost of settlement," Cytec says. Cytec says it will take a pretax charge of $8 million in the third-quarter to cover the settlement and other "minor litigation matters."
* DuPont Forms FCCL JV with Samsung

DuPont Electronic Technologies says it has agreed to form a joint venture with Cheil Industries (Seoul), a division of Samsung, to manufacture adhesiveless, flexible copper clad laminate (FCCL) for use in displays, cell phones, and other electronic devices. The 50-50 Jv, SD Rex, will build a manufacturing facility at Cheil's Gumi, Korea site. It will have initial capacity of 100,000 sq. meters/month, and will be expanded as demand warrants, DuPont says. SD Flex will primarily serve the Korean market.
* New HOS Rules Deadline Extended

Congress approved a one-year extension of the trucking industry's new hours of sen/ice (HOS) rules late last week, says the American Trucking Associations (ATA; Washington) (p. 25). "The new rules will stay in effect until September 30,2005, or until the FMCSA comes up with a rulemaking to comply with the court order-whichever comes first," ATA says.
* Stepan to Acquire Brazilian Firm

Stepan says it has agreed to acquire surfactant maker FCC-Comerico E lndustria de Productos de Hygiene e Limpeza, a subsidiary of Unilever Brasil. Terms were not disclosed. The acquisition will enable Stepan to "better serve the growing Brazilian market with local production." FCC has total anionic surfactant capacity of 83,000 m.t./year.
PQ Puts Itself on the Block

PQ Corp. says that it has retained Credit Suisse First Boston (New York) to explore "strategic alternatives," including a possible sale of the company. The process is likely to take "several months," PQ says. PQ, which is privately held, says it has revenues of more than $500 million/year. Descendants of company founder Joseph Elkinton, who started the company in 1831, own a controlling interest in PQ, and current and retired management own a stake. "PQ's . strong performance over the past four years, the current strength of M&A markets, the favorable long-term capital gains tax environment, and geographic expansion" opportunities are reasons the company cites for pursuing a sale. PQ has strong positions in sodium silicates, zeolites, and magnesium derivatives serving the beverage, catalyst, chemical,

construction, detergent, petroleum, pulp and paper, and water treatment markets, analysts say. PQ has a leading 25%30% share of the 1.2-million m.t./year sodium silicate market in the U.S., says SRI Consulting (Menlo Park, CA). PQ also has a silicates presence in  Europe, and it has announced plans to build a
40,000-m.t./year sodium silicate plant at Tianjin, China, to start up in first-quarter 2005.
ExxonMobil Chemical Acquires Basell's Stake in CIPEN

ExxonMobil Chemical says it has acquired Basell's 50% share in the Compagnie Industrielle des Polyethylenes de Normandie (CIPEN) plant in Notre Dame de Gravenchon, France, giving it 100% ownership of the facility. The plant produces 420,000 m.t./year of linear-low density polyethylene. Terms were not disclosed. The plant manufactures linear low density polyethylene resins. "Market acceptance of metallocene-based polyethylene resins continues to grow rapidly, and we are committed to extending our global supply capability to meet the growing needs of our customers," says Jim Harris, senior v.p. of ExxonMobil Chemical.
Grace Settles Honeywell Suit

W.R. Grace says it will settle a dispute with Honeywell International over chromium waste at a Grace property in New Jersey that Honeywell once owned. Honeywell will pay Grace $62.5 million and indemnify Grace from any further cleanup obligations. Grace purchased the property in 1981, but discovered it was contaminated by a former chromium manufacturing facility owned by a Honeywell predecessor. Grace
says it sued Honeywell to force a cleanup and won. Honeywell was in the process of appealing that verdict when Grace announced the settlement.
Private Equity Firm Buys Great Lakes' WIL Unit

Behrman Capital (New York) says it has agreed to purchase Great Lakes Chemical's toxicological services business, WIL Research Laboratories (Ashland, OH), for $105 million. "Divesting WIL Research Laboratories supports the company's strategy to focus on our core industrial and consumer businesses," says Great Lakes chairman and CEO Mark Bulriss. WIL provides nonclinical toxicological testing and bioanalytical contract services that provide product safety and toxicological assessment services to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and biotechnology industries. WIL has 390 employees based at its Ashland facility, and it does not anticipate job reductions as a result of the transaction, Berhrman says. After-tax proceeds from the sale are estimated at $100 million, Great Lakes says. Great Lakes says that as a result of the sale it expects to announce a realignment of its reportable segments soon.
Nufarm Buys Stake in South American Agchems Maker

Australian agrichemical company Nufarm (Laverton, Australia) has signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire 49.9% of agricultural chemicals makers Agripec Quimica e Farmaceutica (Fortalezam, Brazil) for $120 million. Privately owned Agripec is expected to post sales of around $200 million in 2004, Nufarm says. Agripec operates a major production facility in Fortaleza, and has an extensive sales network serving all of Brazil's major farming regions. Agripec's sales have grown greatly in recent years, reflecting the substantial rise in agricultural production in Brazil, which now ranks behind the U.S. and Japan as the world's third-largest crop protection market, Nufarm says. Total 2003 sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil were $3.1 billion, Nufarm says. The proposed acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of November.
Russia Prepares to Sign Kyoto Protocol
Russian president Vladimir Putin, after years of deliberation, has recommended that Russia sign the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change. Putin's decision remains subject to approval by the Duma, Russia's
parliament. The parliament could vote on the Kyoto accord within weeks, sources say. Russia accounts for
17% of the world's global-warming gas emissions, and its approval will raise the combined emissions of all
signatories to the protocol above 55%-enough to bring the protocol into force. The Kyoto Protocol is widely
regarded as the most important environmental treaty. Anthropogenic global-warming gas emissions are
responsible for causing climate change, according to scientific consensus. "This is a decision for which the
world has been waiting for two-anda-half years," says Jennifer Morgan, director/climate change program
at environmental group WWF International (Brussels). The protocol requires that countries reduce their
emissions of global-warming gases, including carbon dioxide, by just over 5% compared with 1990 levels,
by 2008-2012. The U.S. is the only leading industrialized nation that has refused to sign the protocol. It
cites a lack of scientific evidence surrounding global warming, and concerns that joining the protocol would
harm U.S. industry competitiveness.

Europe's Incoming Industry Commissioner Supports Dilution of Reach
Günter Verbeugen,  Europe's incoming industry commissioner, says he aims to water down the
commission's proposed Regulation, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (Reach) program.
Page 44 of 48 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Speaking in Brussels last week, Verheugen said that he plans in particular to lighten the burden of Reach on small- and medium-size businesses. "We want to make sure companies do not collapse under the weight of [Reach]," he says. "If it turns out that we have to make adjustments, we will make them." He did not disclose specific changes, but says he will deal with each issue "against the backdrop of the effect it could have on Europe's competitiveness." Verheugen says he will wait until the  European Parliament has proposed amendments to the  commission's latest draft of Reach before proposing changes based on
new information from sources such as risk assessments. Verheugen's appointment as industry commissioner is effective November 1. He was previously commissioner responsible for the recent expansion of the  European Union. Incoming environment commissioner Stavros Dimas will have joint responsibility with Verheugen for  fine-tuning Reach.
Private Equity Firm Buys BASF's Printing Inks; Plans Inks Merger
Private equity capital company CVC Capital Partners says it has acquired two printing ink businesses in
Europe and will merge them to create an  euro8300 -million/year ($1 billion) business. CVC has
purchased BASF Printing Systems (Stuttgart, Germany), the  euro600'iTiillion/year printing ink and printing
plate business of BASF. The deal includes pigment plants at Huntington, WV and Shanghai, BASF says.
CVC has also purchased  euro231-million/year printing inks and additives company ANI Printing Inks
(Trelleborg, Sweden) from a management team that bought ANI from Akzo Nobel in 2002. The merged
business will be headquartered at Stuttgart.
Akzo Confirms Chlor-Alkali Closure

Eka Chemicals, an Akzo Nobel subsidiary, has confirmed plans to close a mercury-cell chloralkali plant at Bohus, Sweden, with the loss of about 150 jobs (CW, Feb. 4, p. 16). The plant has capacity for 90,000 m.t./year of chlorine. The closure will take place at the end of 2005 when Hydro Polymers' contract to purchase chlorine from the plant is due to expire. Hydro, the only chlorine customer of the Bohus plant, is building a membrane-cell chloralkali unit at Rafnes, Norway, with capacity for 130,000 m.t./year of chlorine, for completion in 2005 (CW, March 26, 2003, p. 13). Meanwhile, the Swedish government has introduced a ban on mercury-cell, chlor-alkali production in the country from 2010. Separately, Akzo says it will relocate organic  peroxides capacity from Emmerich, Germany, to the U.S. and Asia, by end-2006, with the loss of 70 jobs.
* Degussa Builds Complex at Shanghai

Degussa says it has selected Caojing, near Shanghai, for a previously announced project to establish a "multi-user site" for production units of several Degussa business units. Degussa had also shortlisted Nanjing and Qingdao as possible locations for the project (CW, March 17, p. 17). Degussa Specialty Chemicals (Shanghai), a newly created subsidiary of Degussa's China holding company, will manage the site. Degussa's coatings and colorants business will build the first plant at the sitea polyester unit that will be completed in 2006.
* Shell Merges Chemicals, oil Products

Shell says it has combined its chemicals and oil products businesses under a singe management team. Rob Routs, CEO of Shell Chemicals, has been named CEO of the merged business. The move should lead to improved performance in chemicals and oil products through greater operational integration, Shell says. It is part of a recently announced group-wide restructuring at Shell. The restructuring includes the previously announced divestment of Basell, Shell's polyolef ins joint venture with BASE Basell last week announced the sale of its 50% stake in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) producer Compagnie Industrielle des Polyethylènes de Normandie (Cipen), to ExxonMobil Chemical. Cipen operates a
420,000-m.t./year LLDPE plant at Notre-Dame-de-Gravenchon, France.

Private equity capital company Vienna Capital Partners (VCP; Vienna) says it aims to sell 62.6% of BorsodChem (Kazincbarcika, Hungary) under previously announced plans to reduce VCP's BorsodChem stake (CW, Sept 22, p. 5). The sale will take the form of a private placement to institutional investors, and will cut VCP's stake in BorsodChem to 28.6%. The stake will be reduced to 22.6% if an "over-allotment option" is exercised, VCP says. VCP has set the offer price at HFIl,850/share, valuing BorsodChem at HR140.93 billion ($702 million). The offer is scheduled to close on November 5.

Bayer A.G. has agreed to plead guilty to and pay a $4.7 million criminal  fine for participating in a conspiracy to fix the prices of nitrile rubber for eight months during 2002.

According to the one-count felony charge filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Bayer conspired with ``unnamed co-conspirators to suppress and eliminate competition'' for NBR in the U.S. and elsewhere from May through December 2002.

TD
Under the plea agreement, which must be approved by the court, Bayer has agreed to assist the government in its ongoing investigation, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, which said this case is the first in an ongoing investigation of  price fixing  in the NBR industry.

NBR-technically, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber-is used to make automotive parts, hoses, belting, cable, O-rings, seals, adhesives and sealants.
Bayer was charged with violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of
$10 million for corporations and a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of
$350,000 for individuals for violations occurring before June 22, 2004.
This is the third  price-fixing case to which Bayer has agreed to plead guilty.

Earlier this year it agreed to pay a  fine of $66 million for charges related to the sale of rubber chemicals during 1995-2001 and $33 million for participating in a conspiracy from 1998 to 2002 to fix prices of aliphatic polyester polyols.
Antitrust authorities in  Europe, the U.S. and Canada opened their investigation into  price-fixing
among nitrile rubber suppliers in late 2002, according to Crompton Corp., which said in late 2003
it was assisting competition authorities and had been granted amnesty from criminal prosecutions
and fines as a result.
Crompton sold its nitrile business in 2001 to Mexico's DESC S.A. de C.V. The European Commission also began its investigation in late 2002.
Bayer and Japan's Zeon Corp. are considered the world leaders in nitrile rubber, each with about
100,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, from a total global capacity of about 480,000
tons, according to data published by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers.
