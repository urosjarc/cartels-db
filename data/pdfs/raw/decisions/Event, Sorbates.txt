BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Antitrust authorities Wednesday fined four companies EUR138 million for participating in a  cartel for sorbate food preservatives, European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

TD
The E.U.  fined four companies: Germany's Hoechst AG (G.HFA), EUR99 million, and Japan's Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd. (J.DCI) EUR16.6 million, Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd., EUR12.3 million and the Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. (J.NSY), EUR10.5 million.

A fifth company involved in the  cartel, Japan's Chisso Corp., which helped the  Commission gather evidence, avoided a  fine.

"The only way for companies to avoid high  fines is to come clean," Monti said. "One of the companies came forward and escaped a  fine. This is the fourth time the  Commission has granted full immunity for revealing a cartel."

The Commission said the five companies controlled about 85% of the  European sorbates  market. Sorbates are used to prevent micro-organisms from growing in foods such as mayonnaise and sausages as well as beverages.

The Commission concluded that the companies operated a  cartel between 1979 and 1996. The companies agreed prices and allocated volume quotas for each other. Company officials met twice a year to fix prices and volumes, the  Commission said.

"Because of this conspiracy,  European consumers paid more for many everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other," Monti said.

Chisso told the Commission in 1998 about the  cartel. Under the Commission's leniency policy, companies can avoid fines if they are the first to provide information on a cartel.

The E.U. imposed the biggest  fine on Hoechst because it was co-leader of the cartel with Daicel and it had committed a similar violation in the past. However, the  Commission cut the fine by half because the German company cooperated with the investigation.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) - The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday  fined four European and Japanese companies a total of 138.4 million euros (about 161 million US dollars) for operating a price-fixing cartel in the sorbates  market.

Sorbates are one of the most widely used food preservatives in  Europe to prevent the development of moulds, bacteria and other micro-organisms in food.

TD
"Because of this conspiracy  European consumers paid more for many everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other," the  European Union (EU)'s executive said in a statement.

The largest  fine, of 99 million  euros (about 115 million dollars), was levied on Germany's Hoechst. Other companies named in a statement included Daicel Chemical Industries, Ueno  Fine Chemicals and The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Company.

However, Japan's Chisso Corporation which helped the EU head office gather evidence, was given immunity for cooperating in the probe.



The EU executive said it had determined that the
cartel ran
between December 1978 and October 1996.
The companies met twice a year to discuss setting prices for each country and allocating volume quotas for each other.
The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their

annual worldwide turnover for  price-fixing offences.

The European Commission levied fines of EUR138.4m ($161m) on four companies for their role in a conspiracy to fix the price of food preservatives.

Hoechst, the former German chemicals giant that is now owned by Aventis, and three Japanese groups, Daicel Chemical Industries, Ueno  Fine Chemicals and Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry, were  fined for their role in a  cartel which fixed the price and production quotas for  sorbates,  a widely used preservative.

TD
A fifth company, Chisso, was given immunity after it reported the  cartel to the European authorities under a leniency policy set up to encourage companies to blow the whistle on price fixing.

Between them, the five controlled 85 per cent of the  European market for sorbates  which are used in mayonnaise, sausages, cheese and cosmetics.

Hoechst, which the  commission said benefited most from the  cartel was fined EUR99m. Daicel, Ueno and Nippon synthetic shared total  fines of EUR39.4m.

The fines will be seen as a sign of renewed efforts by Brussels to crack down on cartels. In 2001 the Commission fined Roche of Switzerland and Belgium's Interbrew, nearly EUR200m for their part in two separate conspiracies to fix prices of a citric acid food additives and beer.

Roche was also among 13 pharmaceutical companies that received record total penalties of EUR855m for taking part in a  cartel to control the vitamins market.
Mario Monti,  European Competition Commissioner, said: "I am determined that participation in a  cartel
should not pay. The only way for companies to avoid high  fines is to come clean and stop participating
in cartels whose only purpose is to extort from unknowing consumers, be they intermediate or final, illicit
profits."

Mr Monti has repeatedly said cartels are some of the most serious anti-trust violations and pledged to increase efforts to investigate and punish them. However, his critics say cartel investigations are still too long and often mirror probes already concluded by the US authorities. The sorbate investigation follows a similar investigation in the US.

The European Commission imposed a 99 mln euro ($115.6 mln) fine on former German chemical company Hoechst AG for participating in a cartel for sorbate food preservatives, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on October 1, 2003.

[Editor's Note: The  commission fined a total 138 mln euro ($161.1 mln) Hoechst and Japanese companies Japan Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd, Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd and Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. Japan Chisso Corp was also involved in the  cartel but avoided a fine because it helped the  commission to gather evidence.]

TD
The cartel, which operated between 1979 and 1996, controlled 85 pct of the sorbate market in Europe. Prior to its merger with French Rhone-Poulenc S.A., Hoechst was the largest European producer of sorbate food preservatives. Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc merged on December 16, 1999 to form
Aventis S.A.

The German company paid the largest fine because it had a major share in the  cartel and was previously charged with unfair price fixing  practices, Monti said.
The Commission launched the investigation in 1998, when Japan Chisso informed it of the  cartel
agreement aiming to avoid  fines.

The European Commission decided Wednesday that four Japanese and one German chemical company formed a cartel in the food preservatives market and  fined four of them a total of 138.4 million euros (about $161.6 million).

The five are Chisso Corp., Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd. from Japan, and Hoechst AG from Germany.

TD
The commission said the five companies formed a  cartel in the market of  sorbates,  one of the most widely used food preservatives in  Europe, agreeing upon prices and allocating volume quotas for each other between 1979 and 1996.

"Because of this conspiracy,  European consumers paid more for many everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other," EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.
The companies held about 85% of the  sorbates  market in 1995.

They usually met twice a year to discuss prices for each country and volume allocations. These meetings took place alternatively in  Europe and Japan, the  commission said.

Taking into account the gravity of the infringement and the market shares of each firm, among other things, the commission fined Hoechst 99 million  euros, Daicel 16.6 million euros, Ueno Fine Chemicals 12.3 million euros and Nippon Synthetic Chemical 10.5 million euros.
Chisso was not fined because it fulfilled the conditions for full immunity, the  commission said.

BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had fined European and Japanese companies a total of 138.4 million  euros for operating a price-fixing cartel in sorbates,  which are used as food preservatives.

"Because of this conspiracy  European consumers paid more for many everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference.

TD
In a statement, the  Commission said Germany's Hoechst was  fined 99 million euros, Daicel
Chemical Industries Ltd 16.6 million  euros and Ueno Fine Chemicals 12.3 million euros.
The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co Ltd received a  fine of 10.5 million  euros.

The Commission began the investigation in late 1998 after it was approached by another chemicals firm, Chisso, which therefore received full immunity from any  fines for being the first to inform the EU executive of the  cartel.

The companies met twice a year to discuss setting pricing for each country and allocating volume quotas for each other.

The Commission said sorbates  are one of the most widely used food preservatives in  Europe to prevent the development of moulds, bacteria and other micro-organisms in food.
The EU executive said it had determined that the  cartel ran between December 1978 and October
1996.

TOKYO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Japanese shares are expected to open firmer on Thursday, extending the previous day's rebound from six-week lows following a jump in U.S. stocks.

The U.S. Dow Jones average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index posted their biggest one-day gains since June as investors were relieved to see a report showing the U.S. manufacturing sector continued to expand.

TD
That is expected to ease concerns over Japan's export-led recovery at a time when investors are worried that the yen's recent rise to three-year highs on the dollar could slow exports and choke off a budding recovery in Japan.

"The momentum here will be kept after a jump in U.S. stocks," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities.
"Yesterday's limit-up gains in bank shares suggested the mood is improving."

The dollar spiked up against the yen in early Asian trade on suspected intervention by the Bank of Japan, suggesting the Japanese authorities are determined to hold down the yen. This is also seen as positive for Japanese stocks, analysts said.
Traders said the Nikkei average would move between 10,400 and 10,600 on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Nikkei ended the first day of the second fiscal half-year up 1.39 percent at
10,361.24, snapping a two-day losing streak.
STOCKS TO WATCH
- Kokuyo Co Ltd (7984.T).

Japan's biggest manufacturer of office supplies on Wednesday raised its group net profit forecast for the six months ended on September 30 to 350 million yen ($3.16 million) from 100 million, helped by cost cuts.
- Bridgestone Corp (5108.T).

Standard & Poor's on Wednesday revised its outlook on the 'BBB' long-term corporate credit rating on Japan's largest tyre maker to stable from negative, reflecting progress in debt reduction and a sound recovery in earnings and cash flow.
- Sharp Corp (6753.T).

The electronics maker is likely to report a group recurring profit of more than 50 billion yen for the fiscal first half ended Tuesday, up some 30 percent from a year earlier and a record for an interim pretax profit, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Thursday.

Sales of liquid crystal display colour televisions and camera-equipped cellular phones remained strong, and sales of smaller LCD panels and charge-coupled devices rose as well, the report said.

- Gulliver International Co Ltd (7599.T).

The used-car purchasing specialist on Wednesday raised its group net profit forecast for the half year ended in August by 51.1 percent to 1.7 billion yen, on the back of a 10.1 percent upward revision in its sales forecast.

Gulliver cited the use of New York Yankees star Hideki Matsui as one of its "image characters" as a factor behind its expected solid results.
- Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd (4202.T).

The European Commission said it had fined European and Japanese companies a total of 138.4 million euros for operating a cartel in sorbates,  which are used as food preservatives.

In a statement, the  Commission gave the top three fines as: Germany's Hoechst (HOEG.DE) 99 million euros, Daicel 16.6 million  euros and Ueno Fine Chemicals 12.3 million  euros.
- Furukawa Co Ltd (5715.T).

The copper smelter said on Wednesday it was in talks with two unnamed foreign firms to sell part or all of its 71.44 percent stake in loss-making Australian smelter operator Port Kembla Pty Ltd.

Furukawa halted operations at the Port Kembla smelter on August 25, a company official said. The facility has been hit by a weak copper market and a fall in processing fees.

In July Furukawa said it would liquidate the smelter if talks on selling its stake failed. Last year, the smelter booked sales of about 19 billion yen, accounting for about 38 percent of the Furukawa group's metal sales by value.
($1=110.67 yen).

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union antitrust authorities on Wednesday fined four companies euro138 million ($US 161 million) for participating in a  price fixing  scheme on sorbate food preservatives used in everything from yoghurt to meats and soft drinks.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said German giant Hoechst AG Corp. received the harshest fine, euro99 million (US$115.6 million) for its part in the  cartel which also involved three Japanese firms. However, Japan's Chisso Corp., which helped the EU head office gather evidence, was given immunity for cooperating in the probe, Monti said.

TD
"The only way for companies to avoid high  fines is to come clean," he said. "One of the companies came forward and escaped a  fine. This is the fourth time the  Commission has granted full immunity for revealing a cartel."
Monti said the largest  fine went to Hoescht because it was a repeat offender for participating in similar
price fixing  schemes in the past.
"Because of this conspiracy,  European consumers paid more for products," Monti told reporters. The Japanese companies fined are Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd. of Tokyo, for  euro16.6 million
(US$19.4 million), Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry of Osaka, for  euro12.3 million (US$14.4 million), and
Nippon Goshei, also known as Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., for  euro10.5 million (US$12.3
million).
The European Commission said the five companies controlled around 85 percent of the European      
sorbates  market. Sorbates are used to prevent micro-organisms from growing in foods.

The EU said its investigation found that the companies operated a  cartel between 1979 and 1996. The companies agreed prices and allocated volume quotas for each other. Company officials met twice a year to fix prices and volumes, the  Commission said.
Chisso told the  Commission in 1998 about the  cartel.
The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their annual worldwide turnover for
price-fixing offenses.

HD           Monti pursues  French state aid and UK soccer TV rights. BY           By Peter Chapman.

MARIO Monti, the competition commissioner, shrugged off his department's latest court setback by announcing legal action against serial state-aid offenders France and stepping-up a probe into the way Europe's biggest soccer league sold TV rights to Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.

His assault came just a day after the  European Court of First Instance outlawed a  fine of EUR 273 million levied in 1998 against 15 container shipping lines for forming a cartel. The Court upheld the illegality of the TransAtlantic Conference Agreement, but ruled the Commission had given the parties an insufficient opportunity to respond to their concerns.

TD
Unabashed by this, Monti said the  Commission was launching court action against France for failing to recoup, as promised, a EUR 450-million advance to computer maker Bull. The payment had been approved in 2002 on condition the money was paid back by 17 June this year.

Monti then announced he is stepping-up a probe into the English Premier League's sale of rights to cover matches on TV and new-media including mobile phones.

In the Bull case, Monti said: "The fact that France did not claim the money back in our view constituted a grave violation of state aid rules."

The move follows Monti's face-off with Paris last month over French plans to take a stake in stricken engineering firm Alstom.

Meanwhile Monti said he had "serious concerns" about the way the Premier League had sold-off the rights subsequent to a warning last year that initial plans to hold a single auction for audiovisual rights were too restrictive.

However, under the new tender BSkyB paid EUR 1.45 billion for exclusive rights to show 138 live matches for three seasons from 2004. Experts said this is 8% less than it paid in June 2000 for half as many games.

"The announcements made so far by the Premier League are that BskyB will have a greater monopoly than in the past. This is bad for competition and consumers," said Monti. He said the  Commission will "set out its concerns to the parties" - code for issuing a follow-up `statement of objections'.

Monti's move was attacked by UK Conservative MEP Jonathan Evans. He said: "Only the anonymous, out-of-touch bureaucrats in Brussels can claim that this would be in some way good for the football
fans in Britain."

On the court ruling, Monti declared himself satisfied that the judge had not questioned the substance of the Commission's findings. He said the executive had already put in place reforms to its procedures addressing many of the issues raised by the Court of First Instance.

COMPLETING a frenetic day, Monti announced a combined EUR 138.4 million fine on German chemicals firm Hoechst and three Japanese firms involved in a  cartel for sorbates,  used to preserve products such as mayonnaise and sausages.

A fifth firm, Chisso, escaped  fines because it gave information about the  cartel to officials. Monti confirmed he was also investigating state handouts to the Italian aerospace sector.

ECONOMICS

British industry enjoyed the fastest expansion in its activity for 16 months in September, according to the latest CIPS/Reuters purchasing managers' survey. Its headline index rose to 52.9 for last month from
52.2 in August, boosted by new orders as well as apparent job creation. Any figure above 50 indicates rising activity.

High street sales rebounded in September, according to the latest snapshot of conditions from the CBI.

HD         Cartel costs Hoechst Euros 138m - CHEMICALS. [CORRECTED] BY         By MARTIN ARNOLD, TOBIAS BUCK and DAVID FIRN.

The European Commission yesterday extended its campaign against cartels into the chemicals sector, imposing a fine of Euros 138.4m ( $161.4m) on Hoechst of Germany and smaller penalties on three Japanese companies for fixing prices and agreeing volume quotas between 1978 and 1996.

The cartel consisted of five companies operating in the market for  sorbates,  preservatives used in food products such as mayonnaise, sausages and drinks.

TD
Japan's Chisso Corporation escaped punishment because it provided information on the case. The bulk of the fine, Euros 99m, will have to be paid by Hoechst, with the remainder split between Daicel Chemical Industries, Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry.

Mario Monti, competition commissioner, said the companies' "conspiracy" had forced  European consumers to pay more for everyday products than they would have had to pay if the companies had competed.

"I am determined that participation in a  cartel should not pay. The only way for companies to avoid high fines is to come clean and stop participating in cartels whose only purpose is to extort from unknowing customers, be they intermediate or final, illicit profits," Mr Monti said.

Only a day before, Mr Monti's competition directorate had been dealt a severe blow in its fight against cartels when the Court of First Instance, the second-highest court in the  European Union, annulled a Euros 173m fine imposed on a container shipping  cartel in 1998. At the time, this was the largest  fine in such a case.

The fine, imposed by Mr Monti's predecessor, was thrown out because of what the court saw as a "lack of evidence and infringement of the rights of the defence". However, it upheld the  Commission's 1998 ruling in principle - a fact stressed yesterday by Mr Monti.

He described the court's ruling as a "setback", but insisted it would not change the  Commission's course. "The fight against cartels, as you know, is one of my top priorities," he said.

The commissioner said that Hoechst had been  fined particularly heavily "because of its size, its role in the cartel and because it committed a similar offence in the past". Hoechst was  fined for forming a cartel with other plastics makers in the late 1980s.

Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc of France in 1999 to create Aventis, although it still retains a separate listing in Germany. Aventis, which holds 99 per cent of Hoechst shares, said it could not comment on whether it would challenge the  fine until it had read the full  Commission decision.
However, the company said it had made "substantial" provisions to cover the cost.
Daicel was fined Euros 16.6m, Ueno  Euros 12.3m and Nippon Synthetic  Euros 10.5m.

London Edition 1. CORRECTION - Due to an editing error, Hoechst was reported in yesterday's paper as having been fined Euros 138.4m by the European Commission following a probe into a chemicals cartel. The company, now controlled by Aventis of France, was fined Euros 99m. (FTFT, 3/10/2003)

Bruxelles, 01/10/2003 (Agence Europe) - La Commission européenne  a infligé une amende d'un montant total de 138,4 millions d'euros aux participants d'un cartel sur le marché des sorbates,  un conservateur chimique couramment utilisé dans les produits alimentaires qui empêche le développement de moisissures et autres bactéries. Ils sont également utilisés pour revêtir le papier d'emballage de certains fromages et dans des produits cosmétiques. A l'issue d'une enquête minutieuse débutée en
1998, la Commission est arrivée à la conclusion selon laquelle, entre la fin du mois de décembre 1978 et le 31 octobre 1996 (30 novembre 1995 pour Nippon), cinq sociétés ont participé à une entente illicite sur ce marché, en fixant ensemble les prix et en s'attribuant des quotas en volume. Les consommateurs ont, par conséquent, payé des produits de la vie courante plus chers qu'ils ne l'auraient fait si les sociétés s'étaient livré concurrence.

TD
La Commission a donc décidé d'infliger des amendes aux participants, à savoir 99 millions d'euros à Hoechst (Allemagne), 16,6 millions à Daicel Chemical Industries (Japon), 12,3 millions à Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry (Japon) et 10,5 millions à The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry (Japon). La société Chisso (Japon), qui a dénoncé le  cartel, a pu bénéficier de l'immunité totale et ne s'est pas vu infliger d'amende. C'est la quatrième fois que la Commission accorde une immunité totale d'amende à une société ayant révélé l'existence d'un cartel. Cette infraction est d'autant plus grave qu'en 1995, ces sociétés contrôlaient ensemble plus de 85% du marché dans l'EEE. Jusqu'au transfert de ses activités dans le domaine des sorbates  à Nutrinova, en 1997, Hoechst était le plus grand producteur d'acide sorbique (le principal type de sorbates)  devant Daicel. En raison de sa taille globale, de la part détenue sur le marché et du fait qu'elle a déjà commis une infraction similaire dans le passé, Hoechst écope de la plus grosse amende. Sa bonne volonté lors de l'enquête a permis cependant à la  Commission d'en réduire le montant de 50%. Le Commissaire Monti s'est dit "bien décidé à faire en sorte que la
participation à une entente illégale ne soit pas payante". "La seule façon pour les sociétés d'échapper à de lourdes amendes est de faire des aveux et de cesser de participer à des ententes dont l'unique but est d'extorquer des profits illicites à des consommateurs", a dénoncé le commissaire.

Brussels, 01/10/2003 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission has fined four companies in sorbates cartel a total of 138.4 EUR million. Sorbates are used to prevent the development of moulds, bacteria and other micro-organisms in foods. They are also used for the coating of cheese wrapping paper or in cosmetics. Following a careful investigation begun in 1998, the  Commission demonstrated that beyond any doubt, that between the end of December 1978 and 31 October 1996 (30 November 1995 for Nippon) five companies operated a cartel by which they agreed prices and allocated volume quotas for each other. Consequently, European consumers paid more for many everyday product than if the companies had competed against each other.

TD
The Commission has therefore decided to imposed  fines on the participants of: (in EUR million); Hoechst
AG, Germany: 99; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd, Japan: 16.6; Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry, Ltd,
Japan: 12.3; The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co, Ltd, Japan: 10.5. Chisso, which testified under
the Commission's Leniency policy, obtained full immunity from the  fines. It is the fourth time that the
Commission has granted total immunity from  fines to a company for having revealed the existence of a
cartel. This infringement is more serious in 1995, when these companies jointly controlled 85% of the
market in the EEE. Until it transferred its sorbates  business to Nutrinova in 1997, Hoechst was the largest
producer of sorbic acid the main type of sorbates  followed by Daicel. Hoechst was imposed the highest
fine because of its overall size as well as its share of the relevant market and the fact that it had
committed a similar violation in the past. However, the final amount for Hoechst also includes a 50%
reduction for co-operating in the investigation. Commissioner Mario Monti said. "I am determined that
participation in a  cartel should not pay. The only way for companies to avoid high  fines is to come clean
and stop participating in cartels whose only purpose is to extort from unknowing consumers, be they
intermediate or final, illicit profits".

La Commission inflige des amendes d'un montant total de 138.4 millions d'euros à quatre sociétés ayant participé au cartel des sorbates.

Commission Européenne

TD
Dans une décision adoptée mercredi, la  Commission européenne  est arrivée à la conclusion que Hoechst AG, Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co Ltd et Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd ont mis en oeuvre une entente illégale sur le marché des sorbates  entre 1979 et 1996. Les  sorbates  sont l'un des conservateurs chimiques les plus couramment utilisés en Europe pour prévenir le développement de moisissures, de bactéries et d'autres
micro-organismes dans des produits alimentaires tels que les mayonnaises et les saucissons, ainsi que dans les boissons. Ils sont aussi utilisés pour revêtir le papier d'emballage de certains fromages et dans des produits cosmétiques. "Du fait de cette entente illégale, les consommateurs  européens  ont payé de nombreux produits de la vie courante plus cher qu'ils ne l'auraient fait si les sociétés s'étaient livré concurrence. Je suis bien décidé à faire en sorte que la participation à une entente illégale ne soit pas payante. La seule façon pour les sociétés d'échapper à de lourdes amendes est de faire des aveux et de cesser de participer à des ententes dont l'unique but est d'extorquer des profits illicites à des consommateurs, intermédiaires ou finals, qui sont victimes de ces agissements sans le savoir", a déclaré Mario Monti, Commissaire chargé de la concurrence.

La décision d'aujourd'hui fait suite à une enquête minutieuse qui a démontré de manière incontestable qu'entre la fin du mois de décembre 1978 et le 31 octobre 1996 (30 novembre 1995 pour Nippon), Hoechst, Chisso, Daicel, Nippon et Ueno ont mis en oeuvre une entente par laquelle elles se sont entendues sur les prix et se sont attribué des quotas en volume.

En 1995, les cinq sociétés en question contrôlaient près de 85 % du marché des sorbates  dans l'Espace économique européen (EEE)(1). Jusqu'au transfert de ses activités dans le domaine des sorbates  à Nutrinova, en 1997, Hoechst était le plus grand producteur d'acide sorbique (le principal type de sorbates),  devant Daicel. Hoechst est basée en Allemagne; les quatre autres sociétés ont toutes leur siège au Japon.

Les sorbates  sont des agents antimicrobiens capables de retarder ou d'empêcher le développement de micro-organismes, tels que les levures, bactéries et moisissures, principalement dans les produits alimentaires et les boissons. Ils sont aussi utilisés comme stabilisateurs pour les produits pharmaceutiques et cosmétiques. On distingue trois types de  sorbates:  l'acide sorbique, utilisé
notamment dans les margarines, les mayonnaises, les boissons et les produits de boulangerie; le  sorbate de potassium, utilisé dans les produits à forte teneur en eau, et le  sorbate de calcium, qui sert à revêtir le papier d'emballage du fromage en France et en Italie.

L'enquête a commencé à l'automne 1998, lorsque des représentants de Chisso ont pris contact avec la Commission en application de la politique de clémence, qui permet aux entreprises de bénéficier de l'immunité totale, à condition d'être la première entreprise à fournir des informations sur l'entente, ou, à défaut, d'une réduction du montant des amendes.

Les éléments de preuve recueillis par la  Commission ont clairement établi l'existence d'une entente contraire à l'article 81, paragraphe 1, du traité de l'Union  européenne  et à l'article 53 de l'accord EEE.


Page 34 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Les participants à l'infraction avaient coutume de se réunir deux fois par an pour discuter des prix pour chaque pays(2) et des quotas en volume. Ces réunions se tenaient chaque fois à un endroit différent, en Europe ou au Japon. Les producteurs japonais tenaient des réunions préparatoires, le plus souvent à Tokyo, pour convenir des prix et des quotas en volume qui seraient discutés au cours des réunions communes.
Calcul des amendes

La Commission considère que l'entente constitue une infraction très grave au droit de la concurrence de l'Union européenne.  Pour calculer le montant des amendes dans les affaires portant sur des ententes, la Commission tient compte de la gravité de l'infraction, de sa durée, ainsi que de l'existence d'éventuelles circonstances aggravantes ou atténuantes. Elle tient également compte de la part détenue par l'entreprise sur le marché en cause et de sa taille globale. Conformément au règlement applicable en la matière, l'amende ne peut en aucun cas excéder 10% du chiffre d'affaires annuel total de l'entreprise.

Chisso, qui remplissait les conditions requises pour bénéficier de l'immunité totale, ne s'est pas vu infliger d'amende.

L'amende la plus élevée à été infligée à Hoechst, en raison, d'une part, de sa taille globale et de la part qu'elle détient sur le marché en cause et, d'autre part, du fait qu'elle avait déjà commis une infraction similaire dans le passé. L'amende qui lui a été infligée reflète aussi le rôle de meneur qu'elle a joué dans l'entente conjointement avec Daicel. Hoechst a néanmoins bénéficié d'une réduction de 50% du montant de l'amende pour avoir coopéré à l'enquête.

Des réductions d'importance variable ont été appliquées aux amendes infligées aux producteurs japonais en fonction de la qualité de leur coopération avec la  Commission.
Les amendes individuelles (en millions d'euros) s'établissent comme suit: Hoechst AG: 99
Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd: 16.6
Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry, Ltd: 12.3
The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co, Ltd: 10.5

(1)La Commission applique les règles de concurrence dans l'ensemble de l'EEE, territoire qui comprend les États membres de l'UE plus la Norvège, le Liechtenstein et l'Islande.

(2)Les États Unis et le Canada ont également mené des enquêtes dans le secteur des  sorbates  et infligé des sanctions à certains producteurs pour fixation des prix et d'autres restrictions de concurrence. Les sociétés concernées par les différentes procédures ne sont pas tout à fait les mêmes.

The European Commission fined four chemical companies a total of 138.4 million  euros ($161 million) for participating in a cartel that fixed the price of  sorbates,  a food additive, over 17 years
ending in 1996. Hoechst of Germany was singled out as the ringleader and  fined 99 million euros. The others were all Japanese: Chisso, Daicel Chemical Industries, Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry. Chisso was granted immunity from  fines for blowing the whistle on the cartel. ''Because of this conspiracy,  European consumers paid more for many everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other,'' the competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said. Hoechst is a unit of Aventis of France. Paul Meller (NYT)

HD     CHIMIE - AMENDE TOTALE DE 138 MILLIONS D'EUROS AU CARTEL DES SORBATES. BY     Par (MD).

La Commission européenne  a annoncé, le 1er octobre, l'imposition d'une amende totale de 138,4 millions d'euros aux sociétés Hoechst AG, Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co Ltd et Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd pour entente illégale sur le marché des sorbates  (des agents antimicrobiens utilisés dans l'alimentation) entre 1979 et 1996. Dans cette affaire, la Commission a, pour la première fois, accordé l'immunité totale à une des sociétés, Chisso, pour être passée aux aveux.

"Du fait de cette entente illégale, les consommateurs  européens  ont payé de nombreux produits de la vie courante plus cher qu'ils ne l'auraient fait si les sociétés s'étaient livré concurrence. Je suis bien décidé à faire en sorte que la participation à une entente illégale ne soit pas payante", a commenté le commissaire chargé de la concurrence Mario Monti.

TD
Les sorbates  sont des agents antimicrobiens capables de retarder ou d'empêcher le développement de micro-organismes, tels que les levures, bactéries et moisissures, principalement dans les produits alimentaires et les boissons. Ils sont aussi utilisés comme stabilisateurs pour les produits pharmaceutiques et cosmétiques. On distingue trois types de  sorbates:  l'acide sorbique, utilisé
notamment dans les margarines, les mayonnaises, les boissons et les produits de boulangerie; le  sorbate de potassium, utilisé dans les produits à forte teneur en eau, et le  sorbate de calcium, qui sert à revêtir le papier d'emballage du fromage en France et en Italie.Partage du marché.

L'enquête a commencé à l'automne 1998, lorsque des représentants de Chisso ont pris contact avec la Commission en application de la politique de clémence, qui permet à la première entreprise à fournir des informations sur l'entente aux entreprises de bénéficier de l'immunité totale ou d'une réduction de l'amende. L'enquête a démontré qu'entre la fin du mois de décembre 1978 et le 31 octobre 1996 (30 novembre 1995 pour Nippon), Hoechst, Chisso, Daicel, Nippon et Ueno ont mis en oeuvre un accord par laquelle elles se sont entendues sur les prix et se sont attribuées des quotas en volume. En 1995, les cinq sociétés contrôlaient 85% du marché des  sorbates  dans l'EEE. A l'exception de la société allemande Hoechst, tous les participants ont leur siège au Japon et se retrouvaient deux fois par an dans ce pays pour débattre des prix et de la répartition des quotas. Pour calculer le montant des amendes dans les affaires portant sur des ententes, la  Commission tient compte de la gravité et de la durée de l'infraction. Des réductions d'importance variable ont été appliquées aux amendes infligées aux producteurs japonais en fonction de la qualité de leur coopération avec la  Commission. L'ampleur de l'amende infligée à Hoechst s'explique par la taille et la part de marché de l'entreprise. Les amendes individuelles
s'établissent comme suit:-Hoechst AG: 99 millions d'euros
- Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd: 16,6 millions d'euros
- Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry, Ltd: 12,3 millions d'euros
- The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co, Ltd: 10,5 millions d'euros
Détermination.

Mario Monti a réitéré, le 1er octobre, son engagement à traquer les participants aux cartels. En référence
à la décision de la Cour du 30 septembre sur les conférences transatlantiques (lire  Europolitique n°2807,
même rubrique), il a estimé que cet arrêt n'ébranlerait pas sa cause. La lutte contre les cartels est une
priorité absolue et le fait qu'il y ait eu peu de décisions cette année ne signifie pas que la  Commission
Page 41 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
est moins déterminée qu'auparavant, a-t-il ajouté. Il a étayé ses propos en annonçant que ses services préparaient plusieurs communications des griefs pour les prochains mois.Dans ce contexte, la Commission organise les 2 et 3 octobre le cinquième atelier international sur les cartels regroupant pas moins de 160 "traqueurs de cartels" de 35 pays animés par la volonté d'intensifier leur coopération dans la lutte contre les ententes de prix. Les représentants des Etats-Unis, du Japon, de l'UE et des pays adhérents devraient chercher lors de l'atelier à synchroniser les inspections surprises et échanger les meilleures pratiques.

HD     COMPETITION - MONTI'S CARTEL CLAMPDOWN - SORBATES FIRMS FINED EURO 138 MILLION. BY      By (MD).

The European Commission said on October 1 it was fining five  sorbates  producers a total of  Euro
138.4 million for price-fixing. Hoechst, Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries, The Nippon
Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno Fine Chemicals were found to have operated a  cartel between
1979 and 1996. For the first time, the Commission granted full immunity to one of the companies, Chisso
for being the whistleblower. "Because of this conspiracy,  European consumers paid more for many
everyday products than if the companies had competed against each other", said Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti. "I am determined that participation in a  cartel should not pay." The
Commission is holding an international cartel workshop on October 2-3, aiming to increase international
co-operation in the fight against price-fixing.

TD
Sorbates are widely used chemical preservatives, which prevent the development of mould and bacteria in food and drink. They are also used as stabilisers in cosmetics. Sorbic acid is used in margarine, mayonnaise, drinks and bakery products. Potassium  sorbate is used in products with a high water content and calcium  sorbate is used in the coating of cheese wrapping paper in France and Italy.

Market-sharing.

The Commission began its probe in 1998, after employees of Chisso told it about the  cartel. The EU anti-trust authorities' investigation showed that, between 1978 and 1996, the firms agreed prices and allowed volume quotas for each other. By 1995, the five firms controlled 85% of the  sorbates  market in the EEA. Except for German-based Hoechst, all the companies are based in Japan, where the  cartel participants met twice a year to discuss prices and volume allocation. The  Commission calculated the fines according to the gravity and duration of the infringement, but took into account the level of
co-operation from the companies. Hoechst has the highest  fine because of its sheer size and market share. The amounts are:-Hoechst:  Euro 99 million
- Daicel Chemical Industries:  Euro 16.6 million
- Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry:  Euro 12.3 million
- The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry:  Euro 10.5 million
The Commissioner's crackdown.

Mario Monti again reiterated on October 1 his commitment to coming down hard on  cartel members. Referring to the September 30 TACA Court judgement (see last issue of  European Report), he said:
"This judgement will not weaken our cause. The fight against cartels is a top priority and the fact that there have been few cartel decisions this year does not mean our resolve has weakened." He furthered this by saying that his services are preparing several Statements of Objections (lists of complaints) to be ready in the next few months.On October 2-3, the  Commission is holding the world's fifth international  cartel workshop, bringing together 160 cartelbusters from 35 countries to step up co-operation in the fight on price-fixers. Representatives from the United States, Japan, EU and accession countries are likely to discuss how to synchronise surprise inspections and exchange best practice. "Cartels are increasingly global in scope", said Mr Monti. "Competition authorities must unite and co-operate to meet the
challenge."

HD       Celanese Says Likely To Have 3Q Net Loss

Edited Press Release

KRONBERG, Germany (Dow Jones)--Celanese AG (CZ) said Monday it expects to have a net loss in the third quarter due to an expense relating to the  European Commission's decision last week to  fine Hoechst AG.

TD
The European Commission announced a decision on October 1, 2003 regarding anti-trust matters in the sorbates  industry. The commission concluded Hoechst and other producers operated a  cartel between 1979 and 1996. Hoechst AG was  fined EUR99 million related to this matter.

In accordance with the demerger agreement between Hoechst AG and Celanese AG, which became effective October 1999, Celanese AG , then successor to Hoechsts  sorbates  business, was assigned the obligation related to this matter. However, Hoechst AG agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80 percent of payments for such obligations.

Celanese AG and Hoechst AG are currently examining this decision. It is possible that the ruling will be appealed.

As described in the 2002 Celanese Annual Report filed on Form 20-F, under U.S. GAAP, losses related to the matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from Hoechst and the recoveries are recorded directly to shareholders equity as a contribution of capital. Considering this accounting treatment and a previously recorded reserve of EUR25 million, Celanese expects to record in the third quarter of 2003 an expense of EUR74 million and a corresponding contribution of capital of 80% of such expense. As a result Celanese will likely report a net loss for the third quarter. The payment of this  fine, which will be made in a future period, will result in a cash outflow of approximately EUR20 million for Celanese.
The amount of the payment will depend on whether there is a successful appeal. The U.S. GAAP
accounting treatment of this matter will not affect the ability of Celanese to pay a dividend.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German chemicals company Celanese AG (CZ) said Monday that a higher-than-expected  European Union penalty for its part in a  price-fixing cartel will likely result in a third-quarter net loss.

Analysts said they would likely cut their full-year net profit forecasts as a result, but said the one-off charge won't affect their operating profit forecasts because of the way the  fine will be treated in Celanese's accounts.

TD
They also said the charge does not change their fundamental outlook on Celanese, which was formed in late 1999 from the demerger of Hoechst's chemicals businesses before Hoechst merged with
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. to form Aventis S.A. (AVE).

"It's not a surprise and it doesn't impact the evaluation of the shares," said Petra Meyer, chemicals analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Frankfurt. She has an outperform rating on the stock and a EUR32.50 price target.

"It may affect sentiment but it's not a big issue," says Felix Thierfelder at Metzler. He has a sell rating on the stock.
Nevertheless, Celanese shares fell on the news. At 1235 GMT, they were down 1.6% at EUR28.22. Last Thursday, the E.U.  fined four companies for operating a  cartel on the European sorbates
market between 1979 and 1996.  Sorbates are used to prevent micro-organisms from growing in foods
such as mayonnaise and sausages as well as beverages.

Hoechst was fined EUR99 million, Japan's Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd. (4202.TO) EUR16.6 million, Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd. EUR12.3 million and the Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. (4201.TO) EUR10.5 million.

A fifth company involved in the  cartel, Japan's Chisso Corp., which helped the  Commission gather evidence, avoided a  fine.

The Commission said the companies agreed prices and allocated volume quotas for each other, and said company officials met twice a year to fix prices and volumes.

It imposed the biggest  fine on Hoechst because it co-led the cartel with Daicel and because it had committed a similar violation in the past. However, it cut the fine by half because the German company cooperated with the investigation.
Expecting a penalty, Celanese had previously put aside EUR25 million in reserves to settle  fines
related to the  cartel.

Now, it expects to book an additional EUR74 million expense in the third quarter, but said it expects to recover 80% of all the expenses from Hoechst in the form of shareholders equity.

In the demerger agreement between Celanese and Hoechst, Hoechst - which is now an intermediate holding company that operates as an affiliate of Aventis - had agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80% of the fines. The one-off payment will result in a "cash outflow of approximately EUR20 million," Celanese said.
Analysts said the indemnity will raise Celanese's shareholder equity by EUR5 million. Company Web site:  http://www.celanese.com

HD     Food additives - Brussels imposes  EUR 138.4 M fine on sorbates cartel. WC    218 words

LP
The European Commission has fined Hoechst AG, Daicel Chemical Industries, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry a total of EUR 138.4 M for having operated an illegal cartel, fixing both prices and volumes on the  sorbates  market between 1979-1996. Chisso Corporation escaped being  fined in return for supplying information to the enquiry. The largest  fine (EUR
99 M) was imposed on Hoechst (now Celanese's subsidiary Nutrinova) because of the size of the company and its market share and because it had been involved in a similar  cartel in the past. The  fine also reflects the company's role as leader of the  cartel. However, the  fine was reduced by 50% because Hoechst cooperated with the enquiry. In 1995 these 5 companies controlled 85% of the  European           sorbates  market. Until its operations were transferred to Nutrinova in 1997, Hoechst was the largest
sorbic acid producer (ahead of Daicel).

TD
The European Commission fined Daicel EUR 16.6 M, Ueno  Fine Chemicals EUR 12.3 M and Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry EUR 10.5 M. The US and Canadian authorities have held enquiries into the sorbates  market and imposed sanctions on some producers for  price fixing  and anticompetitive practices.

FRANKFURT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - German chemicals firm Celanese AG (CZZG.DE) said on Monday
that a European Commission fine imposed on Hoechst AG, from which it was formed in 1999, would
probably drive it to a net loss for the third quarter.

Celanese said in a statement that it expected to record an additional expense of 74 million  euros ($87 million) in the third quarter as a result of the fine of 99 million euros the Commission had levied on Hoechst for operating a chemical price-fixing cartel between 1979 and 1996.

TD
The company had earlier set aside a reserve of 25 million  euros for the expense.
Hoechst has agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80 percent of the payment, it said.
A Celanese spokesman said this payment would come through Hoechst investing around 80 million
euros into Celanese's shareholder equity.
The payment of the  fine will result in a cash outflow of approximately 20 million  euros for Celanese. The European Commission said last Wednesday it had fined European and Japanese companies a
total of 138.4 million euros for operating a price-fixing cartel in sorbates,  which are used as food
preservatives. Hoechst was  fined 99 million euros.
It was possible that there would be an appeal against the ruling, Celanese said.

The company had earlier set aside a reserve of 25 million  euros for the expense.

Hoechst will pay back about 80 million  euros to Celanese by way of a contribution into the company's shareholder equity, a Celanese spokesman said.

Celanese shares weakened on the news, trading down 2.86 percent at 27.85  euros at 0810 GMT, underperforming the mid-cap MDAX index, which was down 0.46 percent.
But analysts said the news was not much of a surprise, and that the impact would not be large.

"The impact will eventually be more or less neutral, though investors see an initial negative in the third quarter loss," said Bayerische Landesbank analyst Michael Butscher.

"There's nothing very remarkable about the news - the negative reaction in the shares comes after a recent strong run," said Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz analyst Silke Stegemann.
"Celanese had already indicated the second half would be difficult."
The payment of the  fine will result in a cash outflow of approximately 20 million  euros for Celanese. The European Commission said last Wednesday it had fined European and Japanese companies a
total of 138.4 million euros for operating a price-fixing cartel in sorbates,  which are used as food
preservatives. Hoechst was  fined 99 million euros.

Telefax: +01 (972) 443 8519 Email:VNMeyer@celanese.com(NYSE:CZ) (FWB:CZZ): The European Commission announced a decision on October 1, 2003 regarding anti-trust matters in the sorbates industry. The  commission concluded that Hoechst AG and other producers operated a cartel between
1979 and 1996. Hoechst AG was  fined EUR99 million related to this matter.

In accordance with the demerger agreement between Hoechst AG and Celanese AG, which became effective October 1999, Celanese AG , then successor to Hoechst's  sorbates  business, was assigned the obligation related to this matter. However, Hoechst AG agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80 percent of payments for such obligations.

TD
Celanese AG and Hoechst AG are currently examining this decision. It is possible that the ruling will be appealed.

As described in the 2002 Celanese Annual Report filed on Form 20-F, under U.S. GAAP, losses related to the matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from Hoechst and the recoveries are recorded directly to shareholders' equity as a contribution of capital. Considering this accounting treatment and a previously recorded reserve of EUR25 million, Celanese expects to record in the third quarter of 2003 an expense of EUR74 million and a corresponding contribution of capital of 80 percent of such expense. As a result Celanese will likely report a net loss for the third quarter. The payment of this  fine, which will be made in a future period, will result in a cash outflow of approximately EUR20 million for Celanese. The amount of the payment will depend on whether there is a successful appeal. The U.S. GAAP accounting treatment of this matter will not affect the ability of Celanese to pay a dividend.

Celanese AG is a global chemicals company with leading positions in its key products and world class process technology. The Celanese portfolio consists of five main businesses: Acetyl Products, Chemical Intermediates, Acetate Products, Technical Polymers Ticona and Performance Products.

In 2002, Celanese generated sales of around EUR 4.3 billion and had 10,700 employees. The company has 24 production plants and six research centers in 10 countries mainly in North America,  Europe and Asia.

THE EUROPEAN Commission (EC) has fined five companies a total of 138 million [euro] ($160 million)
for their involvement in a sorbates  cartel, with Hoechst AG of Germany incurring the largest penalty.

An investigation by the EC found that between 1978 and 1996, Hoechst and Chisso Corp., Daicel Chemical Industries, Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry, all in Japan, fixed prices and allocated volume quotas in  sorbates  in Europe.

TD
Hoechst, which was merged with Rhone-Poulenc to form Aventis four years ago, has been fined 99 million [euro] because of its size, share of the market and its involvement in a similar cartel in plastics in the late 1980s. Its  fine was reduced by 50 percent because of its cooperation in the investigation.

Daicel was fined 17 million [euro], Ueno 12 million [euro] and Nippon 10.5 million [euro]. Chisso was exempted from any  fines because it approached the EC with the first information about the  cartel in
1998. The surbates business of Hoechst, which is 98 percent owned by Aventis, was moved into
Celanese in 1997.

Celanese, the German chemicals company, yesterday warned it was likely to report a third-quarter net loss as a result of a  cartel fine on Hoechst, the company from which Celanese was demerged in 1999.

The Commission last week imposed a Euros 138.4m ( $162m) fine on Hoechst and three Japanese companies for fixing prices and agreeing volume quotas on the European sorbates  market in
1978-1996. Hoechst's  fine, the largest, was  Euros 99m.

TD
Celanese had already put aside  Euros 25m to settle  fines related to the  cartel. It now expects to book an additional Euros 74m expense in the third quarter, but to recover 80 per cent of this from Hoechst. Bettina Wassener, Frankfurt and Mary Watkins

German industrial chemicals company Celanese AG expects a net loss for the third quarter of 2003 due to a 99 mln euro ($115.9 mln) cartel fine on Hoechst AG, related to operations prior to Celanese demerger from Hoechst in 1999.
The European Commission (EC) imposed a 138.4 mln euro ($162.1 mln) fine on Hoechst and three
Japanese companies for price fixing  and market sharing  in the European sorbates  market between
1978 and 1996. Sorbates are used as preservatives for food, preventing the emerging of mould,
bacteria or other micro organisms.

TD
Celanese has already put aside 25 mln  euro ($29.3 mln) to settle  fines related to the  cartel. It expects additional 74 mln  euro ($86.6 mln) expenses in the third quarter of 2003.
Under the demerger agreement signed in 1999, Celanese assumed obligations related to the
price-fixing practices, while Hoechst had to indemnify it for 80 pct of the  fine payments. The  fine will
result in about 20 mln  euro ($23.4 mln) net cash outflow for Celanese. The indemnity will be recorded
as a contribution to Celanese paid-in capital.

The European Commission has fined four companies a combined  euro138,4 million ($159 million) for conspiring to fix the price of sorbates  between 1979 and 1996 (CW, April 30, p. 8). They are Hoechst (euro99 million); Daicel Chemical Industries (euro16.6 million); Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry(euro12.3 million); and Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry (euro10.5 million). The fines follow an investigation by the commission that started in 1998.

TD
Hoechst incurred the biggest fine because of its size and because it played a leading role in the
price-fixing cartel, the commission says. Hoechst was the biggest  sorbates  supplier, it says. Hoechst
divested its sorbates  business as part of the 1999 spirvoff of its chemicals business to create Celanese.
The spin-off followed Hoechst's merger with Rhone-Poulenc to create Avertis. Hoechst today is a holding
company with a separate listing in Frankfurt, and is 98% owned by Avertis. Hoechst's  fine was cut by 50%
because the company cooperated with the  commission's investigation. Chisso was also a member of the
cartel but received immunity also for cooperating with the investigation, the  commission says.

The U.S. Department of Justice also  fined Celanese, Daicel, Ueno, and a number of other companies including Eastman Chemical for operating a  sorbates cartel (CW, Oct. 16, 2002, p. 9). IY

Chemicals - Monti's  cartel clampdown - sorbates  firms fined EUR 138 M - Hoechst, Chisso, Daicel
Chemical Industries, Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Ueno  Fine Chemicals.

TD
On 1 Oct 2003, the European Commission said it was fining five  sorbates  producers a total of EUR
138.4 M for price-fixing. Hoechst, Chisso Corp, Daicel Chemical Industries, the Nippon Synthetic
Chemical Industry and Ueno Fine chemicals were found to have operated a  cartel between 1979 and
1996. For the first time, the Commission granted full immunity to one of the companies, Chisso, for being
the whistleblower. Sorbates are widely used chemical preservatives which prevent the development of
mould and bacteria in food and drink. They are also used as stabilisers in cosmetics. Sorbic acid is used in
margarine, mayonnaise, drinks and bakery products. Potassium  sorbate is used in products with a high
water content and calcium  sorbate is used in the coating of cheese wrapping paper in France and Italy.
The EU anti-trust authorities' investigation showed that, between 1978 and 1996, the firms agreed prices
and allowed volume quotes for each other. By 1995, the five firms controlled 85% of the  sorbates  market
in the EEA. The  Commission calculated the  fines according to the gravity and duration of the
infringement, but took into account the level of cooperation from the companies. The amounts are:
Hoechst, EUR 99 M; Daicel Chemical Industries, EUR 16.6 M; Ueno  Fine Chemicals Industry, EUR 12.3
M; Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry, EUR 10.5 M.

Celanese has forecast a net loss for 3Q 2003 to allow for a EUR 99 M  fine imposed by the European Commission. This fine was in relation to a  sorbate producers cartel that operated in Europe at the time Celanese was part of the Hoechst group that was restructured and merged to form Aventis in 1999.

Following a fine from the European Commission related to a  sorbates  pricing cartel investigation, Celanese reports that it is anticipating a loss in 3Q 2003. The five companies investigated by the European Commission were fined a total of EUR 138 M ($160 M). The  fines have been allocated: Hoechst AG EUR 99 M. The Hoechst  sorbates  business was spun off to Celanese in 1997 and Celanese is responsible for the costs, however Hoechst has agreed to reimburse 80% of the  fine to Celanese. However, under accounting procedures Celanese has to take a charge of EUR 74 M in 3Q 2003. Celanese will pay EUR 20 M in 4Q 2003. In 2Q 2003 Celanese posted net earnings of EUR 97 M.

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling almost $160 M on four companies for  price      fixing sorbate food preservatives between 1979 and 1996. Hoechst (now part of Aventis) received the largest fine of $114 M. Daicel Chemical, Ueno  Fine Chemicals, and Nippon Synthetic Chemical also received fines. Chisso Corp escaped a fine because it was the first to supply information about the  cartel.

Because Hoechst has been fined EUR 99 M by the  European Commission as a result of its participation in a price-fixing cartel for sorbates,  a net loss is being forecast by Celanese in 3Q 2003, which will have expenses of EUR 74 M. Hoechst was formerly the parent company of Celanese. A decision on an appeal will be made by Hoechst by 19 Dec 2003. The  sorbates  business is now part of the Nutrinova operations of Celanese. Celanese will receive 80% of the pass-through fine from Hoechst. Provisions amounting to EUR 25 M have been taken by Celanese against the sorbates  investigation. In 3Q 2002, the company recorded net earnings of EUR 39 M.

* IRS Probes Patent Donation Claims

The IRS is investigating tax deduction claims made by companies that donate patents to charitable institutions, such as universities, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The IRS is concerned that companies are over-estimating the market value of patent donations by overlooking restrictions on the beneficiary's use of the patent, or the existence of competing technologies, the report says.
* Bioprocessing Firm Gets Funding

Diversified Natural Products (DNP; East Lansing, MI), a developer of bio-based succinic acid and derivatives, says it has received an undisclosed investment from TTC-RMA Venture Partners LLC (TRVP), a company owned jointly by Toyota Tshusho (Nagoya, Japan), and Roberts Mitani Aqua Partners (New York).
* DuPont, NREL Sign Biorefinery Deal

DuPont and the Department of Energy's (DOE; Washington) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL; Golden, CO) have signed a $7.7-million joint agreement for development of a biorefinery to produce chemicals and fuels from corn. The agreement is part of a larger $38-million consortium, which was awarded $19 million in matching funds from DOE last year (CW, Nov. 13, 2002, p. 27).
* Nanotech Startup Gets Cash

Nanotechnology firm Five Star Technologies (Cleveland) says it has closed a Series C investment round of $4.5-million dollars led by Morgenthaler Ventures (Menlo Park, CA). Other investors include Chevron Technology Ventures, Early Stage Partners, and Industrial Technology Ventures.
* Ticona Boosts UHMW-PE Capacity

Ticona says it will boost capacity for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) at Oberhausen, Germany by 10,000 m.t./year, to 40,000 m.t./year by second-half 2004. Ticona started up a 30,000 m.t./year UHMW-PE unit at Bishop, TX last year.
GE to Acquire U.K. Diagnostics and Drug Discovery Firm ... Castell: To head up new unit.

General Electric (GE) says it has agreed to acquire diagnostics and drug discovery firm Amersham (Little Chalfont, U.K.) for L5.7 billion ($9.5 billion). GE's L8.00/share offer, well above Amersham's L6.60/share closing price on October 9, is designed to deter counter bids, analysts say. GE says it will merge
L1.6-billion/year Amersham with GE Medical, its diagnostic imaging and health care services subsidiary, to create GE Healthcare Technologies. Amersham CEO William Castell will be head of that unit, and will
Page 68 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
become GE vice chairman and board member. GE and Amersham say they expect annualized cost savings of $300 million-$400 million after three years. Amersham's main products are diagnostic imaging agents used in medical scanning. Its other operations are in drug discovery systems and protein separation. The acquisition will allow GE to "accelerate the development of molecular imaging and personalized medicine to predict and treat disease," says chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt.
... Plastics Profits Sink, but Materials Improve

GE says operating profit at its plastics unit fell 55% in the third quarter, to $100 million, on a 2% drop in sales, to $1.3 billion. GE says the operating environment for plastics is "still very tough" but that it expects earnings to improve to $150 million in the fourth quarter. GE Plastics reported operating income of $137 million in fourth-quarter 2002. "We think we turned the corner" in plastics during the quarter, says GE CFO Keith Sherin. Raw materials continue to be "challenging," but GE expects to hold pricing, Sherin says. Volumes also improved strongly in the latter half of the third quarter, he says. GE forecasts fourth-quarter volumes of 400,000 m.t., up 14% on the third quarter, and flat with year-ago volumes. Meanwhile, GE
says earnings doubled in its specialty materials segment, to $115 million, on a 15% sales jump, to $789 million. GE's overall earnings before required accounting changes fell 2%, to $4.02 billion, on sales up 2%, to $33.4 billion.
ExxonMobil, Pequiven Resume Talks on Venezuela Cracker

Pequiven says it expects to sign a preliminary development agreement for a $2.65-billion petrochemical joint venture at Jose, Venezuela later in the fourth quarter, according to press reports. Mobil first announced the project in the mid-1990s, but it was delayed following the company's 1998 acquisition by Exxon. Pequiven says ithopes to have a formal jv agreement in place next year. Sources say that detailed discussions on reviving the project were held last year, but they broke off after political turmoil in Venezuela and related strikes at Pequiven and Petroleos de Venezuela effectively shutdown the country's petrochemical and oil sector.
Crompton to Pay $4.5 Million for Cleanup

Crompton says it will pay $4.5 million to clean up a toxic waste dump near Pittsburgh. Crompton's responsibility for the site stems from its acquisition of Witco, which operated a petroleum products facility at Petrolia,PA. Some of the money will fund a new water supply system, says the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP; Harrisburg). DEP has been supplying water to more than
900 area businesses and residents since March 2002, when it discovered that the drinking water system
is contaminated with sulfonic acid and resorcinol. The DEP says the cleanup settlement with Crompton "is
in the best interest of all state taxpayers, especially the people whose lives have been disrupted by the
contamination at the site," says DEP regional director Kelly Burch.
Aceto, Nufarm to Form U.S. Herbicide JV

Aceto says it has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to form a joint venture with Nufarm (Melbourne) to acquire and market a herbicide in the U.S. Aceto says it will disclose the product when the deal is completed at the end of November. Aceto and Nufarm both currently market the product in the U.S.; the jv will market the herbicide solely under the Nufarm trade name. Nufarm will formulate the product for the jv. Aceto says the deal is part of its strategy for expanding agchem sales by offering its distribution and regulatory capability to overseas agchem producers. Aceto chairman and CEO Eeonard Schwartz says
the company is pursuing other such partnerships to boost its agchem sales.
Cefic Adds to Criticism of Watered-Down EU Chemicals Policy

Cefic says proposals by the  European Commission to ease the burden of the planned  European Union (EU) chemicals policy still fail to address several concerns (CW, Oct. 1, p. 12). "Major changes to the current proposal are necessary to make it work," says Eggert Voscherau, Cefic president and BASF vice chairman. Cefic is calling for creation of a central agency that will have full responsibility for all aspects of decision-making and management for the policy's Reach testing program. Chemical testing should also be prioritized, starting with chemicals of the highest concern, Cefic says. Chemicals should be assessed according to exposure, instead of hazard under the present proposals, Cefic adds. Cefic's concerns echo those expressed recently by ACC and VCI (CW, Oct. 8, pp. 5, 7). The  commission is preparing the next draft of the policy, which is due for publication at the end of this month.

Europe Decides Not to Ban Paraquat

The European Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain & Animal Health has voted to include the herbicide paraquat on a list of authorized pesticide active ingredients, despite a fierce lobbying campaign by environmental groups and trade unions to ban it. The list is part of a  European Union agchem re-registration process (CW, July 23, p. 5). The committee's decision overrules bans on paraquat
Page 69 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in Austria, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, and restrictions in Germany. Paraquat producer Syngenta "welcomes this science-based conclusion, which continues to give  European farmers a very valuable and environmentally friendly tool for their crop protection needs," says Piet Smits, head of Syngenta Crop Protection in  Europe. Environmental groups say paraquat is impossible to handle safely because of its acute toxicity. The committee's decision is "irresponsible," says John Hontelez, secretary general of the European Environmental Bureau (Brussels).
Celanese to Report a Loss Following  Cartel Fine
Celanese says it is likely to report a third-quarter net loss, due to a euro99-million ($115 million)
European Commission fine related to Hoechst's role in a sorbates  price-fixing cartel (CW, Oct. 8, p.
10). Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc in 1999 to create Aventis, and spun off its chemicals business
as Celanese. Liability for the sorbates  cartel transferred to Celanese, which put aside  euro25 million to
settle fines related to the case. The commission's fine is bigger than expected, however, and Celanese
will include a euro74-million, one-off charge in its third-quarter accounts to cover the difference, the
company says. Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80% of the  fines, Celanese says. Celanese
and Hoechst say they may appeal the  fine. Hoechst is now a holding company 98%-owned by Aventis
and has a separate listing in Frankfurt.
Refining Firm Acquires BP's Special Products Business

H&R Wasag (Salzbergen, Germany) has agreed to acquire BP's  European special products business, which makes process oils, rubber additives, and waxes. The deal is expected to close in early 2004. It includes a 5,000-bbl/day specialist base-oil refinery at Neuhof, Germany, as well as plants at Maastricht, the Netherlands; and Chorley and Tipton, U.K. BP will also supply H&R Wasag with 200,000 m.t./year of products from its Coryton, U.K. refinery. Terms were not disclosed, but BP says that assets covered by the transaction have a book value of $30 million. H&R Wasag operates a 300,000-m.t./year specialist refinery at Salzbergen.
Agrolinz Changes Focus from Fertilizers to Melamine

Agrolinz, a subsidiary of OMV, says it is changing its name to Agrolinz Melamine International (AMI), reflecting a shift of focus from fertilizers to melamine. Fertilizers, which generate about 50% of the business's euro392-million/year ($456 million) sales, will shrink to 10%-20% as melamine capacity is increased, the company says. "We do not plan to exit the fertilizer business, however," says AMI board member Joachim Grill. The company will complete an 80,000-m.t./year,  euro130-million melamine plant at Piesteritz, Germany next August. That will raise AMI's total to 210,000 m.t./year. It will make a decision early next year on another 50,000 m.t.-70,000 m.t./year melamine plant that will most likely be built in the Mideast. Abu Dhabi is a likely location for the  euro100-million project given OMV's near-20% stake in International Petroleum Investment Co. (Abu Dhabi), sources say.
* Tan to Succeed Willems at Shell
Tan: Moving up at Shell Chemicals.

Shell Chemicals has appointed Tan Ek Kia executive v.p./procurement and business units, effective October 17. Tan will be based in Singapore. He succeeds Rein Willems, who will become chairman of Shell Nederland. Tan is currently chairman of Shell North East Asia, based in Beijing.
* Equity Firms Eye Dynamit Nobel

Private equity capital companies Advent International, Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Permira, and Texas Pacific Group are interested in acquiring Dynamit Nobel from Mg Technologies, according to recent German press reports. Mg put Dynamit up for sale earlier this month (CW, Oct. 8, p. 6).
* Finnish Peroxides Adds Capacity

Solvay subsidiary Finnish Peroxides (Voikkaa) says it will expand its 50,000-m.t./year hydrogen peroxide plant at Kuusankoski, Finland by an unspecified amount. Completion is scheduled for 2005. The hike will enable the company to keep pace with demand in Finland, which is expected to increase by 15% within two years, says managing director Eero Seuna.
* TPI Aims to Raise Margins

Thai Petrochemical Industry (TPI) says it has hired CMAI Asia (Singapore) to study ways of improving TPI's petrochemical sales and marketing operations. The study forms part of a plan to increase TPI's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margin from 10%-12%, to 15%, TPI says.

Meanwhile, the company says it expects to finalize a revised debt restructuring by year-end (CW, Sept.

plan has been implemented.
* Air Liquide, Linde Eye Parts of Messer
Air Liquide and Linde each say they are interested in acquiring separate parts of Messer Griesheim when
Messer's private equity capital owners decide to sell. Linde, which would likely not be able to buy the
whole of Messer for antitrust reasons, says it is interested in Messer's operations in North America. Allianz
Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, which each own 33.3% of Messer, declined to
comment.

Celanese says it will probably post a 3Q net loss because of a EUR 99 M  European Commission fine relating to Hoechst's role in a  sorbates price fixing cartel. Liability transferred to Celanese when Hoechst's chemicals business was spun-off to it. Celanese had provisioned EUR 25 M to settle  fines in the case. The  fine was larger than anticipated and Celanese will include a EUR 74 M on-off charge in 3Q to make up the shortfall. Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80% of the  fines. Hoechst and Celanese may appeal.

New rules for licensing

The Commission has launched a final round of consultations with industry and consumer organisations over its new block exemption for technology transfer agreements, by publishing a draft of the planned regulation and accompanying guidelines (BE Sep 4th 2002).

TD
The current regulation, dating from 1996, was the last of the old-style, formalistic block exemptions, setting out detailed “white” (permitted) and “black” (prohibited) clauses that have a straitjacket effect, as well as “grey” clauses that had to be notified to the  Commission (a procedure that will no longer exist under the future decentralised antitrust enforcement system). The new one, by contrast, follows the model of the more recent exemptions for vertical restraints in distributor contracts (1999) and horizontal co-operation between competitors (2000). It thus provides a less rigid framework, permitting a wider variety of agreements to be brought within it. It also focuses more on the economic effect of contracts rather than
the details of specific clauses, although there is still a small number of prohibited “hardcore” restrictions, such as interference with a licensee’s pricing freedom or carving up markets between competitors.

The new rules will cover all types of two-party licensing agreements for the production or provision of goods and services. Where the 1996 exemption applies only to patent and know-how licensing, the new one also covers industrial designs, utility models and software copyrights, as well as trademarks and copyrights that are directly related to the exploitation of licensed technology. But it does not extend to copyright licensing in general, nor to multi-party agreements such as technology pools; the  Commission has no power to legislate in these areas, although the guidelines provide guidance as to its future enforcement policy.

The regulation distinguishes between licensing between competitors (actual or potential) and between non-competing firms, which generally pose less of a threat to competition. The market share thresholds above which the block exemption does not apply are 30% for the former and 20% for the latter, and the blacklist of hardcore restraints differs for each. Above these market share levels there is no presumption that agreements are anti-competitive, but companies and their legal advisers must assess their own contracts with the help of the guidelines.

The presence of hardcore restrictions excludes the whole agreement from the block exemption. Certain other clauses, such as an obligation for the licensee to grant back patents for improvements exclusively to the licensor, are not permitted in themselves, but do not invalidate the rest of the agreement.

The Commission (or a national competition authority) may withdraw the benefit of the exemption if it finds that a given licensing deal reduces incentives to innovate or hinders access by third parties to the relevant market, or that parallel networks of agreements covering more than 50% of the market have a similar effect.

Interested parties are invited to submit comments on the proposals by November 26th. After a final review, the new regulation will come into force on May 1st 2004.

Commission overruled on cartel cases

This time last year, the  Commission’s antitrust directorate suffered a string of embarrassing court defeats that led to a shake-up of its merger control division. This year it is taking another drubbing from the judges, but the focus is now on  cartel rulings.

On September 30th the EU’s second highest tribunal, the Court of First Instance (CFI), annulled  fines totalling €273m–a record at the time–which the  Commission had imposed in 1998 on the 15 members of TACA, a transatlantic container shipping conference, for abuse of a collective dominant position. The court based its judgment partly on “lack of evidence and infringement of the rights of the defence” (by not giving the firms a chance to refute its interpretation of the documents supporting its case), and partly on the fact that the TACA agreement had been notified to the  Commission and should therefore have been immune from potential  fines. The Commission said it was “disappointed” by the ruling but drew comfort from the fact that the judges had upheld its substantive finding that TACA had infringed the competition rules and could not qualify for an exemption. For  European exporters to the US, the good news is that the court confirmed that restrictions on  cartel members’ service contracts with shippers are illegal.

Two days later it was the turn of the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) to strike down  cartel fines set by the Commission. The case concerned penalties of €104m imposed in 1994 on 14 steelmakers for participating in a cartel to fix prices for steel beams used in construction. On appeal, the CFI in 1999 had reduced the individual fines by up to a third, but eight of the defendants appealed further to the ECJ. In its ruling, the latter upheld the lower court’s judgments in six of the cases, but annulled the €10m  fine on Luxembourg’s Arbed on procedural grounds, saying the  Commission had violated the firm’s rights of defence by addressing its statement of objections to a trading subsidiary but imposing the fine on the parent company. Similarly, the court held that the Commission had erred in imposing a €7m fine on Siderurgica Aristrain Madrid because it had calculated the fine in part on the turnover of a company
owned by members of the same family, without proving the economic and legal links between the two.

On the other hand, the courts have backed the Commission’s decisions on two other cases. On the same day as the TACA ruling, the CFI upheld a €20m fine imposed on Michelin for abusing its dominant
position on the French market for replacement tyres for trucks and buses by offering quantity rebates and discounts to its dealers. The court also held that the  Commission had acted correctly in referring the merger of cable TV operators Sogecable and Via Digital for examination by the Spanish authorities.

Whether the latest setbacks will lead to further reforms of the  Commission’s antitrust procedures remains to be seen. What is clear is that a higher standard of proof and respect for the rights of defendants is now required than the EU trustbusters were accustomed to meet in the past.

Meanwhile, the  Commission continues its anti-cartel crusade with unabated zeal. On October 2nd it slapped fines totalling €138m on Germany’s Hoechst (now part of Aventis) and four Japanese companies for rigging the  European market for sorbates,  a widely used food preservative. A five-year investigation, triggered when a fifth Japanese cartel member came forward with information in order to gain immunity under the Commission’s leniency policy, concluded that between 1979 and 1996 the participants had met regularly to agree on prices and volume allocations for each country. Because of its size and market
share, the fact that it was a co-leader of the  cartel and had committed a similar offence in the past, Hoechst drew the bulk of the  fine, €99m, but even this reflected a 50% reduction for co-operating with the inquiry.

Commenting on the case, which is regarded as a very serious violation of the competition rules, commissioner Mario Monti warned that “the only way for companies to avoid high  fines is to come clean and stop participating in cartels whose only purpose is to extort from unknowing consumers, be they intermediate or final, illicit profits”.

HD          NEWS SNAP: Celanese Cuts 03 Profit Goal Despite Good 3Q BY          By Angela Cullen

LP
FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Echoing its rivals' bleak expectations for 2003, German chemical company Celanese AG (CZ) cut its full-year profit target Thursday despite beating third-quarter sales and earnings expectations.

Celanese said it's no longer confident it can grow operating profit this year and now expects a shortfall. It's blaming uneven demand throughout its businesses, continued high raw material and energy costs and sustained negative currency effects. Also, the company said visibility for early 2004 is limited despite some improving economic signs.

TD
At 0950 GMT, Celanese shares were up 0.1% to EUR28.53.

The company swung to a third-quarter loss of EUR31 million from a EUR39 million profit in the same period last year. On average, analysts had expected a EUR51 million loss, though forecasts ranged widely. The compan posted an operating loss of EUR60 million in the third quarter, down from a EUR69 million operating profit in the third quarter of 2002.

These losses came despite a 3% rise in third-quarter sales to EUR1.07 billion, above expectations. Celanese has increased volumes and prices with some of its products.

The losses were partly due to special charges of EUR72 million linked to a recent European Union Commission decision to fine Hoechst AG in an antitrust investigation into price-fixing in the sorbates  industry.

Celanese, which was formed in 1999 by the demerger of Hoechst's industrial chemicals operations prior to Hoechst's merger with Rhone-Poulenc S.A. to form Aventis S.A. (AVE), had agreed to assume all fines linked to the case, while Hoechst agreed to indemnify Celanese for 80% of the costs.
Celanese had warned of the charges earlier in October.

About EUR33 million of expenses for stock appreciation rights also contributed to the third-quarter loss, it said.

Although the bottom line was hit by exceptional items, the company was able to increase sales volumes in most of its businesses and raise prices for its core acetyls and chemical intermediate products, which pushed third-quarter sales higher and above expectations.
"The outlook is slightly disappointing," said Felix Tierfelder, analyst at Metzler Bank in Frankfurt. WestLB analyst Harald Gruber said the reduced outlook was foreseeable "if you do the math."
He was pleased with the company's good organic growth and the strong acetyls volumes, but said oil and gas prices remain a risk.

In the face of margin pressure from high raw material and energy costs, Celanese is making a major drive to push down costs and improve its financials.

Page 79 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
By the end of September, it had shrunk its net debt to EUR446 million, 10% lower compared to the end of December last year. That was mostly due to an unexpected windfall in the second quarter linked to insurance recoveries stretching back to 1998.

It also increased its trade working capital by 13% to EUR697 million during the first nine months of the year.

"In the present environment, Celanese will continue to focus on productivity and financial soundness as leading priorities," it said.

HD        How blowing the whistle  on cartels could land you in jail. WC       511 words

Legal Voice is a new column devoted to EU judicial issues. Business editor Peter Chapman, together with leading experts, focuses on a key topic of the Union's legal maze. Johan Ysewyn, a partner with Linklaters, begins with an analysis of how a key part of the campaign to update the Union's 30-year-old competition rules could backfire

CARTEL enforcement from the bottom up is the new vogue. Whistleblowing is all the rage, and the
European Commission is all for it.

TD
During 2002, the  Commission adopted a new leniency policy which, like its US cousin, offers full immunity to the first company to come clean. And it is a strategy that is working. The uncovering, in the sorbates  [food preservers] sector, of the most recent "scourge of the economy", in the words of Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, resulted from  cartel member Chisso, deciding that honesty was the best policy and going to the  Commission with its hands up. The result: full leniency for Chisso and fines of Ä138.4 million for the other companies involved. This adds to the total of more than Ä3 billion in fines already imposed for cartel offences since the beginning of 2001, over half of which were revealed by whistleblowers.

The message is that if you have information, Monti would like to hear from you - that way the bad guys get caught and the  Commission gets to bump up its  fine statistics. In fact, there is even a special number to call if it all gets too hot.

But watch out, because admitting to  cartel activity could land you in jail. Just last week, the managing director of a Belgian company was charged in the US courts with conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids. Several EU jurisdictions, including the UK, now have criminal sanctions. While the US leniency policy provides criminal immunity for officers of whistleblowing companies, there is no such EU-wide get-out.

The European Union has no criminal competence and immunity at EU level does not remove the possibility of national criminal sanctions - a gaping flaw in the present  European scheme.

In addition, immunity does not prevent consumers claiming damages - and here the Commission sees opportunities. It is looking for ways to encourage consumers to claim damages against cartel members, in what is now uninspiringly called `Modernization Phase II'. So what would that mean? US-style treble damages? More likely, perhaps, would be to promote the possibility for consumers to band together in class actions, which, US experience shows, increases the success rate of damage claims.

Although the introduction of class actions is actually an issue for the member states, it may be the next step in making the position of cartelists ever more precarious, ever thinner on trust. The greater the likelihood of high  fines coupled with huge third-party damages, the  finer the balance in deciding whether to blow the whistle.

In the meantime, the  Commission is banking on whistleblowers coming forward - and is banking the results.
