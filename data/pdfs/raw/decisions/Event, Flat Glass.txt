BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - European competition regulators  fined four big makers of  flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors nearly 500 million euros on Wednesday for illegally coordinating price rises and business conditions.

TD
The European Commission imposed fines totalling 486.9 million euros ($717.2 million) on privately held U.S. firm Guardian; Pilkington Plc, the UK unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass ; French producer Saint-Gobain ; and Belgian-based Glaverbel SA, which was recently renamed AGC  Flat Glass Europe and is a unit of Japan's Asahi  Glass .

Although the  cartel lasted little more than a year, the  fine was the Commission's fifth-largest ever by sector. It amounted to nearly half the record 992 million euros imposed on an elevator  cartel lasting nearly 20 years.

It brought the Commission's  cartel fines this year to a record 3 billion euros. The size was due to new, stiffer guidelines covering such penalties.
"This will be the new policy," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said of the higher  fines. "So let everyone be warned by this type of level -- if you don't want to take the risk, just stop your
cartel," she told a news conference.

In an unusual move, the Commission discovered the  cartel without the help of any whistleblowing among the participants. National competition authorities alerted Brussels, acting on what they said was market information.

"They (the companies) thought that they would not be found out. They thought that the increased prices that they agreed were worth the risk and they were wrong," Kroes said.

Guardian was fined 148 million euros, Pilkington 140 million euros, Saint-Gobain 133.9 million euros and Glaverbel 65 million euros. The Commission said Glaverbel had a lower  fine because it cooperated with the EU executive.

Nippon Sheet  Glass said in a statement it has already booked reserves for EU  fines and the company has no plan to revise its earnings outlook. Asahi  Glass said it would announce any impact of the  fines on its earnings at a later date.

The Commission said the four companies managed to raise or stabilise prices between early 2004 and early 2005 through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts.
It carried out surprise raids on the premises of Asahi's and Guardian's European subsidiaries in
February and March 2005.

The Commission is still investigating a suspected auto  glass cartel. Kroes declined to say when it would finish that case. (Editing by Dale Hudson and David Holmes)

HD      EU fines flat glass manufacturers E486m

The European Commission said it has imposed a total E486.9 million  fine on flat glass manufacturers Nippon Sheet Glass Co's UK unit Pilkington, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, Asahi Glass Co and US company Guardian for coordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for  flat glass deliveries in the European Economic Area between early 2004 and early 2005.

The EU executive imposed a E148.0 million  fine on Guardian, 140.0 million on Pilkington, 133.9 million on Saint-Gobain and 65.0 million on Asahi.

TD
The commission carried out surprise inspections on the companies in February and March 2005, promoted by information provided by national competition authorities.

During the inspections, Asahi and its Belgian subsidiary Glaverbel applied for leniency after they cooperated with the commission and provided additional evidence. The EU executive said the companies organised several rounds of price increases, fixed minimum prices and other commercial conditions in an endeavour to raise or otherwise stabilise prices. They also monitored the implementation of the price increase agreements. The evidence uncovered describes in detail several meetings in restaurants and hotels in different European countries during which Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain discussed and agreed the level and timing of price increases, target prices, minimum prices and/or exchanged sensitive commercial information. The commission said a separate investigation into a suspected cartel among car glass manufacturers continues. Saint-Gobain said it has "taken note" of the commission's decision. "The first decision of the commission does not lead us to fundamentally change our approach to this issue," a spokeswoman said, although she added that the company needs time to analyse it fully. Saint-Gobain said in July it had made a 650 mln eur provision for the two investigations. The spokeswoman said any  fine for the commission's second investigation into car  glass manufacturers "could be substantially greater" because  fines are calculated by taking into account the duration of the price fixing  and the total sales involved. The second investigation involves more sales and covers a
longer time frame, she said. The company expects a decision around the end of the first quarter 2008, the spokeswoman added. Copyright: Thomson Financial

HD         EU Fines Flat Glass Producers EUR486.9 Mln For Price Fixing

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined flat glass producers Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA (12500.FR), Pilkington PLC, Asahi Glass (5201.TO) and Guardian Industries EUR486.9 million for  fixing  prices in Europe.

The highest  fine of EUR148 million was handed to U.S.-based Guardian. U.K.-based Pilkington PLC, which is owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass Co. (5202.TO), was  fined EUR140 million, while France's Saint-Gobain will pay EUR133.9 million of the  fine. Japanese firm Asahi's  fine was considerably lower at EUR65 million, as the company had applied for leniency and had fully cooperated with the regulator.

TD
These are the second  fines handed out under the Commission's new guidelines for fining cartels, which aim to better understand the economic harm done by the  cartel as well as the share of each company involved. Under the new guidelines, the commission will also hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat offenders. The  fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales.

The four companies were caught coordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of flat glass in Europe through a series of meetings in restaurants and hotels between 2004 and 2005.

Flat glass is used for windows,  glass doors and mirrors, and the  cartel was centered on flat glass used in the construction sector, where the main customers are processors, which transform the glass into finished products, such as double-glazing windows, fire-resistant  glass and mirrors.

In 2004 the four companies' sales in Europe totaled EUR1.7 billion. Their main customers are in the construction sector.
Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain, have a combined share of at least 80% of the  flat glass
market in Europe.

The cartel was discovered on the commission's own initiative, triggered by market information from several member states' competition authorities.

"This case demonstrates clearly the benefits of enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the National Competition Authorities," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.
The companies' European branches were raided in February and March 2005, and the European
Association of  Flat Glass Producers was also visited, the commission said.

(Updates with comments from European Commissioner Neelie Kroes.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined flat glass producers Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA (12500.FR), Pilkington PLC, Asahi Glass (5201.TO) and Guardian Industries EUR486.9 million for  fixing  prices in Europe.

The highest  fine of EUR148 million was handed to U.S.-based Guardian. U.K.-based Pilkington PLC, which is owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass Co. (5202.TO), was  fined EUR140 million, while France's Saint-Gobain will pay EUR133.9 million of the  fine.
After "substantial cooperation" under the leniency notice Japanese firm Asahi is paying a reduced  fine
of EUR65 million, European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

These are the second  fines handed out under the commission's new guidelines for fining cartels, which aim to better understand the economic harm done by the  cartel as well as the share of each company involved. Under the new guidelines, the commission will also hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat offenders. The  fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales, and up to 30% of the specific product market in question.

Kroes said the commission chose not to apply "aggravating sanctions to Saint-Gobain for being a repeat offender," because the previous infringement was a long time ago.

However, she said the companies knew what they were doing and thought that colluding on prices was worth the risk. "But it was not," she added.

The four companies were caught coordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of flat glass in Europe through a series of meetings in restaurants and hotels between 2004 and 2005.

Flat glass is used for windows,  glass doors and mirrors, and the  cartel was centered on flat glass used in the construction sector, where the main customers are processors, which transform the glass into finished products, such as double-glazing windows, fire-resistant  glass and mirrors.

The companies' European branches were raided in February and March 2005, and the European
Association of  Flat Glass Producers was also visited, the commission said.

This was the commission's seventh  cartel decision so far in 2007, bringing the total  fines garnered by the regulator to over EUR3 billion for the year.

"We are extremely shocked by the decision," said a Guardian spokesman. The company would take some time to study the decision, and possibly appeal the decision at a later date, he said. "It really is a mystery, how they calculated the  fines," he added.

Asahi noted in would now "examine the decision and determine accordingly their future course of action."
Saint-Gobain and Pilkington could not be reached for comment.

Flat glass is used for windows,  glass doors and mirrors, and the  cartel was centered on flat glass used in the construction sector, where the main customers are processors, which transform the glass into finished products, such as double-glazing windows, fire-resistant  glass and mirrors.

In 2004 the sector sales in Europe totaled EUR1.7 billion, of which Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain, have a combined share of at least 80%. Their main customers are in the construction sector.

The cartel was discovered on the commission's own initiative, triggered by market information from several member states' competition authorities.

The companies' European branches were raided in February and March 2005, and the European
Association of  Flat Glass Producers was also visited, the commission said.

This was the commission's seventh  cartel decision so far in 2007, bringing the total  fines garnered by the regulator to over EUR3 billion for the year.

fines totaling 486.9 million euros for fixing  prices of flat glass used in the construction sector.

The European Union (EU)'s antitrust watchdog said U.S. company Guardian, British-based Pilkington, France's Saint-Gobain and Japan's Asahi coordinated price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of  flat glass, which violated EU competition rules against illegal  cartel.

The European Union (EU)'s antitrust watchdog said the U.S. company Guardian, British-based Pilkington, France's Saint-Gobain and Japan's Asahi coordinated price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of  flat glass, which violated EU competition rules against illegal cartels.

"The commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market," the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

The commission said it began investigations on its own initiative on the basis of market information provided by member states. Surprise inspections were carried out in February and March 2005 at the premises of the four companies.

Investigations revealed that the four companies, with a combined share of at least 80 percent of the European flat-glass market, managed to raise or otherwise stabilize prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts between early 2004 and early 2005.

The cartel dealt in flat glass for use in the construction sector. It can be transformed into finished products, such as double-glazing windows, fire-resistant  glass and mirrors, all of which are commonly used in large buildings as well as in private houses and apartments.

On top of the hefty  fines, the commission said any person or firm affected by the four companies' behavior may also seek damages through the courts of the EU member states.

BRUSSELS, Nov 28, 2007 (AFP) -

EU antitrust regulators  fined glass makers Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain 487 million euros (718 million dollars) on Wednesday for running an illegal price  fixing cartel.

TD
The European Commission accused the companies of coordinating price hikes and taking other actions to control prices for flat glass through illegal meetings from early 2004 to early 2005.

The charges covered the European market for  flat glass used in doors, windows and mirrors, in which the four companies hold a combined 80 percent market share, according to the European Union's executive arm.

"The Commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Guardian, a US company, got the biggest  fine of 148 million euros for its role while Britain's Pilkington was fined 140 million euros and French group Saint-Gobain was ordered to pay 133.9 million euros.

Japanese group Asahi, which cooperated with the Commission and provided additional evidence in the case, received a much lower  fine of 65 million euros.

The case goes back to February and March 2005 when surprise inspections were carried out at the companies.

The four can appeal against the  fines at the European Court of Justice while people who consider they were affected by the  cartel can seek damages.

The European Commission has made cracking down on cartels a priority in its antitrust policy and has chalked up well over a billion euros in  fines against companies it has found guilty so far this year.

BRUSSELS, Nov 28, 2007 (AFP) -

EU antitrust regulators  fined glass makers Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain 487 million euros (718 million dollars) on Wednesday for running an illegal price  fixing cartel.

TD
The European Commission accused the companies of conspiring to coordinate price hikes and taking other actions to control prices for  flat glass used in construction through illegal meetings from early 2004 to early 2005.

The four companies hold a combined 80 percent share of the European flat glass market, which was worth 1.7 billion euros in 2004, according to the European Commission.
"The companies will have done very well out of this  cartel until today," EU Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes told reporters in Brussels.

"It is right that the punishment in this case is severe in order to achieve a sufficient deterrent effect and it is a great pity that the Commission's many previous  cartel decisions did not deter the companies from forming the  cartel," she added.

Guardian, a US company, got the biggest  fine of 148 million euros for its role while Britain's Pilkington was fined 140 million euros and French group Saint-Gobain was ordered to pay 133.9 million euros.

Japanese group Asahi, which cooperated with the Commission and provided additional evidence in the case, received a much lower  fine of 65 million euros.

The case goes back to February and March 2005 when surprise inspections were carried out at the companies' premises.

The four can appeal against the  fines at the European Court of Justice while people who consider they were affected by the  cartel can seek damages.

Saint-Gobain and Pilkington are also targetted in a separate investigation by EU regulators on suspicion that they participated in a car  glass cartel.
A spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain said the company "took note" of the decision and that it had set aside
650 million euros for the fine and any possible penalty in the car  glass case, for which it expected a
"substantially higher fine."

Kroes has made a "no-tolerance" crackdown on cartels a priority during her tenure as Europe's top regulator and has lodged ever-rising record  fines against the illegal clubs.

The construction  glass cartel was the seventh such grouping to be  fined so far, bringing total penalties this year to over three billion euros, officials said.

In February the Dutch commissioner slapped the biggest  fine ever in a EU cartel case by ordering leading lift makers to pay a combined 992 million euros.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators fined four companies a total of €487 million
(US$724 million) on Wednesday for  fixing  the price of flat glass used in the making of windows,
fire-resistant  glass and mirrors.
Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner, said France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA,
British-based Pilkington Group Ltd., Japan's Asahi  Glass Co. and U.S.-based Guardian Industries Corp.
were found guilty of colluding to fix prices and other commercial conditions in the European market.

TD
She said the EU "will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing
prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."

EU officials said their investigation, which included surprise raids at the four companies' European subsidiaries, found that they agreed to coordinate "several rounds of price increases" during hotel and restaurant meetings in several European countries between 2004 and 2005.
U.S.-based Guardian received the highest  fine, of €148 million (US$220 million), followed by Pilkington at
€140 million (US$208 million). Saint-Gobain followed with €133.9 million (US$199.2 million), while Asahi's
European subsidiary, then known as Glaverbel, received a €65 million (US$96.7 million)  fine.

Asahi's  fine was lower because it cooperated and "was of great help" to EU authorities in handing over information over the  cartel, Kroes said.

"The important thing is that the  fine as a whole is sufficiently deterrent so that no other companies will be tempted to infringe the rules again in the future and I believe we have achieved that aim in this case," she said.

Peter Walters, group vice president for Guardian Industries, said Wednesday morning that the company was "extremely shocked" by the regulators' decision, which it had learned about through an EU press release.
"We don't believe the facts justify the outcome as it pertains to Guardian," he said. Walters said the company will review the findings, and it may appeal.
Pilkington, which was bought last year by Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass Co. Ltd., acknowledged the  fine, adding that it was also under a separate EU investigation involving possible price  fixing  in Europe's automotive  glass sector.

Saint Gobain spokeswoman Sophie Chevallon said the company "took note" of the decision. "This first decision of the EU is not leading us to fundamentally change our project profile," she said.

She said the company was expecting an even bigger  fine from a decision later this year or early next year about car windows. The company is setting aside a total of €650 million (US$965 million) to cover both pricing-related fines, she said.

Page 21 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Asahi and its European subsidiary ACG  Flat Glass Europe, said they were examining the  cartel decision and had not yet decided on whether it would appeal the  fine.

Wednesday's  cartel fine was the second handed out under new EU  cartel fine rules, which aim to hand out tougher penalties against companies that try to obstruct fair competition. The  fines are capped at 10 percent of annual global sales.

Kroes said the case was brought to light through close cooperation between EU antitrust regulators and national competition authorities, and that the  European Commission started its probe into the  cartel based on information provided by national authorities.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Guardian Industries Corp. of the United States and three other companies were fined about $724 million on Wednesday by European regulators who said they fixed the price in Europe of flat glass used to make windows, fire-resistant  glass and mirrors.

Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner, said its investigation showed Guardian, which is based in Auburn Hills, Mich.; France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, British-based Pilkington Group Ltd. and Japan's Asahi  Glass Co. colluded to fix prices and other commercial conditions in the European market.

TD
Kroes said the EU "will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing
prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."
Guardian said it was shocked by the decision and was reviewing whether to appeal.

EU officials said their investigation, which included surprise raids at the four companies' European subsidiaries, found that they agreed to coordinate "several rounds of price increases" during hotel and restaurant meetings in several European countries between 2004 and 2005.

Guardian received the highest  fine, of 148 million euros ($220 million), followed by Pilkington at 140 million euros ($208 million). Saint-Gobain was  fined 133.9 million euros ($199.2 million), while Asahi's European subsidiary, then known as Glaverbel, received a  fine of 65 million euros ($96.7 million).

Asahi's  fine was lower because it cooperated and "was of great help" to EU authorities in handing over information over the  cartel, Kroes said.

"The important thing is that the  fine as a whole is sufficiently deterrent so that no other companies will be tempted to infringe the rules again in the future and I believe we have achieved that aim in this case," she said.

Peter Walters, group vice president for Guardian Industries, said Wednesday morning that the company was "extremely shocked" by the regulators' decision, which it had learned about through an EU press release.
"We don't believe the facts justify the outcome as it pertains to Guardian," he said. Walters said the company will review the findings, and it may appeal.
Pilkington, which was bought last year by Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass Co. Ltd., acknowledged the  fine, adding that it was also under a separate EU investigation involving possible price  fixing  in Europe's automotive  glass sector.

Saint Gobain spokeswoman Sophie Chevallon said the company "took note" of the decision. "This first decision of the EU is not leading us to fundamentally change our project profile," she said.

She said the company was expecting an even bigger  fine from a decision later this year or early next year about car windows. The company is setting aside a total of 650 million euros ($965 million) to cover both pricing-related fines, she said.

Asahi and its European subsidiary ACG  Flat Glass Europe, said they were examining the  cartel decision and had not yet decided on whether it would appeal the  fine.

Wednesday's  cartel fine was the second handed out under new EU  cartel fine rules, which aim to hand out tougher penalties against companies that try to obstruct fair competition. The  fines are capped at 10 percent of annual global sales.

Kroes said the case was brought to light through close cooperation between EU antitrust regulators and national competition authorities, and that the  European Commission started its probe into the  cartel based on information provided by national authorities.

HD         EC Fines French Saint-Gobain with 133.9 Mln Euro for Price Fixing

The European Commission (EC) has imposed a fine of 133.9 mln euro ($195.7 mln) on French glassmaker Saint-Gobain for  cartel participation between early 2004 and early 2005.

The other participants in the  cartel were U.S. Guardian,  fined with 148 mln euro ($216.4 mln), UK Pilkington with 140 mln euro ($204.7 mln) and Japanese Asahi Glass Co with 65 mln euro ($95 mln). Thus, the total amount of the  fines imposed by the EC to the flat glass producers reached 486.9 mln euro ($711.9 mln).

TD
The European Commissioner for Competition Policy, Neelie Kroes, commented that the EC would not tolerate a situation in which consumers and companies are affected negatively and deprived of the common market advantages due to enterprises which coordinate their price rises.

Kroes added that EC discovered the  cartel with the help of the competition authorities of the member states and launched an investigation on its own initiative.
According to Kroes, the current affair shows the advantages of the enhanced cooperation between the
EC and the national competition authorities.

HD         FT.com site : EU fines glass cartel 490m. BY         Nikki Tait in Brussels

Leading glassmakers were on Wednesday  fined almost 500m ($739m) for rigging prices in the
European market for  flat glass, used mainly by the construction industry.
The overall penalty of 489.9m is the fifth-highest on record imposed by the  European Commission.

TD
It is likely to drive home to companies the costly consequences, under a new fining regime, of engaging in anti-competitive activity in large markets or for long periods.
Guardian Industries, a privately owned US group, faces the biggest single penalty of 148m, followed by
Britain's Pilkington, which receives a 140m  fine.
France's Saint-Gobain is  fined 133.9m, while Japan's Asahi gets a 65m penalty.
Asahi's  fine was reduced because of its co-operation under the Commission's leniency arrangements. On Wednesday, the Commission said the companies had either raised or stabilised prices in the
European flat glass market through a series of meetings and illicit contracts between early 2004 and
early 2005.
"The companies profited from selling  flat glass at artificially inflated prices,"said Neelie Kroes, the EU
competition commissioner.
"The direct victims were the buyers of  flat glass - companies who made products such as
double-glazing and safety  glass. But the final victims were European consumers who had to pay the
price for the  glass used in buildings, private homes and apartments," she said.

The fine is only the second to be imposed under the new  fines guidelines, which are designed to reflect better the economic impact of anti-competitive behaviour.

Last week,  fines were imposed under the new guidelines in a much smaller case involving the market for professional videotape.

Under the new regime,  fines are linked directly to the turnover which the companies derived from the manipulated market, and the length of time the  cartel lasted.

Lawyers said that the size of the latest penalty was a clear warning to companies - especially if they were operating in large markets - given that the  cartel in this case had lasted for barely a year.

Ms Kroes declined to elaborate on exactly how the  fines had been calculated, but she said that the "important thing is that the  fine as a whole is sufficiently deterrent, so that none of these companies will be tempted to infringe the rules again".
"I believe we achieved that aim in this case," she said.
Ms Kroes did confirm, that Saint-Gobain, which has faced antitrust action before, had not been hit by a
"repeat offender" penalty.


Page 31 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The latest  fine means that the Commission has so far raised more than 3bn in antitrust penalties from companies this year.

It also announced new guidelines on Wednesday for so-called "vertical" or conglomerate mergers - between, for example, a manufacturer and a supplier.

Brussels, Nov. 28 (Jiji Press)--The European Commission said Wednesday it has  fined units of Japan's Asahi Glass Co. and Nippon Sheet Glass Co. and two others a total of 486.9 million euros for fixing  flat glass prices in the European market.

The executive organ of the European Union accused the four firms of conspiring to increase the prices of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors by holding several rounds of talks about the size and the timing of price increases between 1994 and 1995.

European Commissioner for Competition Policy Neelie Kroes said the commission "will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing  prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."

The Asahi  Glass group cooperated with the  European Commission's investigation under its leniency program, the commission said.

In 2004, the four firms had combined  flat glass sales of 1.7 billion euros in Europe, giving them a total market share of over 80 pct.

JAPAN RETAIL SALES UP 0.8 PCT IN OCT--Retail sales in Japan in October grew 0.8 pct from a year before to 11,005 billion yen, rising for the third month in a row, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.

The gain reflected brisk sales of pharmaceutical and cosmetics products and replacement demand for passenger cars. Based on the results, the ministry revised up its assessment of Japan's retail sales, saying that the sales are showing signs of picking up. Last month, the ministry said the sales were leveling off, the view first adopted in January this year.

NINTENDO, NTT TO HELP WII USERS CONNECT TO INTERNET-- Nintendo Co. and two regional units of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. said they will launch a service on Thursday to help users of Nintendo's Wii game console connect their machines to the Internet.
Nintendo, NTT East Corp. and NTT West Corp. will jointly operate call centers to accept applications
for Internet connection using NTT's fiber-optic network and send staff to Wii users' homes to help them

The executive organ of the European Union accused the four firms of conspiring to increase the prices of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors by holding several rounds of talks about the size and the timing of price increases between 1994 and 1995. European Commissioner for Competition Policy Neelie Kroes said the commission "will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by fixing  prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."

NEC ELECTRONICS TO INTEGRATE CHIP PRODUCTION UNITS-- NEC Electronics Corp. said Wednesday it will integrate its six domestic semiconductor-manufacturing units into three by April next year, aiming to reduce costs.

The company will merge three units in Kumamoto, Yamaguchi and Fukuoka Prefectures into one unit, and two units based in Shiga and Fukui Prefectures into one. In addition, NEC Electronics will terminate production of state-of-the-art semiconductors at its Sagamihara plant in Kanagawa Prefecture by March 2009, and transfer the facilities to another unit located in Yamagata Prefecture.

AEON, SANYO TO JOINTLY DEVELOP HOME ELECTRONICS-- Aeon Co. and Sanyo Electric Co. said they will jointly develop home electric appliances for sale by the supermarket chain.

Jointly developed products, including refrigerators and washing machines, will go on sale next spring at some 500 outlets, including Jusco supermarkets and Daiei Inc. stores. Retail prices of those white goods sold under Aeon's "Topvalu" brand will be 20-30 pct lower than those of rival makers.

BEIJING - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao repeated Wednesday the country's goal to increase the flexibility of its currency as top European Union officials urged Beijing to allow a quicker appreciation of the yuan against the euro.

EU officials, including its top economic policymakers, told Chinese leaders in meetings in Beijing that the yuan's weakening against the euro is widening the bilateral trade gap and aggravating the global economic imbalance.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 28 -- (EDS: ADDING INFO)

The European Commission said Wednesday it has  finedAsahi Glass Co. and three other companies a total of 486.9 million euros for establishing an international price-fixing cartel.

TD
The three others  fined for infringement of competition rules are Nippon Sheet  Glass. Co.'s British subsidiary Pilkington Group Ltd., Saint-Gobain of France and Guardian of the United States, the commission said in a statement.

The four companies have a combined share of at least 80 percent of the  flat glass market in the European Economic Area, according to the commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union. Flat glass is used for windows,  glass doors and mirrors.

The commission said in the statement that it found in its investigation that Asahi  Glass, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain coordinated ''price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of flat glass'' in violation of a ban on such cartels.
The ban on cartels and restrictive business is stipulated under the commission's treaty and European
Economic Area agreement.

Asahi Glass, in a separate statement, confirmed that the commission imposed a  fine of 65 million euros on it and its European subsidiary AGC  Flat Glass Europe for establishing a sales  cartel in the flat-glass sector.

But Asahi  Glass was fined less than the other three because of its ''substantial cooperation'' during the commission's investigation, the commission said.

''Upon receipt (of the full text of the commission's decision), Asahi  Glass and AGC Flat Glass Europe will examine the decision and determine accordingly their future course of action,'' Asahi Glass said.

Nippon Sheet  Glass meanwhile said it ''has made a provision for the estimated  fine payment for building products and automotive  glass.''

Guardian was fined 148 million euros, Pilkington 140 million euros and Saint-Gobain 133.9 million euros.

''Between early 2004 and early 2005, Asahi, Guardian, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain managed to raise or otherwise stabilize prices through a series of meeting and other illicit contacts,'' the commission said of the  cartel which it uncovered based on information by national competition authorities.

''The commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market,'' Neelie Kroes, European commissioner for competition policy, said in a press conference.

''It is right that the punishment in this case is severe, in order to achieve a sufficient deterrent effect,'' Kroes said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - European competition regulators  fined four big makers of  flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors nearly 500 million euros on Wednesday for illegally coordinating price rises and business conditions.

TD
The European Commission imposed fines totalling 486.9 million euros ($717.2 million) on privately held U.S. firm Guardian; Pilkington Plc, the UK unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass; French producer Saint-Gobain; and Belgian-based Glaverbel SA, which was recently renamed AGC  Flat Glass Europe and is a unit of Japan's Asahi  Glass.

Although the  cartel lasted little more than a year, the  fine was the Commission's fifth-largest ever by sector. It amounted to nearly half the record 992 million euros imposed on an elevator  cartel lasting nearly 20 years.

It brought the Commission's  cartel fines this year to a record 3 billion euros. The size was due to new, stiffer guidelines covering such penalties.
"This will be the new policy," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said of the higher  fines. "So let everyone be warned by this type of level -- if you don't want to take the risk, just stop your
cartel," she told a news conference.

In an unusual move, the Commission discovered the  cartel without the help of any whistleblowing among the participants. National competition authorities alerted Brussels, acting on what they said was market information.

"They (the companies) thought that they would not be found out. They thought that the increased prices that they agreed were worth the risk and they were wrong," Kroes said.

Guardian was fined 148 million euros, Pilkington 140 million euros, Saint-Gobain 133.9 million euros and Glaverbel 65 million euros. The Commission said Glaverbel had a lower  fine because it cooperated with the EU executive.

Nippon Sheet  Glass said in a statement it has already booked reserves for EU  fines and the company has no plan to revise its earnings outlook. Asahi  Glass said it would announce any impact of the  fines on its earnings at a later date.

The Commission said the four companies managed to raise or stabilise prices between early 2004 and early 2005 through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts.
It carried out surprise raids on the premises of Asahi's and Guardian's European subsidiaries in
February and March 2005.

The Commission is still investigating a suspected auto  glass cartel. Kroes declined to say when it would finish that case. (Editing by Dale Hudson and David Holmes)

SAGE INVESTORS CALM AFTER FEARS

SOFTWARE developer Sage has re-booted investors' interest after doubling its dividend and assuring that recent glitches at its US division are being resolved.

TD
The Newcastle-based firm's shares rallied 12pc after full year pretax profits jumped 14pc to £251m, prompting a hike in the dividend from 3.59p to 7p.

Chief executive Paul Walker said the all-important North American operation, which accounts for just under half of group revenues, is back on track after a major shakeout in the Spring.

Sage rose 22.3p to 216p. Walker said there have been no ill-effects so far from the growing economic turmoil in the US, where Sage competes against software giants like Microsoft and Intuit.
JM GETS A JUMP OUT OF METALS COSTS RISE
RISING precious metal prices helped the world's biggest platinum refiner Johnson Matthey deliver a
15pc jump in half year profits to £120m.

The price of platinum in the first half was up 7pc on the same period last year and demand for the metal is expected to have risen 3pc in 2007.
Chief executive Neil Carson is upbeat about the next six months.

He expects earnings growth to be 'similar' to that achieved in the first half. The catalytic converter maker lifted its dividend 7pc to
10.6p. Shares in the group were up 26p at 1686p. EC CRACKS  GLASS PRICE  FIXING PLAN
THE European Commission has slapped a £348m fine on four flat glass manufacturers for price
fixing  between 2004 and 2005.
Nippon-owned Pilkington was  fined £100m, Saint-Gobain was hit with £95.6m, Asahi  Glass
£46.4m, and US company Guardian got £105.6m.

The Brussels regulator found them guilty of co-ordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for  flat glass deliveries in Europe.

The commission sprang surprise inspections on the companies in February and March 2005 after a tip off by national competition authorities.
NW 'NOT HAD OFFERS' AS WATER DEALS FLOW

NORTHUMBRIANWater raised pretax profits for the half to September by 17pc to £88m.

It has 'not had any offers', though takeover talk has spread across the sector after this week's agreed bid for Yorkshire Water owner Kelda.
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan bought 26pc of NW (up 16p at 3393/4p) last year.
Dividends rose 7pc to 4p. After severe storms, there were 816 sewer flooding incidents, up from
212 a year ago.
IPHONE ALLEGATIONS RATTLE CARPHONE
CARPHONE Warehouse is facing accusations that it misled customers about Apple's iPhone.

Last night, BBC One's Watchdog claimed that some Carphone staff had given buyers an inaccurate estimate of the cost of replacing a lost or stolen iPhone.

The salesmen had hoped to sell customers in-store insurance. Carphone (up 17p to 3531/4p) said there may have been 'some element of confusion among an isolated number of sales consultants'.

HD     Paris shares up sharply  as hopes of Fed rate-cut fuels bargain-hunting UPDATE WC    858 words

(Adds full report)

PARIS (Thomson Financial) - Share prices ended sharply higher, with the main indices up over 2 pct, as increased hopes of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month encouraged bargain-hunting on stocks that have suffered from recent economic and credit jitters.

TD
The CAC-40 index finished up 127.04 points or 2.34 pct at 5,561.21.

Among CAC-40 stocks, 38 closed higher and 2 closed lower. On the Matif, December CAC-40 futures were trading at 5,545.

On the broader indices, the SBF-80 index closed up 140.52 or 2.27 pct at 6,338.15 and the SBF-120 ended 91.62 or 2.33 pct higher at 4,026.58.
The euro was at 1.4753 usd compared to 1.4830 usd late yesterday.

Moderate morning gains were reinforced by a strong opening on Wall Street, where investors cheered comments from Fed vice chairman Donald Kohn hinting that recent financial turbulence could merit a further rate cut from the central bank.
Among the big climbers in Paris, financials continued to come off lows, buoyed by yesterday's news of
Citigroup's capital injection from an Abu Dhabi investment fund.

Dexia rose 0.80 eur or 4.62 pct to 18.10, Credit Agricole gained 0.88 or 3.97 pct to 23.03, BNP Paribas added 2.64 or 3.68 pct to 74.43, while Societe Generale was up 3.15 or 3.22 pct at 101.02.

Investors also returned to other stocks that have wilted in recent weeks, notably in the auto sector. Renault jumped 4.99 or 5.32 pct, leading the CAC-40 at the close, Michelin gained 3.45 or 4.58 pct to
78.81, while Peugeot added 1.47 or 2.93 pct to 51.70.
Alcatel-Lucent also rebounded from annual lows, climbing 0.24 or 4.75 pct to 5.29, while Accor regained
2.55 or 4.73 pct to 56.55 after the shares' recent losses.

Outside the CAC-40, Thales rose 1.98 or 5.17 pct to 40.25 as investors voiced relief that the group has ruled out a merger with Safran.

According to a Paris-based dealer, the news removes the uncertainties around Thales created by the prospect of a lengthy merger and restructuring process, and clears the way for investors to focus on the share's attractive profile.

Conversely, Safran plunged 1.26 or 8.54 pct to 13.50, with dealers pointing to the disappearance of the share's speculative appeal and negative comments on Safran's dollar sensitivity.
Elsewhere, Sodexho Alliance regained some of its heavy losses since its full year results, adding 2.82 or
6.86 pct to 43.90, as a positive earnings report and comments from UK peer Compass restored
confidence in the French catering and services group.
In the IT sector, Capgemini rallied after two days of losses, adding 1.68 or 4.52 pct to 38.82.


Page 52 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CM-CIC analysts said in a note today that valuations for IT services companies are currently at all-time lows due to fears of a US and European economic slowdown. The analysts reiterated their 'buy' stance on Capgemini, saying these concerns are being overdone and the sector will still register growth of 3-4 pct in
2008, while the major groups will succeed in preserving or improving profit margins.
The note benefited other IT services stocks, with Atos Origin up 1.02 or 2.82 pct at 37.15 and Dassault
Systemes rising 1.72 or 4.41 pct to 40.71.

Construction stocks trailed the market after negative comments on the US housing market from UK company Wolseley, as well as government data showing sales of existing homes in the US fell for the eighth consecutive month in October.

Among construction groups, Lafarge was up 0.65 or 0.63 pct at 103.91 and Vinci was up 0.14 or 0.26 pct at 53.29, while among property players, Unibail-Rodamco was 0.98 or 0.65 pct higher at 151.75 and Nexity fell 0.70 or 1.86 pct at 36.93.

But building materials group Saint-Gobain surged 2.93 or 4.60 pct to 66.65 after the  European                 Commission announced a smaller than expected  fine of 133.9 mln eur following its probe into price fixing by flat glass manufacturers.

Saint-Gobain has already provisioned 650 mln eur for  fines relating to this enquiry and to a second probe into price-fixing  in the car glass industry.

Fimalac, meanwhile, dropped 1.36 or 2.93 pct to 45.03 after publishing its full-year results, with analysts bemoaning the absence of specific 2008 guidance. tfn.paris@thomson.com gt/lht/gt/lht

HD         Pilkington handed Pounds 100m fine for role in running glass cartel

* Four punished by European Commission
* Prices were fixed for industry for one year

TD
Pilkington, the British glass manufacturer, was handed a Euro 140 million (Pounds 100 million)  fine by the European Commission yesterday for forming an illegal  cartel with three competitors three years ago.

As part of its get-tough policy on companies that ignore European Union anti-trust rules, the  European Commission imposed is fifth- highest  cartel fine of Euro 486.9 million on the quartet of rule-breakers: Asahi, of Japan; Guardian, of the United States; Saint-Gobain, of France; and Pilkington.

Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "The Commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing  prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."
The Commission, working closely with national competition authorities, launched a series of raids on
the companies' premises in February and March 2005. These uncovered evidence that representatives
from the four firms had met several times in hotels and restaurants in different European countries to
exchange sensitive commercial information.

During the meetings, the participants discussed and agreed the level and timing of price increases and considered commercial conditions in order to increase or stabilise prices.

The cartel, which operated between early 2004 and early 2005, was centred on flat glass used in the building industry. The main customers for the products are processors, which turn the glass into finished products such as double-glazed windows, fire- resistant  glass and mirrors for use in large buildings and private homes. The four companies held 80 per cent of Europe's  flat glass market in
2004 and enjoyed sales of Euro 1.7 billion.

When announcing the penalties, the Commission emphasised that any individual or company that had been affected by the illegal behaviour could seek damages before national courts.

The cartel lasted little longer than a year, but the size of the  fine was driven by tougher guidelines ensuring that penalties reflect the overall economic significance of the illegal activity. "This will be the new policy," Ms Kroes said. "It is right that the punishment in this case is severe in order to achieve a sufficient deterrent effect and it is a great pity that the Commission's many previous  cartel decisions did not deter the companies from forming the  cartel."

Pilkington, which became the British unit of Nippon Sheet  Glass, of Japan, last year, was unavailable for comment. The British company and Saint-Gobain are also under investigation for allegedly participating in another  cartel involving car glass.

A spokesman for the French firm said that it "took note" of the decision and had set aside Euro 650 million for the  fine and any possible penalty in the car  glass case. Guardian was  fined Euro 148 million

and the Belgian-based Glaverbel, now a unit of Asahi  Glass and which had co-operated with the
Commission in the investigation, Euro 65 million.

Meanwhile, Qantas, the Australian airline, apologised yesterday for its involvement in an international price-fixing  scam and agreed to pay a $61 million (Pounds 29.5 million)  fine imposed by the US
Justice Department. Geoff Dixon, the company's chief executive, said: "The conduct was wrong and we apologise unreservedly for this. Qantas takes its obligations to comply with the law very seriously."

According to the charges, between June 2000 and February 2006 Qantas had engaged in a conspiracy to eliminate competition by  fixing  the rates for shipments of cargo to and from the United States and elsewhere.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined four flat-glass producers a total of 486.9 million euros ($722.2 million) for fixing  prices in Europe.

U.S.-based Guardian Industries Corp. received the highest  fine, 148 million euros. U.K.-based Pilkington PLC, which is owned by Japanese company Nippon Sheet  Glass Co., was fined 140 million euros, while France-based Cie. de Saint-Gobain will pay 133.9 million euros.

TD
Japanese company Asahi  Glass Co. is paying a reduced  fine of 65 million euros after "substantial cooperation," said European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The four companies were caught coordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of flat glass in Europe through a series of meetings in restaurants and hotels in 2004 and
2005.

Ms. Kroes said the companies knew what they were doing and thought that colluding on prices was worth the risk.

"We are extremely shocked by the decision," a Guardian spokesman said. The company will take some time to study the decision, and possibly appeal the decision at a later date, he said. "It really is a mystery, how they calculated the  fines," he added.
Asahi said it would examine the decision and determine a future course of action accordingly. Saint-Gobain couldn't be reached for comment. A Pilkington representative said the company
couldn't immediately comment on the case.

HD      CARTELS : FOUR FLAT GLASS PRODUCERS FINED FOR OPERATING CARTEL WC     412 words

The European Commission imposed fines, totalling €486.9 million, on  flat glass producers, including French giant Saint-Gobain, found guilty of illegal practices, announced European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes on 28 November. Saint-Gobain will have to pay €134 million. The three other groups involved are Guardian of the USA (€148 million  fine), Pilkington of the UK (€140 million) and
Asahi of Japan (€65 million).

TD
The cartel concerned flat glass for use in the construction sector (basic float  glass, low-emissivity  glass, laminated glass and unprocessed mirror glass). According to the Commission, between 2004 and early
2005, the four companies "managed to raise or otherwise stabilise prices through a series of meetings and other illicit contacts". Together, these companies hold 80% of the market share for  flat glass in Europe. In 2004, their sales to independent customers, who transform this  glass into double glazing or fire-resistant  glass for large buildings and houses, totalled €1.7 billion.

"Companies which engage in cartels will be discovered [ ] the Commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and client companies," said Kroes. In this case, the Commission opened an
own-initiative investigation on the basis of information supplied by competition authorities in member states. During several meetings in restaurants in hotels of several European countries, the four incriminated groups "agreed the level and timing of price increases (including which undertaking was to lead the price increase), target prices and minimum prices," says the Commission.

Searches were carried out in February and March 2005. Asahi and its European subsidiary Glaverbel (AGC Flat Glass Europe) applied for application of the 2002 Leniency Notice. "They both cooperated with the Commission and supplied additional evidence," says the EU executive.
NEW RULES

Kroes says that she remains committed to combating cartels. It is the second time that the Commission has applied the guidelines, adopted in 2006, for the calculation of  fines, now based on a percentage of annual sales concerned (up to 30% of these sales), multiplied by the number of years the  cartel operated. The commissioner very recently inaugurated these new rules against a  cartel in professional video tapes sold to European clients (see Europolitics 3417).
This is Saint-Gobain's first conviction, also implicated for a second infraction in the market for used  glass
for the car industry (windshield, lights, convertible roof, etc). The group had announced in July that it has
€650 million to cover the two infractions.

HD        Flat glass groups  are fined Euros 500m. BY       By NIKKI TAIT

Leading glassmakers were yesterday  fined almost Euros 500m (Dollars 739m) for rigging prices in the
European market for  flat glass, used mainly by the construction industry.

The overall penalty of Euros 489.9m is the fifth-highest on record imposed by the  European                   Commission.

TD
It is likely to drive home to companies the costly consequences, under a new fining regime, of engaging in anti-competitive activity in large markets or for long periods.

Guardian Industries, a privately owned US group, faces the biggest single penalty, of Euros 148m, followed by Britain's Pilkington which receives a Euros 140m  fine.
France's Saint-Gobain is  fined Euros 133.9m, while Japan's Asahi gets a Euros 65m penalty.
Asahi's  fine was reduced because of its co-operation under the Commission's leniency arrangements. Yesterday, the Commission said the companies had either raised or stabilised prices in the European
flat glass market through a series of meetings and illicit contracts between early 2004 and early 2005.
"The companies profited from selling  flat glass at artificially inflated prices," said Neelie Kroes, EU
competition commissioner.
"The direct victims were the buyers of  flat glass - companies who made products such as
double-glazing and safety  glass. But the final victims were European consumers who had to pay the
price for the  glass used in buildings, private homes and apartments," she said.

The fine is only the second to be imposed under the new  fines guidelines, which are designed to reflect better the economic impact of anti-competitive behaviour.

Last week,  fines were imposed under the new guidelines in a much smaller case involving the market for professional video tape.

Under the new regime,  fines are linked directly to the turnover which the companies derived from the manipulated market, and the length of time the  cartel lasted.

Lawyers said that the size of the latest penalty was a clear warning signal to companies - especially if they were operating in large markets - given that the  cartel in this case had lasted for barely a year.

Ms Kroes declined to elaborate on exactly how the  fines had been calculated, but said that the "important thing is that the  fine as a whole is sufficiently deterrent, so that none of these companies will be tempted to infringe the rules again".
"I believe we achieved that aim in this case," she said.

Page 58 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ms Kroes did confirm, however, that Saint-Gobain, which has faced antitrust action before, had not been hit by a "repeat offender" penalty.

The latest  fine means that the Commission has now raised more than Euros 3bn in antitrust penalties this year.

It also announced new guidelines yesterday for so-called "vertical" or conglomerate mergers - between, for example, a manufacturer and a supplier.

Two years ago competition regulators at the  European Commission swooped on the offices of leading
glass manufacturers, including France's Saint-Gobain and Britain's Pilkington, in a series of
pan-European dawn raids.

Yesterday, the result of those probes was revealed - a Euros 487m (Dollars 720m) antitrust penalty levied on four companies for anti-competitive behaviour in the  flat-glass market.

TD
According to the Commission yesterday, individuals working for Saint-Gobain, Pilkington (now owned by Nippon Sheet  Glass), Guardian Industries in the US, and Asahi  Glass's Glaverbel subsidiary in Belgium held a series of covert meetings in hotels and restaurants around Europe in 2004 and 2005. At these,
the Commission alleges, they jointly agreed to increase prices for  flat glass used in the building industry.

According to the Commission, both the amount and the timing of price increases was discussed and the end-result was consumers ended up paying higher prices.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, who has made fighting cartels one of her top priorities, said yesterday: "Companies that engage in cartels will be found."

Some of the companies involved declined to comment yesterday - not least because an antitrust probe into possible price-fixing  in the separate automotive  glass market is continuing.
But Guardian Industries, a private company based near Detroit, said it was "shocked" by the  fines. "We don't believe we're guilty of serious wrongdoing," says Peter Walters, a vice-president.
The company had seen nothing beyond the Commission's press statement and could not understand the
fines' calculations.
"We most certainly are looking at what our next step might be," he says, confirming that an appeal to the
European Court of Justice was one possible option.
For competition lawyers, the scale of the  fine - in aggregate, the fifth largest ever imposed by the
Commission for antitrust behaviour - was a clear warning signal of more to come.

Under new guidelines,  fines can be based on up to 30 per cent of a company's annual sales of the products or services to which the infringement relates, and then multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement.

There can also be an "entry fee" imposed, for joining the  cartel in the first place, and additional penalties for repeat offenders.

Separately, companies may get penalised for obstruction, or get a reduction if they have helped officials under so-called leniency arrangements.

Fines, though, cannot exceed 10 per cent of a company's turnover.

So far, lawyers think the Commission has refrained from using the maximum 30 per cent of turnover benchmark for fines.

"From the two decisions adopted so far, it looks as if the Commission is working in the 15-20 per cent range," says Julian Joshua, partner at Howry in Brussels.

But they make the point that the  flat-glass penalty was for offences of relatively short duration. Its size was due to the fact that the companies spoke for about 80 per cent of a Euros 1.7bn European market.

"Fines of Euros 486.9m were imposed for  cartel activities lasting barely a year," said Stephen Rose at lawyers Eversheds.

Had the cartel persisted for longer,  fines running beyond the Euros 1bn mark could have been in view, and there are now even some predictions that penalties close to the 10 per cent of turn-over cap could become frequent.

HD             EU fines makers of window  glass record euros 487m for fixing  prices

Four major makers of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors were yesterday given one of the largest cartel fines ever imposed by European competition regulators for illegal price  fixing.

The European commission imposed fines of euros 486.9m (pounds 347m) on the four companies including Pilkington - the UK arm of Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass.

TD
The privately held US firm, Guardian, Belgium-based Glaverbel SA, which was recently renamed AGC Flat Glass Europe, and a unit of Japan's Asahi  Glass and French producer Saint-Gobain were the other companies involved in the  cartel.

The fine was the commission's fifth-largest by sector, despite the co-ordination of price rises between the firms lasting little more than a year.

The commission's  cartel fines have this year reached a record euros 3bn, mainly due to the introduction of stiffer guidelines and higher  fines. Yesterday's  fine was the second handed out under these new rules. The  fines are capped at 10% of a firm's annual global sales.

Surprise raids by European officials at the firms' European subsidiaries found that the companies raised and held prices between early 2004 and early 2005 through a series of meetings.

"They thought that they would not be found out. They thought that the increased prices that they agreed were worth the risk and they were wrong," said Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner.

"[The EU] will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing  prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market. So let everyone be warned by this type of [fine] level."

n European competition regulators  fined four big makers of  flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors ¤486.9m (£347.1m) yesterday for illegally coordinating price rises and business conditions.

TD
The European Commission fined four companies, including Pilkington, the UK  glass maker owned by Japan"s Nippon Sheet Glass, Guardian of the US, France"s Saint-Gobain and Belgian"s Glaverbel, which is owned by Japan"s Asahi  Glass.

Although the  cartel lasted little more than a year, the  fine was the commission"s fifth largest ever by sector. It amounted to nearly half the record ¤992m imposed on an elevator  cartel lasting nearly 20 years.

It brought the commission"s  cartel fines this year to a record ¤3bn. The size was due to new, stiffer, guidelines covering such penalties.

HD        LIVERPOOL DAILY POST: We all pay for price fixing
WC        333 words

JUST four months after British Airways was  fined £270m for price fixing,  a new scandal is making headlines - and this time a Mersey-side firm is exposed as the villain.
Industrial giant Pilkington was last night ordered to pay a £100m penalty for illegally  fixing  European
glass price rises.

TD
The St Helens company, along with American company Guardian, French firm Saint-Gobain and Japanese business Asahi, was landed with a share of  fines topping £340m in total from the  European Commission.
The EC attacked all four for arranging secret meetings to arrange "artificially inflated" prices for flat      
glass used in double glazing and safety  glass.
So far, so big business.

But this shameless rigging of  glass prices impacts on the consumer as much as the BA decision to set fixed levies for air travel.

For, while the direct victims of the four firms were the buyers of  flat glass, companies who make products such as double-glazing and safety  glass, ultimately the high costs were passed down the line, to the consumer.

It was the people buying new windows, or even new cars with the high cost of the windscreen factored into price, who shouldered the burden of Pilkington's collusion with the other three firms.

Pilkington - now owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass with a worldwide workforce of 36,000 - has in the past made much of its St Helens roots, and no doubt consumers have been influenced in their purchases by the idea of supporting a local firm employing local people.
Its mission statement promises: "To be the global leader in the manufacture and supply of  glass
products, through the best use of our people and technology and the pursuit of innovation".

Perhaps Pilkington should now consider adding an extra line: "We also pledge to fix the bottom line so you pay more for our products".
Somehow, one suspects that just wouldn't look as good in the corporate literature.

In association with BUSINESS Mersey firm in  cartel with other makers
MERSEYSIDE industrial giant Pilkington has been  fined £100m for fixing glass prices.

TD
The St Helens company was one of four firms hit with a total of £347m in  fines from the European Commission for holding secret meetings to arrange "artificially-inflated" prices for flat glass used in double glazing and safety  glass.
The commission has fined Pilkington, along with American company Guardian, French firm
Saint-Gobain and Japanese business Asahi, for their "price  fixing cartel".

Between them, the four companies control at least 80 % of Europe's  flat glass market. Flat glass is used in glass doors, windows and mirrors.
And there could be more  fines to follow. The EC is also investigating an alleged  cartel among car glass
manufacturers, including Pilkington.

Announcing the  fine in the flat glass case, Neelie Kroes, European commissioner for competition policy, said: "The Commission has established that, in 2004 and 2005, representatives of these companies met covertly at hotels and restaurants around Europe.

"At these meetings, they conspired to increase prices for  flat glass, discussing both the amount and the timing of price increases.
"The companies profited from selling  flat glass at artificially inflated prices.

"The direct victims were the buyers of the  flat glass, companies who made products such as double-glazing and safety  glass.
"But the final victims were once again European consumers, who had to pay the price for the  glass
used in buildings, private homes and apartments.

"The flat glass market was worth about 1.7bn euros in 2004. So the companies, and their shareholders, will have done very well out of this  cartel. Until today.
"It is right that the punishment in this case is severe, in order to achieve a sufficient deterrent effect." Pilkington was founded in 1826 and employs 36,000 people worldwide. It was taken over by Japan's
Nippon Sheet  Glass in a £2.2bn deal in 2006.

The commission launched its investigation after receiving information from national competition authorities.

It carried out surprise inspections in February and March, 2005, at Guardian and Asahi's European divisions, as well as at Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and the European Association of  Flat Glass Producers.

Page 69 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Between the two rounds of investigations, Asahi and its European subsidiary, Glaverbel, agreed to co-operate with the Commission.
As a result of that "substantial co-operation", Asahi received the lowest  fine of £46.3m. Guardian was fined £105.6m while Saint-Gobain was  fined £95.5m.
Ms Kroes said: "Companies that engage in cartels will be found out, whether or not one of their members blows the whistle. And when such cartels are found out, the punishment will be severe because the Commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by fixing  prices."

A Pilkington spokesman said last night the company would not comment on the announcement, as it had not seen the full text of the report and as another investigation was ongoing.
The companies have the right of appeal to the European Court of Justice.

British people or businesses who believe they may have been affected by a  cartel can seek damages in the UK courts.

HD        EU fines smaller, so shares rise Asia's 2 largest glassmakers penalized less than expected

TOKYO -- Nippon Sheet  Glass and Asahi Glass rose in Tokyo trading after the two largest Asian glassmakers were fined a smaller-than-expected €205 million, or $304 million, by the European Union for price-fixing.

Asahi Glass rose 8.4 percent, the biggest jump in five years, to close ¥118 higher at ¥1,526, or $13.87. It was the second-biggest gainer on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Nippon Sheet  Glass gained 7.9 percent, or ¥43, the most since Aug. 8, to close at ¥ 590.

TD
The European Commission fined Nippon Sheet's British-based Pilkington unit €140 million and Asahi
Glass €65 million.

Cie. de Saint-Gobain and Guardian Industries, along with the two Japanese companies, were  fined a total of €487 million for fixing  the price of  glass used in the construction industry, and may face further penalties for forming a cartel in the automotive industry. Nippon Sheet  Glass on May 22 said it had set aside £350 million, or $727 million, for possible  fines in the two investigations.

''The  fines for Nippon Sheet  Glass and Asahi Glass were smaller than anticipated,'' Masao Yoshida, an analyst at Okasan Securities, said by telephone in Tokyo Thursday. He rates the shares of Asahi  Glass
''above average'' and Nippon Sheet  Glass ''below average.''

In mid-March, the commission accused Nippon Sheet, Asahi  Glass, Guardian and Saint-Gobain of conspiring at a series of meetings from early 2004 to early 2005 to set the price of  glass used in windows, glass doors and mirrors.

Asahi Glass's Brussels-based AGC  Flat Glass Europe unit said yesterday it cooperated with the EU for a fine reduction. The commission did not disclose the amount it cut from Asahi's  fine.

Asahi Glass, which has not received the full text of the regulator's decision, ''will decide the future course of action after receiving the text and examining it,'' Yoshihiko Saito, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based company, said Thursday by telephone. The impact on earnings will be released later, Saito said, without giving a time frame.

Nippon Sheet said Wednesday on its Web site that the regulator's decision would not change its full-year earnings forecast.
''Asahi  Glass looks likely to book extraordinary losses to cover the  fines,'' Yuji Matsumoto, a
Tokyo-based analyst at Nomura Securities, said Thursday in a report to investors. ''But as such losses
will be less than 1% of either market cap or shareholders' equity, the impact on corporate value should
be minimal.'' He rates the stock a ''strong buy.''

In April, the EU also charged Saint-Gobain, Asahi  Glass and Nippon Sheet  Glass with a conspiracy to fix prices of car windows. The commission has not ruled on that case yet. The result of the investigation may be announced in ''early 2008,'' according to the Nomura report.

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS -- European competition regulators  fined four big makers of  flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors nearly 500 million euros for illegally co-ordinating price rises and business conditions.

TD
The European Commission imposed fines totalling 486.9 million euros ($717.2 million) on privately held U.S. firm Guardian; Pilkington Plc, the U.K. unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet  Glass; French producer Saint-Gobain; and Belgian-based Glaverbel SA.

Although the  cartel lasted little more than a year, the  fine was the commission's fifth-largest by sector.

Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh will be fined €243.2 million for their participation in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in Europe, announced the European Commission on 5 December. The companies shared the European market from "at least" 1993 to 2002, announced the EU executive, and set prices for rubber used to manufacture adhesives, diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of shoes and a wide range of industrial goods.
The Commission increased the  fine for Italy's ENI, which had already been  fined for similar activities, by
60% (€132.1 million). Germany's Bayer, also a repeat offender, was given the biggest  fine (€201 million),
but the Commission granted it full immunity because it was the first company to reveal details about the
cartel. The EU executive is entitled to grant such reductions under the 2002 rules on leniency.

TD
The Japanese firm Tosoh (€4.8 million) and the American group DuPont-Dow (€59.2 million) were also granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25%, respectively. DuPont, on top of an initial  fine of €10.6 million, will have to share an additional  fine of €48.7 million with Dow, with which it had a joint venture in the cartel, explained the Commission. Japan's Denka will have to pay its full  fine of €47 million.

"The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal arrangements," explained the Commission.

This is not the first ruling against rubber producers. In November 2006, the Commission  fined five companies, among them ENI and Dow, €519 million for  cartel activities on the synthetic rubber market. Bayer, which had participated, was granted immunity for having blown the whistle.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press release. She will continue tracking down illegal concerted agreements. She recently imposed  fines on cartels acting on the European markets for professional videotapes and for  flat glass (see Europolitics 3423 and 3417).In this new rubber case, the  fines were decided on the basis of the 2006 guidelines on  fines, which are now based on a percentage of the annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years the violation existed. The  fines are intended to better reflect the participation of the different companies concerned and the economic impact of the violation.

Four flat glass manufacturers - including Britain's Pilkington - have been handed  fines totalling £350m by the European Commission for price fixing.

The Commission found that between 2004 and 2005, Asahi (Japan), Guardian (USA), Pilkington (UK) and Saint-Gobain (France) managed to operate a cartel through a series of meetings and illicit contact, which managed to raise or stabilise the price of flat glass used in the construction sector throughout the European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
As CJ reported earlier this year (CJ 28 March), the charges followed raids on the  glass makers in February 2005 after market information provided by several member states' national competition authorities.
The evidence uncovered revealed that the four manufacturers, with a share of more than 80% of the EEA
market, had organised several rounds of price increases and fixed minimum prices.

Pilkington was  fined £101m for its part in the cartel, while Guardian, Saint Gobain and Asahi received fines of £107m, £96m and £46m respectively. The fines were close to the maximum permitted, which is up to 30% of the company's turnover within the sector.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "The commission will not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by  fixing  prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market."

HD        FT.com site : A market rigged against the cartels. BY        Nikki Tait

Shockwaves rippled from Brussels to the suburbs of Detroit last month when Guardian Industries, a US
privately owned manufacturing group, was hit with a 148m  fine for price-rigging.

It was the largest single element of a 487m penalty imposed by the  European Commission on four glassmakers for running a  cartel in the market for  flat-glass, used mainly in the construction industry.

TD
The fine was lower than predicted: some had suggested it might be the Commission's first-ever
1bn-plus cartel penalty. But the high forecasts had overestimated the length of time during which the
cartel persisted.
New fining guidelines, which started to bite last month, now tie  cartel penalties awarded by the
Commission more closely to the scale of an infringement. In broad terms,  fines will be based on up to
30 per cent of a company's annual sales to the manipulated market, multiplied by the number of years of
cartel involvement - and then subjected to various other factors and adjustments.

In this case, the price-rigging alleged by the Commission had persisted for barely a year. Had it run on for any significant length of time, the penalties could have been extremely high.

The Brussels authorities hope the implications of this new regime will serve as a warning to companies tempted to breach antitrust rules.

"There should be a real call to change attitudes," Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, told a clutch of businessmen and MEPs at a think-tank dinner recently. And the message, she also suggested, was getting through: "CEOs are now asking how they can address these problems - that is what I'm looking for."

But, while no one seeks to defend  cartel behaviour, competition specialists do query whether the ever-mounting penalties are blurring the boundaries between civil and criminal law.

The Commission and its competition directorate, they point out, are administrative bodies, working under a civil law regime.
However, the total sum raised from antitrust fines has jumped from less than 700m in 2005 to 1.8bn in
2006 and more than 3.3bn in 2007. With more cartel investigations pending there are concerns over
whether escalating penalties are pushing the fining system into quasi-criminal territory - and whether this
demands a higher standard of proof and transparency.

"When  fines get so high, they are clearly of a punitive nature," says Alec Burnside, at Linklaters' Brussels office.

In such a situation, lawyers argue, it should become incumbent on the Commission to make its decision-making more open - for example, detailing precisely how penalties have been calculated.

A second concern is whether penalties at this sort of level could affect a company's willingness to participate in a particular market - and so prove counterproductive.



Page 79 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commission fines cannot top 10 per cent of a company's total annual turnover, but competition specialists claim that if  fines regularly settle at that sort of level there may be consequences for corporate business structures, particularly if companies also face private damages actions. "I know that's of some concern inside the Commission," claims one lawyer.
Commission officials counter that such considerations would be taken into account when  fines were set. The increased fines may place Europe's top courts under pressure. One of the most significant checks
on the Commission's fining decisions is companies' right to appeal - in this case, to the
Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance.

Kyriakos Fountoukakos, at Herbert Smith, the law firm, points out that the CFI has unlimited jurisdiction to adjust Commission-imposed  fines. "It may well decide to exercise [this power] in a more interventionist way."
This though raises questions about how the higher fining regime may fit with the Commission's proposed
"direct settlement" arrangements.

The arrangements, which are under consultation, envisage that companies could reduce their penalties in exchange for acknowledging their  cartel involvement. The Commission hopes this will help free its resources.

The question is whether, faced with the possibility of large  fines, some companies will feel obliged to take this option, under which they may effectively (although not formally) surrender appeal rights.
In response, the Commission says companies that play by the rules have nothing to fear.

As for the determined Ms Kroes, she says simply: "The  finest day for me will be when the  fines are zero."
Judging by the past few weeks, however, such a day is still some way off.

LP
TOKYO, Dec. 19 -- Asahi  Glass Co. said Wednesday it has lowered its group net profit projection for the current business year due to asset impairment losses and provisions for  fines in relation to alleged anticompetitive behavior in Europe.

For the year to Dec. 31, the leading Japanese  glass maker is now expecting to book a net profit of 60 billion yen, instead of 90 billion yen as announced on Oct. 31.

TD
Asahi Glass blamed the downward revision on impairment losses arising from its European assets, such as production facilities, and the closure of a subsidiary's factory in Chiba Prefecture as well as on funds it has set aside for  fines it may have to pay in connection with alleged anticompetitive practices in the flat glass and automotive  glass markets in Europe.
However, the company revised upward its operating profit estimate to 192 billion yen and its pretax
profit estimate to 182 billion yen, thanks to stronger-than-expected business in Europe including Russia
and the favorable effects from the downsizing of cathode-ray tube  glass production facilities.

In October, Asahi  Glass said it was forecasting an operating profit of 180 billion yen and a pretax profit of 170 billion yen.
Its sales forecast remains unchanged at 1.67 trillion yen.

In late November, the  European Commission announced its decision to  fineAsahi Glass, Nippon Sheet  Glass Co.'s British subsidiary Pilkington Group Ltd. and two other companies a total of 486.9 million euros for the alleged formation of an international price-fixing cartel for their flat glass businesses.

Asahi Glass is also facing similar charges from the executive body of the European Union in connection with its automotive  glass business.

TOKYO (Dow Jones)-- Asahi  Glass Co. (5201.TO) said Wednesday it lowered this year's group net profit outlook partly because of special losses from  fines imposed by the European Commission for price fixing.
The Tokyo-based  glass maker said it now estimates a group net profit of Y60 billion, lower than the
Y90 billion previously foreseen.

TD
The company said it will book special losses roughly totaling Y78 billion. The losses also include those from a write-off of fixed assets in Europe and Japan as well as provisions for the penalties.

Last month, the European Commissionfined flat glass producers Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA (12500.FR), Pilkington PLC , Asahi Glass and Guardian Industries EUR486.9 million for  fixing  prices in Europe.

But Asahi  Glass said its mainline business activities fared well, partly because of brisk demand for construction-use sheet  glass in Russia and other emerging markets.

It left unrevised its group sales outlook at Y1.670 trillion. But it raised its group operating profit outlook to Y192 billion from Y180 billion.
Asahi Glass reports its earnings based on Japanese accounting standards.
