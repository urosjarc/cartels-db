Brussels (dpa) - The European Unionfined four European and Asian producers of  smart card chips 138 million euros (181 million dollars) on Wednesday after finding that they had illegally coordinated their business decisions.

Germany's Infineon, the Netherlands' Philips, South Korea's Samsung and Japan's Renesas - a former joint venture between Hitachi and Mitsubishi - traded information in violation of EU rules from 2003 to
2005, the bloc's executive found.

TD
Product prices were among the issues discussed by the companies, the  European Commission said.

"If ... companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

"In this digital era,  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports," he noted.

Infineon faces the biggest penalty at just under 83 million euros, followed by Samsung at 35 million euros and Philips at 20 million euros. Renesas avoided a  fine of more than 51 million euros by blowing the whistle on the  cartel.
Samsung's penalty was reduced by 30 per cent for its cooperation in the investigation.

Philips no longer has its smart card chips business, but is still liable, said the commission, which had been investigating the cartel since 2008.
It had at one point entered settlement negotiations with the companies, but they did not yield results.

The EU on Wednesday finedInfineon, Philips and Samsung 138 million euros (181 million dollars) for forming a smartcard chip cartel in Europe in its latest anti-trust case against technology firms.

The German, Dutch and South Korean firms "colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September 2005," the  European Commission said in a statement.

TD
Japan's Renesas was granted immunity for revealing the  cartel's existence.

Infineon was  fined 82.7 million euros, Philips 20.1 million euros, and Samsung 35.1 million euros, with the latter having its penalty reduced by 30 percent for having cooperated with investigators.

The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

The commmission said Renesas and its joint venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsbubishi avoided a fine of more than 51 million euros because it was the first to reveal the  cartel's existence to the commission

It said that Philips "remains liable for what happened during the period of infringement" even though it has since divested its  smart card chips business.

The commission said anyone harmed by the  cartel may seek damages before the courts of the European member states.

The EU has previously  fined US computer chip giant Intel 1.06 billion euros for abusing its dominant market position.

Earlier this year Google and the Commission agreed a deal over accusations the world's largest search engine was squeezing out competitors in Europe's search market, so avoiding legal action and potentially billions in fines

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined Philips, Samsung Electronics and Infineon Technologies a total of 138 million euros ($181.28 million) on Wednesday for  fixing  prices of chips used in mobile SIM cards.

The European Commission, which raided the companies in October 2008, charged the companies last year with taking part in a cartel. German chipmaker Infineon received the biggest penalty at 82.8 million euros.

AMSTERDAM, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Dutch electronics and healthcare company Philips denied its former semiconductor division had taken part in a price fixing  cartel, saying on Wednesday that it would appeal against a 20 million euro ($26.4 million) European Commissionfine.

"We firmly believe that claims of anti-competitive behaviour by former Philips  smart card chips business are unfounded. As a result, Philips plans to appeal the decision," the company said in a statement. Philips spun off its  semiconductor business into the independent company NXP Semiconductors in 2006.

The European Commission has found that Infineon (INFY), Philips (PHG), Samsung (SSNLF) and
Renesas
at the time a joint venture of Hitachi (HTHIY) and Mitshubishi

TD
coordinated their market behavior for  smart card chips in the European Economic Area, in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels. The Commission has imposed  fines totaling EUR138.05M. The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September
2005. Renesas benefited from full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. Under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice, Renesas received full immunity, as it was the first to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the Commission, avoiding a fine of more than EUR51M for its participation in the infringement. Samsung received a reduction of
30% of its  fine for cooperating with the investigation. Philips has divested its  smart card chips business after the infringement, but remains liable for what happened during the period of the infringement.

The European Commission adopted a decision in its antitrust investigation against four semiconductor
companies active in the smart card industry including Infineon. The European Commission believes
that the companies involved infringed European antitrust rules through the alleged sporadic exchange of
competitively sensitive information. The  fine for Infineon is EUR82.8M, while the total  fine was set at
EUR138M. Infineon rejects the allegations as unfounded. Further, Infineon believes that its procedural
rights were violated by the  European Commission. Therefore, Infineon will review the decision very
closely and is ready to appeal at the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg.

HD      EU finesSamsung, Philips  and Infineon  over smartcard chip cartel

The European UnionfinedInfineon, Philips and Samsung a total of 138 million euros (181 million dollars) on Wednesday for fixing  the prices of  smartcard chips, in its latest anti-trust case against technology firms.

The German, Dutch and South Korean companies "colluded" between 2003 and 2005 to fix prices on the chips, which are widely used in mobile phones, bank cards and passports, the  European Commission said in a statement.

TD
Japan's Renesas was granted immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the commission, which began its investigation in 2008 with raids on the companies.

Infineon Technologies AG was  fined 82.7 million euros, Philips 20.1 million euros, and Samsung 35.1 million euros, with the latter having its penalty reduced by 30 percent for having cooperated with investigators.

Rejecting the allegations as "unfounded," Infineon said it will review the decision and is "ready to appeal" at the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg.

The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

The commission said that Renesas and its joint-venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsbubishi had avoided a fine of more than 51 million euros because it was the first to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the EU.

It said that Philips "remains liable for what happened during the period of infringement" even though it has since divested its  smart card chips business.

Anyone harmed by the  cartel may seek damages before the courts of the European member states, the commission said.

Infineon said from its base in Neubiberg, Germany that it had conducted its own thorough probe and "concluded that none of its personnel acted improperly in handling competitively sensitive information" about smartcard chips.

The EU has previously  fined US computer chip giant Intel 1.06 billion euros for abusing its dominant market position.

Earlier this year Google and the Commission agreed a deal over accusations the world's largest search engine was squeezing out competitors in Europe's search market, so avoiding legal action and potentially billions in fines.

Brussels launched its investigation of Google in November 2010 following a complaint by several companies, including Microsoft.

* Renesas alerted regulators, escaped  fine (Adds Infineon comment)
By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined Philips, Samsung Electronics and Infineon Technologies a total of 138 million euros ($181.28 million) on Wednesday for  fixing  prices of chips used in mobile SIM cards.

The European Commission, which raided the companies in October 2008, said the  cartel took place between 2003 and 2005, with the companies also colluding on customers, production capacity and future market conduct.
Infineon received the biggest penalty at 82.8 million euros. The German chipmaker rejected the EU
finding, saying it would take its case to Europe's second highest court in Luxembourg.
Samsung was fined 35.12 million euros and Philips 20.15 million euros.

Philips, which spun off its former  semiconductor unit into an independent company NXP Semiconductors in 2006, said the EU charge against the unit was unfounded and that it too would challenge the decision in court.

Renesas Technology, a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric that was acquired by Renesas Electronics Corp in 2010, escaped a fine of more than 51 million euros as it was the first to alert the EU competition authority about the cartel.

The chips produced by the companies are also used in bank cards, identity cards, passports and pay TV cards. The companies had sought to settle the case in return for a 10 percent cut in the  fines but talks subsequently broke down.

HD      1ST LEAD EU fines European, Asian smart card chip makers 138 million euros By Alexandra

LP
Brussels (dpa) - The European Unionfined four European and Asian producers of  smart card chips 138 million euros (181 million dollars) on Wednesday after ruling that they had illegally coordinated business decisions.

Germany's Infineon, the Netherlands' Philips, South Korea's Samsung and Japan's Renesas - a former joint venture between Hitachi and Mitsubishi - traded information in violation of EU rules from 2003 to
2005, the bloc's executive found.

TD
Product prices were among the issues discussed by the companies, the  European Commission said.

"Such contacts were clearly anti-competitive," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. "The cartelists in our view knew that their conduct was illegal. Some of them even took measures to conceal
the collusion."

"In this digital era,  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports," he said. "If ... companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

Infineon faces the biggest penalty at just under 83 million euros. In a statement, it rejected the commission's findings as "baseless" and said it was preparing an appeal before the EU's courts.

Philips will also appeal, a spokesman told dpa. Philips was  fined 20 million euros, having been found liable even though it no longer has its  smart card chips business.

Samsung, meanwhile, faces a penalty of 35 million euros after having been granted a 30-per-cent reduction for its cooperation in the investigation.
Renesas avoided a fine of more than 51 million euros by blowing the whistle on the  cartel. The commission had been investigating the  cartel since 2008.

The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."
The commission said Renesas and its joint venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsubishi avoided a
fine of more than €51 million because it was the first to reveal the  cartel's existence to the commission

It said that Philips "remains liable for what happened during the period of infringement" even though it has since divested its  smart card chips business.

The commission said anyone harmed by the  cartel may seek damages before the courts of the European member states.

The EU has previously  fined US computer chip giant Intel €1.06 billion for abusing its dominant market position.

Earlier this year Google and the Commission agreed a deal over accusations the world's largest search engine was squeezing out competitors in Europe's search market, so avoiding legal action and potentially billions in fines.

Wednesday's  fines could have been avoided if the chipmakers -- Infineon Technologies, Royal Philips and Samsung Group -- had settled with EU regulators. The  European Commission launched the investigation in 2008 with raids on the companies' premises, but subsequently entered into talks with some of them aimed at reaching a settlement. It was a "clear lack of progress" in those talks that led to formal charges being issued against the companies, the  European Commission said Wednesday. Infineon said in a statement that it wasn't invited to the settlement talks. "It is up to companies to tell us that they are ready to participate in a settlement, and it is up to us to accept," EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said. (tom.fairless@wsj.com)

The European UnionfinedInfineon, Philips and Samsung a total of 138 million euros (181 million dollars) on Wednesday for fixing  the prices of  smartcard chips, in its latest anti-trust case against technology firms.

The German, Dutch and South Korean companies "colluded" between 2003 and 2005 to form the cartel on the chips, which are widely used in mobile phones, bank cards and passports, the European Commission said in a statement.

TD
Japan's Renesas was granted immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the commission, which began its investigation in 2008 with raids on the companies.

Infineon Technologies AG was  fined 82.7 million euros, Philips 20.1 million euros, and Samsung 35.1 million euros, with the latter having its penalty reduced by 30 percent for having cooperated with investigators.
Rejecting the allegations as "unfounded," both Infineon and Philips said they would appeal the decision. The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's
vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

The commission said that Renesas and its joint-venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsbubishi had avoided a fine of more than 51 million euros because it was the first to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the EU.

It said that Philips "remains liable for what happened during the period of infringement" even though it has since divested its  smart card chips business.

Anyone harmed by the  cartel may seek damages before the courts of the European member states, the commission said.

Infineon said from its base in Neubiberg, Germany, that it will review the decision and is "ready to appeal" at the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg.

It said it had conducted its own thorough probe and "concluded that none of its personnel acted improperly in handling competitively sensitive information" about  smartcard chips.

Page 32 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In Amsterdam, senior Philips press officer Steve Klink told AFP that his company would appeal the decision as "we firmly believe that claims of anti-competitive behaviour by the former Philips  smart card chips business are unfounded."

The EU has previously  fined US computer chip giant Intel 1.06 billion euros for abusing its dominant market position.

In another case, following accusations it was squeezing out competitors in Europe's search market, Google, the world's largest search engine, reached a tentative deal with the Commission in which it would display rivals' links more prominently and avoid a  fine of up to five billion euros.

Brussels launched its investigation of Google in November 2010 following a complaint by several companies, including Microsoft.
The case remains open as Almunia said his staff were "now analysing the responses" to the deal with
Google that were received over the summer from 18 of the 20 plaintiffs.

The European Union has slapped  fines on a number of European and Asian  smart card chip producers, accusing them of illegally coordinating business decisions. Two of them said the allegations were unfounded.

The EU executive said Wednesday it had  fined Germany's Infineon, the Netherlands' Philips and South Korea's Samsung for violations of EU competition rules. A fourth company under investigation, Japan's Renesas, avoided a 51-million-euro ($67-million)  fine by blowing the whistle on what EU officials
believe was a cartel among European and Asian chip makers.

TD
Germany's DAX-listed Infineon received the largest fine of just under 83 million euros for allegedly trading information on prices from 2003 to 2005, the European Commission claimed.

"The cartelists in our view knew that their conduct was illegal, and some of them even took measures to conceal the collusion," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
Objections galore

"In this digital era,  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports," Almunia added. "If companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."
In a company statement, Infineon rejected the Commission's findings, saying all accusations were
"baseless." The German firm announced it was preparing an appeal before the EU's courts.

Philips would also appeal, a spokesman told DPA news agency. The Dutch company was  fined 20 million euros. It is no longer in the  smart card chip business.

Six years of antitrust investigation come to an expensive conclusion for three major tech companies

The European Commission has slapped a €138m fine on three tech companies after finding them guilty of having a smart card chips cartel, concluding a six-year-old case.

TD
Samsung, Philips, Infineon and Renesas - a joint Hitachi and Mitsubishi venture - were discovered to have co-ordinated their market behaviour for  smart card chips, which are used in mobile phone SIM cards, bank cards, passports and other applications.

The European Commission (EC) imposed the  fines when its investigation revealed that the companies had colluded together via bilateral contacts between September 2003 and September 2005, breaching anti-cartel EU rules within the European Economic Area.

The cartel saw the four companies reach a consensus about how to deal with responses to customer requests to lower  smart card chip prices.

The EC revealed that sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct, was shared and discussed between the four companies. Such behaviour was found to have breached Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Joaquin Almunia, vice president in charge of EC competition policy, declared that companies need to focus their efforts on competition in order to deliver the best products at attractive prices. He added: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

In October 2008, the EC started investigations into the  cartel over smart card price fixing,  customer allocation and the exchange of sensitive commercial information. Since then the investigation has been ongoing, with the  EC announcing in June that it was nearing a conclusion to its antitrust case.

The EC had looked at the possibility of settling the case with the companies in order to reach common ground on what constitutes a  cartel. But in 2012, it decided to revert back to its investigation procedures after discussions with the companies failed to progress.

While the four companies were found to have established a  cartel, Renesas received full immunity by whistleblowing to the  European Commission.

Samsung has to pay a  fine of €35m, although it wriggled out of 30 percent of its share of the  fine by co-operating with the EC's investigation. In a statement sent to V3 Samsung said: "We are carefully reviewing the European Commission's decision and have no further comments at this stage."

While Philips got rid of its  smart card chips business after the infringement, it still remains liable for its activity during the period it was involved in the  cartel. It has to pay a  fine of €20m.

Philips told V3 that it does not agree with the EC's conclusion: "We do not agree with the decision by the European Commission as we firmly believe that claims of anti-competitive behavior by the former Philips smart card chips business are unfounded." Philips said it plans to appeal the EC's decision.

The largest  fine was handed to Infineon, at €82.7m. V3 contacted the company but had received no reply at the time of publication.

Qualcomm could also be investigated for exploiting its market position in Europe, and faces monopoly
fines in China.

Microsoft has also incurred the scrutiny of Chinese authorities, which have given the company 20 days to respond to antitrust accusations.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined Philips, Samsung Electronics and Infineon Technologies a total of 138 million euros ($181.28 million) on Wednesday for  fixing  prices of chips used in mobile SIM cards.

The European Commission, which raided the companies in October 2008, said the  cartel took place between 2003 and 2005, with the companies also colluding on customers, production capacity and future market conduct.

TD
Infineon received the biggest penalty at 82.8 million euros. The German chipmaker rejected the EU
finding, saying it would take its case to Europe's second highest court in Luxembourg.
Samsung was fined 35.12 million euros and Philips 20.15 million euros.

Philips, which spun off its former  semiconductor unit into an independent company NXP Semiconductors in 2006, said the EU charge against the unit was unfounded and that it too would challenge the decision in court.

Renesas Technology, a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric that was acquired by Renesas Electronics Corp in 2010, escaped a fine of more than 51 million euros as it was the first to alert the EU competition authority about the cartel.

The chips produced by the companies are also used in bank cards, identity cards, passports and pay TV cards. The companies had sought to settle the case in return for a 10 percent cut in the  fines but talks subsequently broke down.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch electronics and healthcare company Philips denied its former semiconductor division had taken part in a price fixing  cartel, saying on Wednesday that it would appeal against a 20 million euro ($26.4 million) European Commissionfine.

"We firmly believe that claims of anti-competitive behavior by former Philips  smart card chips business are unfounded. As a result, Philips plans to appeal the decision," the company said in a statement. Philips spun off its  semiconductor business into the independent company NXP Semiconductors in 2006.

HD         Europe slaps cartel fine on global chipmakers

Brussels has imposed a €138m cartel fine on groups including Samsung and Philips for rigging the
European market for smart card chips.

The European Commission said on Wednesday that Philips, Samsung, Infineon and Renesas - at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi - illegally colluded for about two years to share information on contracts and prices.

TD
The smart card chips are used in products such as mobile phones, bank cards, passports and pay television cards. Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the products were used by "almost everybody".

He added that "the cartelists knew their conduct was illegal" and in some cases "took measures to conceal the collusion." The  cartel operated between September 2003 and September 2005.

Germany's Infineon was  fined €82m, Philips €20m, and Samsung €35m. Renesas won immunity from the penalty after revealing the existence of the  cartel. The fines followed a failed attempt to settle the case with some of the companies involved.

Infineon rejected the charges as "unfounded" and said it was prepared to appeal against the decision. Philips, which spun off its former  semiconductor unit in 2006, will also lodge an appeal. Samsung, the world's biggest chipmaker, is reviewing the decision.

Investigators believe the collusion was triggered by a price war between two big customers in the sector. Mr Almunia said the companies involved in the  cartel exchanged "sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity and their future market conduct".

HD      European Commission Fines Smart Card Chips Producers EUR138 Million  For Cartel
WC    486 words
PD     3 September 2014

(RTTNews) - The  European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR138048000 after finding that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas coordinated their market behaviour for  smart card chips in the European Economic Area (EEA), in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels.

The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September 2005, the Commission said on Wednesday. Renesas, at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi, benefited from full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.

TD
EU Commissioner for competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "In this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports. It is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices. If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions".

Smart card chips are used in mobile telephone SIM cards, bank cards, identity cards and passports, pay TV cards, and various other applications. Those used in the SIM segment rely mainly on memory, for example to store telephone numbers, while the  smart card chips used in other applications also rely on security devices like cryptography in order to ensure data confidentiality.

The companies involved in the  cartel colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct. Collusion of this type breaches Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), which prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices.

The Commission had initially explored the possibility of settling this case with some of the companies involved under the Commission's 2008 Settlement Notice. However, in 2012 the Commission decided to discontinue the settlement discussions and to revert to the normal procedure because of the clear lack of progress of these discussions.

Under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice, Renesas and its joint venture parent companies - Hitachi and Mitsubishi -- received full immunity, as it was the first to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the Commission, avoiding a  fine of more than EUR51 million for its participation in the infringement.
Samsung received a reduction of 30 percent of its  fine for cooperating with the investigation.

Philips has divested its  smart card chips business after the infringement, but remains liable for what happened during the period of the infringement.

BRUSSELS, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission has finedInfineon, Philips and Samsung more than 138 million euros (181 million U.S. dollars) for their coordinated market behaviour for  smart card chips to form a cartel, an official statement said on Wednesday.
"The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September
2003 and September 2005," the statement said.

TD
The German company Infineon was  fined 82.78 million euros, the Dutch firm Philips 20.14 million euros and the South Korean Samsung 35.11 million euros, with Samsung receiving a reduction of 30 percent of its fine for cooperating with the investigation.

The Japanese company Renesas (at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitshubishi) was also involved in the case, but the statement said Renesas avoided the fine of more than 51 million euros for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the European Commission.

"The companies involved in the  cartel colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices," the Commission said.

The Commission added, "They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilization and their future market conduct."

Smart card chips are used in mobile telephone SIM cards, bank cards, identity cards and passports, pay TV cards, and various other applications.

The commission said any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behavior as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages.

The Commission started the investigation in 2008 with unannounced inspections. After the settlement discussions were discontinued in 2012, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections in 2013, giving the companies the opportunity to comment and to be heard before taking the decision.

The Commission said more information will be available once confidentiality issues have been dealt with.

BRUSSELS—European Union regulators issued  fines totaling €138 million ($181 million) against Infineon Technologies AG, Royal Philips NV and Samsung Group on Wednesday for  fixing  the price of smart card chips.

The European Commission, the region's central antitrust authority, said the companies had "exchanged sensitive commercial information" on pricing, customers, contract negotiations and production between September 2003 and September 2005.  Smart card chips are used in mobile phones, bank cards, passports and other applications.

TD
The fines add to more than €1.4 billion in penalties that EU regulators have imposed for  cartel
violations in the first six months of the year.

"In this digital era,  smart card chips are used by almost everybody," the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement. "If…companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon, which will bear the lion's share of the  fine, or €82.8 million, said it would appeal the decision.

"Infineon rejects the allegations as unfounded…[and] believes that its procedural rights were violated by the European Commission," the company said in a statement.
A spokesman for Philips, which was  fined €20 million, said the company plans to appeal the decision. Samsung received a 30% reduction to its  fine for cooperating with the investigation and will pay €35
million. The company couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

A fourth company, Renesas Technology Corp. of Japan, escaped a  fine because it revealed the existence of the  cartel, the commission said.

In June, a record €1.06 billion  fine imposed by EU regulators against U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market was upheld by the EU's second highest court. Intel is appealing the decision at the EU's top court in Luxembourg.

The European Union has  finedInfineon, Philips and Samsung €138m for forming a  smartcard chip
cartel in Europe in its latest competition case against technology firms.

The German, Dutch and South Korean firms "colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September 2005," the  European Commission said in a statement.

TD
Japan's Renesas was granted immunity for revealing the  cartel's existence.

Infineon was  fined €82.7m, Philips €20.1m, and Samsung €35.1m, with the latter having its penalty reduced by 30% for having cooperated with investigators.

The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Mr Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

Infineon Technologies AG was  fined 82.7 million euros, Philips 20.1 million euros, and Samsung 35.1 million euros by the European Union.

The European UnionfinedInfineon, Philips and Samsung a total of 138 million euros (181 million dollars) on Wednesday for  fixing  the prices of  smartcard chips, in its latest anti-trust case against technology firms.

TD
The German, Dutch and South Korean companies "colluded" between 2003 and 2005 to fix prices on the chips, which are widely used in mobile phones, bank cards and passports, the  European              Commission said in a statement.

Japan’s Renesas was granted immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the commission, which began its investigation in 2008 with raids on the companies.

Infineon Technologies AG was  fined 82.7 million euros, Philips 20.1 million euros, and Samsung 35.1 million euros, with the latter having its penalty reduced by 30 percent for having cooperated with investigators.

Rejecting the allegations as "unfounded," Infineon said it will review the decision and is "ready to appeal" at the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg.

The companies "in our view knew that their conduct was illegal," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission’s vice president in charge of competition policy.

They "discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct," the commission said.

Almunia added that "in this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports."

Companies producing them should be focused on being competitive, he said, adding: "If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

The commission said that Renesas and its joint-venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsbubishi had avoided a fine of more than 51 million euros because it was the first to reveal the existence of the cartel to the EU.

It said that Philips "remains liable for what happened during the period of infringement" even though it has since divested its  smart card chips business.

Anyone harmed by the  cartel may seek damages before the courts of the European member states, the commission said.

Infineon said from its base in Neubiberg, Germany that it had conducted its own thorough probe and "concluded that none of its personnel acted improperly in handling competitively sensitive information" about smartcard chips.

The EU has previously  fined US computer chip giant Intel 1.06 billion euros for abusing its dominant market position.

Earlier this year Google and the Commission agreed a deal over accusations the world’s largest search engine was squeezing out competitors in Europe’s search market, so avoiding legal action and potentially billions in  fines.

Brussels launched its investigation of Google in November 2010 following a complaint by several companies, including Microsoft.

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators issued  fines totaling EUR138 million ($181 million) against Infineon Technologies AG, Royal Philips NV and Samsung Group on Wednesday for  fixing  the price of smart card chips.

The European Commission, the region's central antitrust authority, said the companies had "exchanged sensitive commercial information" on pricing, customers, contract negotiations and production between September 2003 and September 2005.  Smart card chips are used in mobile phones, bank cards, passports and other applications.

TD
The fines add to more than EUR1.4 billion in penalties that EU regulators have imposed for  cartel
violations in the first six months of the year.

"In this digital era,  smart card chips are used by almost everybody," the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement. "If...companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions."

Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon, which will bear the lion's share of the  fine, or EUR82.8 million, said it would appeal the decision.

"Infineon rejects the allegations as unfounded...[and] believes that its procedural rights were violated by the European Commission," the company said in a statement.

A spokesman for Philips, which was  fined EUR20 million, said the company plans to appeal the decision.

Samsung received a 30% reduction to its  fine for cooperating with the investigation and will pay EUR35 million. The company couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

A fourth company, Renesas Technology Corp. of Japan, escaped a  fine because it revealed the existence of the  cartel, the commission said.

In June, a record EUR1.06 billion  fine imposed by EU regulators against U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market was upheld by the EU's second highest court. Intel is appealing the decision at the EU's top court in Luxembourg.

Infineon slapped with 82.8 mln eur  fine (Il Sole 24 Ore Radiocor) - Brussels , 03 Sep - The  European   Commission said it has found that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas (at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi) coordinated their market behaviour for  smart card chips in the European Economic Area (EEA) in the period from September 2003 to September 2005 in violation of European Union rules prohibiting cartels.

TD
The commission said the companies colluded through bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct.

German firm Infineon was slapped with the largest fine, or 82.8 million euros, while Renesas benefitted from full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to the commission. South Korea's Samsung was fined 35.1 million euros, benefiting from a 30% reduction in its fine for cooperating with the investigation. Philips of the Netherlands, which divested its smart card chips business after the infringement, nonetheless remained liable for the infringement and was fined 20.1 million euros.
"In this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones,
bank cards or passports," said Joaquin Almunia, the commissioner responsible for competition policy." It
is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors
by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices. If instead companies choose
to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions".

HD     Regulators fine electronic giants £110m for price fixing

LP
European Union antitrust regulators  fined Philips, Samsung Electronics and Infineon Technologies a total of 138 million euros (£110m) yesterday for  fixing  prices of chips used in mobile SIM cards.

The European Commission, which raided the companies in October 2008, said the  cartel took place between 2003 and 2005, with the companies also colluding on customers, production capacity and future market conduct.

TD
Infineon received the biggest penalty at 82.8 million euros.

The German chipmaker rejected the EU finding, saying it would take its case to Europe's second highest court in Luxembourg.
Samsung was fined 35.12 million euros and Philips 20.15 million euros.

Philips, which spun off its former  semiconductor unit into an independent company NXP Semiconductors in 2006, said the EU charge against the unit was unfounded and that it too would challenge the decision in court.

Renesas Technology, a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric that was acquired by Renesas Electronics Corp in 2010, escaped a  fine of more than 51 million euros as it was the first to alert the EU competition authority about the  cartel.
The chips produced by the companies are also used in bank cards, identity cards, passports and pay TV
cards.

The companies had sought to settle the case in return for a 10 per cent cut in the  fines but talks subsequently broke down.

Infineon said it would appeal against the price-fixing fine imposed by the European Commission and was prepared to take the matter to court.
"Infineon rejects the allegations as unfounded," Infineon said in a statement yester- day.
"Infineon will review the decision very closely and is ready to appeal at the General Court of the European
Union in Luxembourg," it added.

LP
The European Commission has imposed a €138 million cartel fine on groups including Samsung and Philips for rigging the European market for smart card chips.

The commission said Philips, Samsung, Infineon and Renesas - at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi - illegally colluded for about two years to share information on contracts and prices.

TD
The smart card chips are used in products such as mobile phones, bank cards, passports and pay television cards. Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the products were used by "almost everybody". He added that "the cartelists knew their conduct was illegal" and in some cases "took measures to conceal the collusion". The  cartel operated between September 2003 and September 2005.
Failure to settle

Germany's Infineon was  fined €82 million, Philips €20 million, and Samsung €35 million. Renesas won immunity from the penalty after revealing the existence of the  cartel. The fines followed a failed attempt to settle the case with some of the companies involved.

Infineon rejected the charges as "unfounded" and said it was prepared to appeal against the decision. Philips, which spun off its former  semiconductor unit in 2006, will also lodge an appeal. Samsung,
the world's biggest chipmaker, is reviewing the decision.

Mr Almunia said the companies involved in the  cartel exchanged "sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity and their future market conduct".

Penalties of E138m levied

SAMSUNG Electronics, Royal Philips and Infineon Technologies have been  fined a total of e138 million (R1.9 billion) by the EU for  fixing  the price of  chips used in cellphones and bank cards.

TD
Samsung, the largest smartphone maker, will have to pay e35.1m, while Philips was told to pay e20.1m. Infineon received the largest penalty at e82.8m.

The companies "colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices", the  European Commission said yesterday. Some of the firms "took measures to conceal the collusion", Joaquin Almunia said.

The EU competition chief, whose term is due to end in less than two months, increased his tally of price-fixing fines to e1.58bn for this year.
Philips nearly escaped a penalty as the 10-year deadline on penalties for antitrust violations ran until
September 9, a person familiar with the case said in June.
Renesas Technology will avoid an EU punishment because it revealed the  smart-card chip cartel. The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September
2003 and September 2005, the commission said. They discussed and exchanged sensitive
commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity
utilisation and their future market conduct, the regulator said.
Philips shares gained 0.9 percent by 1.04pm in Amsterdam. Infineon shares were up 0.9 percent in
Frankfurt.

Philips planned to appeal the decision, which it considered "unfounded", spokesman Steve Klink said yesterday. Samsung was "reviewing" the decision, said Rhee So-eui, a spokeswoman for the South Korean company.

Infineon declined to comment ahead of the decision. Representatives for Renesas did not immediately respond to requests for comment ahead of the decision.

Infineon and Samsung were among nine chip makers that agreed to pay a total of e331m four years ago for fixing  prices for dynamic random access memory  chips for personal computers and servers.

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, got the EU's biggest-ever  fine of e1.06bn in 2009 for squeezing its nearest rival Advanced Micro Devices. The US-based company is challenging the EU decision at the EU's top court. - Bloomberg

Penalties of E138m levied

SAMSUNG Electronics, Royal Philips and Infineon Technologies have been  fined a total of e138 million (R1.9 billion) by the EU for  fixing  the price of  chips used in cellphones and bank cards.

TD
Samsung, the largest smartphone maker, will have to pay e35.1m, while Philips was told to pay e20.1m. Infineon received the largest penalty at e82.8m.

The companies "colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices", the  European Commission said yesterday. Some of the firms "took measures to conceal the collusion", Joaquin Almunia said.

The EU competition chief, whose term is due to end in less than two months, increased his tally of price-fixing fines to e1.58bn for this year.
Philips nearly escaped a penalty as the 10-year deadline on penalties for antitrust violations ran until
September 9, a person familiar with the case said in June.
Renesas Technology will avoid an EU punishment because it revealed the  smart-card chip cartel. The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September
2003 and September 2005, the commission said. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial
information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and
their future market conduct, the regulator said.
Philips shares gained 0.9 percent by 1.04pm in Amsterdam. Infineon shares were up 0.9 percent in
Frankfurt.

Philips planned to appeal the decision, which it considered "unfounded", spokesman Steve Klink said yesterday. Samsung was "reviewing" the decision, said Rhee So-eui, a spokeswoman for the South Korean company.

Infineon declined to comment ahead of the decision. Representatives for Renesas did not immediately respond to requests for comment ahead of the decision.

Infineon and Samsung were among nine chip makers that agreed to pay a total of e331m four years ago for fixing  prices for dynamic random access memory  chips for personal computers and servers.

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, got the EU's biggest-ever  fine of e1.06bn in 2009 for squeezing its nearest rival Advanced Micro Devices. The US-based company is challenging the EU decision at the EU's top court. - Bloomberg

The European Commission has found that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas coordinated their market behaviour for smart card chips, in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels. The Commission imposed fines totaling EUR 138 million on three of the companies, while Renesas benefited from immunity after it revealed the  cartel to the EC. An earlier attempt at a settlement with the companies proved unsuccessful.

According to the Commission, the companies colluded through bilateral contacts in the period September 2003 to September 2005, when they discussed respective responses to customer requests to lower prices. The  smart card chips are used in SIM cards, bank cards, identity cards and
passports, pay TV cards, and various other applications. Infineon received the largest  fine of EUR
82.8 million, and Philips will pay EUR 20.1 million. Samsung received a 30 percent reduction for
cooperating, putting its  fine at EUR 35.2 million.

Good morning. When faced with the prospect of a hostile takeover from Pfizer Inc. that would've been structured as a tax inversion, the U.K.'s AstraZeneca PLC recruited one of the most powerful allies possible: the White House. With the help of advisers close to the Obama administration, who told the senior administration officials that the government should do something to stop American companies from relocating abroad for better tax treatment, Astra managed to run out the clock on Pfizer's offer.

TD
Previously undisclosed calls were made in May to White House officials by Thomas Nides of Morgan Stanley and Roger Altman of Evercore Partners, at Astra's behest. And while Pfizer's bid faltered for more than one reason, that pressure over inversions was among them.

So Astra succeeded in evading Pfizer's grasp, but now all U.S. companies may face a tougher road ahead if they consider foreign domiciles. Mr. Obama went from a mostly quiet objector to angrily questioning the patriotism of companies who employ the tactic, and his administration is still at work drafting policies to diminish the tax benefits of inversions.
THE DAY AHEAD
The ADP national employment report releases at 8:15 a.m., and the consensus estimate is for a
private-payroll gain in August of 223,000, besting July's 218,000. Jobless claims for the week of Aug. 30
will add to the employment picture at 8:30 a.m., and analysts forecast 300,000, nearly flat from the prior
week's 298,000. At 10 a.m. we'll get a survey of nonmanufacturing activity in August, and market
watchers are expecting a reading of 57.5, down from July's recovery best of 58.7.

Mattress Firm Holding Corp. reports fiscal second-quarter results Thursday, and consensus forecast is for 41 cents a share, roughly flat compared with the previous year. However, results this time will be burdened by the costs of recent acquisitions--without those, earnings are expected to climb 40% to 60 cents a share.
CORPORATE NEWS

Goldman named to key role in Alibaba IPO. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. landed a coveted role in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s upcoming initial public offering as the bank in charge of overseeing the deal's early share trading. The role, known as "stabilization agent," was sought by banks currently working on the IPO because of the prestige and potential additional fees and trading commissions that could be generated from overseeing the trading.

Call for tax breaks for U.K. tech groups. The former chief executive of Tech City UK, a group created by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron to foster London's technology industry, has called on ministers to introduce new corporate tax breaks to help startups grow into world-class technology firms, the Financial Times reports. Eric van der Kleij, who held the CEO job for 18 months starting in 2011, said corporations

and investment groups should receive tax relief when involved in "growth" funding rounds that involve raising millions of pounds.

In television deals, NFL plays by its own rules. The National Football League now has huge leverage over television networks, which are increasingly looking to it to help fortify them against the rise of online video services and other threats. Power amassed by the NFL has emboldened the league to carve up new rights to games over and over in different ways. At the same time, NFL officials are launching or expanding numerous online efforts that could undercut traditional TV viewing.

New cancer drugs offer hope, at a steep cost. The first of a promising new class of cancer drugs went on sale in Japan this week at an average annual cost of $143,000 a patient, a harbinger of hefty prices the new drugs are expected to command in the U.S. and Europe. The drug Opdivo, from Ono
Pharmaceutical Co. and Bristole-Myers Squibb Co. harnesses the body's immune system to fight tumors, including melanoma. High prices come as concerns mount about the affordability of new drugs.

Michael Bloomberg returning to run Bloomberg LP. Less than a year after leaving office as mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg will return as head of the Bloomberg LP, the media and data information company he founded in 1981 and in which he still owns an 88% stake. The move reverses Mr. Bloomberg's stated intention not to take the job when his mayoral stint was finished.
Google, AbbVie announce research partnership . Biopharmaceutical giant

AbbVie Inc. and   Calico, a life-sciences company funded by Google Inc., will pour up to $1.5 billion into developing treatments for age-related diseases. The agreement will help Calico build a research-and-development center in the San Francisco Bay Area to tackle diseases like neurodegeneration and cancer.
Brazil's sugar sector goes on a diet. Brazil's sugar industry is slimming down, a shift that producers hope
will deliver them from a yearslong glut that has depressed prices. The moves follow an ill-fated
expansion, and the effects have yet to hit the marketplace, where prices are near their lowest in more
than six months.

ITG plans dark pool for bonds. Brokerage Investment Technology Group Inc. is opening an alternative trading venue for bonds in an effort to tap demand from investors to trade more cheaply and through electronic networks. Similar efforts by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc. have faltered, but ITG is betting it can leverage its track record in stock trading and technology to make inroads in credit markets.

Foreigners get greater access to China shares. Overseas money managers in October will be able to buy Chinese companies listed in Shanghai via Hong Kong's stock exchange. Investors have poured money into funds that track these so-called A-shares in anticipation. A new surge of foreign cash could breathe new life into a market that has lost more than 60% of its value since 2007, even as the S&P 500 and
other global indexes have hit record highs.

Monsanto's new GMO defender. After selling his tech startup to Monsanto Co., David Friedberg has emerged as a champion of the company in Silicon Valley at a time when the genetically engineered crops that Monsanto pioneered face intensifying attacks. State ballot initiatives have sought to compel companies to label foods containing genetically modified organisms, which the industry fears would be a scarlet letter.

Home Depot hires security firms. Home Depot Inc. hired security firms Symantec Corp. and Fishnet Security to investigate a potential data breach, and took steps to reassure customers through its website and social-media accounts. It still hasn't determined whether a breach actually occurred, but it advised customers to closely monitor their accounts and contact their card issuers if they notice unusual activity.

Small firms poised to spend more on plants, equipment. There are signs that small businesses are moving from slashing costs to spending more on new plants and equipment. Among small private firms,
51% said they planned to increase capital outlays in the next 12 months.
REGULATION

Agencies flooded by comments on new rules. Record numbers of online comments are flooding agencies at a time when Congress is stuck in gridlock and the Obama administration has turned to executive actions to achieve its policy objectives on matters including the Keystone XL oil pipeline, net neutrality
and emissions rules for power plants.

Regulators unveil revised swaps-margin rule. U.S. banking regulators said they couldn't formally exempt companies and other commercial "end users" from a rule requiring certain derivatives trades be backed by cash or other collateral. Large U.S. corporations balked at the initial version for requiring swaps
Page 82 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
dealers to require margin from them in certain cases. Agency officials said they don't expect the requirement to change how banks currently treat the end users.

Bank liquidity rule is adjusted. U.S. regulators provided some relief to large U.S. banks with adjustments to a new rule designed to ensure firms don't run out of cash in a crisis. The rule will require more than 30 of the biggest U.S. banks to add a combined $100 billion more in cash or cash-like assets than they currently hold, though banks were previously expected to have to raise about $200 billion to meet the rule.

EU slaps cartel fine on global chipmakers. The  European Commission imposed a 138 million euro fine on groups including Samsung Electronics Co. and Philips for rigging the European market for smart card chips, the Financial Times reports. The  chips are used in products such as mobile phones, bank cards, passports and pay television cards.

Tech firms resume talks with workers in hiring lawsuit. Apple Inc., Google, Intel Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. have resumed mediation talks with tech workers in the lawsuit over hiring practices in Silicon Valley, Reuters reports. A district court judge last month rejected a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the class-action case, saying it was too low.

Wellness programs hurt by rules, some CEOs say. Large companies are chafing at federal requirements for programs that reward or penalize employees based on whether they meet health goals. The
programs must provide a reasonable, alternative standard for those who don't meet a specific health goal. Some employers say that may open programs to abuse and can be unfair to employees who do meet the health goals.

Brokers back away from ETF adviser. Three large brokerage firms are distancing themselves from money manager F-Squared Investments Inc., amid regulatory scrutiny of whether the firm overstated its track record. RBC Wealth Management and Raymond James Financial Inc. have set limits on how much new business its advisers can conduct with F-Squared, and Wells Fargo Advisers has put the firm on "watch."

Fed survey: Economic outlook brightened. Economic activity largely picked up during the summer after hitting a soft patch at the start of the year, though the Federal Reserve's latest survey of regional conditions showed few signs of pressure on wages. The "beige book" survey was the third-straight report in which all of the Fed's district banks reported either modest, moderate or improving economic growth.

Eurozone private sector slowed sharply in August. Activity in the eurozone's private sector slowed more sharply than first estimated in August, and declined in both France and Italy, indicating that the currency area is unlikely to soon escape a lengthening period of low or no growth.

HD     Europa- Antitrust: Commission fines smart card chips producers EUR 138 million for cartel
WC    915 words

Release date - 03092014

The European Commission has found that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas (at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitshubishi) coordinated their market behaviour for  smart card chips in the European Economic Area (EEA), in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels.

TD
The Commission has imposed  fines totalling EUR 138 048 000. The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September 2005. Renesas benefitted from full immunity under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: ‘In this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports. It is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices. If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions’.

Smart card chips are used in mobile telephone SIM cards, bank cards, identity cards and passports, pay TV cards, and various other applications. Those used in the SIM segment rely mainly on memory, for example to store telephone numbers, while the  smart card chips used in other applications also rely on security devices like cryptography in order to ensure data confidentiality.

The companies involved in the  cartel colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers’ requests to lower prices. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct. Collusion of this type breaches Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), which prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices.

The Commission had initially explored the possibility of settling this case with some of the companies involved under the Commission’s 2008 Settlement Notice. However, in 2012 the Commission decided to discontinue the settlement discussions and to revert to the normal procedure because of the clear lack of progress of these discussions.

Fines

The fines were set on the basis of the Commission’s 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256) taking into account the serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope (i.e. the entire EEA) and the duration of each company’s participation in the infringement.

Under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice, Renesas (and its joint venture parent companies Hitachi and Mitsubishi) received full immunity, as it was the first to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the Commission, avoiding a  fine of more than EUR 51 million for its participation in the infringement.
Samsung received a reduction of 30% of its  fine for cooperating with the investigation.

Philips has divested its  smart card chips business after the infringement, but remains liable for what happened during the period of the infringement.

Background

The Commission started this investigation in 2008 with unannounced inspections (see MEMO/09/1). After the settlement discussions were discontinued in 2012, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections in 2013 (see IP/13/346), giving the companies the opportunity to comment and to be heard before taking today’s decision.

More information on this case will be available under the case number 39574 in the Commission’s public case register on the competition website, once confidentiality issues have been dealt with. For more information on the Commission’s action against cartels, see its cartels website.
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Antitrust Regulation (Council Regulation 1/2003) both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission  fine.

In June 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive that aims at making it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to obtain such damages (see IP/14/455, IP/13/525 and MEMO/13/531). More information on antitrust damages actions, including a practical guide on how to quantify the harm typically caused by antitrust infringements, the public consultation and a citizens’ summary, is available at:

Good morning. Corporate boards are focusing more closely on cybersecurity, following news of a possible breach at Home Depot Inc.

TD

and the massive security lapse at
Target Corp.   "Target and now Home Depot are both seminal moments," John
Stewart, chief information security officer at  Cisco Systems Inc., tells CIO Journal. He expects that boards will become more sophisticated in their
oversight of cybersecurity--and that chief information security officers must be able to communicate effectively with directors. "CISOs will no longer be
able to resort to speaking jargon to make the questions go away," he said. Meanwhile , Home Depot hired security firms Symantec Corp. and Fishnet Security to investigate the potential data breach. Home Depot took steps to reassure customers through its website and
social-media accounts. It still hasn't determined whether a breach actually occurred, but advised customers to closely monitor their accounts and contact their card issuers if they notice unusual activity.

SAP's tennis tool may enhance coaching, increase player longevity. Analytic capabilities are catching up with the ever-increasing amount of data being collected about professional athletes. Jenni Lewis, head
of tennis technology at SAP SE, tells CIO Journal that the ability to integrate that information is giving coaches the context they need to better advise their players in real time. Through its partnership with the Women's Tennis Association, the German software giant is expanding those capabilities as it provides coaches and players with point-by-point analysis. Knowing when players serve aces, for example, gives coaches "a little bit more insight into when their players are taking a risk and when they're not," Ms.
Lewis says.

Salesforce.com is platform for apps for wearable devices. Salesforce.com Inc. says that Wear, its platform for building business apps for smart glasses and other wearable devices, is drawing attention from software makers. In the nearly three months since the platform's debut, seven companies have used the software to build health care, facial recognition, field service and other apps, Daniel Debow, Salesforce.com's senior vice president of emerging technologies, tells CIO Journal.

China to limit foreign-TV streaming. China is set to impose a limit on the number of foreign television shows that Chinese online video-streaming services can offer, in its latest effort to control foreign-media content, according to the WSJ. Regulators could require that foreign TV shows eventually make up no more than 30% of TV content on Chinese video-streaming sites. Currently, foreign shows make up more than half of the TV content of popular sites such as those run by Youku Tudou Inc. and Sohu.com Inc.

Call for tax breaks for U.K. tech groups. The former chief executive of Tech City UK, a group created by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron to foster London's technology industry, has called on ministers to introduce new corporate tax breaks to help start-ups grow into world-class technology firms, the Financial Times reports. Eric van der Kleij, who held the CEO job for 18 months starting in 2011, said corporations and investment groups should receive tax relief when involved in "growth" funding rounds that involve raising millions of pounds.

EU slaps cartel fine on global chipmakers.

Nokia plans to unfurl a new mobile map app.   Nokia Corp. said it will release free map apps that do not require an Internet connection. The apps will run on  Google Inc. Android and  Apple Inc. iOS platforms, the WSJ's Sven Grundberg reports. The announcement comes as Nokia's maps are no longer tied to the fate of the company's shrinking and unprofitable
handset business, which was transferred to   Microsoft Corp.
LinkedIn considers China censorship changes. The WSJ reports that the business social network is considering changing a policy that censors content posted from within China that does not meet the country's strict guidelines.

Fed survey: Economic outlook brightened. Economic activity largely picked up during the summer after hitting a soft patch at the start of the year, though the Federal Reserve's latest survey of regional conditions showed few signs of pressure on wages. The "beige book" survey was the third-straight report in which all of the Fed's district banks reported either modest, moderate or improving economic growth, the WSJ reports.

Eurozone private sector slowed sharply in August. Activity in the eurozone's private sector slowed more sharply than first estimated in August, and declined in both France and Italy, indicating that the currency area is unlikely to soon escape a lengthening period of low or no growth, the WSJ reports.

Brussels, 03/09/2014 (Agence Europe) - Three manufacturers, Philips, Samsung and Infineon, have been fined a little over €138 million for a  cartel between 2003 and 2005 on the smart chip markets in the European Economic Area, announced the  European Commission on Wednesday 3 September.  Smart  card chips are used in mobile telephone SIM cards, bank cards, identity cards and passports, pay TV cards, and various other applications.
Despite its involvement in the  cartel, Renesas (at the time a joint venture between Hitachi and Mitsubishi)
has been granted immunity for revealing the  cartel's existence.

After three years of investigation and an unsuccessful attempt to reach an arrangement, the Commission has decided to fineInfineon (of Germany) over €82 million, Philips (of the Netherlands) more than €20 million and Samsung (of South Korea) more than €35 million. Samsung's  fine was reduced from over €51 million because it cooperated with the investigation, leading to a 30% reduction in its  fine.
Philips and Infineon are planning to appeal against the decision.

The Commission's investigation found that the companies colluded through a network of bilateral contacts between September 2003 and September 2005 in order to determine their responses to customers' requests to lower prices. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market conduct.

The Commission had initially explored the possibility of settling this case with some of the companies involved, which would have led to reduced  fines, but after months of negotiations, the Commission decided to put an end to talks because of clear lack of progress. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “In this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports. It is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices.” (EL)

The European Commission has found that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas (at the time a joint venture of Hitachi and Mitshubishi) coordinated their market behaviour for  smart card chips in the European Economic Area (EEA), in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels.

Renesas, which was a joint venture between Hitachi and Mitshubishi at that time, benefited from full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.
Samsung received a 30 percent reduction of its  fine for cooperating with the investigation and has to pay
35.12 million euros.

Philips has divested its  smart card chips business after the infringement, but is liable for what happened during the period of the infringement. The company has been  fined 20.15 million euros.
Infineon is to pay the most among the firms as  fine - 82.78 million euros.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "In this digital era smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports. It is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices."

If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions, Almunia added.

Infineon rose 0.8 percent to close at 8.98 euros in Frankfurt, while Philips also gathered 0.8 percent to close at 30.67 euros in Amsterdam.

Samsung Electronics must pay a 46.5 billion won (US$45.4 million)  fine in Europe for price  fixing.

According to the AFP on Sept. 3, the E.U. levied  fines worth €138 million (US$178 million) on companies involved in fixing  the price of  chips in smartphones and bank cards. Those companies include Philips with €20.1 million (US$26.0 million), Samsung with €35.1 million (US$45.4 million), and Infineon Technologies with the largest  fine of €82.8 million (US$107 million).

TD
It was ruled that these three firms exchanged information related to chip prices and discussed prices from Sept. 2003 to Sept. 2005.

In a statement, the  European Commission said, "These companies fixed the price through bilateral contacts." Renesas Electronics, which also participated in price-fixing,  was exempt from paying  fines by exposing the collusion. Samsung cooperated with the E.U. in the investigation, and its  fines were reduced by 30 percent as a result.

Release date - 03092014

Neubiberg, Germany -Today, the European Commission adopted a decision in its antitrust investigation against four  semiconductor companies active in the smart card industry including Infineon
Technologies AG (FSE: IFX / OTCQX: IFNNY).

TD
The European Commission believes that the companies involved infringed European antitrust rules through the alleged sporadic exchange of competitively sensitive information. The  fine for Infineon is Euro
82.8 million, while the total  fine was set at Euro 138 million.

Infineon rejects the allegations as unfounded. Further, Infineon believes that its procedural rights were violated by the  European Commission. Therefore, Infineon will review the decision very closely and is ready to appeal at the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg.

As is typical in such antitrust proceedings, the  fine is apportioned according to the revenue of each of the affected companies during the relevant timeframe. Consequently, Infineon was attributed the greatest portion of the total  fine, simply because of its higher share in the European market for  smart card chips  in the relevant period between September 2003 to March 2005.
About the case

The investigation of the  European Commission began in 2008. When the allegations were raised, Infineon conducted a thorough investigation and concluded that none of its personnel acted improperly in handling competitively sensitive information regarding  smart card chips. Since that time, Infineon has been presented with no credible evidence contrary to that conclusion.

In 2011, the European Commission initiated settlement discussions with the three other  semiconductor companies. The European Commission invites companies to discuss settlement only if it believes they were part of a cartel. Infineon was not invited to the settlement talks. The settlement discussions ended unsuccessfully in 2012, and the  European Commission surprisingly resumed the proceedings against Infineon in April 2013.

HD    ID card chip makers Infineon,  Philips,  Samsung fined by EU Commission

Wondering why only selected few  semiconductor vendors dominating the security id chip market? The leading companies in this market must be having best technologies, but there is also another factor. Well, European commission finds a group of ID card semiconductor vendors co-ordinated their market behaviour, kind of a cartel. The companies found by European Commission includes leading industrial and power semiconductor maker Infineon, Philips (which has divested its semiconductor business into another company named NXP Semiconductors), world's 2nd ranked semiconductor vendor Samsung and world's top microcontroller chip vendor Renesas. The EU said these companies coordinated their market behaviour for smart card chips in the European Economic Area (EEA), in breach of EU rules that prohibit cartels. The total fine imposed on these companies is 138 048 000.

TD
The release from  EU Commission says The companies colluded through bilateral contacts that took place in the period between September 2003 and September 2005. However Renesas is saved from fining for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. In this digital era  smart card chips are used by almost everybody, whether in their mobile phones, bank cards or passports. It is crucial that the companies producing them focus their efforts on how to outperform their competitors by innovating and providing the best products at the most attractive prices. If instead companies choose to collude, at the expense of both customers and end consumers, they should expect sanctions said Joaquín Almunia,
Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy. The companies involved in the  cartel colluded through a network of bilateral contacts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices. They discussed and exchanged sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiations, production capacity or capacity utilisation and their future market
conduct. Collusion of this type breaches Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), which prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. , stated in the release. The Commission said it had initially explored the possibility of settling this case with some of the companies involved under the Commission's
2008 Settlement Notice. However, in 2012 the Commission decided to discontinue the settlement discussions and to revert to the normal procedure because of the clear lack of progress of these discussions. Security ID IC  chips are used in SIMs, smart cards, id cards, passports, e-tickets, and many such id storing devices, which are basically low power consuming tiny sized very thin microcontroller IC chips. The market for these  chips is huge and is estimated to be growing at double digit.

Section: General News - 10 September 2014
Ladies and Gentlemen,

TD
I want to thank Sharis Pozen and Larry Center for inviting me again to share my views with such a distinguished audience, which this year includes William Baer and Edith Ramirez. I look forward to the conversation Sharis and I will have after this presentation.

This is the last time I am speaking to you as European Commissioner for Competition. So, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to take stock of the work done over the past five years, of the challenges facing competition authorities, and of how we in the EU have used and developed the instruments to tackle them.
Effectiveness, due process, and independence

Let me start with a general comment on my perspective on the fundamental role of competition authorities, looking back at my experience during these years.

There's no such thing as an ideal world where all economic actors see the advantage of open markets and competition on the merits, and where there is no need for efficient and independent systems of competition enforcement.

That world does not exist. We know that the reality is very different: competition authorities and courts are needed to preserve open and competitive markets.

Whatever the system put in place in each jurisdiction, one of the main challenges is to find the right balance between its ability to prevent and sanction anticompetitive practices in the public interest and the respect of due process, which is not only essential to ensure that sound and impartial decisions are taken, but is also inherent in our democracies.

Based on these principles, we have in the EU and in most EU Member States administrative systems whereby public authorities - namely the European Commission and the National Competition authorities
- take decisions, sometimes imposing fines or legally binding commitments, which can then be appealed before the relevant Courts.

While I have a lot of respect for other systems stemming from different traditions, my own experience tells me that the EU system delivers effective and independent enforcement and guarantees due process. The system, anchored in the rule of law, secures the respect of the rights of parties at all stages of the procedure and ensures a high standard of fairness and impartiality.

I remember that, at the beginning of my mandate, when the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty implied the increased relevance of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in the case-law of the EU Court of Justice, some stakeholders were questioning whether administrative competition enforcement systems - and in particular the combination of investigation and decisions in the same body - were in themselves compatible with fundamental rights.



Page 98 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
During these years this issue has been raised before the European Court of Human Rights and the EU Court of Justice. We now have a string of very recent case law confirming that the EU institutional framework complies with fundamental rights requirements.

By the way, contrary to some opinions I've heard, the European Court of Justice also provide a thorough review of our cartel and antitrust decisions, including the amount of the  fines imposed.

Over and above these requirements, the Commission has, on my initiative, taken a range of measures early on to enhance openness and transparency in the relationships between companies and DG Competition during the proceedings.

In 2011 we approved new antitrust best practices to give parties more opportunities to interact with DG Competition and to explain their arguments at an early stage. We have also strengthened the role of the Hearing Officers, who are the guardians of the parties' procedural rights and report to me and to the College of Commissioners before we adopt decisions.

Of course, at the same time we must make sure that our procedural safeguards are not abused and our investigations remain efficient.

Beyond the fundamental rights of defence companies are entitled to, competition authorities must strive to keep their enforcement and policies clear and predictable - whatever the systems' architectures.

Preventing unnecessary delays will be a challenge for the future - of course, without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Another important issue is to guarantee that there is no discrimination between companies regardless of their national origin.
And we must aim at providing the best possible guidance to facilitate compliance among businesses.

To this end, since the beginning of my mandate I introduced new antitrust rules and guidelines to cover a number of issues such as distribution, standards, exchanges of information, and so on. These rules are designed to keep enforcement in touch with the realities in today's markets.

More recently, updated rules on R&D agreements have also been adopted to make sure that these agreements are used to promote, rather than stifle, innovation.
Similarly, our rules regarding  fines are transparent and clear, thanks to the Guidelines adopted in 2006. Evolution of  cartel enforcement in the EU
This brings me to  cartel enforcement, which has been one of the main priorities during my mandate.

Over these years, our practice has shown two main trends: a higher proportion of global cartels - which calls for strong international cooperation - and more cartels detected in sectors other than the traditional industrial sectors - from finance to energy trading.
Settlements

As part of our efforts to adapt to these and other developments in the markets, which often call for a swifter resolution of cases, we have introduced  cartel settlements in the EU.

The first case was settled in 2010. Four years later, I can tell you that the new procedure has already had a positive impact on our practice.

Many companies today prefer to settle to limit the damage to their reputation, clean up their operations, and go back to business as quickly as possible.

So far, the European Commission has settled 14  cartel cases in a variety of sectors, involving 65 undertakings and imposing fines for a total of 4.1 billion.

According to our legal framework, settlements offer quicker procedures, a 10% reduction in the amount of the fines, and shorter decisions.

It's important to understand that not all cases are suitable for settlement. The Commission can use the procedure at its discretion and if companies do not play by the rules, we can revert to the normal procedure at any time.



Page 99 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As a matter of fact, in the  Smart Card Chips decision adopted a week ago, we started settlement discussions and then reverted to the ordinary procedure for lack of progress.

In principle, in contrast to the practice here in the US, a settlement is concluded with all parties to a  cartel at the same time. But we also had a few hybrid cases where, because some of the companies involved ultimately decided not to settle, we nevertheless took a settlement decision while reverting to the normal procedure for the remaining parties.

The best known case is our investigation in the Euribor  cartel in which, following the settlement decision taken in 2013 vis à vis some of the banks involved, normal proceedings are ongoing vis-à-vis JPM, Credit Agricole and HSBC.

Although these hybrid cases will likely remain the exception, keeping this possibility open allows us to use the settlement procedure without being held hostage to the decisions of the companies that prefer not to settle.

Fines

Now, let me say a few words on our fining policy.

Our general approach is to deter through  fines and use our leniency programme to encourage companies to cooperate with us to uncover and investigate cartels.

Our leniency policy offers incentives to the companies that help us to detect such infringements. A large proportion of our  cartel investigations result from participants who approach us to reveal illegal practices.

As to our fines, they are set following our fining guidelines. Over the last years, the EU Courts have confirmed all the main features of the guidelines; including on fundamental principles and rights, gravity, duration, entry fee, and deterrence multiplier.

Since 2010, the Commission has meted out  fines for a total of about 8.8 billion against companies that had formed cartels. These include 1.71 billion in our financial decisions of last December concerning interest-rate derivatives, and almost 1 billion in the recent automotive ball bearings settlement.

I sometimes observe some contradictions in the comments I hear in Europe on our fining policy. Some say that they are too high; more recently, others have said that they are too low and that setting up a  cartel is still a bargain for companies.

I do not agree with either view. Each case is analysed and sanctioned in its own merit, while keeping in mind the need for overall deterrence.

In light of the figures I just mentioned and the risk of a tarnished reputation, our fining policy tells companies not to get involved in cartels because the negative consequences far offset the expected gains.

I can formulate my message in a clearer way: If you did get involved, get out of it as fast as you can. And when you're out, don't do it again.
Regarding fines, I still expect two major developments in the future.
One is further convergence on fining principles within the EU. National Competition authorities enforcing
EU competition rules still apply national guidelines for  fines but the basic principles should be the same.
For example, parental liability has evolved in my decisions over the last few years. However, in some EU
countries parent companies cannot be held liable.

Also, the turnover used to determine the maximum amount may vary in some countries. Differences of this type can lead to situations where the threat of  fines in some Member States does not achieve the desired deterrent effect.

In light of this, I recently called for more convergence among EU National Competition authorities based on our ten-year experience of decentralisation.

This means aligning the fining principles but also ensuring that all NCAs have sufficient resources, the necessary autonomy, and the same fundamental investigative and decision-making powers.
It will be up to the next Commission to decide on the most appropriate initiatives to be taken. Damages directive

Page 100 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The other development I expect is linked to private enforcement, thanks to new EU legislation on antitrust damages actions.

As you know, under my tenure the Commission proposed a Directive on antitrust damages actions to facilitate compensation of victims throughout the EU.

The European Parliament and the European Council of Ministers have reached political agreement on the text before the summer and formal adoption is set to take place in the coming weeks.

Once the new Damages Directive becomes law in the EU, one can expect more actions brought by customers who seek compensation for the harm they suffered.

The new legislation will democratise enforcement and empower the victims of antitrust infringements to receive effective compensation, because damages actions will be more readily available to victims throughout the EU.

The directive will also enforce the principle that all victims have the same right to compensation in the EU, which is excellent news especially for SMEs and consumers.

In addition, the damages directive will  fine-tune the interaction between private and public enforcement - that is, between court actions and the work of national and EU agencies - by allowing victims to wait for and rely on the decisions of the Commission or the national authorities.

Finally, the directive will preserve public enforcement and a company's incentives to cooperate with competition authorities through leniency programmes and settlement procedures.

All in all, this new EU law will ensure that private enforcement complements and relies on a strong public enforcement, first and foremost as regards cartels but also as regards other anticompetitive practices such as abuses of dominance.
Abuse of dominance
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I will now turn to the domain we call in Europe abuse of dominance.

The laws that apply in our respective jurisdictions do not overlap completely. For various reasons, we make a distinction between exploitative and exclusionary abuses.
This distinction derives from article 102 of the EU Treaty and the case-law.

Unlike the Sherman Act, our Treaty does not prohibit the acquisition of dominance. It only applies to abuses of already existing dominance, hence the need to exert additional control over exploitative practices of dominant companies.
Still, this field of EU competition policy is bound to evolve in light of legal and market developments. Recently, the EU General Court - which is the Court of first instance - has issued important rulings in the
field of abuses of dominance. Let me say a few words on them.

On the 12th of June, the General Court upheld a 1.06 billion  fine the Commission had imposed on Intel back in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market.
The Court found that Intel had engaged in two types of abusive behaviour.

- First, Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their CPUs from Intel.

- Second, Intel made direct payments to manufacturers to stop or delay the launch of products containing competitors' CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products.

The Court has reviewed the facts of the case extensively and set clear-cut principles for this type of exclusionary conduct.

The judgment sets out the test for the assessment of exclusivity rebates. In essence, the Court held that these practices are abusive as such, unless they are justified by economic efficiencies.

The Court thus made it clear that the Commission is not bound by law to always establish the economic effects of certain abuses, especially when they clearly do not constitute competition on the merits.

Page 101 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, outside the context of this type of behaviour which is abusive by its nature, in a range of cases the EU Courts have assessed the potential effects of abuses before finding that the dominant company infringed our rules.

This is, for example, how the Court of Justice dealt with predatory pricing or margin squeeze practices by a dominant company.

By confirming the  fine imposed by the Commission on Intel, the Court also suggested that serious abusive behaviour on the market should be sanctioned as harshly as collusive behaviour. So, this judgment will likely have implications on our current policy on rebates and exclusive-dealing arrangements, and the type of economic analysis to be conducted. We may need more time before we can reach more definitive conclusions.

More recently, in July, the General Court gave another important judgment in the Greek Lignite case as regards abuses by State-owned companies. In this case, the State-owned energy supplier had been given exclusive access to national energy sources, thus necessarily excluding potential competitors.

Essentially the Court signalled that granting certain exclusive rights to such companies can be automatically abusive, irrespective of the actual behaviour of the company.
This could be an important development for competition enforcement in the future as regards this kind of
State-owned undertakings.

Second, beyond legal developments, economic developments in our digital age also raise new issues when dealing with abuses of dominance.

In digital markets, successful players can emerge as leaders very quickly. Over time these companies can build large platforms, both locally and globally. This is often the result of innovation and smart business strategies, which are central to economic growth and should be encouraged.

However, competition concerns may arise when leading market positions transform companies into gatekeepers to consumers for other market players. This is particularly so in industries in which network effects reinforce and perpetuate market dominance.

In the digital sectors, network effects can be closely linked with big data - the access to big data is becoming a major barrier to entry.

Digital platforms also tend to operate as two-sided platforms, with users on one side and advertisers on the other. The more users you have, the more valuable the platform becomes to advertisers. And the more advertising revenues are earned, the more investments can be made to attract additional users.

These patterns are important to explain why digital platforms tend to become dominant. As I said before, achieving a dominant position does not in itself constitute a competition problem in the EU.

Competition policy is about ensuring that the competitive process remains healthy so as to foster and allow innovative companies to grow. And this is where our Google search investigation fits in.

The case is not about Google's dominance in search. The case is about the alleged abuse of that dominance with the aim to exclude competitors from other markets where Google faces competition from large or small innovative rivals.

In this particular case, one of the main issues relates to Google using its dominant position in search to enter other markets - the so-called vertical search services - where it faces more competition.

By giving its own services preferential treatment, Google could leverage its dominant position in search to weaken competitors in vertical search markets in a way that would harm consumers.

There would be a disincentive for current and future competitors to invest in vertical services as these would be at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis the prominently displayed Google services.

This would be all the more damaging for users since they are generally not aware of the preferential treatment Google gives its own services.

Other concerns in the investigation relate to the use by Google of third-party content as well as contractual elements of AdSense and AdWords.

Over the last two years, we have explored with Google possible remedies in order to solve our competition concerns and have asked for significant feedback from the market.

Page 102 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We have received new elements and data from complainants concerning the effectiveness of the latest remedies package. In accordance with the EU antitrust procedures, we had asked the complainants to react to the Google proposal. Some of their arguments seem to be solid enough to be taken into consideration. Therefore, we now need to see if Google can propose solutions to these issues by improving its offer.

Crafting effective remedies is a major challenge in digital antitrust cases. These are dynamic, fast-evolving markets.

In the case of Google, the result page for a given keyword may differ from one day to the next. This is the result of a product being constantly optimized and is in itself not an issue. But it also increases the demands on competition authorities that need to decide on effective remedies in an ever-changing environment and ensure their compliance over time.

Finally, we have also seen in recent years an increasing interaction between competition and intellectual property rights, especially in the context of standards and, more specifically, in the so-called smartphone wars.
Last April, the Commission adopted two decisions involving the smartphone manufacturers Samsung and
Motorola.

The decisions establish that a company can always use injunctions to fight back patent infringements. However, such injunctions may be abusive when the holder of a standard-essential patent has given a commitment to licence it on FRAND terms and when licensees are willing to respect them.

These principles strike a good balance between the interests of patent holders and those of the companies that need those patents to produce their devices.

The former should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property. The latter should get access to standard-essential technology without the threat of anti-competitive injunctions.

I hope our decisions will bring clarity to the market and help avoid the protracted patent disputes we have seen in the smartphone industry.

These decisions also illustrate the two different types of decisions that the  EU Commission can take when it decides to pursue a case.

The first is to formally find an infringement under a prohibition decision, potentially with  fines. Alternatively, it may take a commitment decision, which allows companies to make legally binding commitments to alleviate our concerns.

The latter decisions represent slightly more than half of our decisions since May 2004 when they were introduced. They are essentially aimed at opening up markets more quickly and effectively for the future, whether in the energy sector, in payment services, or in digital industries.

But not all cases can be solved with commitments, either because nothing effective is proposed or because it is better to set a strong precedent, as we did recently with several pay for delay cases in the pharmaceutical industry.
Mergers
Let me conclude my presentation with a short overview of merger control in the EU.

Globalisation is a reality that can be particularly observed in this field. But this does not mean that the definition of the relevant market, when it comes to the analysis of a particular merger case, will always conclude that the market is global.

First, our practice shows that, in many sectors, markets have broadened from being purely national to becoming at least EU-wide. This is a direct effect of the EU internal market being effective in some sectors.

Once industrial customers or final consumers tend to procure on a European rather than a purely national basis, we take that reality into account in our assessment.

We see for instance that merger decisions involving purely national markets now represent only 13% of our decisions, compared to 20% ten years ago.



Page 103 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
More significantly, in more than 60% of the cases in which an investigation is launched - i.e. cases which do not fall under a simplified process and are thus potentially problematic - markets were considered at least EU-wide if not global, compared to 48% ten years ago.

Of course, there are variations from industry to industry or among products within a sector, depending on various elements. Still, this shows that our practice evolves with the realities of the markets.

But in some sectors there is no such evolution in Europe; unfortunately, some markets still remain national because of regulatory and economic barriers.

A well-known example is the EU telecoms industry, where operators, despite being global companies, still compete on a national basis.

European consumers only have access to mobile operators present in their respective Member States. When we drive from Strasbourg to Brussels, we have to switch providers three times - and incur roaming fees.

This is because spectrum allocation and telecoms regulations in Europe remain very much national affairs, thus leading to a fragmented European market along national borders.

Existing barriers in the internal market prevent EU companies from competing on a European scale and reach out to a customer base of half a billion potential users. This is what makes the difference with other large telecom markets outside Europe.

To bring Europe's telecom industry into the 21st century we would need a genuine Single Market for telecommunications.

In an integrated EU market, the definition of relevant markets would automatically change. The Commission would assess the impact of most mergers on the whole of the EU and not on individual national markets, which would no longer exist. Until then, we must rely on this reality.
Future developments: Convergence of national systems in the EU?

The rules we have been using in the EU since 2004 to assess mergers have worked well, but there's always room for improvement. At the end of last year, we simplified the process for unproblematic mergers to make the rules even more business-friendly.

As a result, 70% of the transactions we review already follow a simplified process, in which less information is required from companies and no investigation is needed. This allows us to focus on the most important cases.

In addition, in July we published proposals that would allow the Commission to deal with the acquisition of non-controlling minority shareholdings and make referral procedures from national competition authorities to the EU simpler and faster.

At present, mergers that do not reach a certain threshold need to be notified in various EU countries, which mean that companies have to deal with different processes and sustain higher transaction costs. I believe that in such cases, which are not referred to the Commission, more convergence among national systems would be needed in any event.
Our proposals are currently in public consultation. On the basis of the comments we receive, the next
Commission will decide whether legislative initiatives need to be launched.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Since the start of my mandate, the EU has gone through a period of serious economic difficulties. These have been difficult years for Europe's companies, for our workforce, and for consumers.

In this juncture, the recurrent risk has been to yield to protectionist and populist views regarding the role of competition authorities and their alleged interference in the way markets should function.

We have resisted with great determination repeated calls for weaker enforcement on the assumption that laxer control would help companies weather the storm.

I know that all our sister agencies in the Member States and the leading competition authorities around the world have similar stories to tell. Our mutual cooperation has become stronger in these difficult years for competition enforcement.


Page 104 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Competition policy is a pillar of Europe's internal market and the internal market is the single largest asset
Europe has to create value and jobs. It is our decisive competitive advantage.

Open markets, even business conditions, and fair implementation of competition laws are also prerequisites for global markets to thrive. It is with concern that I read reports in the press of some jurisdictions using competition enforcement for different ends.

It has never been more vital than in these years - marked by a severe recession with serious economic and social implications in Europe and in other world regions - to preserve the best possible competition conditions and keep markets open, vibrant, and innovation-friendly.
Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I would like to thank Michael Reynolds for his kind invitation to address one more time the expert audience of the International Bar Association’s annual conference in Florence.

As my mandate as member of the  European Commission comes to an end in a few weeks, this is my last opportunity to share with you my thinking about some significant areas of our enforcement.

I will use some highlights from our practice since I took up the post in February 2010 to discuss my approach to antitrust and State aid.

I will start with our fight against cartels. I will then give a quick look at how we have dealt with some new challenges in the enforcement of the provisions in article 102 regarding abuse of dominance. Finally, I will recall some of the regulatory initiatives we have taken, including the State aid modernisation strategy and the Directive on private damages in antitrust.

I have said in many occasions that cartels are my top enforcement priority. In fact, they have been a priority for the European Commission since the late 90’s, under Karel van Miert’s tenure, when the first leniency programme, guidelines on fines, and dedicated teams of enforcers were gradually set up.

Over the past five years I encouraged DG Competition to keep up with this tradition and, at the same time, adapt to the new challenges brought by the increasing internationalisation of business and by the expansion of cartels beyond the usual sectors.

I have observed two main trends in our practice: we have more global  cartel cases and more cartels are uncovered outside the traditional industrial sectors.

To respond to the first trend, we have strengthened the links that we have with other competition authorities around the world; launched investigations in common; and adapted our investigative tools.

In parallel, we have continued to promote and support the International Competition Network to share our knowledge and experience with authorities in other jurisdictions - including those in emerging countries - as they fight against cartels.

As to the other trend, our practice shows that cartels may also occur in some sectors among the more technologically advanced.

We have had quite a few examples of these cases during these years. One was the DRAM decision in the market for memory  chips back in 2010.

More recently - two weeks ago, in fact - we sanctioned a  cartel that had been set up some years ago among four producers of the  smart card chips that are found everywhere from SIM cards, to passports and bank cards.

We have also been investigating some companies that operate in the market for optical disc drives - this is an ongoing case.
Another industry that has kept our  cartel teams busy is finance.

The most prominent decisions in the sector - related to what the press has called the Libor and Euribor scandals - are those we took at the end of last year against financial institutions that had colluded to manipulate benchmark rates.

The case - in which several large banks and a broker accepted a settlement decision - and the EUR1.7 billion fines we imposed send a clear message: the Commission is determined to fight and punish these practices, which cause widespread damage to our economies and ultimately affect millions of consumers.
However, three banks - JPMorgan, Credit Agricole and HSBC - and one broker - ICAP - did not accept
our findings. As a result, we started standard proceedings against them, and these are progressing as we
speak.

These ‘hybrid decisions’ - where not all the parties involved settle the case - must not become the norm, but they have an important function, because they tell companies they cannot hold up the process if the Commission finds it appropriate to follow this route.
But this is not the only means we have to protect settlement proceedings from manipulation.

The smart card chip case I mentioned earlier started off with settlement discussions. When we noticed that the talks were stalling because they were refusing to acknowledge liability for an infringement for which we had good evidence, we went back to the ordinary procedure and the companies eventually lost the benefit of the settlement process, including the settlement discounts.
Since the first settlement decision - the DRAM case - was adopted in 2010, the procedure has been used
13 more times, allowing companies and the Commission to arrive at quicker decisions.

Of course, we still have many  cartel cases in the more traditional sectors. The almost 9 billion in  fines we imposed since 2010 went to a broad range of markets, including airfreight, detergents, steel abrasives
and power cables.

I would like to make special mention here of our work in the automotive industry, because we have many investigations in the sector and because the same buyers -car manufacturers - suffer from the negative consequences of this sort of infringement.

We have already taken two decisions against car-parts producers - the Wire Harnesses case in July 2013 and the Bearings case last March - and there are more in the pipeline.

Moving on to antitrust, we have been active during these years in various sectors that are important for the Single market, such as energy, telecoms, transport, payment services, as well as in the digital economy.

But today I will focus on one specific development of our enforcement over the last years; the interaction between competition enforcement and intellectual property rights.

This development is reflected in the action we have taken in two areas; the pharmaceutical sector and the smartphone industry.

Our work in the pharmaceutical sector address a major concern identified during our 2009 sector inquiry - the use of patent settlements in pay-for-delay deals.

We analysed this practice in detail during our inquiry, which has been followed up by yearly monitoring reports.
These reports show that patent settlements can be a useful and a completely legitimate tool in more than
90% of the cases. Actually there has been an increase in the number of total settlements, and a decrease
in the amount of potentially problematic agreements.

As to our cases in the sector, over the past year or so we have imposed  fines in three pay-for-delay cases, two of which involved patent settlements. Other investigations, such as the one involving the companies Cephalon and Teva, are ongoing.

The Lundbeck decision of June 2013 sanctioned a series of patent settlements that drove out of the market potential generic competition to Citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant.

Page 107 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the Johnson&Johnson/Novartis case of December 2013, payments were made under the pretence of
co-promotion agreement to avoid entry in the Netherlands of a potential competitor in relation to Fentanyl,
a very strong analgesic. In this case, however, there were no IPRs involved.

Last July, we  fined Servier for excluding generic competition to Perindopril, a best-selling hypertension medication, through a technology acquisition and five patent settlements with potential generic competitors.

I strongly support Intellectual property rights, and I believe that patents are vital for innovation. It is totally legitimate for companies to apply for patents and have them enforced, and settle litigations.

However, in some cases patent holders may want to distort the system and exclude rivals thanks to their deep pockets rather than the strength of their patents.

This is why our enforcement work is guided by the search of a good balance between the rewards for past discoveries and the incentives to continue innovating.

At the same time, our action makes sure that prices for medicines are not kept artificially high. In times of spending cuts, it is important to protect patients and public health systems. Just think that generic competition can bring prices down by as much as 90%.
IPRs can also be used in an anti-competitive manner in another area - the so-called smartphone wars. Here the practices that distort the intellectual property system are not bogus settlements and acquisitions
between companies but involve court injunctions and standard-essential patents.
The two antitrust decisions adopted in April against Samsung and Motorola make a core principle clear. If the owners of a technology that are part of a standard for mobile devices have pledged to license it on
FRAND terms to manufacturers that need it, they cannot bring rivals to court when they are willing to
license the technology on those very same terms. Our Motorola Decision concluded that this was a
breach of the EU antitrust rules.

Again, I believe that these decisions strike the right balance. They protect the interests of patent holders and, at the same time, the interests of the companies that need the patented technology to keep manufacturing their devices.

Holders of standard-essential patents are entitled to a fair remuneration. On the other hand, the companies that use the technology are entitled to do so without the threat of anti-competitive injunctions.
I hope our decisions will help to bring the endless disputes among smartphone manufacturers to an end. These two smartphone cases are also useful to show the relative merits of commitment and prohibition
decisions.

The one involving Motorola was an Article 7 decision without  fines, formally finding an infringement. In contrast, Samsung’s was an Article 9 decision where the company pledged, among other things, not to seek injunctions over its standard-essential patents when the situation I described earlier applies.

In my experience, commitments may be useful when they allow the establishment of competitive structures more quickly and when markets need to be opened up.

Conversely, prohibition decisions may be better suited to deter others from adopting the same behaviour than the infringers.

It goes without saying that I have no preference for either procedure. Since every single case is analysed in its own merit, I ended up choosing the one or the other depending on the facts of the case and on the attitude of the companies involved in our investigations.

Since May 2004, when commitments were introduced, the Commission has adopted 22 prohibition decisions if one excludes cartels, and 35 commitment decisions. The commitment decisions were adopted in a variety of sectors, but often in markets that were being liberalised - such as energy - and in
fast-moving markets - such as media and IT.
Ladies and Gentlemen:

I will say a few words on two important areas in our enforcement of State aid rules; the control of public support of banks in distress and corporate taxation.


Page 108 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But first, let me recall the comprehensive reform we have carried out in this domain - the State aid modernisation strategy.
The new State aid guidelines and procedures are designed to support Europe-wide efforts to boost
growth and create jobs, and to promote what I call ‘good aid’ - that is, measures that improve the quality of
public spending - and fairness in the way taxes treat companies operating under similar circumstances.

The new rules will also help us focus on the cases that matter and massively cut red tape for aid measures with negligible impact on the internal market.

The strategy is articulated in ten guidelines covering all key sectors such as research and development and innovation, broadband connections, energy and environment, risk financing of SMEs, regional policy, cinema, aviation, etc.

We also issued five regulations and two notices to make our instruments more efficient, with streamlined rules and faster decisions.

The State aid modernisation strategy was prepared by the reform of the rules for the services of general economic interest, which cover the public financing of public services across Europe, from hospitals to local transport, to utilities.

Now, let me tell you how State aid instruments were used to control the public bailouts of banks in distress.
Special State aid rules were quickly introduced and deployed when the financial crisis precipitated.

At the time, it was vital to make sure that the large sums that had to be used to prevent the meltdown of the financial system would not tear the Single Market apart.
We have been using these special tools since the end of 2008, and I am really proud of the work done. Many EU countries have made public funds available to banks. In some of them more than half of the
banking sector has received government support.

Thanks to State aid control, we have avoided the spill over of systemic risks and have kept a level playing field for Europe’s banks.

As you know, the sums involved have been huge. From 2008 to end 2013, EU governments injected EUR608 billion into banks in capital and assets relief measures, equivalent to 5.2% of the average GDP of the Union between 2007 and 2013.

These figures do not take into account the repayments of capital injections that some banks have started to do. However, a number of banks have successfully gone through the restructuring phase and have allowed some governments to fully recover their capital - including with a premium.
Other stabilisation tools, such as governments’ guarantees, were also provided to banks.

The States’ outstanding guaranteed liabilities have more than halved since the peak year in 2009, when the outstanding amount of guarantees provided to banks reached EUR835 billion. Since then, they have decreased progressively to EUR400 billion at the end of 2013.

As it turned out, State guarantees have been generating revenues for governments with EUR 38 billion in fees received compared to EUR3 billion in guarantees actually called upon for the whole period
2008-2013.

The special State aid rules we have implemented were designed to keep the use of taxpayers’ money to a minimum and make sure that the aided institutions would become viable again.

In many cases, this has led to the approval of restructuring plans for the banks. When this was not possible, the banks were orderly resolved.

Since the beginning of the crisis and as of today, 110 banks in the EU have received State aid. This is about 25% of the EU banking system by assets.

The Commission has so far approved restructuring plans for 52 of them and put 33 into orderly wind down. 13 more banks had their viability reviewed without further need for a restructuring plan. We are still assessing the viability and restructuring of 12 banks.



Page 109 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It was indeed critical to assess whether the banks would be able to return to long term viability without further need for aid.

And it was equally critical that non-viable banks would be gradually wound down, leaving room for viable banks to grow and finance the EU economy.

One important aspect of our work in this area is that we have filled a serious gap in the EU architecture. We have acted as a de facto banking resolution authority.

In the last two years, the Commission has prepared a new and comprehensive regulatory regime, within the framework of the Banking Union.

The EU approved major changes with the set-up of a single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism with a single resolution fund for the euro zone. A common resolution tools box for the whole EU was also adopted.

In parallel, last year we reviewed the special State aid rules for banks based on the experience and good practices gathered over the previous years.

One of the main changes was making sure that bank owners and junior creditors would contribute before spending more taxpayers’ money on bank bail-outs.

Looking forward, I hope the new framework will reduce dramatically the amount of public funds needed to sustain a solvent and resilient banking sector.
However, together with the new regulatory and institutional tool-box, State aid will continue to be
enforced, making sure that public funding is minimised through appropriate burden sharing measures; that
aided banks are viable; and that competition in the internal market is not distorted.

To turn to another major development in the State aid domain, the Commission has shown its willingness to use all the tools at its disposal to combat corporate tax avoidance.

Under State aid rules, national authorities cannot take selective measures that allow certain companies to pay less in taxes than they should if the tax rules of the country were applied in a fair and
non-discriminatory way.

New State aid investigations have been launched before the summer break into certain tax practices in several Member States, following reports that some companies had received significant tax reductions by way of ‘tax rulings’ issued by national tax authorities.

These investigations are part of the broader drive in Europe and other parts of the world aimed to get big corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. I don’t need to add that this is all the more important in a time of tight public budgets.
Ladies and Gentlemen:

I would like to round up my presentation with the changes we have introduced in our policy tools in addition to the State aid reforms I mentioned earlier.
I will start with the new Directive on antitrust damages actions, which has been approved by the European
Parliament and the European Council of Ministers and will be formally adopted in the coming weeks.

Much has been written about this new Directive. When it becomes operational, it will empower the victims of antitrust infringements to be compensated for the harm suffered.

The private enforcement of competition law will become more effective in Europe and more equal across its territory, and will better interact with public enforcement.

Small companies and individuals will benefit the most and will be able to better rely on the decisions taken by the Commission and the national competition authorities.

Besides this important piece of legislation, we have continued to update, refine and improve our antitrust procedures.

Soon after I became Commissioner for competition I promoted changes that would make our proceedings more open and transparent with the parties.

Thanks to the new best practices introduced in 2011, the companies involved in our cases have more formal opportunities to contact DG Competition and make their cases at an early stage.

Page 110 of 125 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In addition, the role of the Hearing Officers has been strengthened to better protect the procedural rights of the parties.

In our efforts to always keep enforcement ahead of the curve, I’ve also introduced new antitrust guidelines on distribution, standards, exchanges of information and related issues.

More recently, we have updated the rules on research and development agreements. The goal here is making sure that these agreements are used to promote, rather than stifle, innovation.

Finally, we have also simplified the rules we have been using in the EU since 2004 to assess mergers. We have made them more business-friendly and 70% of the deals we review already follow the simplified process.

In the summer, we’ve launched new ideas to extend our review to deals that imply the acquisition of non-controlling minority shareholdings and to make cooperation with national competition authorities simpler and faster.

The comments we are receiving will help the next Commission decide whether the law should be amended.
Ladies and Gentlemen:

As an overview of my term as Commissioner for Competition, I have presented to you a few highlights that illustrate my understanding of competition policy over the past five years.
I am convinced that our action is more important than usual in these years of recession and difficulties. As a necessary condition to return to a sustainable growth path, we need to come together and rekindle
our confidence in the Single Market. Tearing down the remaining barriers, deepening the internal market
in growth-promising sectors, and resisting protectionism are the first orders of business.

I have no doubt that re-launching our process of integration - including through the fair, robust and impartial enforcement of EU competition law - will release our more dynamic and innovative forces from the shackles of this long downturn.

By investing fresh economic and political resources in the Single Market, we will find out that Europe has all it takes to start growing again and create jobs.
Thank you.

The ECJ has delivered its judgment on an appeal by companies in the YKK group against a judgment of the General Court that dismissed their appeal against the  European Commission's decision on the fasteners  cartel. The ECJ considered that the General Court had incorrectly interpreted Article 23(2) of Regulation 1/2003 in respect of the  fine imposed for one cartel infringement. However, the General Court had not erred in concluding that the Commission had been entitled to impose a multiplier for deterrence based on the economic strength of the entire YKK group.

Following a Phase II investigation, the  European Commission has approved the acquisition by Cemex of the Spanish operations of Holcim. The Commission considers that the merged entity will continue to face sufficient competition in affected grey cement markets in eastern Spain. Further, the Commission did not consider that the transaction would be likely to facilitate any possible co-ordination in the grey cement markets in central Spain to an extent that would raise competition concerns.

UK CMA
The CMA has accepted binding commitments from Epyx Limited and its parent company FleetCor Technologies, Inc. In order to address competition concerns regarding its conduct in the market for the supply of service, maintenance and repair platforms in the UK, Epyx will remove certain provisions from its contracts with demand side and supply side customers that could have potentially restricted competition by raising barriers to entry and foreclosing competitors' access to customers.

HD     EUR 138,000,000 fine for a cartel between smart card chip producers

LP
The European Commission imposed on 3 September 2014  fines of up to EUR 138,000,000 for a  cartel between Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas between September 2003 and September 2005. Renesas benefited from full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission under the Commission's Leniency Notice. In 2008, Renesas, a joint venture between Hitachi and Mitsubishi,
lodged a leniency request before the Commission regarding a  cartel between smart card chip producers. Smart card chips are used for the production of smart cards such as telephone SIM cards, bank cards and identity cards. Following this leniency application, an investigation was initiated in 2008 and the Commission carried out unannounced inspections (dawn raids) in several Member States. The Commission had initially considered concluding a settlement with some of the companies involved in the case.

TD
However, the discussions were discontinued in 2012 and the Commission issued in 2013 a statement of objections in order to give the companies at stake the opportunity to comment and to take part in a hearing on the alleged competition infringement. At the end of the investigation, the Commission decided that Infineon, Philips, Samsung and Renesas had taken part in a  cartel in the sector of  smart card chips in
the European Economic area. It found evidence that those companies concluded a network of bilateral contracts in order to determine their respective responses to customers' requests to lower prices. Sensitive commercial information on pricing, customers, contract negotiation, production capacity and capacity utilization was discussed and exchanged between competitors. Those bilateral contracts were in force between September 2003 and September 2005. This type of collusion is prohibited by Article 101 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and by Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Therefore, the Commission adopted a decision on 3 September 2014 imposing the following fines: Infineon: EUR 82,784,000 Philips: EUR 20,148,000 Samsung: EUR 35,116,000. Renesas was granted full immunity for having revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission and avoided a fine that would have exceeded EUR 51,000,000 for its participation in the  cartel. Samsung benefited from a reduction of 30% of its  fine as it had cooperated in the investigation.
