BRUSSELS, Feb 16, 2007 (AFP) -
EU regulators will next week slap a record  fine of up to a billion euros (1.3 billion dollars) on four big
European and US makers of lifts for running an illegal  cartel, sources close to the matter said Friday.

TD
ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis of the United States,  Schindler of Switzerland and  Kone of Finland will be targeted by the EU competition watchdog as a result of a probe it has been conducting for several years, the sources said.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels, which she says undermine competition and drive up prices for consumers.

The fine to be imposed on the lift makers will be "between 900 million and one billion euros," according to the sources, which will make it the biggest penalty ever imposed by the regulators at the European Commission.

EU investigators uncovered evidence that the companies operated a  cartel for between five and 10 years around the turn of the century by sharing confidential commercial information and secretly agreeing on prices.

The European Union's executive arm is scheduled to confirm the decision on Wednesday, one of the sources said. But the  commission's agenda could be changed at the last minute.
A European  Commission spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
After bumper  fines in 2006, the EU regulators in January ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros
(984 million dollars) for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.

That fine was the second biggest EU regulators have imposed in a  cartel case after slapping 855 million euros in penalties on eight vitamin makers in 2001. It was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.

BRUSSELS, Feb 16, 2007 (AFP) -
EU regulators, who have vowed to clamp down on illegal cartels, are poised to slap a record billion-euro
fine on Europe's four biggest lift makers for fixing prices, sources said Friday.

TD
ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis of the United States,  Schindler of Switzerland and  Kone of Finland will be targeted by the EU competition watchdog as a result of a probe it has been conducting for several years, sources close to the matter told AFP.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels, which she says undermine competition and drive up prices for consumers.

The fine to be imposed on the lift makers will be "between 900 million and one billion euros," (1.2-1.3 billion dollars) according to the sources, which will make it the biggest penalty ever imposed by the regulators at the European  Commission.

Under EU antitrust rules,  fines on companies participating in a  cartel can run as high as 10 percent of their global revenues, although such a heavy penalty has so for never been imposed on a group.

EU investigators uncovered evidence that the four lift makers operated a  cartel for between five and 10 years around the turn of the century by sharing confidential commercial information and secretly agreeing on prices.

The illegal activity took place in Germany, the biggest lift market in Europe, as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

The European Union's executive arm is scheduled to confirm the decision on Wednesday, one of the sources said. But the  commission's agenda could be changed at the last minute.
A European  Commission spokesman declined to comment on the matter.

Kone of Finland also had no comment.

After busting the power equipment club, Kroes warned that she "will not tolerate cartels in Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business."
Despite the record the lift  fine will set, higher penalties are likely in future cases after the  commission
tightened its rules for calculating  fines, making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels.

The reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before.

The commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the European Court of Justice which gave regulators more freedom to fix  fines, especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--The world's biggest lift manufacturers are bracing themselves for a record fine from the European  Commission that could amount to almost GBP673 million for alleged price-fixing activities, the Times reports Saturday, citing industry sources.

The paper says that according to industry sources, some evidence of  cartel-like behavior had been investigated in German and the Benelux countries, but insisted that this didn't amount to Europe-wide price-fixing.

TD
Complaints from smaller rivals are believed to have led to the launch of an inquiry nearly three years ago into the so-called "big-four" lift manufacturers: United Technologies Corp's  Otis Elevators,  based in the U.S. and Paris;  Schindler Group of Switzerland; ThyssenKrupp (TKA.XE) of Germany and the Helsinki-based Kone Group (KNEBV.HE).

The word's biggest lift manufacturers are bracing themselves for a record  fine from the European Commission that could amount to almost Euro 1 billion (Pounds 673 million) for alleged  price-fixing activities.

Industry sources told The Times that some evidence of  cartel-like behaviour had been investigated in Germany and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), but insisted that this did not amount to Europe-wide  price-fixing.

TD
Complaints from smaller rivals are believed to have led to the launch of an inquiry nearly three years ago into the so-called "big four" lift manufacturers: United Technologies Corp's (UTC)  Otis Elevators, based in the United States and Paris;  Schindler Group of Switzerland; ThyssenKrupp from Germany; and the Helsinki-based  Kone Group.

In March 2004, UTC said that an internal investigation had given it "reason to believe that some  Otis employees in a small number of locations may have engaged in activities in violation of  Otis and UTC policies and competition law".

The Commission has the power to  fine companies up to 10 per cent of turnover for  cartel behaviour. The four big lift companies account for about half of the global $37 billion (Pounds 19 billion)  elevator industry between them.

The largest set of  fines yet imposed on a cartel came in January, when the  Commission fined 11 groups of companies Euro 750 million for participating in a  cartel for gas-insulated switchgear products between 1988 and 2004.
A new record fine is likely to be announced against the lift companies on Wednesday, according to
Agence France Presse yesterday. The  Commission refused to comment.
If they do receive such a big  fine, the companies are likely to appeal against the amount.

Neelie Kroes, the EU's Competition Commissioner, has given notice that she will not shy away from using the full extent of her powers to break cartels in Europe.

The vast elevator market in Europe has only just been overtaken in volume of new sales by China, which pipped annual European sales of 120,000 lifts. But Europe has the largest stock of existing elevators,  beating even the US.

HELSINKI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Shares in Finnish lift and escalator  maker Kone slipped on Monday after media reports that it and other lift-makers could receive EU fines totalling 1 billion euros ($1.31 billion)
in a cartel probe.

TD
Kone shares traded 1.3 percent lower at 46.31 euros by 0920 GMT after opening down 4.1 percent, against a 0.3 percent gain in the Helsinki bourse general index <.OMXHPI>.

Reuters reported on Thursday that the European  Commission is expected to  fine several companies, including Kone, U.S.-based  Otis, which is owned by United Technologies , ThyssenKrupp of Germany and Schindler of Switzerland, according to a source familiar with the case.

The source said the fines would be imposed at a  Commission meeting on Wednesday, but did not say which firm would be fined or by how much.
Reports in Finnish media said the  fine could be 1 billion euros in total.

If a fine of that size were to be divided according to sales,  Kone could be penalised by up to 180 million euros ($237 million), analysts at FIM Securities said in a note to clients.

Kone spokeswoman Minna Mars said the company had received no new information from the Commission and could not comment on the possible  fine. She also said  Kone had not been told when the decision would be made public.

Sampo Brisk, analyst at OKO Bank, said market worries were less about the size of the  fine, and more about the impact of the ruling on the industry as a whole.

"Cartel investigations are unfortunate mainly for image.  Kone's balance sheet is so strong that even if it got a large fine, it will not impact the valuation much," said Brisk, who has an "accumulate" recommendation on the stock.

New York – EU regulators plan to  fine four of the biggest lift makers at least E900 million (R8.5 billion)
for price-fixing, according to a person with knowledge of the penalty.

United Technologies’  Otis division, the world’s largest lift maker,  Schindler Holding, ThyssenKrupp and Kone would be penalised, said the person, who declined to be identified because the decision was not public. About half of the  fine would be against ThyssenKrupp, the person said.

TD
The fine, to be announced as early as Wednesday, would be the largest by the European
Commission, exceeding a E790.5 million penalty against a vitamin  cartel in 2001.

European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes has made busting cartels her priority since taking over from Mario Monti in November 2004.

Christian Obst, an analyst at HVB in Munich, said: “Nobody expected such a high  fine. It will have an effect on the companies. The message is there needs to be more competition in the market.”

The commission alleges a price-fixing cartel took place in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1998 and 2004. Jonathan Todd, a  commission spokesperson, declined to comment.

The EU regulator would  fine the four companies as much as E1 billion, AFP reported on Friday, citing people close to the matter.

“This could affect the future profitability of  elevator companies, which have historically had high margins and charged high prices,” Obst said. He estimated that the lift market this year would generate profit of at least E3 billion.

“These are just rumours,” said a spokesperson for  Kone. A spokesperson for  Schindler said it did not comment on speculation. All four companies said they had been co-operating with the regulator. – Bloomberg

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission on Wednesday is likely to  fine four elevator

The commission, the European Union's regulatory arm, two years ago charged United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) Otis unit, ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE),  Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) and  Kone OYJ (KNEBV.HE) with operating cartels in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The commission declined to comment on the details of the case or to say whether a decision to punish the manufacturers was scheduled for Wednesday.

The regulator likely will  fine the companies a total of EUR900 million to EUR1 billion, according to an Agence France Presse report that cited unnamed sources. That total would surpass the  commission's highest-ever cartel penalty, a EUR750 million  fine levied last month against 11 companies that fixed prices for power-grid components.

U.S.-based  Otis, Switzerland's Schindler and Finland's Kone two years ago acknowledged that they were charged by the commission. Spokesmen for Schindler and Kone on Tuesday declined to discuss further details of the case. A spokesman for Otis couldn't be reached for comment.

Germany's ThyssenKrupp so far has declined to comment on the case. Because the company previously was fined for fixing prices in the E.U. -EUR3.17 million in 1998 for a stainless steel  cartel -it likely faces steeper fines in this case. Under new E.U. antitrust guidelines established last year, the commission can now levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders.

HD      CARTELS : LIFT MAKERS FACE RECORD FINE WC     295 words

SN      Europolitics SC      EURREP LA     English

LP
The European  Commission is set to impose a record  fine on four lift makers for operating an illegal cartel. Penalties of up to €900 million are expected to be announced on 21 February against ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis of the United States, Switzerland's  Schindler and Finnish company Krone. The biggest  fine in this international price-fixing ring is thought to be pending against ThyssenKrupp, the world's largest producer of elevators.  Reports allege that between 1998 and 2004, the companies made secret agreements to fix prices and share confidential information in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

TD
Only a month ago, the Commission imposed a staggering €750 million  fine on 11 companies for involvement in a cartel in the gas insulated switchgear sector (see Europolitics 3233). A €900 million  fine would be the highest ever imposed by the  Commission, beating even the €855 million imposed in the huge vitamin cartel in 2001. This shows that Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes indeed means business when she talks of a zero-tolerance policy against cartels - illegal conspiracies which damage business and consumers alike.

The discovery of these major cartels vindicates the  Commission's 2004 decision to turn some of its powers concerning anti-competitive agreements over to national authorities. The rationale at the time was that it would free up time and resources within the  Commission to combat large-scale cartel activity: the strategy appears to be paying off.  Fines are likely to continue to rise when the Commission's new fining guidelines kick in. These will increase the overall level of  fines from the current 10% of the total annual turnover to 30% of annual sales relating to the  cartel. They also allow even larger  fines for repeat offenders.

HD         EU To Impose 1.0 Bln Euro Fine on Lift Makers - Report

The European Union will impose a  fine for up to 1.0 bln euro ($1.317 bln) on four lift makers, among which is German steel and engineering group ThyssenKrupp AG, German daily Handelsblatt reported on February 20, 2007, citing industry sources.

The fine, which is the highest  cartel fine ever imposed by the EU, will be between 900 mln euro ($1.186 bln) and 1.0 bln euro ($1.317 bln). Besides ThyssenKrupp, it will also affect U.S. United Technologies Corp's  Otis Elevators  Co Ltd, Switzerland's  Schindler and Finland's  Kone Corporation.

TD
A spokesperson for the European  Commission (EC) did not comment on the total size of the  fine. The
EC is expected to announce its decision on February 21, 2007.

The four companies are alleged to have divided between themselves orders and tenders for  elevators and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands for the last ten years, according to branch experts.
ThyssenKrupp will account for around half of the  fine, as it has repeatedly trespassed anti-cartel
regulations.

Industry sources said the  cartel agreements must have applied only within the actual country borders and varied from country to country. The  price-fixing agreements in Germany were only valid for escalators. The EU competition authorities carried out separate investigations in the different markets. The fine, however, will refer to the delinquency in all countries.

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

The commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

TD
None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal. Spokesmen for Switzerland-based Schindler and the German unit of U.S.-based  Otis declined to comment.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.
"Companies have the option of seeking damages" or renegotiating their contracts, said the
commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

HD         UPDATE: EU Fines Elevator Makers EUR992M For Price-Fixing
WC        666 words
PD         21 February 2007
ET         05:31 PM
SN         Dow Jones Asian Equities Report

(Updates an item, published from around 1125 GMT, with company responses and further details.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission on Wednesday levied Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty, fining five  elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices.

TD
ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million.

The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR790 million penalty levied in 2001 against makers of vitamin products, reflects the  Commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  Commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million  fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty
included this added charge, bringing its  fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

"Three million euros is lunch money," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team. Steeper  fines, such as the ones in the elevator case, "can have important financial consequences for companies," he added.

ThyssenKrupp shares fell about 2% to EUR38.60 after the  fine was disclosed. The other three companies had smaller dips in their share prices.
The Commission launched its investigation into the  elevatorand escalator  businesses in January
2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The Commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the Commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking. The  Commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

Otis' penalty was reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Otis said it will appeal the  Commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its parent company United Technologies said the  fine "will have no material impact" on its financial condition.

Schindler said it was "very surprised" at the size of the  fine since the companies were charged with local collusion, not running a pan-European  cartel.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the Commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.

Commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

The European Commission accused the companies of operating a  cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros for rigging bids for procurement contracts, fixing prices, sharing out projects, carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

The total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against Japanese company Mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to The Netherlands.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes stormed.

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway.

"The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators  -- for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long," she added.

ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest  fine ever imposed on a single company in  cartel case because it was a repeat offender. The German group was  fined 480 million euros.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corporation, was given a  fine of 225 million euros for its role, followed by  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone with 142 million euros.

Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown.

After bumper  fines in 2006, EU regulators in January ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.

That fine was the second biggest EU regulators have imposed in a cartel case after slapping 855 million euros in penalties on eight vitamin makers in 2001. The vitamin makers' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.

BRUSSELS, Feb 21, 2007 (AFP) -
EU competition regulators imposed their biggest  fine ever on Wednesday, hitting lift makers Otis,
Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  Kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel.

TD
The European Commission accused the companies of operating a  cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros (1.3 billion dollars) for rigging bids for procurement contracts, fixing prices, sharing out projects, carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

The total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against Japanese company Mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to The Netherlands.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes stormed.

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway.

"The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators  -- for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long," she added.
ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a single company in a
cartel case because it was a repeated offender. The German group was  fined 480 million euros.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corporation, was given a  fine of 225 million euros for its role, followed by  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone with 142 million euros.
EU antitrust investigators conducted so-called "dawn raids" on lift and  escalator  makers across Europe in
January 2004 after getting a tip off about the  cartel.
After the raids, the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced
fines.

The European  Commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the  cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants. They also visited the countryside and travelled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators' scrutiny.

Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown.

After bumper  fines in 2006, EU regulators in January ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.
After the lift makers case, that  fine is now the third biggest ever against a  cartel.

Until Wednesday, the biggest  fine in a European cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001. The vitamin makers' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.

Despite the record  fine on the lift makers, higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating  fines, making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels.
The reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before.

The commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the European Court of Justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix  fines, especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account.

WASHINGTON, Feb 21, 2007 (AFP) -
The US parent company of elevator maker Otis said Wednesday it would appeal against a record EU
antitrust  fine imposed against a lift cartel.

TD
United Technologies Corp. (UTC) said it had "cooperated fully" with the European Union's executive
commission during the investigation into the market-rigging  cartel.
"Otis will appeal the  commission's decision to the European Court of the First Instance," a UTC
statement said.

"We are disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  commission's and UTC's own investigations," UTC chief executive George David said.
"UTC will not tolerate unethical behaviors of any kind," he said, noting that nine  Otis employees in
Europe had been "quickly identified and dismissed" for violating the company's code of ethics.

The statement added: "The outcome of the case will have no material impact on UTC's financial condition and no material impact on  Otis' competitive position."

The European Commission ruled that the companies ran a  cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands between at least 1995 and
2004.
The combined fine came to a record 992 million euros (1.3 billion dollars).
ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a single company in a
cartel case because it was a repeat offender. The German group was  fined 480 million euros.

Otis was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role, followed by  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and Kone with 142 million euros.

HD      EU brings  down lift cartel with record billion-euro fine

BRUSSELS, Feb 21, 2007 (AFP) -
EU competition regulators imposed their biggest  fine ever on Wednesday, hitting lift makers Otis,
Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  Kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel.

TD
"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," said the competition commissioner's spokesman.

The European  Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, accused the companies of operating a  cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004.

It said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros (1.3 billion dollars) for rigging bids for procurement contracts, fixing prices, sharing out projects, carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

The total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against Japanese company Mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to The Netherlands.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record  fines against companies targeted by her crackdown.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels," Kroes stormed on Wednesday after the record  fine was announced.

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," she said.

Her spokesman Jonathan Todd told journalists that the lift  cartel's effects "will be felt for the next 20 to 50 years because a lot of these companies make their money from the maintenance which is done following the installation of  escalators and elevators."

ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender. The German group's  fine was increased by 50 percent to a total 480 million euros because of its history of participating in cartels.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corp., was given a  fine of 225 million euros for its role, followed by Switzerland-based  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone of Finland with 142 million euros.

United Technologies said that  Otis would lodge an appeal with an EU court while ThyssenKrupp,  Kone and Schindler said separately they would examine the  commission's case against them before deciding whether to challenge it.

Schindler said in a statement that it was "very surprised at the size of the  fine since the European Commission found no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European  elevator industry."

EU antitrust investigators conducted so-called "dawn raids" on lift and  escalator  makers across Europe in
January 2004 after getting a tip-off about the  cartel.
After the raids, the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced
fines.

The European  Commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the  cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants. They also visited the countryside and travelled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators' scrutiny.

After bumper  fines in 2006, EU regulators in January ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.
After the lift makers case, that  fine is now the third biggest ever against a  cartel.

Until Wednesday, the biggest  fine in a European cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001. The vitamin makers' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.

Despite the record  fine on the lift makers, higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating  fines, making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels.

HD      US shares mixed on inflation jitters

NEW YORK, Feb 21, 2007 (AFP) -

US shares ended mixed Wednesday after a surprise hike in consumer prices revived fears about the outlook for inflation and Federal Reserve policy.

TD
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 48.23 points (0.38 percent) at 2,738.41, after notching up a record closing high of 12,786.64 Tuesday.

"The CPI and the BoJ raising interest rates weighed on the market today," Cowen and Co. analyst Michael Malone said after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for only the second time in over six years.
But the Nasdaq composite shrugged off the inflation numbers to gain 5.38 points (0.21 percent) to
2,518.42. The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 meanwhile fell 2.05 points (0.14 percent) to close
at 1,457.63.

The US consumer price index (CPI) jumped 0.2 percent last month compared to December as surging food and medical costs drove up headline inflation, the Labor Department said.
The "core" rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up a larger 0.3 percent in January. "The CPI news takes some of the wind out of the excessively optimistic 'Goldilocks' forecast of moderate
economic growth with low inflation," Briefing.com president Dick Green said.

"This one-month read on inflation does not signal a new trend, or even undermine the belief that inflation trends are moderate," he added.
"It does, however, take away some of the optimism that inflation has moderated to such an extent that the
Fed will be able to lower interest rates later this year."

Minutes from the Fed's January 31 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that central bankers were encouraged by easing price pressures but "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."

Among stocks in focus, computer maker Hewlett-Packard slumped 4.75 percent to 41.08 dollars after issuing a disappointing earnings outlook late Tuesday, despite posting better-than-expected profits for the past quarter.

"Hewlett-Packard is really weighing on the Dow today. HP is accounting for 15 points of the downside of the Dow, so if you remove that, it would be very different," Malone said.

He added: "We're just slightly off. We had multi-year highs yesterday. I think it's contributing to today's pulback but I don't think it's anything that investors are really finding overly troubling."

AG Edwards chief market strategist Al Goldman said Tuesday's record finish for the Dow had "demonstrated the underlying momentum and positive economic fundamentals supporting the stock market."

"However, the upside has been losing some of its previous oomph. This is normal action after so many up days and we will be watching for signs of increased fatigue," he said.

United Technologies Corp. closed down 0.81 percent at 67.58 after its elevator-making division Otis was ruled by the European Union to have formed part of a market-rigging cartel.
The EU's executive commission imposed a record antitrust fine of 992 million euros (1.3 billion dollars)
on cartel members Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and Kone.

Otis, whose share of the  fine was 225 million euros, said it would appeal to an EU court.

JetBlue Airways recovered 2.25 percent to 13.19 dollars, a day after slumping 5.0 percent, following its release of a "customer bill of rights" to compensate passengers hit by last-minute cancellations.

The budget US airline has been in a storm of controversy after it cancelled nearly 1,100 flights last week owing to heavy snow, stranding thousands of passengers.
Bond prices, which move in opposite directions to bond yields, weakened on the inflation news.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.692 percent from 4.680 percent Tuesday, while that on the 30-year bond advanced to 4.789 percent from 4.780.

HD     OUTLOOK Thyssenkrup, Otis, Schindler, Kone braced for 1 bln eur EU cartel fine

BRUSSELS (AFX) - Four of the world's biggest lift makers, ThyssenKrupp AG, United Technologies Corp's Otis Elevators  Co Ltd, Schindler AG and Kone Oyj, are bracing themselves for heavy sanctions set to be imposed tomorrow by the European Commission totalling close to 1 bln eur for alleged  cartel behaviour beginning nine years ago, sources said.

Sources told Agence France-Presse that said the collective  cartel fine imposed on the German, US, Swiss and Finnish manufacturers would set a record for EU antitrust regulators. Reports also said that the majority of the  fine would be levied at ThyssenKrupp.

TD
The sanction could come as early as tomorrow, with European Commissioners, including EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, meeting to discuss the timing and  fine detail of the decision on the
long-standing case.
Industry sources told DPA News Agency that the  commission is to rubber-stamp its ruling tomorrow. The
commission has declined to comment.

ThyssenKrupp said it was cooperating with the body, but a company spokeswoman declined to provide further details on the matter.

The commission will say that the companies engaged in  price-fixing and market collusion in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1998 and 2004.
In Jan 2004, EU executive officials raided the premises of the four groups after receiving  cartel
allegations from third parties with regard to the European  elevator and escalator  market.
Third parties complained that they were not supplied with spare parts by the members of the supposed
cartel.

The commission also conducted further raids in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany in early March of that year.

United Technologies confirmed at the time that a "small number" of employees at the European operations of its  Otis elevator unit may have violated company policy and competition rules.

Kone added that it found "local" anti-competitive behaviour at its offices in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany following an internal investigation triggered by the EU raids, but said it did not find "evidence or indications" of any European-wide anti-competitive practices.

In a statement at the time,  Kone said it took "immediate measures to stop anything that could be considered as anti-competitive behaviour in the European Union." The company declined to specify the nature of the measures.

The commission finally issued formal charges to the companies -- set out as a 'statement of objections' -- in mid-October 2005.
The companies can appeal  fines at the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ).



Page 39 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fine is set to be the heaviest imposed by EU regulators after they levied 855.2 mln eur -- reduced on appeal to 790.5 mln -- in Nov 2001 against eight vitamin companies suspected of  cartel behaviour lasting nine years.
The companies implicated were Roche Holding AG, BASF AG, Aventis SA, Takeda, Solvay
Pharmaceuticals NV, Merck KGaA, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and Eisai Co Ltd.
Late last month, the  commission also fined 11 companies a total of 750.7 mln eur for participation in a
cartel for gas insulated switchgear projects between 1988 and 2004.
The companies involved were Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Alstom, Areva, Fuji Co, Hitachi Japan AE Power
Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Toshiba Corp and VA Tech.

Kroes has made the fight against cartels one of the key policies of her tenure as head of the EU's competition department.

Under new guidelines set by the  commission in June last year, the  commission adopted new powers for its policing of antitrust abuses.

The commission will fix a basic fine of up to 30 pct of a company's sales of the product in the market where the abuse has taken place. The  fine will also be multiplied by the number of years during which a company participates in the infringement.
The overall ceiling for  fines remains 10 pct of global annual turnover.

In addition, a so-called 'entry fee' may be imposed, particularly on cartels, irrespective of the duration of the infringement. This is calculated as a sum equal to 15-25 pct of a company's annual sales, whatever the duration of the infringement.
The commission added that repeat offenders will also be  fined more than in the past.

The commission's previous practice has been to increase a  fine by 50 pct where the company has been found to have been previously involved in one or more similar infringements.

Under the new rules, the  commission can increase the fine up to 100 pct. It will also take into account not only its own previous decisions, but also those of EU member state national competition authorities.
Each prior infringement will justify an increase of the  fine.
In this regards, the  commission's remit to fight cartels was given a boost earlier this month after the ECJ
upheld a fine of 42.4 mln eur imposed by the EU's lower court on French food company Groupe Danone.

The court dismissed Danone's claim that sanctions imposed for repeated  cartel infringements have no basis in EU law.
A spokesman for Kroes said at the time that the ECJ for the first time "clearly confirmed the
commission's policy of increasing  fines for repeat offenders."

The changes do not affect the commission's rules on leniency, whereby  cartel whistleblowers can receive full immunity from fines. There are also graded  fine reductions for assistance in  cartel exposure.

There is no strict deadline to complete  cartel inquiries. Their duration depends on a number of factors, including; the complexity of each case, the extent to which the companies concerned co-operate, and the exercise of the rights of defence.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said it has fined four of the world's biggest lift makers ThyssenKrupp AG, United Technologies Corp's Otis, Schindler AG and Kone Oyj a total of 992.3 mln eur for alleged cartel activity going back twelve years.

The fine imposed is a record for the  commission, surpassing one of 855.2 mln eur -- reduced on appeal to 790.5 mln -- sanctioned against eight companies for operating a vitamin  cartel in Nov 2001.

The lion's share of the sanction was levied at Thyssenkrupp, which was  fined 479.7 mln eur, or 48.3 pct of the total  fine.

Otis was fined 224.9 mln eur,  Schindler, 143.7 mln, and  Kone, 142.1 mln.
The decision also implicates 17 units of the above groups, in addition to Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV
which participated in the Dutch  cartel.

The commission said the lift manufacturers engaged in  price-fixing and market collusion in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

The companies can appeal the decision at the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice. Under EU antitrust rules, the EU can  fine a company participating in a  cartel up to 10 pct of its global
revenues.

The lion's share of the sanction was levied at ThyssenKrupp, which was  fined 479.7 mln eur, or 48.3 pct of the total  fine. The fines imposed on the group were increased by 50 pct, as it is a repeat offender.

Otis was fined 224.9 mln eur,  Schindler 143.7 mln, and  Kone 142.1 mln. The decision also implicates
17 units of the above groups.

In addition, Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV was  fined a much smaller amount, 1.8 mln eur, for participating in the Dutch cartel.

Kone units received full immunity from  fines under the commission's leniency programme in respect of the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg, as they were first to provide information about these cartels.
Similarly,  Otis Netherlands received full immunity in respect of the Netherlands  cartel.

The commission said the lift manufacturers engaged in  price-fixing and market collusion in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

"These companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the EU executive said.

"Business secrets and confidential information on bidding patterns and prices between the  cartel participants were also exchanged. Projects that were rigged included lifts and  escalators for hospitals, railway stations, shopping centres and commercial buildings".

The commission said that high-ranking national management -- such as managing directors, sales and services directors and heads of customer service departments -- participated in regular meetings and discussions.

It added that there is evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal and took care to avoid detection.

"They usually met in bars and restaurants, they travelled to the countryside or even abroad, and they used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking," it added.

"The effects of this  cartel may continue for twenty to fifty years as maintenance is often done by the companies that installed the equipment in the first place".
The commission said the allocation of projects was similar in all four member states

In Jan 2004, EU executive officials raided the premises of the four groups after receiving  cartel
allegations from third parties with regard to the European  elevator and escalator  market.
The commission finally issued formal charges to the companies -- set out as a 'statement of objections'
-- in mid-October 2005.

In their responses to the  commission's charges, the EU executive said the companies did not contest the facts and none of them requested an oral hearing.
The companies can appeal the decision at the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice. Under EU antitrust rules, the EU can  fine a company participating in a  cartel up to 10 pct of its global
revenues.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels."

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway".

"The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators,"  she added.

HD       Schindler says to decide later whether to appeal EU lift cartel fine

ZURICH (AFX) -  Schindler Holding AG said it will decide whether to appeal the European  Commission's
143 mln eur fine imposed earlier today for its alleged participation in a lift  cartel, once it has been able to
examine the grounds for the decision.

However, the Swiss elevator and escalator  maker said it is very surprised at the size of the  fine since the EU Commission found no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European elevator industry.

TD
The Commission did however accuse ThyssenKrupp AG, United Technologies Corp's  Otis, Schindler AG and Kone Oyj of local collusion in the  elevator markets of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Germany.

In Europe's largest  elevator market, Germany,  Schindler did not participate in collusive practices with competitors thanks to the introduction of its Code of Conduct in 1996, the company noted.
However, Schindler was accused of collusion in the elevator markets of Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands before 2004, and in the far smaller German escalator  market, but only between 1995 and
2000, it added. afx.zurich@afxnews.com at/jlw

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Rumour is rife over condemnation of lift maker cartel

Brussels, 20/02/2007 (Agence Europe) - There have been various reports announcing the  Commission's likely condemnation, on Wednesday 21 February, of several lift and  escalator  manufacturers. After the Reuters report last Thursday (see EUROPE 9368), an article appeared in Le Monde of 19 February confirming that Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is soon to condemn the lift maker,  Otis (held by the American company, United Technologies), ThyseenKrupp (Germany),  Schindler (Switzerland) and Kone (Finland).

The Commissioner's spokespersons refused all comment. Nonetheless, a trade union representative of the companies charged admitted to Le Monde that “it would not come as a surprise” if the  Commission were to announce a  fine on Wednesday. Addressing EUROPE, a  Schindler spokesman confirmed this expectation.

TD
For several years, the sector has had to face allegations of unlawful  market sharing  between competitors. This agreement allowed them not only to impose high prices but also to undertake superfluous renovation work. Since 2003, complaints have been increasingly filed by cheap housing managers, and by tenants and joint owners of property. Furthermore, in 2005, several  Schindler employees were reportedly dismissed for unlawful agreements. It is not yet known to what extent these anecdotal incidents are connected to the current  Commission investigation.

Fines resulting from the investigation could, according to these sources, reach €1 billion. If this proves to be the case, it will be the heaviest  fine ever imposed on a cartel by the Commission, and will increase to
€1.75 billion the  fines imposed in 2007. We recall that €1.8 billion were imposed in fines in 2006, mainly after the June strengthening of anti-trust sanctions (see EUROPE 9221). (cd)

HD      EC Fines Lift Producers 992 Mln Euro For Price Fixing

Brussels/Vienna (APA/ADP) - The European  Commission (EC) has finedfine on four of the world's largest lift makers 992 mln euro ($1.303 bln) for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, on February 21, 2007.

German steel and engineering group ThyssenKrupp AG was alone fined 479 mln euro ($629.62 mln), the largest fine the EC has ever imposed on a single company for cartel violations. The other  cartel participants are U.S. United Technologies Corp's  Otis, fined 225 mln euro ($295.75 mln), Swiss Schindler AG, 143.7 mln euro ($188.88 mln), and Finnish Kone Oyj, 142.1 mln euro ($186.78 mln).

TD
Between 1995 and 2004 the  cartel participants fixed bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information, the  Commission said.
The effects of the cartels are to be felt in the next years as well, EC added.

According to a spokesman of the European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes, the EC limited its investigation on four countries, where there was evidence of collusion and it was up to the national anti-trust authorities to carry out further probes in other EU members. Kroes referred to one of the latest investigations of the Austrian anti-trust authority (BWB). On January 30, 2007, BWB filed a request for fines on leading lift and  escalator  manufacturers on suspicion of  cartel participation.

HD         EU Fines 4 Elevator Makers EUR992 Million  For Price Fixing

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission on Wednesday fined four elevator and
escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices, Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty.

ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million. [ 02-21-07 0642ET ]

TD
The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR750 million penalty levied last month against makers of power-grid components, reflects the  commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty included this hike, bringing its fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid in
2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

The commission launched its investigation into the  elevator business in January 2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and it fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement. [ 02-21-07 0712ET ]

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

The commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal. Spokesmen for Switzerland-based Schindler and the German unit of U.S.-based  Otis declined to comment.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.
"Companies have the option of seeking damages" or renegotiating their contracts, said the
commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

(Updates an item, published from around 1125 GMT, with company responses and further details.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission on Wednesday levied Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty, fining five  elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices.

TD
ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  Commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million  fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty
included this added charge, bringing its  fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

"Three million euros is lunch money," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team. Steeper  fines, such as the ones in the elevator case, "can have important financial consequences for companies," he added.

ThyssenKrupp shares fell about 2% to EUR38.60 after the  fine was disclosed. The other three companies had smaller dips in their share prices.
The Commission launched its investigation into the  elevatorand escalator  businesses in January
2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

Otis said it will appeal the  Commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its parent company United Technologies said the  fine "will have no material impact" on its financial condition.

Schindler said it was "very surprised" at the size of the  fine since the companies were charged with local collusion, not running a pan-European  cartel.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the Commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal. Spokesmen for Switzerland-based Schindler and the German unit of U.S.-based  Otis declined to comment.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.
"Companies have the option of seeking damages" or renegotiating their contracts, said the
commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

HD         DJ UPDATE: EU Fines Elevator Makers EUR992M For Price-Fixing

BRUSSELS, Feb 21, 2007 (DJCS via Comtex) --
(Updates an item, published from around 1125 GMT, with company responses and further details.)

TD
The European Commission on Wednesday levied Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty, fining five
elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices.

ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million.

The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR790 million penalty levied in 2001 against makers of vitamin products, reflects the  Commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  Commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million  fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty
included this added charge, bringing its  fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

"Three million euros is lunch money," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team. Steeper  fines, such as the ones in the elevator case, "can have important financial consequences for companies," he added.

ThyssenKrupp shares fell about 2% to EUR38.60 after the  fine was disclosed. The other three companies had smaller dips in their share prices.
The Commission launched its investigation into the  elevatorand escalator  businesses in January
2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The Commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the Commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking. The  Commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was reduced by over

Page 59 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Otis said it will appeal the  Commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its parent company United Technologies said the  fine "will have no material impact" on its financial condition.

Schindler said it was "very surprised" at the size of the  fine since the companies were charged with local collusion, not running a pan-European  cartel.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the Commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.
"Companies have the option of seeking damages" or renegotiating their contracts, said the
Commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

HD           CHECK URGED AFTER LIFT MANUFACTURERS' CARTEL SCAM EXPOSED WC          660 words
PD           21 February 2007

LP
By Geoff Meade, PA Europe editor, Brussels

The Government was urged today to check whether a massive scam run by a  cartel of lift manufacturers on the continent has also hit British taxpayers, public authorities and property developers.

TD
The call came after the European Commission imposed fines of more than £665 million on four
major makers of lifts and escalators for illegally rigging prices in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands.
For at least a decade public and private companies have been 'ripped off, big time'' said  Commission
spokesman Jonathan Todd.

The cartel colluded to fix the cost of projects installing and maintaining lifts and  escalators for everything from hospitals and railway stations to shopping centres and commercial buildings.
Even the European  Commission's own Brussels headquarters and the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg were victims of the scams operated by  Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  KONE.

The web of secretly-fixed procurement contracts and rigged prices could extend across the EU, warned Mr Todd.

'Taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time. Prices were way above what they should have been. Today's decision (to impose  fines) is based on information we have been able to prove,'' he said.

'This does not mean that the  cartel activity did not take place in other member states. It simply means we did not have sufficient proof on which to base a decision.''
He added: 'It is up to the competition authorities in each member state to verify whether this  cartel
activity may also have taken place on their territory.''

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels.

'The damage caused will last for many years because these cartels covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  escalators for these companies: the memory of this fine should last just as long.''

Liberal Democrat MEP Sharon Bowles said: 'The behaviour of these companies is only made worse by the fact that some of their contracts were made with hospitals where every single penny counts.
'These companies have a responsibility to offer real genuine prices for their goods and services.''

Mr Todd explained how the dominant firms in the cartels rigged the market so that they all got a share. Three of the four in the  cartel club would bid wildly above the fourth, more or less ensuring that the already-inflated lowest bid won the tender.

Page 61 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
On another contract, another member of the  cartel would be selected to submit the lowest bid.

Senior management staff of the companies - managing directors, sales and services directors, and heads of customer services departments, would meet regularly and in secret.

'There is evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal and they took care to avoid detection,'' said a  Commission statement.

'They usually met in bars and restaurants, they travelled to the countryside or even abroad and they used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.''

The effects of the scams could last as long as 50 years because of the maintenance contracts tied to the installation deals - although affected firms could now challenge the contracts through national courts.

The fact that the  Commission itself and the European Court were victims of the scams emerged as investigations went on.
'My understanding is that the contract for the provision of  elevators  and escalators in this building
(EU Commission HQ) and in the Court of Justice were indeed covered by the cartel,'' said Mr Todd.
That could be unfortunate for the companies facing the largest collective  fine ever imposed by
Brussels - because their only appeal is to the European Court.

If the  fines do stand, EU taxpayers will benefit, because the money is put into the EU budget, reducing the member states' annual contributions.

HD          EU Fines Finnish  Kone 142 Mln Euro in Cartel Case

The EU Commission imposed a 142 mln euro ($186.5 mln)  fine on Finnish company Kone Oyj for anticompetitive practices in the  elevator and escalator  market in Germany and the Netherlands,  Kone said on February 21, 2007.

The ruling is the result of a three-year investigation into price-fixing in the elevator and escalator market in Europe, started in 2004. The  Commission had found Kone's subsidiaries in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands were involved in local anticompetitive practices prior to
2004.

TD
However, the company did not receive a  fine for Belgium and Luxembourg as it was the first to cooperate with the  Commission regarding these countries.

Kone said it would examine the  Commission's decision and would decide on potential further action.

Kone manufactures  elevators  and escalators, and provides maintenance of automatic building doors. The company generated net sales of 3.6 bln euro ($4.742 bln) for 2006.

OPERATOR: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to ThyssenKrupp conference call. At
this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and
instructions will follow at that time. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. I would just like to remind participants
that this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand you over to your chairperson, Mr. Claus
Ehrenbeck. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.

CLAUS EHRENBECK, HEAD OF IR, THYSSENKRUPP AG: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Claus Ehrenbeck from the IR team of ThyssenKrupp speaking. Also on behalf of the entire team I would like to welcome you to our today's conference call on the subject of today announced elevator fine. You can find all the relevant press releases, including the slides for this conference call, in
the IR section of our website.

TD
In a second I would like to hand over to ThyssenKrupp's CFO and Vice Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr. Ulrich Middelmann, who will provide you with more details. After that we will be pleased to take your questions. We are sure that you will understand that in this conference call we will exclusively answer questions who are dealing with the aforementioned subject, which is the  elevator fine.
So I would like now to hand over to Mr. Middelmann.

ULRICH MIDDELMANN, CFO, THYSSENKRUPP AG: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. This is Ulrich Middelmann speaking. I welcome you to this afternoon's conference call on the  fines of the E.U. Commission has imposed on elevator companies. Welcome also to Internet listeners who are following the online audio transmission.

I am sure that you are already aware of the reason for this call. Today the E.U.  Commission announced that it has imposed  fines on several elevator companies, including our Group segment ThyssenKrupp Elevator AG. The various elevator companies - Kone, Otis, Schindler and Mitsubishi - are accused of having reached price-fixing agreements for elevators  and escalators. These agreements were made at national level in the Benelux countries and Germany.

ThyssenKrupp has incurred a  fine in the amount of roughly EUR480m. As ThyssenKrupp has not yet received the complete notice of the  fine, we cannot yet fully assess whether it is justified. The ThyssenKrupp legal team will review the  fine notice and then decide whether to appeal. Although we did not have all the relevant information at present, our intention was to inform you as quickly as possible.
In the following I will shed some more light on what has happened, what the E.U. has done up to now, how
ThyssenKrupp has cooperated and how this  fine might affect our current year's financials.

I would like to start with the latter. The  fine definitely represents a significant amount. Nevertheless, since the financial structure of the Group is in excellent and rock-solid shape, the  fine will not cause financial problems for us. EBT guidance will be unaffected since it is, as you know, before major non-recurring items. The  fine will affect our bottom line in the second quarter but as a major non-recurring item. It will be
presented in the line item Other Operating Expenses in our income statement and will be allocated in full to our elevator segment.

The investment program that you know from the investor relations presentation will be unaffected. The investment grade rating is not in question, of course. The  fine of roughly EUR480m will fall due for payment three months after ThyssenKrupp has received the final decision of the E.U.  Commission. If ThyssenKrupp should decide to appeal against the  fine, there is also the option to provide a bank guarantee in order to avoid a cash outflow on due date.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's turn to the past for a moment again. On October 11, 2005 the European Commission announced the initiation of administrative  fine proceedings against the aforementioned companies in the elevator and escalator  industry. This also affected some European subsidiaries of ThyssenKrupp Elevator AG.
Prior to the initiation of the administrative  fine proceedings, the European  Commission had conducted
pre-investigations in Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxemburg at the beginning of 2004. As part
of these pre-investigations, several dawn raids were carried out at the premises of  Kone, Schindler, Otis,
ThyssenKrupp and Mitsubishi in the European Union and at the corresponding associations. The subject of
the administrative  fine proceedings is that the respective companies are accused of having violated
European antitrust law in connection with the manufacturing and servicing of  elevators  and escalators in
certain member states of the European Union.

ThyssenKrupp has been cooperating with the antitrust authorities and started internal investigations across Europe at a very early stage to support the investigation process of the  cartel authorities. In the course of our own investigations, we discovered that there had been breaches of conduct by individual employees in local markets of the  elevator segment. However, there was no Europe-wide agreement and no systematic wrongdoing.

As a result, ThyssenKrupp took personal action and consequently individual executives in the markets concerned had to leave the Company and are no longer with ThyssenKrupp. It goes without saying that part of our cooperation with the E.U.  Commission involved informing them of the results of the internal examination.

For the future, we have taken every step to avoid breaches of conduct at both ThyssenKrupp  Elevator AG and in the ThyssenKrupp Group. Therefore we are convinced that there will be no recurrence of these unfortunate events.

At the balance sheet date, end of September 2006, we did not make any financial provisions as the E.U. Commission's investigations had not yet taken such concrete form as to allow any reasonable assessment of possible financial consequences.

Ladies and gentlemen, a ThyssenKrupp legal team will review the  fine notice and then decide whether to appeal. It goes without saying that we will keep the capital markets informed about any new development in this matter.
Thank you for your attention and we are now ready to take your questions.
OPERATOR: Thank you. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael
Shillaker. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

MICHAEL SHILLAKER, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Yes, hello. It's Mike Shillaker from Credit Suisse in London. I've just got three brief questions. First of all, can you tell us is the  fine tax deductible? I suspect it's probably not but can you clarify that?

The second question is can you tell us what proportion of existing maintenance contracts would be affected by this ruling?

And the final question, can you give us a sense as to the extent that going forward the  elevator division will be impacted, because as I read it in the  Commission statement there is potential recourse under existing maintenance contracts, either through renegotiation or seeking damages, and also what this means for the pricing of maintenance contracts going forward? Thank you very much.

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Well, thank you for your question. First the issue of tax- deductible situation; we need further details. When we have the full decision, then we will make up our mind and later, when we meet together for the second quarter conference call, we can inform you in more detail. Actually we have not a clear [fairway]. We only have the press release from the E.U.  Commission and not the detailed decision. Therefore I ask for your understanding.

Then the portion of maintenance contracts which might be affected, well, it's difficult. We will consider this in the next couple of weeks. Our average length of contract for service activities is between five to 10 years, so we need to have a detailed investigation which contracts might be affected. You know that the time of the investigation of the E.U.  Commission is quite old in some parts, so we need further clarification. But we do not expect impacts on our profitability.
And then the third subject was -- did you -- Mr. Ehrenbeck?



Page 65 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CLAUS EHRENBECK: The third subject was how many contracts have to be negotiated or will this affect pricing, Mike, if I understood you correctly. We do not see that the contracts which we had negotiated after all those things became obvious were negatively affected. So we do not expect in the future a deterioration of our margin or profitability in the  elevator segment.

MICHAEL SHILLAKER: Okay. And you're not expecting any recourse from the existing contracts, because that of course is what the E.C.  Commission suggests? But you don't think there will be any recourse on contracts that were negotiated at the time of the investigation?
CLAUS EHRENBECK: If I may hand this question over to our General Counsel, which is Dr. Thomas
Kremer.

THOMAS KREMER, GENERAL COUNSEL, THYSSENKRUPP AG: Hello, Mr. Shillaker. Thomas Kremer speaking. Regarding your question, we just have to assess the situation, how it is and which damage claim could come up. Up to now we have no indication that any indemnification claim will be raised.
MICHAEL SHILLAKER: Okay. That's  fine. Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Hermann Reith. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

HERMANN REITH, ANALYST, BHF: Yes, hello. This is Hermann Reith from BHF in Frankfurt. It's on the item that ThyssenKrupp is punished with a 50% add-on regarded -- as it is regarded as a repeated offender. Has there been in the past some similar cases, where a company was  fined additionally
compared to the other participants of a  cartel with such an add-on? And how will be the probability that you can bring your interests into -- that means not to pay this 50% add-on?

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Middelmann speaking. Hello, Hermann. Thank you for your question. The 50% add-on obviously refers that we had some trouble in the stainless sector a couple of years ago and that the Commission considers us as a repeater. But this was in another segment and you know our legal
structure of the Group; the stainless segment has nothing -- nearly nothing to do with the  elevator segment. So we see this fully as a separate action. Therefore, when we see the whole decision in detail, we have -- respectively our legal team has to make up its mind whether this is a field to re-discuss with the Commission again.
HERMANN REITH: Have you heard of a similar case in the past?
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: I have to pass to Mr. Kremer, our legal counsel. He's -- THOMAS KREMER: Not exactly a comparable case, no.
HERMANN REITH: Okay. Okay, thank you.
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Thank you for your question.

OPERATOR: [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Coats. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

ALAN COATS, ANALYST, HSBC: It's Alan Coats, HSBC London. I just wondered what value of contracts was the EUR480m based on. Is there a value it's based on? And could there be a downward movement in that value and a downward movement of the  fine if you negotiate that? I'm assuming that EUR480m is the top fine that's possible. I'm assuming that it depends on a certain value of contracts affected because they're charging pro rata on that and I'm just wondering if the value could be reduced in any way.
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: In total -- hello, Alan. ALAN COATS: Hello.
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: In total, the value of the contracts is less than 5% of our whole turnover. The turnover of our  elevator business last fiscal year was EUR4.3b and the volume affected here is less than
5%.

ALAN COATS: Okay. So it's quite a small -- it's a small issue in terms of the Group. And I'm supposing that if there's ongoing negotiation, whether you should have such a very, very high  fine for such a small misdemeanor, if I may say.

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Yes. We have a similar feeling but, as I've said before, it's necessary to see the decision in all the details, the argumentation of the  Commission, and we expect the full wording in a

Page 66 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
fortnight or three weeks. Then I think our expert group will need some further three weeks. So I expect that we might have some more details when we meet for our conference call for the second quarter.

ALAN COATS: Thank you, very helpful. It certainly won't be more than EUR480m and might be significantly less, but that depends on legal advice really?
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Yes. ALAN COATS: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Peter Metzger. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

PETER METZGER, ANALYST, MM WARBURG & CO: Yes, good afternoon. It's Peter Metzger from MM Warburg in Hamburg. As Michael Shillaker has asked most of the questions I was interested in, I just wanted to know whether, independent of the final amount of the  fine, don't you expect as a consequence of this antitrust case that the competition among the  elevator companies might increase going forward, especially on the maintenance and service contracts, and that that will have a negative impact on your margin potential in that business area?

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: I would believe -- hello, Peter. I would believe no. Because, as I mentioned before, 5% of our whole volume is affected. Isolated actions here of certain individuals were the case, so I do not think that other big European markets are affected nor the United States or South America or the Pacific Rim. We should consider this as a number of isolated separate actions between certain individuals.
PETER METZGER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Christian Obst. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

CHRISTIAN OBST, ANALYST, UNICREDIT: Christian Obst from UniCredit in Munich. You mentioned it currently, is it right there are further proceedings concerning the  elevator business in the U.S. and Brazil? And what is the entire volume of this kind of business and what is the current situation there? And can we expect more in these things to come?

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Hello, Christian. There are definitely no further investigations in the mentioned areas, United States, South America or anywhere. This -- and Mr. Kremer will add something.

THOMAS KREMER: Yes. I want to confirm what Mr. Middelmann told you but first you are also aware that in Austria there is one further unrelated proceeding ongoing.
CHRISTIAN OBST: Okay. THOMAS KREMER: But I can't --
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Not in those areas you mentioned. CHRISTIAN OBST: Okay. Thank you very much.
THOMAS KREMER: Again, we do not expect any further risk of  fines resulting from such proceedings in
Austria [multiple speakers] answer your question.
CHRISTIAN OBST: Yes, okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. Our next question comes from the line of Asad Abedi. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

ASAD ABEDI, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Hi. This is Asad Abedi from Merrill Lynch in London. Two questions for you. The first, what was the time period that the investigation looked at? Which contracts did they investigate?

And the second, did you say that you do not expect any deterioration of  elevator margins going forward? Thank you.

CLAUS EHRENBECK: Asad, the last -- your second question, yes, we have said that we do not expect any deterioration from -- deterioration of our margin in the  elevator business, this is true.
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: And the time period?
CLAUS EHRENBECK: Yes, the time period of the contracts, from 2005 on.
Page 67 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
THOMAS KREMER: No, no. The E.U.  Commission investigated periods from the mid-90s to early 2004. That's the relevant period.
ASAD ABEDI: Great, thank you. CLAUS EHRENBECK: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Winfried Becker. Please go ahead and announce your company name and location.

WINFRIED BECKER, ANALYST, SAL OPPENHEIM: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Winfried Becker, Oppenheim Research in Frankfurt. A question maybe more on some formal aspects. When you will receive the full statement from the E.U.  Commission and you will decide to argue against it, could you comment a bit on timeframe, how the process then is going on and how this could affect your potential payment to the E.U.  Commission? Thank you.

THOMAS KREMER: Hello. This is again Thomas Kremer speaking. We will have to pay, as already outlined, the fine within a period of three months after having received the full decision of the E.U. Commission. We have the possibility to appeal the decision in court. These proceedings may last for several years and -- but, again, payment has to be made prior to that.

WINFRIED BECKER: And then if you were successful by appealing, you will maybe in some years get back some of your cash?
THOMAS KREMER: Yes.
WINFRIED BECKER: Could that be the case? THOMAS KREMER: That's the situation, exactly. WINFRIED BECKER: Okay.
ULRICH MIDDELMANN: That was the case in the stainless situation too. It lasted several years. WINFRIED BECKER: Yes, okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
OPERATOR: And our last question comes from the line of Andy Mohinta. Please go ahead, sir.

ANDY MOHINTA, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Hi, good afternoon. It's Andy from JP Morgan. I have one question. Just looking at the relative market share of ThyssenKrupp in the  elevator space compared to Kone, Schindler and Otis, the fine does seem pretty disproportionate compared to what the other companies have been charged. Is this simply because of the so-called repeat offender clause because of the stainless issue earlier on? Or -- I'm just trying to understand if there's anything I'm missing out here.

ULRICH MIDDELMANN: No, I think that's the case if you see a 50% additional punishment referring to the EUR480m. Obviously the normal situation would be EUR240m and this is more in line with the level of the other competitors. Comparing the market share, we are the number three in the world. So obviously it's the repeater punishment in reference to our stainless case we had in a different segment some eight, 10 years ago.
ANDY MOHINTA: Okay. Thank you. ULRICH MIDDELMANN: Thank you.
OPERATOR: And there is no further questions registered at this time, so I will hand the conference back to you gentlemen.

CLAUS EHRENBECK: So, as there seem to be no further questions, we would like to thank you for attending this conference call. The investor relations team will of course be happy to answer any further questions you may have. The audio stream for this call will be available for downloading from the Internet later on. And thank you again for your attention and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you. Goodbye.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The European  Commission on Wednesday handed down a record antitrust  fine of nearly a billion euros over several lift companies for running illegal cartels.
The lift makers  Otis, Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp groups were given a combined penalty worth
992 million euros, the biggest ever fine imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog for  cartel
violations.

TD
Those major lift companies was accused of operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

The investigation revealed that they rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

"The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators  -- for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long," the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The European  Commission on Wednesday handed down a record antitrust  fine of almost a billion euros over several lift companies for running illegal cartels.

The lift and  elevator makers Otis, Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp groups were given a combined penalty worth 992 million euros, the biggest ever fine imposed by the European Union 's antitrust watchdog for  cartel violations.

TD
Those major lift companies was accused of operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium,Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

The investigation revealed that they rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

Even the European Commission's headquarters in Brussels and the EU courts building in Luxembourg were affected by their cartel arrangement.

The effects of this  cartel may continue for 20 to 50 years as maintenance is often done by the companies that installed the equipment in the first place, and by cartelising the installation, the companies distorted the markets for years to come, the  commission said.
Among those companies, ThyssenKrupp alone had to pay almost half of the total  fine, the heaviest
ever imposed by the commission on a single company in a cartel case. The German group' s  fine was
increased by 50 percent to 480 million euros because it was a repeated offender.

Otis, a unit of U.S. conglomerate United Technologies Corp., received a  fine of 225 million euros, followed by Switzerland- based  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone of Finland with
142 million euros.
Japanese company Mitsubishi was also  fined 1.8 million euros for its limited role in the Dutch  cartel. "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply
but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators  - for these companies the memory of this
fine should last just as long," the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The European  Commission imposed a total  fine of 855 million euros on eight vitamin makers in 2001, the biggest penalty in an EU  cartel case before Wednesday's decision. The  fine was later reduced to
790 million euros by an EU court.

HD            Lift manufacturers fined €992 for price fixing

European Union regulators slapped their largest  price-fixing fine ever – €992m – on five lift makers today.
The was imposed for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in
Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

TD
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said in Brussels that the  fines were the "largest ever" for  price fixing
in the European Union.

"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Todd said.

"The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market."

German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp, Finland’s  Kone and Switzerland’s  Schindler Holding were fined under the decision, as was United Technologies unit  Otis Elevator of the United States and subsidiaries of Japan’s Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe.
ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, more than €479m, because the company was labelled a
"repeat offender" by EU regulators, Mr Todd said.
The company said in a statement that it would review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Otis was fined €225m, Schindler €144m, Kone €142m, and Mitsubishi’s Dutch subsidiary was  fined
€1.8m.

The European  Commission said the cartel had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, fix prices and share markets between at least 1995 and 2004. The  Commission said the companies
"did not contest the facts" found by EU regulators, adding none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations.
But Schindler said it was "very surprised at the size of the  fine," because it claimed the EU had
found "no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European  elevator industry".
It said in a statement that it had not yet decided whether it would appeal.

Kone also said it will "examine the  commission’s decision and decide on potential action."

Today’s fine tops a €750m fine imposed last month against 10 companies for running a  cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, reflecting stepped-up action by EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes against  price fixing.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 -- The European  Commission on Wednesday imposed a record total of 992 million euro in fines on 14 elevator makers, including Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe, for forming cartels.

''It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels,'' Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in announcing the fine against price fixing  in the European Union.

TD
''The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their actions and went ahead anyway.''

Among the companies, Germany's ThyssenKrupp was  fined about 480 million euro, while  Otis          Elevator and Schindler Elevator, both from the United States, were  fined 225 million euro and 143 million euro respectively.
Mitsubishi Elevator from Japan was fined 1.84 million euro.

The companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other for the installation and management of  elevators  and escalators between 1995 and 2004, the commission said.

BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The European  Commission fined lift manufacturers a record 992 million euros ($1.3 billion) on Wednesday for fixing prices and carving up markets in the biggest  cartel penalty in European Union history.

TD
Germany's ThyssenKrupp incurred the highest ever  fine for a single company -- 480 million euros ($630.6 million) -- raised by 50 percent because it was a repeat offender. The company said it would decide whether to appeal.

The companies had fixed prices, rigged bids and allocated projects to each other in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004, the EU's competition regulator said.

"The result of this cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Commission competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

"Its effects will be felt for the next 20 to 50 years, because a lot of these companies make their money from the maintenance which is done following the installation of the  escalators and elevators,"  he told a news conference.

Todd invited companies that had suffered at the hands of the  cartel to pursue damages in national courts and seek to annul and renegotiate long-term service contracts.

The huge fines reflected the scale of the market, the size of the companies and the long-term effects, he said.
Among the many buildings affected were the headquarters of the European  Commission, the
Berlaymont, from which Todd was speaking, and the European Union courts building in Luxembourg.
IDENTIFIED AND DISMISSED
The Commission fined Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United States, 225 million euros. "The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance
programmes were quickly identified and dismissed," Chairman and Chief Executive George David said
in a statement.

Kone of Finland was fined 142 million euros and said: "We have only received a short release and know the amount of the fine and are expecting more information."

Schindler of Switzerland was fined 144 million euros.  Schindler said it was "very surprised at the size of the fine since the European Commission found no evidence of pan-European collusion."  Schindler said the Commission had looked for pan-European evidence but dropped the accusation.

Mitsubishi Electric Corp of Japan was  fined 1.8 million euros for participating in the Dutch portion of the cartel.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes was unapologetic for the size of the  fines.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels," she said in a statement.

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway. The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years," she said.

(Updates shares)

HELSINKI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Finnish lift and  escalator  maker Kone said it would make a first-quarter provision for a European  Commission fine of 142 million euro ($187 million) for  price-fixing, but had yet to decide on any appeal.

TD
"We need to familiarise ourselves with the decision before we can comment whether we are going to complain,"  Kone Executive Vice President Klaus Cawen told Reuters on Wednesday.

Kone spokeswoman Minna Mars said Kone would book the fine as an one-off cost in its first-quarter earnings, regardless of whether appeals or simply decides to pay the  fine.

Kone said it was fined for anticompetitive practices in Germany and the Netherlands, but not penalised in relation to Belgium and Luxembourg, where it had been the first company to cooperate with the  Commission in its investigations.

Kone's Cawen said the lift maker had made efforts to increase its employees' knowledge on competition law and carried out an internal investigation at the time in 2004, when the case became public.
The Commission fined Kone and four other lift manufacturers a total of 992 million euros for
price-fixing.
The others include ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United
States,  Schindler of Switzerland and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.

Kone shares were 0.4 percent lower at 45.73 euros by 1501 GMT, outperforming the Helsinki bourse general index <.OMXHPI>, down 0.6 percent.

FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - German elevator and escalator  manufacturer ThyssenKrupp said on Wednesday it would review an EU Commission fine of 480 million euros ($631 million) for
price-fixing before deciding whether to pursue further legal measures.

"A ThyssenKrupp legal team will review the fine notice and then decide whether to appeal," the company continued, adding it wsa accused of price-fixing agreements made at a national level in the Benelux countries and Germany.
United Technologies unit  Otis, Finnish firm  Kone as well as Schindler of Switzerland were also  fined

(Adds Schindler decision to appeal, updates headline)

ZURICH, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Swiss elevator and escalator  maker Schindler said on Wednesday it would appeal against a European Commission decision to fine it 144 million euros ($189.2 million) for price fixing.

TD
"Schindler has decided to appeal," a company spokesman said late on Wednesday, adding that the appeal would be in the next few weeks.

Schindler is first waiting for the reasons for the  fine, would should be available in two weeks, he said.

In an earlier statement,  Schindler had said it was "surprised at the size of the  fine since the European Commission found no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European elevator industry.

Schindler said it had cooperated with the  Commission since it started the investigation in January
2004.
The Commission fined Schindler and four other lift manufacturers a total of 992 million euros for
price-fixing.
The others include ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United
States,  Kone of Finland and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.

Participation certificates in  Schindler, which is the world's second largest lift and  escalator  maker, closed more than 4 percent higher on Wednesday at 83.00 Swiss francs, outperforming a largely flat Swiss midcap index <.SMIM>.
"The increase in the share price implies that markets were expecting a heftier  fine based on
Schnindler's global market size," Maria Ivek, analyst at Credit Suisse, said.

BOSTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp. said on Wednesday it plans to appeal a $295 million (225 million euro) fine levied against its  Otis elevator unit by the European  Commission for its alleged participation in a price-fixing cartel.

The diversified manufacturer said the  fine would have "no material impact on UTC's financial condition."

"The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance programs were quickly identified and dismissed," said Chairman and Chief Executive George David, in a statement.

HD         UPDATE 1-ThyssenKrupp says fine won't hurt Elevator margins

(Adds comments from conference call with management)

FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - German industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp does not expect profitability at its high-margin Elevator unit to decline as competition returns to normal following an EU crackdown on a price-fixing cartel.

TD
Earlier, the EU  Commission levied a record 480 million euro ($630.6 million) fine on the company for its role in a scheme during the mid-nineties to 2004 that also included Schindler , Kone , Mitsubishi Electric Corp and United Technologies subsidiary  Otis.

"We do not see that the contracts which we had negotiated after all those things became obvious were negatively affected. so we do not expect in the future a deterioration of our margin or profitability in the elevator segment," Claus Ehrenbeck, head of investor relations, told a conference call with analysts.

ThyssenKrupp Chief Financial Officer Ulrich Middelmann said the breach was a one-off, adding it would not happen again.

"In the course of our own (internal) investigations we discovered that there had been breaches of conduct by individual employees in local markets of the  Elevator segment. However there was no Europe-wide agreement and no systematic wrongdoing," Middelmann told the analysts.

The Commission's competition spokesman, Jonathan Todd, had earlier invited companies that had suffered at the hands the  cartel to pursue damages in national courts and seek to annul and renegotiate long-term service contracts.

Maintenance contracts, often concluded after installation, usually last several years and are a lucrative business providing stable cash flow.
Middelmann said it was difficult to say how many maintenance contracts would be affected by the EU
finding and that the group would have to consider this over the next couple of weeks.
REPEAT OFFENDER

"Our average length of contracts for service activities is between five to 10 years, so we need to have a detailed investigation which contracts might be affected. You know that the time of the investigation of the EU Commission is quite old in some parts so we need further clarification," he said.

When asked to what possible extent they expected damage claims or recourse from customers, ThyssenKrupp general counsel Thomas Kremer said: "We just have to assess the situation how it is ... up to now we have no indication that any indemnity claim will be raised."

Middelmann said he expected some possibility to reduce the size of the  fine, in which ThyssenKrupp suffered a 50 percent additional penalty for being a repeat offender.

Since its  Elevator segment only generated 4.3 billion euros in sales last year, the 480 million euros exceeded the general maximum limit for  fines of 10 percent of revenue.

The group's forecast of significantly more than 2.5 billion euros in pretax profit in the current fiscal year
2006/07 to the end of September will not be affected, it said, since the target is before major
non-recurring items. The fine will affect the company's bottom line in the second quarter and would be
fully allocated to the Elevators  segment.
ThyssenKrupp said it is considering whether to appeal against the  cartel finding.

HD     EU slaps €992 million (US$1.3 billion) fine on elevator makers for price fixing

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators slapped their largest  price-fixing fine ever --
€992 million (US$1.3 billion) -- on five elevator makers Wednesday for operating cartels for the
installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fines were the "largest ever" for  price fixing  in the European
Union.

TD
"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Todd told reporters. "The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market."

German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG, Finland's  Kone Corp. and Switzerland's Schindler Holding AG were fined under the decision, as was United Technologies Corp.'s unit Otis Elevator Co. of the United States and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV.

ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, over €479 million (US$630 million), because the company was labeled a "repeat offender" by EU regulators, Todd said.
The company said in a statement that it will review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Otis was fined €225 million (US$295.8 million),  Schindler €144 million (US$189.3 million),  Kone €142 million (US$187 million), and Mitsubishi's Dutch subsidiary was  fined €1.8 million (US$2.37 million).

The European  Commission said the cartel had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, fix prices and share markets between at least 1995 and 2004. The  Commission said the companies "did not contest the facts" found by EU regulators, adding none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations.

But Schindler said it was "very surprised at the size of the  fine," because it claimed the EU had found "no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European  elevator industry." It said in a statement that it had not yet decided whether it would appeal.

Otis, however, said it would appeal. "Otis and UTC first disclosed this investigation in early 2004, have cooperated fully with the European Commission, and received full or partial reductions in penalties in all jurisdictions for this cooperation," the company said in a statement.

Kone, the world's fourth largest elevator and escalator  maker, also said it had cooperated with Commission officials in the cartel investigation as soon as they heard about it in January 2004. It said it will "examine the commission's decision and decide on potential action."




Page 84 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Wednesday's fine tops a €750 million (US$978 million)  fine imposed last month against 10 companies for running a cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, reflecting stepped-up action by EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes against  price fixing.

She has vowed a crackdown under new antitrust guidelines, which allow EU regulators to come down harder on repeat offenders like ThyssenKrupp, which faces an automatic 50 percent increase for repeated price-fixing activities.

The German company had already received a previous  cartel fine of €3.2 million (US$4.2 million) in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices. Wednesday's punishment brings ThyssenKrupp close to the €479 million (US$613 million)  fine paid by U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. for breaking European monopoly laws.

EU regulators found evidence from "numerous documents and corporate statements" to prove the companies allocated tenders and contracts for the sale, installation and maintenance of  elevators  "with the aim of freezing market shares and fixing prices," the  Commission said.

"Projects that were rigged included lifts and  escalators for hospitals, railway stations, shopping centers and commercial buildings," it said, adding such acts were decided upon between managing and service directors during regular meetings between  cartel members.

"There is evidence that the companies were aware that their behavior was illegal and they took care to avoid detection," the  Commission said, adding that the meetings usually took place in bars and restaurants or in secret locations outside cities to avoid suspicion.
EU officials said they even used prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

"The national management of these companies know what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," Kroes said in a statement. "The damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators."

The EU conducted surprise raids against the companies in January 2004 after EU regulators were tipped off.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined United Technologies'  Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fines represented the "largest ever" for  price fixing  in the European Union, and EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the costs of buildings and hospitals were "artificially bloated by these cartels."

"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Todd told reporters. "The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market."

Fined were Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., the corporate parent of Otis Elevator; German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG; Finland's  Kone Corp.; Switzerland's Schindler Holding AG and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV.

George David, chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials are "disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  Commission's and UTC's own investigations."

Otis was fined 225 million euros ($295.8 million).

"UTC will not tolerate unethical behaviors of any kind," he said. "The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance programs were quickly identified and dismissed and we have reinvigorated our ethics and compliance programs worldwide."

Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have cooperated with the European Commission, David said.  Otis and UTC have received full or partial reductions in penalties for its cooperation and the outcome will have "no material impact" on UTC's financial condition or  Otis' competitive position.

United Technologies is waiting for the full text of the decision and will review it before reporting on its impact on its 2007 earnings guidance. In addition, David said  Otis will appeal the decision to a European court.

ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, just over 479 million euros ($630 million), because the company was labeled a "repeat offender" by EU regulators, Todd said.
Frankfurt, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said it will review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Schindler 144 million euros ($189.3 million),  Kone 142 million euros ($187 million) and Mitsubishi's

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined United Technologies'  Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

The commission said the companies "did not contest the facts" found by EU regulators, adding none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations.

Wednesday's fine tops a 750 million euros ($978 million)  fine imposed last month against 10 companies for running a cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, reflecting stepped-up action by Kroes against price fixing.

She has vowed a crackdown under new antitrust guidelines agreed to last year that allow EU regulators to come down harder on repeat offenders like ThyssenKrupp, which faces an automatic 50 percent increase for repeated  price-fixing activities.

The German company had already received a previous  cartel fine, worth 3.2 million euros ($4.2 million) in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices. Wednesday's punishment brings ThyssenKrupp close to the 479 million euros fine paid by U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. for breaking European monopoly laws.

EU regulators found evidence from "numerous documents and corporate statements" to prove the companies allocated tenders and contracts for the sale, installation and maintenance of  elevators  "with the aim of freezing market shares and fixing prices," the  commission said.

"Projects that were rigged included lifts and  escalators for hospitals, railway stations, shopping centers and commercial buildings," it said, adding such acts were decided upon between managing and service directors during regular meetings between  cartel members.

"There is evidence that the companies were aware that their behavior was illegal and they took care to avoid detection," the  commission said, adding that the meetings usually took place in bars and restaurants or in secret locations outside cities to avoid suspicion.
EU officials said they even used prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

"The national management of these companies know what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," Kroes said in a statement. "The damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators."

The EU conducted surprise raids against the companies in January 2004 after EU regulators were tipped off.

HD     EU slaps $1.3 billion fine on 5 elevator makers

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined United Technologies'  Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fines represented the "largest ever" for  price fixing  in the European Union, and EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the costs of buildings and hospitals were "artificially bloated by these cartels."

TD
"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Todd told reporters. "The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market."

Fined were Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., the corporate parent of Otis Elevator; German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG; Finland's  Kone Corp.; Switzerland's Schindler Holding AG and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV.

George David, chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials are "disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  Commission's and UTC's own investigations."

Otis was fined 225 million euros ($295.8 million).

"UTC will not tolerate unethical behaviors of any kind," he said. "The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance programs were quickly identified and dismissed and we have reinvigorated our ethics and compliance programs worldwide."

Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have cooperated with the European Commission, David said.  Otis and UTC have received full or partial reductions in penalties for its cooperation and the outcome will have "no material impact" on UTC's financial condition or  Otis' competitive position.

United Technologies is waiting for the full text of the decision and will review it before reporting on its impact on its 2007 earnings guidance. In addition, David said  Otis will appeal the decision to a European court.

ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, just over 479 million euros ($630 million), because the company was labeled a "repeat offender" by EU regulators, Todd said.
Frankfurt, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said it will review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Schindler 144 million euros ($189.3 million),  Kone 142 million euros ($187 million) and Mitsubishi's
Dutch subsidiary was  fined 1.8 million euros ($2.37 million).

The European  Commission said the cartel had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, fix prices and share markets "between at least 1995 and 2004." It said the companies "did not contest the facts" found by EU regulators, adding none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations.

But Schindler said the company was "very surprised at the size of the  fine," because it claimed the EU had found "no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European  elevator industry." It said in a statement that it had not yet decided whether it would appeal.

Kone also said it will "examine the  commission's decision and decide on potential action."

HD        EU Slaps Record Near Billion-euro Fine on Lift Cartel
WC       596 words

LP
EU competition regulators imposed their biggest  fine ever on Wednesday, hitting lift makers Otis,
Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  Kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel.

The European Commission accused the companies of operating a  cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004.

TD
The European Union's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros ($1.3 billion) for rigging bids for procurement contracts, fixing prices, sharing out projects,
carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

The total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against Japanese company Mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to The Netherlands.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by
these cartels," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," she said. "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators  -- for these companies the memory of this  fine should last just as long," she added.
German firm gets stiffest  fine

German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest  fine ever imposed by EU regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender. The German group was  fined 480 million euros.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corporation, was given a  fine of 225 million euros for its role, followed by  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone with 142 million euros.

EU antitrust investigators conducted so-called "dawn raids" on lift and  escalator  makers across Europe in January 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel. After the raids, the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines.

The European  Commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the  cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants. They also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and
used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators' scrutiny.
EU campaign against illegal cartels

Kroes, Europe's top antitrust regulator, is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown.

Page 94 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
After bumper  fines in 2006, EU regulators in January ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment.
After the lift makers case, that  fine is now the third biggest ever against a  cartel.

Until Wednesday, the biggest  fine in a European cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001. The vitamin makers'  fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an EU court.
Despite the record  fine on the lift makers, higher penalties are likely in future cases after the
commission tightened its rules for calculating  fines, making them heavier for repeat offenders and
long-lasting cartels. The reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before.

The commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the European Court of Justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix  fines, especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission on Wednesday fined four elevator and
escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices, Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty.

ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and  Kone was fined EUR142.1 million. [ 02-21-07 0642ET ]

TD
The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR750 million penalty levied last month against makers of power-grid components, reflects the  commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty included this hike, bringing its fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

The commission launched its investigation into the  elevator business in January 2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and it fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement. [ 02-21-07 0712ET ]

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

The commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal. Spokesmen for Switzerland-based Schindler and the German unit of U.S.-based  Otis declined to comment.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the  commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.
"Companies have the option of seeking damages" or renegotiating their contracts, said the
commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) Wednesday said its pretax profit guidance for the fiscal year 2007 ending Oct. 31 will be unaffected by a EUR479.7 million  fine imposed by the European  Commission for price-fixing. [ 02-21-07

However, the complete  fine will affect the company's bottom line, Chief Financial Officer Ulrich
Middelmann told analysts in a conference call.

TD
Middelmann said that the fine will be booked as other operating expenses and will be allocated in full to the company's elevator subsidiary.

Earlier this month, ThyssenKrupp raised its earnings and sales forecasts for fiscal year 2007, saying it expects to "significantly exceed" its sustainable pretax profit goal of EUR2.5 billion, after reaching EUR2.62 billion in fiscal year 2006.

In the conference call Wednesday, CFO Middelmann also said that ThyssenKrupp's current investment plan won't be affected by the E.U.  fine.

Earlier Wednesday, the E.U.  commission fined ThyssenKrupp and three other  elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices. The  fine is Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty.

(Updates an item, published from around 1125 GMT, with company responses and further details.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission on Wednesday levied Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty, fining five  elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices.

TD
ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and  Kone was fined EUR142.1 million.

The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR790 million penalty levied in 2001 against makers of vitamin products, reflects the  Commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  Commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million  fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty included this added charge, bringing its  fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

"Three million euros is lunch money," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team. Steeper  fines, such as the ones in the elevator case, "can have important financial consequences for companies," he added.

ThyssenKrupp shares fell about 2% to EUR38.60 after the  fine was disclosed. The other three companies had smaller dips in their share prices.
The Commission launched its investigation into the  elevatorand escalator  businesses in January
2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The Commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the Commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking. The  Commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was

reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Otis said it will appeal the  Commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its parent company United Technologies said the  fine "will have no material impact" on its financial condition.

Schindler said it was "very surprised" at the size of the  fine since the companies were charged with local collusion, not running a pan-European  cartel.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the  Commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.

HD         EU Fines 4 Elevator Makers EUR992 Million  For Price Fixing

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission on Wednesday fined four elevator and
escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices, Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty.

ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million. [ 02-21-07 0642ET ]

TD
The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR750 million penalty levied last month against makers of power-grid components, reflects the  commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty included this hike, bringing its fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid in
2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

The commission launched its investigation into the  elevator business in January 2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and it fined the company EUR1.8 million.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," the commission's top antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a statement. [ 02-21-07 0712ET ]

In all four countries, high-ranking managers held regular meetings related to the  cartel. The commission found evidence that the companies knew their behavior was illegal. The managers were careful to avoid detection, meeting in rural areas or abroad and using prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

The commission said none of the companies contested these facts or other evidence unearthed in the investigation.

None of the companies qualified for the full immunity usually given to whistle-blowers.  Kone's penalty was reduced by about EUR138 million because it was the first to disclose the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg and provided key evidence in the German investigation.  Otis' penalty was reduced by over EUR208 million because it disclosed the Dutch  cartel and cooperated with investigations in the other countries.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal. Spokesmen for Switzerland-based Schindler and the German unit of U.S.-based  Otis declined to comment.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.

commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission on Wednesday levied Europe's largest-ever antitrust penalty, fining five  elevator and escalator  makers a total of EUR992 million for fixing prices.

TD
ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) was fined EUR479.7 million, United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX)  Otis unit was fined EUR224.9 million, Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.EB) was hit with a EUR143.7 million penalty and Kone was fined EUR142.1 million.

The sum of these  fines, which topped a EUR790 million penalty levied in 2001 against makers of vitamin products, reflects the  Commission's expanded powers to crack down on corporate cartels.

Under new antitrust guidelines established last year, the  Commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Since ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment - a EUR3.2 million  fine in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices - its  elevator penalty
included this added charge, bringing its  fine close to the record EUR497 million Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
paid in 2004 for breaking monopoly laws.

"Three million euros is lunch money," said Julian Joshua, a lawyer at the Howrey LLP law firm in Brussels and a former deputy head of the  commission's cartel team. Steeper  fines, such as the ones in the elevator case, "can have important financial consequences for companies," he added.

ThyssenKrupp shares fell about 2% to EUR38.60 after the  fine was disclosed. The other three companies had smaller dips in their share prices.
The Commission launched its investigation into the  elevatorand escalator  businesses in January
2004. Its probe showed that the four companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004.

The Commission said Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO), participated in the Dutch cartel and fined the company EUR1.8 million.

Otis said it will appeal the  Commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its parent company United Technologies said the  fine "will have no material impact" on its financial condition.

Schindler said it was "very surprised" at the size of the  fine since the companies were charged with local collusion, not running a pan-European  cartel.

Finland-based Kone and Germany's ThyssenKrupp said they will examine the  Commission's decision before deciding whether to appeal.

A key question in this case will be whether the companies' customers decide to sue. Over the past few years, the Commission has encouraged private damages claims to further deter  cartel offenders.

LONDON (Dow Jones) -- The European  Commission on Wednesday doled out its largest-ever  fine for cartel behavior, $1.3 billion (992 million euros), to four companies for allegedly rigging prices to install and maintain  escalators and elevators.

TD
Those fined include the Otis unit of United Technologies (UTX) , and Germany's ThyssenKrupp, which received the harshest fine for being a repeat offender.

The E.C. said the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets, and exchanged commercially important and confidential information in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
They did so from between at least 1995 and 2004, the  commission alleged.

"It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

In all four cartels, high-ranking national management participated in regular meetings and discussions and did so in a James Bond-esque way, the E.C. alleged -- they usually met in bars and restaurants, they traveled to the countryside or even abroad, and they used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.
None of the firms contested the facts, the E.C. said.

Otis was the first to provide the E.C. with information on the alleged  cartel in the Netherlands, and Finland's  Kone was the first to provide the commission with information on the cartels in Belgium and Luxembourg; as a result, neither firm was fined for activities in the markets for which they provided information.
ThyssenKrupp received the largest fine, 480 million euros.  Otis was fined 225 million euros,  Kone
was fined 142 million euros and Schindler was fined 144 million euros.

ThyssenKrupp shares weakened 2.5%,  Schindler shares rose 3.1% in Switzerland and  Kone was largely unmoved. United Technologies has yet to trade. [ 02-21-07 0816ET ]

ThyssenKrupp, Schindler, Kone and Otis - the world's biggest lift manufacturers - will today be punished and fined by the European Commission for operating a  price-fixing cartel.

The European Union antitrust watchdog issued formal charges against the four groups in October2005, and according to several people familiar with the case will hand down its final ruling at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow.

TD
Together, the groups control about two-thirds of the world market for  elevators  and escalators, with
Otis, a unit of US group United Technologies, the market leader.

They are accused of operating a  cartel in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg between 1998 and 2004. Tobias Buck, Brussels

HD          EC Fines Lift Makers 992 Mln Euro for Cartel Participation

The European  Commission (EC) has imposed a 992 mln euro ($1.303 bln)  fine on four of the world's largest lift makers, including German steel and engineering group ThyssenKrupp AG, for  cartel participation, European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said on February 21, 2007.

ThyssenKrupp alone will be  fined with a 479 mln euro ($629.62 mln), the largest  fine EC has ever imposed on a single company for  cartel violations.

TD
The fine of the German company has been raised by 50 pct, as ThyssenKrupp was a repeat offender, EC said. In 1998, the company was  fined on grounds of stainless steel  cartel participation.
The other  cartel participants are U.S. United Technologies Corp's  Otis, fined with 225 mln euro
($295.75 mln), Swiss  Schindler AG, with 143.7 mln euro ($188.88 mln), and Finnish  Kone Oyj, with
142.1 mln euro ($186.78 mln).

Kone and Otis will receive milder fines, as the companies are working in collaboration with the EC
investigators.

According to the EC, the companies were involved in  price-fixing for the installation and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and
2004.

The cartel participants rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information, the Commission said.

The construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially boosted by the cartels, Kroes said.
The effects of the cartels are to be felt in the next years as well, EC said.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission fines members of lifts and escalators cartels over €990 million

LP
Brussels, 21/02/2007 (Agence Europe) - Following the toughening up of the anti-trust measures adopted in July 2006, which saw a total of €1.8bn in  fines, the Commission announced on Wednesday 21
February that a series of  fines would be imposed for illegal agreements in 2007. The €992,312,200 in fines affect four companies involved in the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators Otis (owned by US United Technologies), ThyssenKrupp (Germany),  Schindler (Switzerland) and KONE (Finland), which were dividing up the markets in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995-2005. These  fines are the highest ever imposed by the  Commission.

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew that what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway”.

The Commission started the investigation on its own initiative using information brought to its attention. This led to surprise inspections in January 2004 at the premises of lift and  escalator  manufacturers throughout Europe. In turn, these inspections triggered many applications from the companies for immunity or reduction of  fines under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice.

The evidence uncovered in the inspections showed that the companies ran illegal cartels in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. This was further confirmed by numerous documents and corporate statements appealing for immunity.

The companies allocated tenders and other contracts for the sale, installation, maintenance and modernisation of lifts and  escalators with the aim of freezing market shares and fixing prices. Business secrets and confidential information on bidding patterns and prices between the  cartel participants were also exchanged. Projects that were rigged included lifts and  escalators for hospitals, railway stations, shopping centres and commercial buildings.

The allocation of projects was similar in all four member states. The companies informed each other of calls for tender, and co-ordinated their bids according to their pre-agreed  cartel quotas. Fake bids, too high to be accepted, were lodged by the companies who were not supposed to win the tender, in order to give the impression of genuine competition. The companies kept and circulated amongst themselves updated project lists for Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg. In Germany and the Netherlands, it was often agreed that the company that had a longstanding or good relationship with a particular customer should secure most of that customer's contracts; referred to by the companies as the "existing customers remain" principle.

In all four cartels high-ranking national management (such as managing directors, sales and services directors and heads of customer service departments) participated in regular meetings and discussions. There is evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal and they took care to avoid detection; they usually met in bars and restaurants, they travelled to the countryside or even abroad, and they used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

The fines reflect not just the severity of the offence but also the size of the markets in question. The companies involved are responsible for almost the entire supply and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in the countries in question, essential materials for the effective functioning of almost all kinds of institution.  Otis itself explained that the equivalent of the total world population uses its lifts, mechanical

escalators and moving pathways every nine days. Ms Kroes also drew attention to the fact that public institutions, such as hospitals had been affected by the excessive costs of these cartels.

The situation was further worsened by the fact that ThyssenKrupp companies were repeat offenders. Part of the group had already been charged for creating illegal cartels (EUROPE 9332) and all of its subsidiaries were involved in the cases being investigated, leading to a 50% increase in the  fines
imposed on them, in compliance with last June's enhanced anti-trust sanctions (EUROPE 9221). Among the 18 subsidiaries under investigation, only certain Kone subsidiaries and one Otis subsidiary benefited from clemency for having cooperated with the Commission in the required time frame.

The accused did not oppose the statement of objections or call for an oral hearing. The day the Commission's announcement was made ThyssenKrupp,  Schindler and Kone indicated that they would wait for an analysis of the  Commission's investigation before deciding on what approach they would take.

FOCUS: l'intérêt se portera sur l'amende infligée la semaine passée par l'UE au  cartel des ascenseurs et sur ce que le management de Schindler entend faire à ce propos. On souhaite aussi des informations sur la stratégie future de Schindler à l'égard de sa filiale Also. Enfin, les analystes s'intéresseront aux prévisions du groupe.

OBJECTIFS: le 25 janvier dernier,  Schindler a confirmé ses propres prévisions de bénéfices, malgré l'avertissement sur bénéfice de sa filiale Also. Le bénéfice de groupe consolidé, y compris le gain attendu de la vente d'immeubles, devrait se situer juste en-dessus de 500 mio CHF. Pour le secteur A&F, Schindler vise une marge d'EBIT de 10%, qui, selon des déclarations datant de 2006, ne sera toutefois pas atteinte.

PRO MEMORIA: le 21 février, la  Commission européenne a infligé une amende totale de près d'1 mrd d'EUR pour entente cartellaire à quatre fabricants d'ascenseurs, dont  Schindler, qui a écopé de 143,7 mio EUR. Le groupe a annoncé qu'il va faire appel.

Commentaires d'analystes (texte original):

"JP Morgan" (Nick Paton): Following the margin disappointment in 1H 06, our estimates look for the company to miss its 10% margin target in the E&E division with a 9.8% margin in the 2H, after an 8.6% margin in the 1H. The companys focus on new equipment will, we believe, put downward pressure on the margin which investors are unlikely to give the company credit for in the short term. We believe  Schindler will seek a structural exit from its ALSO business but that it needs to get greater scale before doing so. We believe ALSO needs revenues of Sfr8bn, a significant increase on our 2006 estimate of Sfr2.9bn. We believe the company has to increase its exposure to this unappealing business before an exit. "Neutral"

"ZKB" (Martin Hüsler): Nebst den Zahlen 2006 richten wir unser Augenmerk auf den Ausblick für 2007 und auf die strategische Weiterentwicklung der Logistiktochter ALSO. 2006 dürfte wachstumsbedingt einen Margenrückgang gebracht haben, da das profitablere Servicegeschäft weniger dynamisch gewachsen ist. Die höhere Dynamik im Neuanlagegeschäft wird jedoch zunehmend auch Unterhaltsgeschäft nach sich ziehen und zukünftig zu Margenverbesserungen beitragen. "Übergewichten"

"Vontobel" (Serge Rotzer): We will be interested in learning about the progress made in H2 06 regarding the implementation of the new growth strategy. The motto in H1 06 was 'growth before margins', leading Schindler to post stronger organic growth than its main competitors (13% vs. 10% for  Kone and ~5% for Otis). The price to be paid for this strategy was a temporary fall in the margin from 9.2% to 8.6% -  Otis
and Kone were both able to increase their margins during the same period. We will also be keen to get an assessment from management concerning a possible  fine in connection with the ongoing EU
investigation. "Market Perform"

"Credit Suisse" (Maria Ivek): We are optimistic about the demand outlook for  Schindlers Elevator and Escalator  (E+E) operations, with service and modernisation forecast to remain strong in Europe owing, in particular, to the SNEL (Safety Norm for Existing Lifts) legislation for existing  elevator systems being implemented across Europe. Demand for new installations should also remain solid owing to the global launch last year of Schindlers innovative E+E product portfolio. [...]ALSOs expansion plans will not be financed by Schindler and we would consider a potential disposal of the 65% stake in ALSO in the medium term as a positive for  Schindler. "Neutral"

(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) By Adam Cohen

TD
BRUSSELS -- A record 992 million euros ($1.3 billion)  fine imposed on five elevator and escalator makers for fixing prices shows European Union regulators are intent on using their expanded power to crack down on cartels.
ThyssenKrupp AG was fined 479.7 million euros, United Technologies Corp.'s  Otis unit was fined
224.9 million euros, Schindler Holding AG was hit with a 143.7 million euros penalty and Kone Corp.
was fined 142.1 million euros. The European  Commission also said Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV, a
division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., participated in the Dutch  cartel and fined the company 1.8 million
euros.

Under antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Because ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment, its  elevator penalty included this added charge.

The commission launched its investigation in January 2004. Its probe showed the companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and
2004.

HD       Elevator cartel slapped down for rigging contracts: Europe's  'big four' companies hit with fines totalling $1.3 billion U.S.

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - The penalty for being caught running a cartel in Europe increased dramatically yesterday when a group of elevator companies was hit with record fines totalling $1.3 billion U.S.

TD
Managers from the "big four"  elevator providers -- Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  Kone -- were caught rigging contracts in four European countries.

Deals to install and maintain  elevators  for hospitals, shopping centres and commercial buildings were carved up between the businesses, the European  Commission found.

The companies even colluded over new  elevators  for Commission headquarters in Brussels, as well as for the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, officials said yesterday.

The fine beats a $975 million penalty imposed last month on 11 firms in a  cartel for gas-insulated switchgear products.

It showed that Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, meant business when she vowed last year to use more of power available to her.
She can fine a company up to 10 per cent of its turnover for  cartel activity.

Ms. Kroes said that managers of the  elevator companies met in bars away from main cities and, to avoid detection, even used pay-as-you-go mobile phones when deciding whose "turn" it was to win a contract.

"National management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead, anyway,'' Ms. Kroes said.

''The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply, but also the subsequent maintenance of  elevators  and other lift devices.
For these companies, the memory of this  fine should last just as long."
ThyssenKrupp, branded a repeat offender because the German group was found to be in a steel  cartel in
1998, was given the largest antitrust  fine for one company so far, of about $623 million.
It said that it may fight the amount of the  fine, as did Finland's Kone, fined $185 million. Otis, part of the
American UTC, was  fined $291 million and the Swiss company Schindler $186 million.
Misubishi Elevator Europe was fined $2.34 million for its role in the Netherlands.

HD        FT.com site : Brussels imposes  992m fine on lift cartel. BY         Tobias Buck in Brussels

LP
The European Union's top antitrust regulator on Wednesday slapped a record 992m  fine on ThyssenKrupp and four other lift manufacturers, in the latest sign that the Brussels watchdog is drastically ramping up the financial pain for companies that violate competition rules.

It was the highest penalty imposed by the European Commission, topping a previous record set only last month. Brussels hopes that the recent increase in antitrust fines will deter companies from abusing the law and encourage people involved in cartels to blow the whistle on co-conspirators in exchange for immunity.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner and the -official behind Brussels' get-tough approach, said the lift and  escalator cartel had behaved "outrageously", while her spokesman said taxpayers, public authorities and other customers had been "ripped off big time" by the  cartel.

ThyssenKrupp, the German engineering group, received the toughest penalty,? 479.7m ($630m, GBP322.5m).  Otis, a unit of US group United Technologies, was  fined 224.9m, Schindler of Switzerland was given a 143.7m penalty and Finland's  Kone was ordered to pay 142.1m. Mitsubishi's Dutch subsidiary was  fined 1.8m.

Ms Kroes said: "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators.  For these companies the memory of this  fine should last just as long."

The Commission said the lifts installed in its own headquarters as well as at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg were covered by the  cartel. It urged customers of the companies involved in the agreement to renegotiate their contracts, and said they might have the right to sue for damages.
John Pheasant, a competition law specialist and partner at law firm Hogan?&?Hartson, said yesterday's
fines were part of a wider trend. "In terms of  fines, the Commission is now the toughest authority in
the world. The trend towards higher  fines started a few years back, but recently there has been a
distinct acceleration."

The Commission last year passed new fining guidelines that will allow Brussels to further increase the financial pain on abusive companies in all new cases. Officials have argued that the new rules will mean that more companies will be hit with the maximum penalty - a  fine equivalent to 10 per cent of their annual global turnover.

The lift  cartel operated in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg between at least 1995 and 2004. According to the  Commission, the groups co-ordinated their bids to ensure that a designated group would win specific contracts.

"[To agree on bids] they usually met in bars and restaurants, they travelled to the countryside or even abroad, and they used pre-paid mobile cards to avoid tracking," the  Commission said.

ThyssenKrupp, United Technologies,  Schindler and Kone said they were studying the Commission ruling, with  Schindler adding it was "very surprised" by the high  fines. United Technologies said Otis would appeal against the decision.

HD         Roundup: EU imposes  record billion-euro fine on lift cartels

BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The European  Commission on Wednesday handed down a record antitrust  fine of almost a billion euros over several lift companies for running illegal cartels.

The lift and  elevator makers Otis, Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp groups were given a combined penalty worth 992 million euros, the biggest ever fine imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog for  cartel violations.

TD
Those major lift companies was accused of operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

The European  Commission conducted surprise inspections in January 2004 at the premises of those companies throughout Europe after receiving a tip-off about the  cartel.

The three-year investigation revealed that they rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

Even the European Commission's headquarters in Brussels and the EU courts building in Luxembourg were affected by their cartel arrangement.

The effects of this  cartel may continue for twenty to fifty years as maintenance is often done by the companies that installed the equipment in the first place, and by cartelizing the installation, the companies distorted the markets for years to come, the  Commission said.

Among those companies, ThyssenKrupp alone had to pay almost half of the total  fine, the heaviest ever imposed by the Commission on a single company in a cartel case. The German group's  fine was increased by 50 percent to 480 million euros because it was a repeated offender.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corp., received a  fine of 225 million euros, followed by Switzerland-based  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone of Finland with
142 million euros.
Japanese company Mitsubishi was also  fined 1.8 million euros for its role limited to the Netherlands. "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply
but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators  - for these companies the memory of this
fine should last just as long." the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The United Technologies Corp. said in a statement that it felt disappointed with the  Commission's decision and will appeal to the European Court of First Instance. Nine  Otis employees in Europe have since been identified and dismissed for breaking the company's code of ethics.
ThyssenKrupp also said it was considering whether to appeal against the decision.

The European  Commission imposed a total  fine of 855 million euros on eight vitamin makers in 2001, the biggest penalty in an EU  cartel case before Wednesday's decision. The  fine was later reduced to
790 million euros by an EU court.

HD            EU fines lift companies €992m for role in cartel. BY            Jamie Smyth in Brussels

EU: The European  Commission has levied a record €992 million  fine on several lift manufacturers for illegally rigging bids and fixing prices.

The EU executive said yesterday the German firm ThyssenKrupp was given the highest penalty awarded to date in a  cartel case, €480 million, because it was a repeat offender.

TD
Four other companies were also handed multimillion euro  fines.
The commission investigation uncovered evidence that lift manufacturers had operated an illegal
cartel in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

It also admitted that it had fallen prey to the  cartel by purchasing lifts and maintenance contracts for its own headquarters, the Berlaymont.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg had also been ripped off by the lift manufacturer's  cartel. Hospitals, public authorities and private firms were also victims of the scam, according to the results of the  commission's cartel investigation initiated several years ago.

"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," said Jonathan Todd, spokesman for competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Its effects will be felt for the next 20-50 years because a lot of these companies make their money from the maintenance which is done following the installation of the  escalators and elevators."

The commission said that companies that had purchased maintenance contracts from the lift firms involved in the cartel could go to court to renegotiate their agreements.

Aside from ThyssenKrupp, the other parent companies implicated in the  cartel are: Otis, which is owned by US firm United Technologies, the Finnish firm Kone, Schildler of Switzerland and the Japanese firm Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. The commission fined Otis €225 million, Kone €142 million, Schindler €144 million and Mitsubishi €1.8 million. Seventeen different subsidiary firms took part in the cartel.

The investigation by the commission in the four member states concerned showed that bids were allocated in similar ways by the cartel. The companies informed each other of calls for tender and co-ordinated their bids according to their pre-agreed  cartel quotas.

Fake bids, too high to be accepted, were lodged by the companies who were not supposed to win the tender, in order to give the impression of genuine competition.

The companies kept and circulated amongst themselves updated project lists for Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg.

In all four cartels high-ranking national management (such as managing directors, sales and services directors and heads of customer service departments) participated in regular meetings and discussions.

BRUSSELS -- A record 992 million euros ($1.3 billion)  fine imposed on five elevator and escalator makers for fixing prices shows European Union regulators are intent on using their expanded power to crack down on cartels.
ThyssenKrupp AG was fined 479.7 million euros, United Technologies Corp.'s  Otis unit was fined
224.9 million euros, Schindler Holding AG was hit with a 143.7 million euros penalty and Kone Corp.
was fined 142.1 million euros. The European  Commission also said Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV,
a division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., participated in the Dutch  cartel and fined the company 1.8
million euros.

TD
Under antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Because ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment, its  elevator penalty included this added charge.

The commission launched its investigation in January 2004. Its probe showed the companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and
2004.

Brussels, Feb. 21 (Jiji Press)--The European Commission on Wednesday imposed a total of 992.31 million euros in fines on four U.S. and European elevator makers and a European unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. for forming price cartels for elevators  and escalators.
The four firms are industry leader  Otis of the United States,  Kone of Finland,  Schindler of
Switzerland and ThyssenKrupp of Germany.

TD
The total amount of  fines is the biggest for a price  cartel case, according to the  commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
Mitsubishi Elevator Europe BV, the Mitsubishi Electric unit in the Netherlands, was slapped with
fines of 1.84 million euros.

ThyssenKrupp was  fined 479.66 million euros, the biggest penalty imposed ever on any single company.
According to the  commission, the cartels were operated in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004 in a clear violation of its treaty rules.
Mitsubishi Elevator Europe was accused of having participated in the  cartel in the Netherlands. The commission said the companies "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and
allocated projects to each other." They also "shared markets, and exchanged commercially important
and confidential information," it said.

The effects of the cartels may continue for 20 to 50 years as maintenance work is often done by the companies that installed the equipment, the  commission said. "By cartelizing the installation, the companies distorted the markets for years to come," it said.

(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes in text) (Adds  Schindler decision to appeal, updates headline)

ZURICH, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Swiss elevator and escalator  maker Schindler said on Wednesday it would appeal against a European Commission decision to fine it 144 million euros ($189.2 million) for price fixing.

TD
"Schindler has decided to appeal," a company spokesman said late on Wednesday, adding that the appeal would be in the next few weeks.

Schindler is first waiting for the reasons for the  fine, would should be available in two weeks, he said.

In an earlier statement, Schindler had said it was "surprised at the size of the  fine since the European Commission found no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European elevator industry.

Schindler said it had cooperated with the  Commission since it started the investigation in January
2004.
The Commission fined Schindler and four other lift manufacturers a total of 992 million euros for
price-fixing.
The others include ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United
States,  Kone of Finland and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.

Participation certificates in  Schindler, which is the world's second largest lift and  escalator  maker, closed more than 4 percent higher on Wednesday at 83.00 Swiss francs, outperforming a largely flat Swiss midcap index <.SMIM>.
"The increase in the share price implies that markets were expecting a heftier  fine based on
Schnindler's global market size," Maria Ivek, analyst at Credit Suisse, said.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 -- European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined Otis Elevator and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators.
The union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the costs of buildings and hospitals were
''artificially bloated by these cartels.''

TD
Jonathan Todd, a union spokesman, said the  fines represented the ''largest ever'' for  price fixing
in the European Union.

The authorities said the  cartel operated from at least 1995 until 2004 in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

The companies fined were Otis, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford; the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp; Kone of Finland;  Schindler Holding of Switzerland; and subsidiaries of Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe, a unit of Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.

George David, the chief executive of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials were ''disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  commission's and U.T.C.'s own investigations.''
He said nine Otis employees were dismissed over the matter.

Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have cooperated with the European Commission, Mr. David said. Nevertheless, he said,  Otis will appeal the decision to a European court.

Otis was fined 225 million euros ($296 million).

ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, just over 479 million euros, because the company was labeled a ''repeat offender'' by regulators, Mr. Todd said.

ThyssenKrupp, which is based in Frankfurt, said it would review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Schindler was fined 144 million euros;  Kone, 142 million euros; and Mitsubishi's Dutch subsidiary,
1.8 million euros.

Schindler and Kone said they also would review the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

HD     EU slaps $1.3 billion cartel fine on United Technologies' Otis unit, 4 other elevator makers

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined United Technologies'  Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  fines represented the "largest ever" for  price fixing  in the European Union, and EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the costs of buildings and hospitals were "artificially bloated by these cartels."

TD
"The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time," Todd told reporters. "The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market."

Fined were Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., the corporate parent of Otis Elevator; German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG; Finland's  Kone Corp.; Switzerland's Schindler Holding AG; and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV.

George David, chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials are "disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  Commission's and UTC's own investigations."

Otis was fined 225 million euros ($295.8 million).

"UTC will not tolerate unethical behaviors of any kind," he said. "The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance programs were quickly identified and dismissed and we have reinvigorated our ethics and compliance programs worldwide."

Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have cooperated with the European Commission, David said.  Otis and UTC have received full or partial reductions in penalties for its cooperation and the outcome will have "no material impact" on UTC's financial condition or  Otis' competitive position.

United Technologies is waiting for the full text of the decision and will review it before reporting on its impact on its 2007 earnings guidance. In addition, David said  Otis will appeal the decision to a European court.

ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, just over 479 million euros ($630 million), because the company was labeled a "repeat offender" by EU regulators, Todd said.
Frankfurt, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said it will review the  fine and then decide whether to appeal.

Schindler was fined 144 million euros ($189.3 million),  Kone 142 million euros ($187 million) and
Mitsubishi's Dutch subsidiary was  fined 1.8 million euros ($2.37 million).

Mitsubishi Elevator Europe has received notice of the  fine and will decide how to respond after reviewing the details, parent company Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said in a statement. Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Electric holds a 51 percent stake in the European  elevator maker; Dutch construction company TBI Holdings BV owns the remainder.

The European  Commission said the cartel had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, fix prices and share markets "between at least 1995 and 2004." It said the companies "did not contest the facts" found by EU regulators, adding none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations.

But Schindler said the company was "very surprised at the size of the  fine," because it claimed the EU had found "no evidence of pan-European collusion among companies in the European  elevator industry." It said in a statement that it had not yet decided whether it would appeal.

Kone also said it will "examine the  commission's decision and decide on potential action."

Wednesday's fine tops a 750 million euro ($978 million)  fine imposed last month against 10 companies for running a cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, reflecting stepped-up action by Kroes against price fixing.

She has vowed a crackdown under new antitrust guidelines agreed to last year that allow EU regulators to come down harder on repeat offenders like ThyssenKrupp, which faces an automatic 50 percent increase for repeated  price-fixing activities.

The German company had already received a previous  cartel fine, worth 3.2 million euros ($4.2 million) in 1998 for fixing stainless steel prices. Wednesday's punishment brings ThyssenKrupp close to the 479 million euros fine paid by U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. for breaking European monopoly laws.

EU regulators found evidence from "numerous documents and corporate statements" to prove the companies allocated tenders and contracts for the sale, installation and maintenance of  elevators  "with the aim of freezing market shares and fixing prices," the  commission said.

"Projects that were rigged included lifts and  escalators for hospitals, railway stations, shopping centers and commercial buildings," it said, adding such acts were decided upon between managing and service directors during regular meetings between  cartel members.

"There is evidence that the companies were aware that their behavior was illegal and they took care to avoid detection," the  commission said, adding that the meetings usually took place in bars and restaurants or in secret locations outside cities to avoid suspicion.
EU officials said they even used prepaid mobile phone cards to avoid tracking.

"The national management of these companies know what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway," Kroes said in a statement. "The damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators."

The EU conducted surprise raids against the companies in January 2004 after EU regulators were tipped off.

WSJ(2/22) EU  Fines Companies For Price-Fixing
(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) By Adam Cohen

TD
BRUSSELS -- A record 992 million euros ($1.3 billion)  fine imposed on five elevator and escalator makers for fixing prices shows European Union regulators are intent on using their expanded power to crack down on cartels.
ThyssenKrupp AG was fined 479.7 million euros, United Technologies Corp.'s  Otis unit was fined
224.9 million euros, Schindler Holding AG was hit with a 143.7 million euros penalty and Kone Corp.
was fined 142.1 million euros. The European  Commission also said Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV, a
division of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., participated in the Dutch  cartel and fined the company 1.8 million
euros.

Under antitrust guidelines established last year, the  commission can levy larger fines and apply an automatic 50% increase for repeat  cartel offenders. Because ThyssenKrupp had a previous  cartel punishment, its  elevator penalty included this added charge.

The commission launched its investigation in January 2004. Its probe showed the companies fixed prices and rigged bids in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and
2004.

HD      CARTELS : LIFT CARTEL: LARGEST FINES EVER WC     495 words

On 21 February, the European  Commission announced swingeing fines totalling over €992 million against 17 companies for involvement in a series of cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators. It also admitted that as well as being prosecutor, the  Commission was itself a victim:
the lifts in the Commission's Brussels headquarters, the Berlaymont building - and those in the European
Court complex in Luxembourg - were installed by companies involved in the  cartel.

The illegal agreements covered Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, involving four major company groupings:  KONE - fined €142,120,000;  Otis - fined €224,932,950;  Schindler -
€143,748,000 and ThyssenKrupp. The fine against ThyssenKrupp was increased by 50% for previous cartel activity resulting in a €479,669,850 penalty - the largest ever against one group of companies. Another single firm involved was Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe, which participated in the Dutch  cartel: it was fined €1,841,400.

TD
Over at least five years from 1995 to 2004, senior management of the firms travelled regularly to secret locations to discuss  cartel arrangements. The  Commission investigation, which was not prompted by a whistleblower, began with surprise inspections in January 2004. These set off a flurry of immunity applications, which alerted the Commission to the fact that the  cartel was also active in Belgium and Luxembourg. Some  KONE subsidiaries and Otis Netherlands were granted full immunity for supplying this information.

The fact that many of the contracts were public and subject to tenders shows just how bold the  cartel was. Not content with fixing prices, sharing markets and exchanging confidential information, the companies involved in the  cartel blatantly rigged bids for major public procurement contracts. They circulated information on calls for tender and took turns to win'. The firm with its name at the top of the rota would submit a bid and all the others would ensure their bids were higher: the apparent competitive process was therefore a sham.

The level of the  fines reflects the size of the companies and the value of the markets. In the words of Commission spokesperson Jonathan Todd, the  cartel resulted in taxpayers, public authorities and property developers being "ripped off big time". "Prices were way above what they would have been otherwise," he said. The effects of the  cartel will continue to be felt for the next 20-50 years, because the contracts concerned both installation and maintenance. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes commented, "the memory of these  fines should last just as long."

Todd went on to explain that companies or public bodies affected by the  cartel could use the Commission decision as grounds for renegotiating their contracts (in some member states they may have a legal right to do so) or could invoke the  Commission decision if they chose to take action for
damages in national courts. He declined to say, however, whether the  Commission itself would be taking the lead and going down this legal avenue.

The European  Commission has imposed a record fine of 992m euros on five manufacturers of lifts and escalators, including German steel and engineering group ThyssenKrupp. The companies have been accused of entering into illegal price agreements in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg between 1995 and 2004; they are also said to have obtained contracts for each other and thus to have divided up the market among themselves. ThyssenKrupp alone will have to pay 479.7m euros, the highest ever individual fine imposed by the EU.

As the company has not made any reserves for the  fine on its balance sheet, the  fine will place a burden on ThyssenKrupp's accounts. It is also thought that customers could contest maintenance contracts with the company. ThyssenKrupp is examining whether to appeal against the  fine. The other companies in the cartel were US group Otis, Swiss company  Schindler, Finnish manufacturer  Kone and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe, which is based in the Netherlands.

HD       Brussels imposes  Euros 992m fine on lift cartel. BY       By TOBIAS BUCK

The European Union's top antitrust regulator yesterday slapped a record Euros 992m  fine on ThyssenKrupp and four other lift manufacturers, in the latest sign that the Brussels watchdog is drastically ramping up the financial pain for companies that violate competition rules.

It was the highest penalty imposed by the European Commission, topping a previous record set only last month. Brussels hopes that the recent increase in antitrust fines will deter companies from abusing the law and encourage people involved in cartels to blow the whistle on co-conspirators in exchange for immunity.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner and the -official behind Brussels' get-tough approach, said the lift and  escalator cartel had behaved "outrageously", while her spokesman said taxpayers, public authorities and other customers had been "ripped off big time" by the  cartel.
ThyssenKrupp, the German engineering group, received the toughest penalty, Euros 479.7m (Dollars
630m, Pounds 322.5m).  Otis, a unit of US group United Technologies, was fined Euros 224.9m,
Schindler of Switzerland was given a Euros 143.7m penalty and Finland's Kone was ordered to pay
Euros 142.1m. Mitsubishi's Dutch subsidiary was  fined Euros 1.8m.

Ms Kroes said: "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators.  For these companies the memory of this  fine should last just as long."

The Commission said the lifts installed in its own headquarters as well as at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg were covered by the  cartel. It urged customers of the companies involved in the agreement to renegotiate their contracts, and said they might have the right to sue for damages.

John Pheasant, a competition law specialist and partner at law firm Hogan &Hartson, said yesterday's fines were part of a wider trend. "In terms of  fines, the Commission is now the toughest authority in the world. The trend towards higher  fines started a few years back, but recently there has been a distinct acceleration."

The Commission last year passed new fining guidelines that will allow Brussels to further increase the financial pain on abusive companies in all new cases. Officials have argued that the new rules will mean that more companies will be hit with the maximum penalty - a  fine equivalent to 10 per cent of their annual global turnover.

The lift  cartel operated in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg between at least 1995 and 2004. According to the  Commission, the groups co-ordinated their bids to ensure that a designated group would win specific contracts.

"(To agree on bids) theyusually met in bars and restaurants, they travelled to the countryside or even abroad, and they used pre-paid mobile cards to avoid tracking," the  Commission said.

ThyssenKrupp, United Technologies,  Schindler and Kone said they were studying the Commission ruling, with  Schindler adding it was "very surprised" by the high  fines. United Technologies said Otis would appeal against the decision.

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators yesterday  fined United Technologies Corp.'s  Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3-billion (U.S.) for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the fines represented the “largest ever” for  price fixing  in the European Union, and EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the costs of buildings and hospitals were “artificially bloated by these cartels.”

“The result of this  cartel is that taxpayers, public authorities and property developers have been ripped off big time,” Mr. Todd said. “The companies ensured that by rigging the bids and sharing the markets that the prices paid for the installation and the maintenance were way above what they would have been if there had been a competitive market.”

TD
Fined were United Technologies Corp., of Hartford, Conn., the corporate parent of Otis Elevator; German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG; Finland's  Kone Corp.; Switzerland's Schindler Holding AG and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi  Elevator Europe BV.

George David, chairman and chief executive officer of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials are “disappointed by the conduct revealed through the  Commission's and UTC's own investigations.”

Otis was fined €225-million or $295.8-million.

“UTC will not tolerate unethical behaviours of any kind,” he said. “The nine local  Otis employees who violated our code of ethics and regulatory compliance programs were quickly identified and dismissed and we have reinvigorated our ethics and compliance programs worldwide.”

Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have co-operated with the European Commission, Mr. David said.  Otis and UTC have received full or partial reductions in penalties for its co-operation and the outcome will have “no material impact” on UTC's financial condition or Otis's competitive position.

United Technologies is waiting for the full text of the decision and will review it before reporting on its impact on its 2007 earnings guidance. In addition, Mr. David said  Otis will appeal the decision.
ThyssenKrupp was given the largest  fine, just over €479-million, because the company was labelled a
“repeat offender” by EU regulators, Mr. Todd said.

HD              EU imposes  record fine on lift cartels

Indo-Asian News Service Brussels, Feb 22 -- The European  Commission has handed down a
record antitrust  fine of almost one billion euros ($1 billion) to several lift companies for running illegal
cartels.

A combined penalty worth 992 million euros - the biggest ever  fine imposed by the European Union's antitrust watchdog for cartel violations - was imposed Wednesday on lift and  elevator makers Otis, Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp groups.

TD
The companies were accused of operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and
escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004.

The European  Commission conducted surprise inspections in January 2004 at the premises of those companies throughout Europe after receiving a tip-off about the  cartel.

The three-year investigation revealed that they rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.
Even the European  Commission's headquarters in Brussels and the EU courts building in
Luxembourg were affected by their  cartel arrangement.

The effects of this  cartel may continue for 20-50 years as maintenance is often done by the companies that installed the equipment in the first place, and by cartelising the installation, the companies distorted the markets for years to come, the  commission said.

Among those companies, ThyssenKrupp alone had to pay almost half of the total  fine - the heaviest ever imposed by the commission on a single company in a cartel case. The German group's  fine was increased by 50 percent to 480 million euros because it was a repeated offender.

Otis, a unit of US conglomerate United Technologies Corp, received a  fine of 225 million euros, followed by Switzerland-based  Schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and  Kone of Finland with 142 million euros.
Japanese company Mitsubishi was also  fined 1.8 million euros for its role limited to the Netherlands. "The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial
supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and  elevators.  For these companies, the
memory of this  fine should last just as long," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The United Technologies Corp said in a statement that it felt disappointed with the  commission's decision and will appeal to the European Court of First Instance. Nine  Otis employees in Europe have since been identified and dismissed for breaking the company's code of ethics.
ThyssenKrupp also said it was considering appealing against the decision. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Indo-Asian News Service. HTS ir 070222-408308

BUILDING owners, property developers and hospital managers have been urged by Brussels to renegotiate their lift and  elevator maintenance contracts - or go to court - after a  cartel of major manufacturers was hit with the biggest anti-trust  fine in EU history.

The European  Commission yesterday fined lift manufacturers €992m for  price-fixing and carving up markets in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

TD
The rigged contracts, by the biggest names in the business, extended to the  Commission's own
Brussels HQ, the Berlaymont, and to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Germany's ThyssenKrupp received the highest-ever penalty for a single company, €480m - double that of the next-nearest  fine because the company, described as "recidivist" by the  Commission, is a repeat offender.
The Commission fined Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United States, €225m.  Kone of
Finland was fined €142m. Schindler of Switzerland was  fined €144m.

Otis estimates that the equivalent of the entire world's population travels on its lifts,  escalators and moving walkways every 9 days. The companies fixed prices, rigged bids and shared out projects for lifts and  escalators in hospitals, railway stations, shopping centres, office blocks and commercial buildings to each other between 1995 and 2004.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings, including hospitals, have been artificially bloated by these cartels. The national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal
their action and went ahead anyway. The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators."

Her spokesman, Jonathan Todd, who urged companies in all other member states to renegotiate their maintenance contracts or go to court, said the damage "will be felt for the next 20-50 years because a lot of these companies make their money from the maintenance which is done following the installation of the escalators and elevators".

HD          EU fines of Euro 992m for lift firms step up war on cartels

The penalty for being caught running a cartel in Europe increased dramatically yesterday when a group of lift companies was hit with record fines totalling Euro 992 million (Pounds 666 million).

Managers from the "big four" lift providers -Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and  Kone -were caught rigging contracts in four European countries.

TD
Deals to install and maintain  elevators  for hospitals, shopping centres and commercial buildings were carved up between the businesses, the European  Commission found.The companies even colluded over new lifts for the  Commission's headquarters in Brussels, as well as for the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, officials said yesterday.

The fine beats a Euro 750 million penalty imposed last month on 11 firms in a  cartel for gas-insulated switchgear products. It showed that Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, meant business when she vowed last year to use more of power available to her. She can  fine a company up to 10 per cent of its turnover for  cartel activity.

Mrs Kroes said that managers of the lift companies met in bars away from main cities and, to avoid detection, even used pay-as-you-go mobile phones when deciding whose "turn" it was to win a contract.

She said: "National management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong, but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway. The damage caused by this  cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply, but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators.  For these companies, the memory of this  fine should last just as long."

ThyssenKrupp, branded a repeat offender because the German group was found to be in a steel  cartel in 1998, was given the largest antitrust  fine for one company so far, of about Euro 479 million. It said that it may fight its  fine's size, as did Finland's Kone, fined Euro 142 million.  Otis, part of the American UTC, was fined Euro 224 million and the Swiss Schindler Euro 143 million.
Misubishi Elevator Europe was fined Euro 1.8 million for its role in the Netherlands. (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2007

FOCUS: l'intérêt se portera sur l'amende infligée la semaine passée par l'UE au  cartel des ascenseurs et sur ce que le management de Schindler entend faire à ce propos. On souhaite aussi des informations sur la stratégie future de Schindler à l'égard de sa filiale Also. Enfin, les analystes s'intéresseront aux prévisions du groupe.

OBJECTIFS: le 25 janvier dernier,  Schindler a confirmé ses propres prévisions de bénéfices, malgré l'avertissement sur bénéfice de sa filiale Also. Le bénéfice de groupe consolidé, y compris le gain attendu de la vente d'immeubles, devrait se situer juste en-dessus de 500 mio CHF. Pour le secteur A&F, Schindler vise une marge d'EBIT de 10%, qui, selon des déclarations datant de 2006, ne sera toutefois pas atteinte.

PRO MEMORIA: le 21 février, la  Commission européenne a infligé une amende totale de près d'1 mrd d'EUR pour entente cartellaire à quatre fabricants d'ascenseurs, dont  Schindler, qui a écopé de 143,7 mio EUR. Le groupe a annoncé qu'il va faire appel.

Commentaires d'analystes (texte original):

"JP Morgan" (Nick Paton): Following the margin disappointment in 1H 06, our estimates look for the company to miss its 10% margin target in the E&E division with a 9.8% margin in the 2H, after an 8.6% margin in the 1H. The companys focus on new equipment will, we believe, put downward pressure on the margin which investors are unlikely to give the company credit for in the short term. We believe  Schindler will seek a structural exit from its ALSO business but that it needs to get greater scale before doing so. We believe ALSO needs revenues of Sfr8bn, a significant increase on our 2006 estimate of Sfr2.9bn. We believe the company has to increase its exposure to this unappealing business before an exit. "Neutral"

"ZKB" (Martin Hüsler): Nebst den Zahlen 2006 richten wir unser Augenmerk auf den Ausblick für 2007 und auf die strategische Weiterentwicklung der Logistiktochter ALSO. 2006 dürfte wachstumsbedingt einen Margenrückgang gebracht haben, da das profitablere Servicegeschäft weniger dynamisch gewachsen ist. Die höhere Dynamik im Neuanlagegeschäft wird jedoch zunehmend auch Unterhaltsgeschäft nach sich ziehen und zukünftig zu Margenverbesserungen beitragen. "Übergewichten"

"Vontobel" (Serge Rotzer): We will be interested in learning about the progress made in H2 06 regarding the implementation of the new growth strategy. The motto in H1 06 was 'growth before margins', leading Schindler to post stronger organic growth than its main competitors (13% vs. 10% for  Kone and ~5% for Otis). The price to be paid for this strategy was a temporary fall in the margin from 9.2% to 8.6% -  Otis
and Kone were both able to increase their margins during the same period. We will also be keen to get an assessment from management concerning a possible  fine in connection with the ongoing EU
investigation. "Market Perform"

"Credit Suisse" (Maria Ivek): We are optimistic about the demand outlook for  Schindlers Elevator and Escalator  (E+E) operations, with service and modernisation forecast to remain strong in Europe owing, in particular, to the SNEL (Safety Norm for Existing Lifts) legislation for existing  elevator systems being implemented across Europe. Demand for new installations should also remain solid owing to the global launch last year of Schindlers innovative E+E product portfolio. [...]ALSOs expansion plans will not be financed by Schindler and we would consider a potential disposal of the 65% stake in ALSO in the medium term as a positive for  Schindler. "Neutral"

HD     Handelsblatt: Industry in turmoil as Thyssen-Krupp still under cartel investigations (Zoff in der
Aufzugbranche).

The European Union's  cartel procedure filed against four leading lift and  escalator  manufacturers for holding illegal price agreements has left the industry in turmoil, with the companies reportedly accusing each other of holding agreements in order to come under principal witness regulations and to avoid record fines. After years of investigation, German steel and engineering company Thyssen-Krupp, Finnish rival Kone, US rival  Otis and Swiss rival Schindler Group were last week  fined 992m euros by the European Commission for fixing prices, manipulating tenders and exchanging confidential information.
Thyssen-Krupp has to pay the largest share at 479m euros, owing to the company's having been found guilty of illegal price agreements in the past.

TD
The investigations have resulted in a  cartel in Austria being uncovered, whereby Thyssen-Krupp has admitted to its first  cartel violation and submitted to principal witness regulations, which means that it may escape punishment. The  cartel court in Vienna is still investigating the matter; a representative for Thyssen-Krupp would not comment. The scandal in Austria undermines the arguments put forward by the manufacturers of the price agreements being a problem limited to small markets.

HD       Call for neutral body to probe cartel behavior

Hong Kong people will remain vulnerable to rip-offs and  price- fixing  until the government introduces a comprehensive competition law endowed with the powers of investigation, a senior Consumer Council official said.

``Many business people understand that cartels are unethical, but for us to be hostage to their moral judgment is unsatisfactory,'' Victor Hung Tin- yau, the council's chief officer of research and trade practices, said.

TD
``We need to be able to substantiate claims and to investigate cases along with the necessary powers to carry out these ends. The fact that we haven't allocated anyone with any investigative powers means we've left ourselves vulnerable.''
Hung made the remarks in wake of the European Union's antitrust  commission, which Wednesday
levied a record fine of nearly 1 billion euros (HK$10.22 billion) against five lift manufacturers, which all do
business in Hong Kong.

The judgment against  Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp,  Kone and Mitsubishi arose from accusations they were engaged in an illegal cartel that rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, shared out projects and carved up markets in the installation and maintenance of lifts and  escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004. ThyssenKrupp was handed the heaviest fine of 480 million euros due to repeat offenses.

Among the five companies' numerous Hong Kong operations are The Bank of China Tower, Two International Finance Centre, the Hong Kong Police Headquarters, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the Mong Kok footbridge.

Legislator Ronny Tong Ka-wah said despite suspected  cartel behavior locally among supermarkets, property markets, fresh pork suppliers, ports and exhibition services, the lack of any independent and neutral body charged with adequate investigative powers to detect and substantiate claims would make enforcement of fair competition difficult, if not impossible.

He acknowledged external forces were also pressuring the territory to adopt mechanisms to protect fair competition as foreign chamber of commerce members were from nations with conventions of free competition and similar practices.

Although there exist few barriers to entry into Hong Kong markets, Tong believed existing business conduct that impeded competition was particularly worrisome for foreign investors who were new to the market.

Additionally, international institutions such as the EU and International Monetary Fund have been pressuring the Hong Kong government to adopt measures to protect competition within markets.

In its 2002 Trade Policy Review on Hong Kong, the World Trade Organization said: ``The seeming lack of coherent measures to address anti-competitive practices in all but a few sectors could constitute an obstacle to greater competition.''


Page 157 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commenting on the massive  fines levied by Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes against a number of European companies, Tong believed there should be a cap commensurate with a company's turnover.

``The Civic Party wants to set a cap on  fines in relation to a business' turnover, say 20 to 30 percent. Fines can't be too small, otherwise enterprises would just factor them into their pricing strategies.  Fines are to ensure that laws are complied with. We are targeting a particular type of behavior, not a trader's position in a certain market,'' Tong said, adding that companies not engaged in unethical practices had nothing to worry about.

The Competition Policy Review Committee says a comprehensive law should specifically target anti- competitive practices such as  price-fixing, bid-rigging, market allocation, sales and production quotas, joint boycotts, and unfair or discriminatory standards, as well as abuse of a dominant market position.

The committee suggested such a law would not regulate ``natural'' monopolies or mergers and acquisitions.
It also proposed setting up a regulatory authority with sufficient investigative powers.

However, a critic of anti- competitive practices law, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, believes the market place is the best arbitrator of resource allocation and not the courts.

``We fail to see how creating an uncertain, litigative and costly environment helps SMEs compete with the big guys, who are more experienced and better equipped to deal with just such an environment,'' it said.

The consultation paper on free competition is pending a report to determine the more concrete aspects of unfair competition.

HD           UPDATE 2-Schindler shares fall as core unit disappoints

(Recasts, adds share price, analyst's comment, outlook)

ZURICH, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Shares in Swiss  elevator and escalator  maker Schindler plunged on Monday as investors shunned a 27-percent rise in full-year group net profit and focused on disappointing margins in its core unit.

TD
The group failed to reach its medium-term 10 percent operating profit margin (EBIT) target in its elevator and escalator  unit, posting a margin on an operating level of 8.4 percent excluding a real estate gain, as disproportionate growth of new installations weighed on margins.
Chief Financial Officer Erich Ammann told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference that the
2007 EBIT margin in the core unit would be between 9 percent and 9.5 percent, as production
bottlenecks ease.
By 1036 GMT, participation certificates in  Schindler, its most widely traded form of equity, had fallen
7.1 percent to 79.55 Swiss francs per share, well behind a 0.4 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European
industrial goods index <.SXNP>.

"Overall we judge these results as being in-line on first glance, but rather 5 percent below expectations when looking at the adjusted operating numbers," said Vontobel analyst Remo Rosenau in a note.

"The outlook is not highly encouraging and we will not increase our numbers, as they are already in line with the new company guidance," he said.

Schindler, which posted a group net profit of 511 million Swiss francs ($412 million) in 2006, said it expected to report a group net profit of around 530 million Swiss francs ($427.4 million) for 2007, excluding the EU  fine and any unforeseeable events.
The group said it was aiming for a group net profit of more than 600 million francs in 2008. Operating profit in the group's  elevators  and escalators unit rose to 717 million francs, from 632
million francs in the year ago period, but this included a gain before tax of 63 million francs from the
sale of real estate.
DISAPPOINTING

Schindler said it had secured orders for new installations for buildings such as the Federation Tower in Moscow, Europe's tallest building, but it makes more money by maintaining and servicing lifts than through new installations.

"These results are somewhat disappointing on the surface, and it looks as if the company has had difficulties working down such a abnormally large order increase," Helvea analyst Volkan Goecmen said in a note.



Page 159 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The group, whose lifts and escalators move around 700 million people every day, competes with Germany's ThyssenKrupp , Otis, owned by United Technologies of the United States, and  Kone of Finland.

Analysts were disappointed that the operating margin-gap versus  Otis and Kone had increased, as both firms posted increases in their operating margins for the full-year.

The group said it would propose a dividend of 1.30 francs per share, versus 0.90 francs per share last year after the 1 to 10 share split.

It also appointed Juergen Tinggren as president of the core  elevator and escalator  unit, the senior position on the company's management committee.

Last week, Schindler said it would appeal against a European Commission decision to fine it 144 million euros for price fixing.  Schindler said it will record its fine in 2007.

The Commission fined Schindler, ThyssenKrupp,  Otis, Kone and Japan's Mitsubushi Electric a total of 992 million euros for fixing prices and carving up markets in the biggest  cartel penalty in European Union history.

HD             Kone to decide on EU fine appeal soon

HELSINKI, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Head of the Finnish lift and escalator  maker Kone said on Monday the company will soon decide whether it is going to appeal the cartel fine imposed by the European Commission last week.

"We have not yet received the report -- when we receive it, we are ready to make decisions about follow-up actions on a rapid schedule," Chief Executive Matti Alahuhta told Reuters at the sidelines of a seminar.

TD
He added this would mean a week or two.

On Feb. 21, the European  Commission said it had fined Kone 142 million euros ($187 million) for anticompetitive practices in Germany and the Netherlands.

Swiss Schindler , fined 144 million euros in the same case, has announced that it will appeal the decision.
Other companies  fined were ThyssenKrupp of Germany,  Otis, owned by United Technologies of the
United States and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.

Cartel fines reach new heights Cartels are in the news once again. Last week, the European Commission handed down its largest ever  fine - £992m ($1.3bn) - to four makers of lifts, or  elevators  to our transatlantic readers. The companies hit were  Otis, Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp, who were judged to have operated cartels in four EU countries in the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators. This exceeds the previous record fine of £790m, handed down in 2001 to companies involved in the widely reported and operated vitamins cartel. To its shame, the chemicals industry also holds the fourth, sixth and seventh positions on the fines league table, for cartels in synthetic rubber (2006), hydrogen peroxide (2006) and acrylic glass (2006), respectively. In the past four years, there have been fines levied on no fewer than 12 cartels in the chemicals sector, very nearly half of the total of 25  fines.

TD
By company, the worst offenders, as judged by the Commission's fines are: Roche, ENI, BASF, Arkema, Solvay and Shell. These occupy six of the top 10 cartel league places. Now, it has to be said that these are not usually thought of as the cowboys of the industry the fly-by-night operators. Indeed, all involved outwardly boast of their probity, their corporate responsibility and their stringent governance. So what is going wrong, time and time again? How many more cartels need to be uncovered? There are plenty in the pipeline still under investigation, and no doubt more that have not seen the light of day, despite the European Commission's leniency programme that offers immunity to whistleblowers that cooperate fully
in subsequent investigations. It is an issue that the chemical industry needs to come to grips with more effectively than it does at present. There is no excuse for inaction: the  fines are increasingly punitive the follow-up claims for damages from injured parties increasingly frequent, and, indeed, encouraged by the Commission and the effect on the public's perception of and trust in the industry is damaging. It should be the responsibility of line managers and management boards to put safeguards in place, and stress that illegal activity is neither condoned nor ignored. The pressure to improve prices and margins by
manipulating markets in concert is no excuse, and indeed in many cases is non-productive. Let's hope that we soon see an end to these anti- competitive practices.

FOCUS: l'intérêt se portera sur l'amende infligée la semaine passée par l'UE au  cartel des ascenseurs et sur ce que le management de Schindler entend faire à ce propos. On souhaite aussi des informations sur la stratégie future de Schindler à l'égard de sa filiale Also. Enfin, les analystes s'intéresseront aux prévisions du groupe.

OBJECTIFS: le 25 janvier dernier,  Schindler a confirmé ses propres prévisions de bénéfices, malgré l'avertissement sur bénéfice de sa filiale Also. Le bénéfice de groupe consolidé, y compris le gain attendu de la vente d'immeubles, devrait se situer juste en-dessus de 500 mio CHF. Pour le secteur A&F, Schindler vise une marge d'EBIT de 10%, qui, selon des déclarations datant de 2006, ne sera toutefois pas atteinte.

PRO MEMORIA: le 21 février, la  Commission européenne a infligé une amende totale de près d'1 mrd d'EUR pour entente cartellaire à quatre fabricants d'ascenseurs, dont  Schindler, qui a écopé de 143,7 mio EUR. Le groupe a annoncé qu'il va faire appel.

Commentaires d'analystes (texte original):

"JP Morgan" (Nick Paton): Following the margin disappointment in 1H 06, our estimates look for the company to miss its 10% margin target in the E&E division with a 9.8% margin in the 2H, after an 8.6% margin in the 1H. The companys focus on new equipment will, we believe, put downward pressure on the margin which investors are unlikely to give the company credit for in the short term. We believe  Schindler will seek a structural exit from its ALSO business but that it needs to get greater scale before doing so. We believe ALSO needs revenues of Sfr8bn, a significant increase on our 2006 estimate of Sfr2.9bn. We believe the company has to increase its exposure to this unappealing business before an exit. "Neutral"

"ZKB" (Martin Hüsler): Nebst den Zahlen 2006 richten wir unser Augenmerk auf den Ausblick für 2007 und auf die strategische Weiterentwicklung der Logistiktochter ALSO. 2006 dürfte wachstumsbedingt einen Margenrückgang gebracht haben, da das profitablere Servicegeschäft weniger dynamisch gewachsen ist. Die höhere Dynamik im Neuanlagegeschäft wird jedoch zunehmend auch Unterhaltsgeschäft nach sich ziehen und zukünftig zu Margenverbesserungen beitragen. "Übergewichten"

"Vontobel" (Serge Rotzer): We will be interested in learning about the progress made in H2 06 regarding the implementation of the new growth strategy. The motto in H1 06 was 'growth before margins', leading Schindler to post stronger organic growth than its main competitors (13% vs. 10% for  Kone and ~5% for Otis). The price to be paid for this strategy was a temporary fall in the margin from 9.2% to 8.6% -  Otis
and Kone were both able to increase their margins during the same period. We will also be keen to get an assessment from management concerning a possible  fine in connection with the ongoing EU
investigation. "Market Perform"

"Credit Suisse" (Maria Ivek): We are optimistic about the demand outlook for  Schindlers Elevator and Escalator  (E+E) operations, with service and modernisation forecast to remain strong in Europe owing, in particular, to the SNEL (Safety Norm for Existing Lifts) legislation for existing  elevator systems being implemented across Europe. Demand for new installations should also remain solid owing to the global launch last year of Schindlers innovative E+E product portfolio. [...]ALSOs expansion plans will not be financed by Schindler and we would consider a potential disposal of the 65% stake in ALSO in the medium term as a positive for  Schindler. "Neutral"

CLEVELAND (AP)—Banking and financial services firm KeyCorp will receive $279 million from a Swiss insurance company to settle a six-year-old suit over losses KeyCorp claimed in its car-leasing business.

The settlement resolves a lawsuit KeyCorp filed against New York-based Swiss Reinsurance America Corp., part of Zurich-based Swiss Reinsurance Corp. The issue was whether Swiss Reinsurance was obligated to cover the losses stemming from the lease of about 160,000 cars between 1997 and 2000 by KeyCorp. When leased cars are returned and the company is unable to sell them for fair-market value, the difference is considered a loss and is insured.

WASHINGTON (AP)— Waste Management Inc. has been ordered to pay about $29 million dollars to settle a dispute involving its sale of a joint venture in Mexico.

SEATTLE (AP)— Microsoft Corp. must pay $1.52 billion in damages to telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent S.A. for violating two patents related to digital music, a San Diego jury ruled last week.

Microsoft said the patents govern the conversion of audio into the digital MP3 file format on personal computers. In 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc., which last year was acquired by Alcatel, filed 15 patent claims against Gateway Inc. and Dell Inc. for technology developed by Bell Labs, its research arm. In April
2003, Microsoft added itself to the list of defendants, saying the patents were closely tied to its Windows operating system.
Microsoft disputed that Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent's patents govern its MP3 tools, and said it licenses the
MP3 software used by its Windows Media Player from a German company.
NEGLIGENCE

BIRMINGHAM, ALA. (AP)—An Alabama state jury found Brookwood Medical Center at fault for the suicide of a psychiatric patient who escaped custody and jumped to his death from a hospital parking deck. The jury ordered the hospital to pay $12 million in punitive damages.

Vaughn Hollon was 53 in October 2003 when he was admitted to the hospital as a suicide risk. He died two days after he scaled a fence in an outdoor area of a psychiatric ward. He broke both legs after an initial fall to a parking deck, and was killed by a second jump that sent him plunging 80 feet to the ground.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—A California federal judge has approved a $13.55 million settlement of a lawsuit filed against Boeing Co. and three other companies by two soldiers who were hurt in a 2003 Army helicopter crash in Iraq.

The products liability lawsuit claimed that a gear box on an AH-64 Apache Longbow failed during a maintenance flight in Tikrit, causing the chopper to plunge 800 feet. Former Chief Warrant Officer Juan Beltran, 34, was left a quadriplegic. The crash shattered the spine of Chief Warrant Officer Ron Carnes,
34. He can walk but his movement is restricted.

The lawsuit claimed that the gearbox and gearbox bearings were inadequately lubricated and that a device called an accelerometer that should have warned pilots of a problem was badly designed and had failed early.
REGULATORY ACTION

BRUSSELS (AP)—European Union regulators have  finedUnited Technologies Corp.'s Otis unit and four other elevator makers $1.3 billion for operating cartels while installing and maintaining elevators  and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

Also fined were German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp A.G.; Finland's Kone Corp.; Switzerland's Schindler Holding A.G.; and subsidiaries of Japan's Mitsubishi Elevator Europe B.V. The European Commission said the cartel had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, fix prices and share markets "between at least 1995 and 2004."

E.U. regulators found evidence from "numerous documents and corporate statements" to prove the companies allocated tenders and contracts for the sale, installation and maintenance of  elevators  "with the aim of freezing market shares and fixing prices," the  commission said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—Securities regulators have  fined software maker Veritas Software Corp. $30 million to settle accusations that the company engaged in various accounting schemes in the years leading to its sale to Symantec in 2005.

Regulators opened an inquiry into a deal Veritas negotiated with AOL in 2000.That arrangement, involving a quid pro quo purchase of software licenses and advertising, improperly increased the revenue of each company by $20 million. Veritas then lied to auditors about the deal and helped AOL conceal its involvement, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission.

The probe also found that Veritas manipulated its books in 2001, 2002 and 2003 in an effort to produce results that would please shareholders.
