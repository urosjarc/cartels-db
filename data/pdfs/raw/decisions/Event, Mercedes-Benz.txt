BRUSSELS - The  European Commission is tomorrow expected to fineDaimlerChrysler AG, the German-U.S. automaker, about US$75-million, one of the largest penalties levied by the Brussels regulator for breaching  European Union competition laws.

The likely fine follows a five-year investigation by the commission into alleged attempts by DaimlerChrysler to control prices and restrict supplies of Mercedes-Benz cars in several European countries.

TD
The scale of the fine reflects the  commission's growing disenchantment at the alleged abuse of the "block exemption" rules governing new car sales in Europe. Those rules, due to expire next September, are likely to be replaced by a much more liberal regime.
The commission claimed DaimlerChrysler tried to prevent dealers in Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Spain from selling cars to consumers from other member states between 1985 and
1996. That allegedly breached  European rules on the single market.

DaimlerChrysler was also accused of restricting car sales to leasing companies and of trying to control prices.
The German-U.S. carmaker has denied the claims.
The size of the  fine will be decided tomorrow at a  commission meeting.

Competition experts said the  commission broadly followed the advice of the directorate, but could reduce the fine if it comes under pressure from Germany or other member states. The  commission declined to comment.

DaimlerChrysler is expected to appeal against the  fine, but officials indicated that the carmaker would await full details before deciding its next step.

The European Commission is on Tuesday expected to  fine DaimlerChrysler, the German-US carmaker, about E70m ($64m) - one of the largest penalties levied by the Brussels regulator - for breaching European Union competition laws.

The fine follows a five-year investigation by the Commission into alleged attempts by DaimlerChrysler to control prices and restrict supplies of Mercedes-Benz cars in several European countries.

TD
The scale of the fine reflects the  Commission's growing disenchantment at the alleged abuse of the "block exemption" rules governing new car sales in Europe. Those rules, due to expire next September, are likely to be replaced by a much more liberal regime.
The Commission claimed DaimlerChrysler tried to prevent dealers in Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Spain from selling cars to consumers from other member states between 1985 and
1996. That allegedly breached  European rules on the single market.

DaimlerChrysler was also accused of restricting car sales to leasing companies and of trying to control prices by setting a minimum price for some models.
The German-US carmaker has vigorously denied the claims.
The size of the  fine will be decided on Wednesday, but it is understood that the  competition
directorate, which carried out the investigation, is recommending a  fine of about E70m.

Experts said the  Commission broadly followed the advice of the directorate, but could reduce the  fine if it came under pressure from Germany or other member states. The  Commission declined to comment.

Brussels has the power to require companies to pay up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover. The biggest fine imposed was E102m on Volkswagen, although that was reduced to E90m after the German carmaker took the  commission to court.

DaimlerChrysler is expected to appeal.

The European Commission on Wednesday signalled a tougher line against carmakers indulging in price fixing or discriminatory retail practices after fining  DaimlerChrysler E71.8m ($66.05m) for abusing competition rules.

Although the German-US automotive group vowed to appeal, the  Commission hinted that the penalty served as a warning to manufacturers trying to control new car prices and limit cross-border sales.

TD
The fine, the fourth against a leading carmaker, coincides with a review of the 20-year-old  European block exemption on car retailing, due to expire next September, which allows carmakers to avoid normal competition rules. Mario Monti, EU  competition commissioner, is expected to recommend a much more liberal retailing regime.

Demands for reform are expected to grow after Brussels  ruled that Mercedes Benz, DaimlerChrysler's flagship brand, had breached trading  rules in Germany, Spain and Belgium.

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr Monti said: "Our investigation has also shown once more that the car manufacturers can largely control their distributors and punish those whose commercial behaviour they dislike.

"Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are therefore unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely."

Commission officials said they would take abuses of the trading system into account when they recommend new retailing  rules.

DaimlerChrysler claimed, however, that the  Commission had dropped allegations, first made in 1999, that it employed an overall strategy to block cross-border sales of  Mercedes cars.
"DaimlerChrysler feels that the few remaining accusations are also groundless," the company said. One senior executive said  Mercedes had gone further than most carmakers in  Europe to harmonise
prices between member states.

Brussels found it had infringed  competition rules: by obliging non-German customers to pay a 15 per cent deposit to source vehicles from German dealers; limiting sales to independent leasing companies in Spain and Germany; and fixing prices in Belgium.

THE AUTOMOBILE maker, DaimlerChrysler, is today expected to be hit by massive  fines from the
European Commission for breaching competition rules.
It is thought that Mario Monti, the EU  Competition Commissioner, will impose a penalty of up to 90m
euros (#57m) on the company, following a five-year probe into its sales practices.

TD
Investigators have been examining whether  DaimlerChrysler sought to prevent customers - especially
Germans - going to another EU country to take advantage of lower prices for its cars in other territories.

They have also investigated whether the company, which makes  Mercedes-Benz vehicles, has limited sales to car leasing companies in order to benefit its own leasing business, and if it has sought to dictate the retail prices charged by its dealers. It is alleged that some of these abuses remain in place.

The Commission yesterday refused to comment, but added that Mr Monti will be holding a press conference on the matter at 10.30am today. Although Brussels can levy  fines of up to 10 per cent of a company's turnover, in practice  fines are imposed at much lower levels.

Mr Monti has singled-out carmakers in his campaign to bring the price of goods down in the EU and tackle price disparities across member states. Earlier this year, Volkswagen was  fined 31m euros for preventing its German dealers from offering discounts to customers.

HD     DaimlerChrysler fined 45m pounds  for rule breach

DAIMLERCHRYSLER has been fined nearly 45 million pounds by the  European Union for breaking
competition rules.
The fine relates to the company's distribution and pricing of  Mercedes cars and trucks.

TD
"When you drive you're expected to know the highway code," said EU competition commissioner Mario
Monti, who added the company had broken "fundamental  rules of competition".
"A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices," he said. "The  Commission
is determined to ensure that they benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal."

The German auto giant had broken  rules on price-fixing, leasing  competition and parallel trade, according to Mr Monti. The company had also prevented the re-importation of its cars over a period of years, he added.

One of DaimlerChrysler's misdemeanours was to instruct its dealers to make foreign customers pay a deposit of 15 per cent when ordering a car in Germany.

This was not the case for German customers even when they lived far away or were unknown to the seller. The fine is the third largest ever imposed by the EC on an industrial producer.
The fine was intended to have "a deterrent effect", said Mr Monti.

Luxury car-maker BMW said its worldwide sales rose three per cent in September from the same period last year to 75,350 units despite the attacks on the United States last month.

BMW also said that in the first nine months of the year, car sales rose nine per cent to 671,850 units from a year ago.
The company still says it expects to sell more than 900,000 units this year.

US agency probes Nissan Altimas

THE US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating about 248,638 Nissan Altimas made between 1994 and 1995 after 75 people said they were hurt by the force of a deploying air bag. Most of the injured passengers said they were wearing seat-belts. Dierdre Dickerson, a spokeswoman for Nissan North America, said: 'Air-bags are very powerful and they have to be to save lives. Sometimes there are injuries that result.' In other actions, the NHTSA is checking cases of exploding batteries in  Mercedes C-Class 1998-99 models and a decomposing wiring harness in Porsche's 1995 model 911.

Firestone agrees to more tyre recalls

FIRESTONE, the US arm of Japan's Bridgestone, has succumbed to pressure from US safety regulators and agreed to a further recall of the type of tyres linked to hundreds of traffic accidents in the US. The company will recall varieties of Wilderness tyres made before May 1998 and used on sport utility vehicles
- notably Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, about 3.5 million tyres of this type were produced, mainly at Firestone plants in North Carolina and Quebec, although Firestone estimates that only 768,000 are still on the road. The company has put the direct cost of the latest recall at less than US$30 million. Firestone and Ford agreed to recall about 6.5 million tyres in August last year. Ford made a second recall this year, covering 13 million tyres.
EC may fine DaimlerChrysler 70m euros

THE European Commission is expected to  fine the German-US car-maker  DaimlerChrysler about 70 million euros (S$115.8 million) - one of the largest penalties levied by the regulator - for breaching European Union competition laws. The Financial Times said the  fine follows a five-year investigation into alleged attempts by DaimlerChrysler to control prices and restrict supplies of  Mercedes-Benz cars in several European countries. The scale of the fine reflects the  commission's growing disenchantment
at the alleged abuse of the 'block exemption' rules governing new car sales in Europe. The commission claims DaimlerChrysler tried to prevent dealers in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain selling cars to consumers from other member states between 1985 and 1996. This would have breached European rules on the single market.  DaimlerChrysler has vigorously denied the claims.
Nissan to buy MMC transmission ops

NISSAN, 36.8 per cent owned by Renault, will acquire the transmission operations of rival Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC). In return, MMC will take a 20 per cent stake in the merged transmission company. The move will create the world's largest transmission company, with an approximate value of US$1
billion. Under the memorandum of understanding, MMC, which is 37 per cent owned by  DaimlerChrysler, will roll its automatic transmission and continually variable transmission operations into Jatco TransTechnology, a transmission company 99.7 per cent owned by Nissan. Nissan will hold the
remaining 80 per cent of the merged entity.
GM, Toyota to study telematics services

GENERAL Motors and Toyota Motor have agreed to conduct a feasibility study of telematics services in the Japanese market. Under the eight-month pact, the two companies will explore collaborative opportunities in telematics services in the Japanese market based on the business scheme for Toyota's vehicle information network service called G-Book.

In Paris the price of shares in Schneider Electric fell by 0.50  euros to 40.31  euros and Legrand stock rose 4.40 euros to 132.90  euros.

"It's very bad news indeed," said a Paris-based dealer. "There had been some hope the decision may be deferred pending further deliberations."

"Now we're going to have a demerger. That's a costly business. I hope the EU will give them 18 months to carry it out. They can give them anything between six to 18 months to demerge.

BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (AFP) - The European Commission fined on Wednesday the German-American group DaimlerChrysler 71.825 million euros (65.5 million dollars) for unfair  competition in the European distribution of  Mercedes cars and trucks.

"When you drive you're expected to know the highway code," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "That's the message of this decision," he said, adding that DaimlerChrysler had broken "fundamental  rules of competition".

TD
The fine, he said, was the third largest ever imposed by the  commission on an industrial producer.
"This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear," said Monti. "Practices like the ones that
Daimler-Chrysler indulged in are...unacceptable and must be remanded heavily."

"A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices," he said. "The commissioin is determined to ensure that they benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to nation customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of  DaimlerChryslers' competition transgressions, that of instructing its dealers to oblige foreign consumers to pay a deposit of 15 percent to  DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

"This was not the case for German consumers," he said, "even though they might present the same 'risk' of, for instance, being unknown to the seller, ordering a car with particular specifications, or living far away," said Monti.

The heavy fined was intended to have "a sufficient deterrent effect on  Daimler-Chrysler and other companies," he said.

ATTENTION - ADDS  DaimlerChrysler appeal

LP
BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (AFP) - The European Commission fined on Wednesday the German-American group DaimlerChrysler 71.825 million euros (65.5 million dollars) for unfair  competition in the European distribution of  Mercedes cars and trucks.
But in Stuttgart, Germany,  DaimlerChrysler said it would appeal.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said here: "When you drive you're expected to know the highway code.
"That's the message of this decision," he said, adding that  DaimlerChrysler had broken "fundamental
rules of competition".
The fine, he said, was the third largest ever imposed by the  commission on an industrial producer. "This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear," said Monti. "Practices like the ones that
Daimler-Chrysler indulged in are...unacceptable and must be remanded heavily."

"A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices," he said. "The commissioin is determined to ensure that they benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to nation customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of  DaimlerChryslers' competition transgressions, that of instructing its dealers to oblige foreign consumers to pay a deposit of 15 percent to  DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

"This was not the case for German consumers," he said, "even though they might present the same 'risk' of, for instance, being unknown to the seller, ordering a car with particular specifications, or living far away," said Monti.

The heavy fined was intended to have "a sufficient deterrent effect on  Daimler-Chrysler and other companies," he said.

In Stuttgart, DaimlerChrysler said that "most of the allegations made had been dropped, particularly the serious charge that DaimlerChrysler had pursued an 'overall' strategy to prevent cross- border sales of Mercedes cars to the end-user."

Nevertheless, even those allegations which were upheld were "unfounded" from the car maker's point of view, the statement said.

"The ruling comes as even more of a surprise since  Mercedes has played a leading role for years in price harmonisation and  European integration.

"DaimlerChrysler will appeal against the EU  Commission decision," the car maker added.

HD     EU tightens competition grip on corporate giants

BRUSSELS, October 10 (AFP) - The European Commission blocked on Wednesday a French electronics merger and fined DaimlerChrysler for impeding cross-border car sales, two demonstrations of its determination to police competition.

The commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies Schneider Electric and Legrand, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment, Monti announced.

TD
And it imposed a fine of 71.825 million euros on German-US automaker  DaimlerChysler for unfair
competition in the European distribution of Mercedes cars and trucks.
This puts the company third on a penalty list led by German auto giant Volkswagen.

VW was fined 102 million euros in 1998 for practices aimed at restricting distribution, and retained the top spot even after the  fine was reduced to 90 million  euros in 2000.

Tetra Pak, the Swedish beverage packager, was slapped with a  fine of 75 million euros in 1991 for abusing its dominant market position.

In 10 years, the  commission has blocked 16 planned mergers, including several major tie-ups involving companies based outside the  European Union, and levied heavy  fines for antitrust violations by EU firms.

The commission is empowered by European law to rule on mergers by groups with combined global sales exceeding five billion  euros (4.6 billion dollars) and which separately have sales within the 15- member union of more than 250 million  euros.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Wednesday that  DaimlerChrysler had broken "fundamental rules of competition" within the EU.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of DaimlerChryslers' competition violations; instructing dealers to demand foreign consumers pay a 15-percent deposit to DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

The commission may levy a multi-billion-euro (dollar) fine on US software giant Microsoft and force it to drop features from its new Windows XP operating system, a report by the Wall Street Journal  Europe said Wednesday.

The commission has also demonstrated it is ready to block global deals if it finds they offer unfair advantages to the companies concerned.

He said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of  competition" in their market, in France and in several other EU countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.
Page 16 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission killed a megamerger between US groups General Electric and Honeywell International on July 3, saying the 45- billion-dollar deal would have slashed  competition in the aerospace sector.

It marked the first time that a US corporate merger had been blocked solely by EU authorities, and both companies have challenged the decision in separate petitions before the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

On June 28, 2000 the  commission decided formally to block a merger of US telecommunications giants MCI Worldcom and Sprint, even though they had already announced they were dropping the plan because of EU opposition.

Monti hailed "very good cooperation" between EU and US officials in the case and said the merger would have produced "a company whose size would have given it a dominant position in the information transmission market on the Internet."
On April 24, 1996 the  commission killed a deal between South African mining groups Gencor and
Lonrho, which the EU said would result in a domination of the platinum and rhodium markets.
Gencor later argued that the  commission directives did not concern countries outside the 15-nation EU
and stressed that the mining operations were all in Africa.

However, a chamber of the EU  European Court court  ruled in March 1999 that the decision was not determined by the place of production, but by the market in which the metals were sold.
Sales by Lonrho and Gencor in  Europe are well above the 250- million-euro limit set by  European law. wai/hd

ATTENTION - UPDATES with Schneider,  DaimlerChrysler appeals

LP
BRUSSELS, October 10 (AFP) - The European Commission flexed its power to police  competition on Wednesday, blocking a French electronics merger and fining DaimlerChrysler for impeding cross- border car sales.

The commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies Schneider Electric and Legrand, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment,  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announced.

TD
And it imposed a  fine of 71.825 million euros (65.53 million dollars) on German-US automaker
DaimlerChysler for unfair competition in the European distribution of  Mercedes cars and trucks.

In the past decade, the  commission has blocked 16 planned mergers, including several major tie-ups involving companies based outside the  European Union, and levied heavy  fines for antitrust violations by EU firms.

The commission is empowered by European law to rule on mergers by groups with combined global sales exceeding five billion  euros and which separately have sales within the 15-member union of more than 250 million  euros.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Wednesday that  DaimlerChrysler had broken "fundamental rules of competition" within the EU.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of DaimlerChryslers' competition violations: instructing dealers to demand foreign consumers pay a 15-percent deposit to DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

DaimlerChrysler said it considered the  commission's findings "unfounded" and that it would challenge the decision.

The commission has also demonstrated it is ready to block global deals if it finds they offer unfair advantages to the companies concerned.

Monti said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of  competition" in their market, in France and in several other EU countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.

Schneider said that it would appeal the decision, which could cost shareholders dearly because the company has already acquired 98 percent of Legrand's capital, making it costly to disentangle the two groups.

According to press reports earlier this week, French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister
Laurent Fabius personally intervened to argue for  European Commission approval of the deal.

US giant General Electric and German industrial group Siemens were reported to be possible predators if the EU blocked the merger.

The commission killed a mega-merger between US groups General Electric and Honeywell International on July 3, saying the 45- billion-dollar deal would have slashed  competition in the aerospace sector.

It marked the first time that a US corporate merger had been blocked solely by EU authorities, and both companies have challenged the decision in separate petitions before the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

HD    EU regulators fine DaimlerChrysler for price-fixing, restricting Mercedes sales

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union ruled Wednesday that DaimlerChrysler AG had violated competition rules by restricting sales of its Mercedes cars in Europe and fined it nearly 72 million euros (dlrs 65.5 million).

It's one of the largest  fines levied against a car company for hampering consumers from taking advantage of price differences between different  European countries.

TD
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the German automaker had violated  rules over several years in three ways:
-by instructing its German dealers not to sell to customers outside their respective territory from 1996 to
1999 and making foreigners, but not Germans, pay a 15 percent deposit when ordering a car in Germany,
a requirement in place since 1985;

-by limiting the sales of cars to leasing companies in Germany and Spain, a practice Monti said is still ongoing;

-and by participating in a price-fixing agreement in Belgium to restrict rebates offered by  Mercedes dealers from 1995 to 1999.

"Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are ... unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely," Monti said. "The consumer must be able to benefit from  competition at the retail level."

DaimlerChrysler called the fine out of proportion to the charges and said it would decide "shortly" whether to appeal.

"This is all the more surprising as  Mercedes has for years played a pioneering role in price harmonization and European integration," it said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Stuttgart.

Monti said the investigation did not find any "general strategy" by  DaimlerChrysler to prevent cross-border trade within the EU, but was judged to have infringed the  rules in isolated cases.
A year ago, the EU  fined the Dutch importer of General Motors Corp.'s Opel cars 43 million  euros (dlrs
36.5 million) for telling its dealers not to sell to foreigners from countries where Opels cost more than in the
Netherlands.

The largest  fine was levied against Volkswagen in 1998 - 90 million  euros (dlrs 77.4 million) for restricting car sales in Italy.

The European Commission, which enforces EU  rules, began the investigation on its own initiative after receiving some complaints from consumers, Monti said.

Wednesday's decision was based on documents found during inspections in December 1996 at DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz AG) offices and  Mercedes dealerships in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain.

"Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are ... unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely," Monti said. "The consumer must be able to benefit from  competition at the retail level."

DaimlerChrysler called the fine out of proportion to the charges and said it would decide "shortly" whether to appeal.

"This is all the more surprising as  Mercedes has for years played a pioneering role in price harmonization and European integration," it said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Stuttgart.

Monti said the investigation did not find any "general strategy" by  DaimlerChrysler to prevent cross-border trade within the EU, but was judged to have infringed the  rules in isolated cases.
A year ago, the EU  fined the Dutch importer of General Motors Corp.'s Opel cars 43 million  euros (dlrs
36.5 million) for telling its dealers not to sell to foreigners from countries where Opels cost more than in the
Netherlands.

The largest  fine was levied against Volkswagen in 1998 - 90 million  euros (dlrs 77.4 million) for restricting car sales in Italy.

The European Commission, which enforces EU  rules, began the investigation on its own initiative after receiving some complaints from consumers, Monti said.

Wednesday's decision was based on documents found during inspections in December 1996 at DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz AG) offices and  Mercedes dealerships in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union ruled Wednesday that DaimlerChrysler AG
violated competition rules by restricting sales of its Mercedes cars in Europe and fined it nearly
$65.5 million.

It's one of the biggest  fines levied for restricting the ability of consumers to take advantage of price differences for cars in different  European countries.

TD
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the German automaker had violated  rules over several years in three ways:
-instructing its German dealers not to sell to customers outside their respective territory from 1996 to
1999 and making foreigners, but not Germans, pay a 15 percent deposit when ordering a car in
Germany, a requirement in place since 1985;

-limiting sales of cars to leasing companies in Germany and Spain, a practice Monti said is still ongoing;
-participating in a price-fixing agreement in Belgium to restrict rebates offered by dealers of its
Mercedes line from 1995 to 1999.

"Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are ... unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely," Monti said. "The consumer must be able to benefit from  competition at the retail level."

DaimlerChrysler called the fine out of proportion to the charges and said it would decide shortly whether to appeal.

"This is all the more surprising as  Mercedes has for years played a pioneering role in price harmonization and  European integration," it said in a statement from its headquarters in Stuttgart.

Monti said the investigation did not find any "general strategy" by DaimlerChrysler to prevent cross-border trade within the EU, but was judged to have infringed the rules in isolated cases.

The largest  fine was levied against Volkswagen in 1998 - $77.4 million for restricting car sales in
Italy.

The European Commission, which enforces EU  rules, began the latest investigation on its own initiative after receiving some complaints from consumers, Monti said.

Wednesday's decision was based on documents found during inspections in December 1996 at DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz AG) offices and  Mercedes dealerships in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 9 -- The European Commission is expected to impose a  fine Wednesday on
DaimlerChrysler A.G. as it concludes a five-year antitrust investigation of the German carmaker.

DaimlerChrysler was accused in 1999 of violating union  rules by preventing its exclusive dealer networks in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain from selling  Mercedes passenger cars to nonresidents of those countries, in an effort to stem the tide of shoppers seeking cheaper prices abroad.

TD
It was also accused of fixing the prices of its cars for sale to fleets.
The infringements, the commission said, took place between 1985 and 1996, well before the Chrysler
Corporation and Daimler Benz A.G. combined in 1998.
On Wednesday, the  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, will propose a  fine of 40 million euros
to 90 million euros (about $36.8 million to $82.8 million) to his 19 fellow commissioners at their weekly
meeting, according to people close to the  commission.

This amount falls short of the 102 million  euro fine imposed on Volkswagen for similar  antitrust violations in 1998. Volkswagen was found guilty of preventing Austrian car buyers from taking advantage of the weak Italian lira in 1995 by buying across the border. The  fine, however, was reduced to 90 million  euros by the European Court of Justice.

The accusations filed against  DaimlerChrysler in 1999 were more serious than those in the Volkswagen case because they concerned four countries rather than one, and they included allegations of price fixing.
''It is possible that a decision tomorrow only covers part of the objections we had in the first place,''
said Michael Tscherny, a spokesman for Mr. Monti. Mr. Tscherny said the scope of the  commission's
concerns had narrowed during the investigation, but he refused to give details. He also would not
confirm the amount of the  fine.

DaimlerChrysler's lawyers in Brussels declined to comment. The  commission opened an inquiry into
DaimlerChrysler in 1996 after receiving complaints from consumers.

DaimlerChrysler is one of a handful of carmakers to be investigated for abusing their special relationship with their tied dealerships. The  commission imposed a fine of 43 million euros last year on the General Motors Dutch unit, Opel Nederland, for preventing non-Dutch residents from buying in the Netherlands, where prices of new cars are among the lowest in the  European Union.
The French carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are also being investigated.

The car industry has benefited from partial immunity from  antitrust laws governing the links between manufacturers and their distributors since 1985. Carmakers say that the complicated nature of the


Page 32 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
product and the high ticket price justify a tied network of dealers with specialist knowledge of one or another brand of vehicle.
But their immunity runs out at the end of next September, and Mr. Monti has hinted that the
commission was unlikely to renew it.

Brussels, Oct 10 (EFE).- The European Commission has slapped a 72 million euro ($65.5 million) fine on the German-U.S. automaker Daimler-Chrysler for unfair  competition practices, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announced on Wednesday.

The company, he said, was sanctioned for hindering sales to non-Germans buying  Mercedes cars in Germany, limiting leasing operations in Germany and Spain and for engaging in de facto price fixing by putting a ceiling on dealers' rebates offered in Belgium.

"This is third-highest  fine that the European Commission has leveled against any  European company," Monti said and added that the commission had agreed unanimously that "Daimler-Chrysler violated competitionrules".

OUSTED MARCONI BOSS GETS 2.8 MILLION STG

Marconi , which had intended to take a firm stance with the former chief executive Lord Simpson over his pay-off, has agreed to a 300,000 stg cash payment in addition to Lord Simpson's 2.5 million stg funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme. Derek Bonham, who became chairman after the Lord Simpson and the former chairman Roger Hurn were ousted last month, said that there was no point in fighting a court case when the terms of the contract were pretty clear. The MSF union's general secretary Roger Lyons said: 'This is outrageous and a slap in the face for the workforce and shareholders alike'. Ministers, who are drafting new performance-related  rules for executives, are likely to come under even more pressure after Lord Simpson's payout.

BUSINESSES CALL FOR TAX CUTS TO OFFSET UNCERTAINTY.

Representing more than 5,000 companies, Martin Temple, the director general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, has called on the Treasury to make a 0.3 percent cut in employers' National Insurance contributions in November's pre-budget report. The cuts would save employers a billion stg, and the EEF is also calling for changes to the climate change levy to bring another 200 million stg in tax
cuts for manufacturers. Mr Temple also wants the planned relaxation of minimum funding requirements for pension funds speeded up. He will meet Treasury officials next week to discuss the proposals, which he sees as modest compared with the tax cuts announced in the US.
FINANCE DIRECTORS SHOW GROWING EAGERNESS TO JOIN  EURO.

In a survey of 350 finance directors of British business conducted by the employment agency Reed, 50 percent were in favour of joining the  euro and 36 percent were against, the highest number in favour since the quarterly survey began in 1999. Some of the respondents cited the need for international solidarity following September 11 as their reason for favouring the  euro, but other respondents said that the current economic climate was a bad time to take risks. Whether opinions have been changed by recent events is unclear and the anti-euro No campaign said the survey was too small to be reliable.
'DIGITAL TSAR' TO LEAD SWITCH-OVER.

The Department of Trade and Industry together with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will publish an 'action plan' on Friday which will include the appointment of a 'digital tsar' to oversee the changeover from analogue to digital TV broadcasting. TV industry leaders have urged the government to take a bigger role in encouraging the take-up of digital TV, an appeal led by ITV companies Carlton and Granada, who are expected to invest a billion stg in their ITV Digtal venture before it breaks even. Currently around 30 percent of British TV households are digital: Labour has said it will switch off the analogue signal when the figure reaches 95 percent.
MICROSOFT TO CONFRONT EU ON ANTI-TRUST.

Following a confidential document from the  European Commission to Microsoft alleging that the US company was obstructive in investigations, Microsoft has asked for a meeting with the  Commission to defend against the allegations. The  Commission would not comment on Wednesday, but is understood
to have arranged a hearing on December 20 and 21, which will also be open to rival companies in the EU. The Commission competition directorate is investigating alleged violations  competition law by
Page 36 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft, with respect to whether it used its dominant operating system to gain control of the server market and video player software market.
WPP TRIES TO PULL OUT OF TEMPUS DEAL.

Advertising group WPP has said that its board unanimously considers that a material adverse change has taken place in the advertising industry since September 11, and is appealing to a clause in its offer for Tempus which made the takeover conditional to there being no such change. The advertising industry is
in a marked downturn and Havas Advertising, against which WPP had been bidding for Tempus, as well as Cordiant Communications have issued profits warnings citing September 11 as the cause. The Takeover Panel will make an initial ruling soon as to whether WPP can be released from its offer, but a clause in a note to  rule 2.7 of the Takeover Code discounts general economic, political or industrial circumstances. WPP has added to its stake in Tempus since September 11, making its case harder to argue that September 11 is an exceptional circumstance.
GRANADA FREEZES PAY TO SAVE MONEY.

The biggest ITV company, Granada , has told its 5,000 staff that it will be better placed to review salaries next summer, and has frozen pay until then, including that of board directors. The company, the latest of a series of media companies to freeze pay, has already said it will cut 100 management positions and is understood to not have  ruled out further job cuts. Granada's main source of income is from advertising
and it has spent, together with Carlton , 800 million stg on ITV digital, with a further 300 million stg in joint spending committed to the venture before it breaks even.
PILOTS' UNION TO OPPOSE BA PROPOSAL TO CUT BONUS.

While the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the Transport and General Workers Union, two of the staff unions at British Airways, have accepted the company's proposals for a pay freeze in the hope it will save jobs, the GMB union has joined the pilots' union Balpa in rejecting the scrapping of guaranteed pay rises. A Balpa official said of the BA plans on Wednesday: 'They are the wrong proposals'. Balpa, which was to submit a pay claim later this month, is expected to draw up alternative proposals, hoping to follow the strong success of pilots' groups in other countries, such as those at Lufthansa in Germany who won a 15 percent pay rise.
INDEPENDENT LAWSUITS FOCUS ON ADVISERS.

More than 1,000 former policyholders, shareholders and employees of the collapsed Independent Insurance are preparing with  law firm Class Law to launch a class action in coming weeks. The lawsuit will target Independent's former actuaries and auditors, Watson Wyatt and KPMG, respectively. The
chairman of the Creditors of Independent Insurance, Kevin Young, said the intention was not to punish but to recover lost money, and that they would pursue those who can pay. Watson Wyatt would make no comment on Wednesday, but KPMG said that they were cooperating with investigators and that there was clear evidence 'that information was withheld from ourselves, our advisers, the board and the regulators'.
BRUSSELS  FINES DAIMLER 71 MILLION  EUROS.
The European Commission on Wednesday fined the German-US automotive group  DaimlerChrysler
71.8 million euros for price fixing on its Mercedes cars in Belgium, for limiting sales to independent
leasing companies in German and Spain and for obliging non-German customers to place a 15 percent
deposit to source cars from German dealers. The  fine comes as the Commission reviews its 20-year old
block exemption for car retailers, which allows carmakers to sell only through captive dealers. The
Commission has also let the  fine be understood as a warning to other carmakers and officials said that
such abuses would be taken into account when new retailing  rules are recommended. A
DaimlerChrysler executive said that  Mercedes had gone further than most carmakers to harmonise
prices in Europe, and the group intends to appeal.

HD        EU warns car makers for rigging markets. WC       441 words

CAR makers have been warned they will be severely punished if they persist in trying to stop customers shopping around for the best deal anywhere in the  European Union.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti was speaking after fining  DaimlerChrysler #45m for rigging the market to discourage bargain hunters snapping up models abroad to save thousands of pounds.

TD
He said: "A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices. The  Commission
is determined to ensure that they benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal.

"Consumers strongly and rightly criticise the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor who is willing to supply them or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers."

The latest case tackled by Brussels - the fourth fine against a car manufacturer for failing to respect competition rules - followed an instruction from DaimlerChrysler's German distribution network not to sell Mercedes cars outside their allotted territory.

And to discourage foreign customers trying to buy the car at lower prices than the same model on their home market, distributors were told to demand a deposit of 15pc - something not required of German customers.

It was a "very serious" offence, said Mr Monti, because it helped partition national markets and thwart the whole aim of the EU single market.

DaimlerChrylser also rigged the market in Belgium through a pricefixing agreement limiting to 3pc the rebates its Belgian dealers could offer customers. Those exceeding that level found supplies of new cars were reduced.

"Our investigation has shown once more that the car manufacturers can largely control their distributors and punish those whose commercial behaviour they dislike.

"This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear. Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are therefore unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely, " said Mr Monti.
The latest infringement will increase the chances of the Commission refusing to renew the  European
car industry's current exemption from EU competitionrules.

Car makers have been allowed to operate exclusive sales and servicing centres for years, but the pressure is on to establish supermarket-style multi-marque showrooms in line with other retail sectors in which consumers are expected to shop around freely wherever they choose in the EU.
The car industry says it needs to operate separately because of the specialised nature of modern cars. But Brussels will refuse to renew the exclusive dealership arrangements in September next year if it
feels the system is being used to distort the EU market and keep prices artificially high in some member
countries.

The Globe and Mail reports in its Thursday, Oct. 11, edition that the  European Commission is unwinding a French electronics merger and fining DaimlerChrysler for impeding cross-border car sales. An Agence France-Presse dispatch to The Globe reports that the commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies Schneider Electric and Legrand, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment. And it imposed a fine of $65.53-million (U.S.) on  DaimlerChrysler for unfair competition in the European distribution of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks. In the past decade, the commission has blocked 16 planned mergers, including several major tie-ups involving firms based outside the European Union, and levied heavy  fines
for antitrust violations by EU firms.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti says  DaimlerChrysler broke
"fundamental  rules of competition" within the EU.

TD
He says, "The commission is determined to ensure consumers benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal." DaimlerChrysler says it considers the  commission's findings "unfounded" and that it would challenge the decision.

BRITISH drivers trying to buy Mercedes-Benz cars on the Continent have been illegally blocked by the
German car maker, the European Commission has decided.

Now the EC has  fined MB parent  DaimlerChrysler #45m for refusing to sell cars to consumers shopping abroad for lower prices.

TD
Mario Monti, EU competition commissioner, said the German carmaker has broken  rules on
price-fixing, leasing competition and parallel trade. It found that  DaimlerChrysler instructed dealers in
Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium not to sell to bargain hunters from other EU countries between
1985 and 1996.
Volkswagen was last year  fined #56m for restrictive sales practices.

The new fine comes just months before the EC is expected to announce an end to automakers' control over dealer networks, the so-called Block Exemption.
Mr Monti said, "This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear. Practices like the ones that
DaimlerChrysler indulged in are therefore unacceptable and must be reprimanded."

EU statistics published revealed that 46 of 81 models are more than 20pc more expensive than in at least one other market in the dozen countries sharing the  euro currency.

All 20 commissioners voted for the  fine, the third biggest ever imposed on an individual company. DaimlerChrysler said the fine was disproportionate to the charges and it would "shortly" decide whether to appeal.

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - DaimlerChrysler is fined EUR 72 million. WC  262 words

LP
Brussels, 10/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday, the  Commission decided unanimously to impose a fine of EUR 72 million on the German-American automobile manufacturer  DaimlerChrysler for three infringements to the Community  competition rules. After a detailed investigation initiated in April
1999, the Commission reached the conclusion that the manufacturer had infringed European                  
competitionrules in three ways. Infringements consisted of:

Measures that were an obstacle to the parallel trade of cars in Germany:  DaimlerChrysler had ordered the members of its German distribution network of  Mercedes passenger cars not to sell cars outside their respective territory.

TD
Measures to limit in Germany and Spain the sales of cars by  Mercedes agents or dealers to independent leasing companies as long as these companies had not found customers for the cars concerned. Such restrictions prevented the companies from holding cars in stock or from benefiting from rebates granted to all fleet owners. Consequently, the independent leasing companies were not able to pass on such favourable conditions to their clients.
A price fixing agreement, in Belgium, with the aim of limiting the rebates granted to consumers: According
to the agreement,  DaimlerChrysler reduced deliveries to dealers which granted their customers reductions
higher than the 3% level agreed.

Practices in the automobile sector are thus under close scrutiny by the Commission. This is the fourth time an automobile manufacturer receives a  fine for breach of competition rules. The manufacturer Volkswagen was found guilty of similar infringements on two occasions (in 1998 and 2001), as was Opel in
2000.

Car makers were warned yesterday they will be severely punished if they persist in trying to stop customers shopping around for the best deal anywhere in the  European Union.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announced that  DaimlerChrysler had been fined #45 million by the Commission for rigging the market to discourage bargain hunters buying models abroad to save thousands of pounds.

TD
He said: 'A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices. The  Commission
is determined to ensure that they benefit from  competition at retail level and get a good deal.

'Consumers strongly and rightly criticise the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor who is willing to supply them or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers.'

The latest case tackled by Brussels - the fourth fine against a car manufacturer for failing to respect competition rules - followed an instruction from DaimlerChrysler's German distribution network not to sell Mercedes cars outside their allotted territory. To discourage foreign customers trying to buy the car at lower prices than the same model on their home market, distributors were told to demand a deposit of
15 per cent - something not required of German customers.

It was a 'very serious' offence, said Mr Monti, because it helped partition national markets and thwart the whole aim of the EU single market.

DaimlerChrylser also rigged the market in Belgium through a price-fixing agreement limiting to three per cent the rebates its Belgian dealers could offer customers.
Those exceeding that level found supplies of new cars were reduced.
The latest infringement will increase the chances of the Commission refusing to renew the  European
car industry's current exemption from EU competitionrules.

Car makers have been allowed to operate exclusive sales and servicing centres for years, but the pressure is on to establish supermarket-style multi-marque showrooms in line with other retail sectors in which consumers are expected to shop around freely wherever they choose in the EU.

HD   AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY - EURO 72 MILLION FINE FOR DAIMLERCHRYSLER. WC   978 words

The European Commission set a fine of Euro 71.825 million on DaimlerChrysler AG, on October 10, for three infringements against article 81 of the EU Treaty covering the common rules on competition and undertakings. The decision concerns measures adopted by DaimlerChrysler AG. The company had "impeded parallel trade in cars and limited  competition in the leasing and sale of motor vehicles."

TD
"A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices," declared EU  Competition commissioner Mario Monti, on October 10. "The  Commission is determined to ensure that they benefit from competition at retail level and get a good deal." He added that the  Commission investigation had shown "once more" that the car manufacturers can "largely control their distributors and punish those whose commercial behaviour they dislike". In determining the level of the  fine, the Commission took into account the fact that the measures applied were destined to prevent consumers from taking advantage of the benefits of the Single Market."This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear. Practices like the ones that DaimlerChrysler indulged in are therefore unacceptable and must be reprimanded severely." The decision is based on documents found during a series of inspections made in December 1996 on the premises of DaimlerChrysler AG (formerly  Daimler-Benz AG or  Mercedes-Benz AG) in Germany, and at the premises of its subsidiaries in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain.
The former Competition Commissioner, Karel Van Miert, had already signalled potential action back in
1998 when he imposed a Euro 102 fine on Volkswagen for not respecting EU  competition rules. "The
size of the  fine is an indication that the Commission will not tolerate practices of this kind and will act with
similar determination against other manufacturers who set out to partition the market."
Conclusions.

The Commission said the German car maker instructed its German car dealers not to sell to customers outside their respective territories from 1996 to 1999, and required foreigners to pay a 15 % deposit when ordering a car in Germany.

DaimlerChrysler also limited the sale of its cars to leasing companies in Germany and Spain, according to the Commission. Finally, the company was accused of participating in price-fixing agreements in Belgium to restrict rebates offered by dealers of  Mercedes-Benz from 1995 to 1999.

The measures adopted by the German company infringe not only the provisions of Article 81 of the EU Treaty, which prohibits all agreements between undertakings which may effect trade negatively between member States. It also breaches the  Commission Regulation 1475/95 concerning motor vehicle distribution (Official Journal L145 of June 29, 1995), prohibiting car manufacturers and their importers from restricting, either directly or indirectly, the freedom of final consumers, authorised intermediaries or dealers of their own distribution network, to buy new motor vehicles in the Member State of their choice. The
Regulation therefore assures that  European consumers have the option of buying a car wherever it is most advantageous to them. In doing this, consumers can also use the services of an authorised intermediary."We will appeal the decision," declared Tony Melfi, DaimlerChrysler's corporate communications manager and head of automotive affairs in Stuttgart. "The Commission's allegations are serious, and few of the accusations are founded. The decision is all the more surprising that  Mercedes has always played a pionneering role in the harmonisation of prices and has always contributed in the
European integration." Mr Melfi did not, however, wish to comment the accusations any further.



Page 44 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He did add however that the  Commission dropped the more serious charges against the company, formulated in 1999. "It no longer tried to prove" that the company was practising "overall cross-border strategies", prohibiting car dealers from selling cars to customers abroad, said Mr Melfi.

Mr Monti, on his side, noted it was the fourth time a car manufacturer was  fined for breaking EU laws. Common decisions were taken twice against Volkswagen in 1998 and 2001, and once against Opel Nederland BV/General Motors Nederland BV in 2000. The most serious was the 1998  Euro 102 million on Volkswagen for "systematically forcing its authorised dealers in Italy to refuse to sell Volkswagen and Audi cars to foreign buyers," mainly from Germany and Austria.
EU considering changes to block exemption.

The DaimlerChrysler decision comes at a time when the Commission is considering changes to its block exemption (which is due to expire in 2002) for car manufacturers from antitrust rules. Those laws generally prohibit companies from restricting  competition by assigning territories or agreeing to fix prices, but auto makers have an exemption that allows them to assign exclusive dealerships.

Due to expire in 2002, Mr Monti announced on October 10, that a first draft of the new rules of the block exemption could be expected to surface before the end of the year. He said the Commission would "take into account the experiences of the application - to some extent, I should say the nonapplication - of current regulations by car manufacturers".

"We should justify (...) our conviction, that when competitive conditions are in place, producers try to attract customers by offering them a lower price, higher quality or better service than their competitors, and that consumers are also the final beneficiaries when efforts made by firms lead to greater innovation and efficiency," said the  Competition Commissioner at the fourth "European Competition Day" which took place in Antwerp on October 11. "But this will happen only if companies compete rather than collude, if market power is not abused and if efficiencies lead not only to increased profits."Mr Monti explained that
the Commission has pursued "a merciless policy" since the early sixties "against companies which - one way or another - clipped the wings of parallel traders". "DaimlerChrysler is the last one in a long series of companies to now feel the heat," the commissioner concluded.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS NAMED $64 MILLION AS THE SUM  DAIMLER CHRYSLER IS TO PAY IN FINES. THIS WAS ANNOUNCED FOLLOWING A FIVE-YEAR INVESTIGATION WHICH REVEALED THAT THE COMPANY WAS ENGAGED IN PRICE FIXING AND ALSO SUPPLIED LIMITED
MERCEDES-BENZ CARS TO SOME COUNTRIES IN  EUROPE IN ORDER TO KEEP ITS PRICES HIGH IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

Reference: FT, "DaimlerChrysler committed a $64 million offence", Vedomosti, 10.10.2001, p. B2; I. Fedin, "Mercedes will pay for taking care of its prestige", Kommersant, 10.10.2001, p. 5.

TD
This is one of the largest fines ever to be charged by a  European regulatory body. The sum reflects the growing dissatisfaction of the European Commission about the current  European trade regulations, which allows automobile manufacturers to avoid competition. Now manufacturers are practically the ones controlling distribution and sales of new cars and therefore they are able to set and change at will the
condition of sale in different EU countries. In one year the current rule will cease operating and will have to be replaced with a new one, which will facilitate tougher competition.

Kommersant pointed out that representatives of  DaimlerChrysler deny any wrongdoing. However, indirect factors showed that the company was meddling in the affairs of its dealers, at a time it did so to those in Russia as well. In mid 1999 the Russian media carried reports that the management of the company,
called Daimler-Benz at the time, was doing everything to postpone the beginning of official supply of the latest models to Russia. According to unofficial sources, the company was then afraid of the intensifying image of Mercedes as a car of bandits and unscrupulous people. Moreover, the company tried not to deliver on individual orders made from Russia.

Time will tell how authentic the allegations against  DaimlerChrysler are. Experts are saying, however, that even if the company is found guilty of the allegations, the sum of  fine will be reduced significantly. Moreover, in the opinion of analysts, in the event of this outcome the management of  DaimlerChrysler will immediately file an appeal and it does have good chances of winning in court.

There are examples of successful appeal against the EU  Commission's decisions. The largest  fine in the history of the EU, 102 million  euros($94 million), was pronounced as penalty for Volkswagen, which was accused of violations similar to the one Daimler Chrysler is facing. But after a court appeal filed by Volkswagen the sum was reduced to 90 million euros ($83 million).

COUNTRY BRIEFING

TD
FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

The Commission has again flexed its  antitrust muscles against the  European car manufacturers, slapping a fine of nearly EUR; 72m on Germany's DaimlerChrysler for a series of abuses. This is the fourth time a carmaker has been  fined for not respecting the EU competition rules.
The fine, the third highest ever levied against a single company, relates to three separate practices. The first is actions taken by DaimlerChrysler to obstruct crossborder sales of  Mercedes cars - a "very
serious" infringement of the rules. According to the  Commission, during 1996-99 the manufacturer
ordered its German dealers not to sell outside their respective territory. Distributors were also instructed
to oblige foreign consumers, but not German ones, to pay a deposit of 15% when ordering a vehicle in
Germany.

Secondly,  DaimlerChrysler was found guilty by the  Commission of curbing sales of cars to independent leasing companies in Germany and Spain. The company's third alleged offence was to instigate price-fixing arrangements in Belgium, limiting the rebates granted by  Mercedes dealers to consumers.

"Our investigation has shown once more that the car manufacturers can largely control their distributors and punish those whose commercial behaviour they dislike," said  competition commissioner Mario Monti. "This is an area where the  law is perfectly clear. Practices like the ones that  DaimlerChrysler indulged in are therefore unacceptable, and must be reprimanded."

Lawyers see this case as another nail in the coffin of the EU's block exemption for the motor industry, which expires next September. "The block exemption relies on car manufacturers abiding by the competition rules laid down by EU law outside of the exemption," explains Stephen Kinsella, managing partner at the Brussels branch of law firm Herbert Smith. Yet the growing number of  fines against car companies for breaching antitrust rules shows that Mr Monti's patience with the industry is wearing thin. It is widely expected that he will attempt to usher in sweeping changes to the block exemption next year, in a push to improve competition in the sector.
