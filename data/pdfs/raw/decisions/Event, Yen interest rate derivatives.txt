LP
Brussels is poised to levy multibillion-euro  fines on banks that took part in a cartel to rig two key global
interest rate benchmarks as the cost of financial misconduct continues to spiral.

Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale are set to pay the  fines next month to settle allegations they acted in concert to manipulate either Euribor,  Yen Libor or both benchmarks, according to people familiar with the talks.

TD
A further three banks - JPMorgan, HSBC and Crédit Agricole - have been involved in the talks but are currently holding out from signing a joint settlement, the people said. These banks are likely to face formal charges that would pave the way for  fines at a later stage.

The news comes at a torrid time for the world's biggest banks, which are facing a litany of scandals ranging from allegations they manipulated the foreign exchange market to to the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and consumer products.

Next month's bumper EU settlement relates to alleged collusion between interest  rate traders in two separate cartels, which sought to gain financially by manipulating the Japan-focused Yen Libor and Libor's European sister benchmark, Euribor. The Commission has warned some banks that it is seeking a fine of as much as €800m each for groups involved in both cartels. The precise level will depend on a mix of culpability and market share.

Even with only three banks signing up, the settlement is expected to smash antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU  fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. If the Commission issues  fines at the top of the range for all six banks, the aggregate could hit €5bn, although people involved in the talks expect the final number to be significantly lower.

The Commission's Euribor case relies in large part on evidence submitted by Barclays, which has secured immunity from EU cartel  fines relating to Euribor. Its settlement with UK and US financial regulators in mid-2012 showed that a euroswaps trader, Philippe Moryoussef - identified only as "a trader" in Barclays' settlement report - had "orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks".

Traders at Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Rabobank, Crédit Agricole and SocGen all communicated with Mr Moryoussef, a Financial Times investigation found. Rabobank is not involved with the Euribor settlement and is unlikely to face charges, according to people familiar with the case.

Four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker ICAP have settled with regulators around the world over core Libor abuses, paying a combined $3.5bn in fines. However, the EU antitrust authorities have not been party to those deals, preferring instead to seek a multi-bank arrangement of their own specifically relating to collusion.

Over the past year Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition chief, has pressed banks and interdealer brokers to settle the most advanced probes on the  Yen Libor and Euribor manipulation, with the aim of announcing a deal in December. A third cartel probe into Swiss franc Libor abuses is still in progress.

Page 4 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Unlike US antitrust regulators, Brussels will not settle with individual cartel members and only concludes cases simultaneously with all or most of the companies involved - a process that typically takes several years. While more than half of the banks involved in the Euribor cartel are pursuing a deal, the European Commission has never endorsed a settlement when three groups hold out.

Those banks refusing to settle would face formal charges - a so-called statement of objections - that could eventually lead to an antitrust ruling and a  fine. The holdouts are unwilling to open discussions over what they consider to be unfounded allegations of wrongdoing or unfairly high settlement amounts.

There are EU guidelines for calculating cartel  fines but the rules have never been applied to markets in financial instruments. The commission can impose a maximum penalty equivalent to 10 per cent of a company's global turnover for each cartel it is found to be involved with.

Those groups expressing interest in a settlement are typically given a range for the potential  fine, which can include discounts for co-operation.

The main incentive to settle under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet against the cartel, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out have the opportunity to fight the charges in Commission organised hearings and eventually to appeal against any decision in the courts.

Mr Almunia said in September: "EU settlements are normally concluded with all parties at the same time. Let me stress that if a company ultimately decides not to join the others in a global settlement, it will continue to be investigated under normal proceedings."
All the banks and the  EU Commission declined to comment.

HD            EU to levy record fines on LIBOR banks

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters)—EU antitrust regulators will levy a record  fine of at least €1.5 billion ($2.02 billion) on six financial institutions, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, for rigging the yen LIBOR  interest rate benchmark, a banking industry source said on Wednesday [Nov. 6].

The world's top interdealer broker,  ICAP, and Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank are among the firms that will be  fined, the person said. The names of the other two financial institutions were not immediately clear.

TD
Switzerland's UBS will not be fined because it was the first member of the group to come clean
during the European Commission's investigation into wrongdoing, two sources familiar with the case
confirmed to Reuters.

The yen LIBOR  fines, likely to be the biggest so far to be handed out by Brussels, come on top of other penalties for a separate case involving the rigging of the Euribor benchmark  interest rate, reported by Reuters on Tuesday [Nov. 5].

Other regulators worldwide have also punished several banks and brokerages — including some of those to be  fined by the European Commission — for misconduct.

EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia will announce the penalties next month, at the same time as  fines for the rigging of the euro zone  interest rate, dealing a blow to a system which allowed banks to determine the cost of borrowing.

"The total  fine could be at least €1.5 billion," the financial industry source told Reuters. That would beat the current record of €1.47 billion  fine handed down to a cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

The London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) is a central cog in the global financial system, used as a benchmark for pricing hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of products.

The financial source said the group of banks had admitted to wrongdoing in yen LIBOR, the rate associated with the Japanese currency, in exchange for a 10 percent cut in the fine. The fines, which can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, are nonetheless set to be significant.

RBS had a turnover of £25 billion ($40.2 billion) last year, while Barclays was £29 billion and Rabobank €13.5 billion.  ICAP's turnover was £1.47 billion. RBS, Barclays, Rabobank,  ICAP and UBS declined to comment.

Antoine Colombani, the  European Commission spokesman for competition policy, declined to comment.

Almunia wants to hand out the  fines by the end of the year, reinforcing his emerging legacy as a firm penalizer of banks' wrongdoing since the financial crisis struck five years ago. His investigators say interest rate derivatives' traders colluded to rig the LIBOR and Euribor benchmarks, using advanced knowledge of the cost of borrowing to bolster their profits. Such cartels are illegal.

LIBOR is based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans. Other regulators have already found that traders colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits.

(Recasts to incorporate Euribor and Libor settlement details)

BRUSSELS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A number of finance firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Rabobank face billions of euros in  fines next month from European Union regulators for colluding on global benchmark interest rates, reinforcing Brussels' hard line on the sector after the financial crisis.

TD
EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia is set to unveil a record  fine of at least 1.5 billion euros ($2.03 billion) on six banks, including Barclays and RBS, for rigging the  yen Libor interest rate benchmark, a banking source said on Wednesday.

In addition to the  yen Libor fines, likely to be the biggest so far from Brussels, Almunia will also penalise another group of banks for operating as a cartel in a separate case involving the rigging of the Euribor benchmark interest rate, reported by Reuters on Tuesday.

Fines in the two cases could run to billions of euros.

The fines will add to the spiralling cost to banks for cleaning up past misdeeds. Globally this is expected to reach about $125 billion if JP Morgan agrees a $13 billion deal with the U.S. authorities over mortgages.

This earnings season, banks set aside more money for the rising cost of  fines, lawsuits and compensation.

Authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

The London inter-bank offered rate (Libor) and its European cousin (Euribor) are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets, from Spanish mortgages to  derivatives.

A settlement with the EU over cartel allegations would require the banks to admit liability, potentially paving the way for lawsuits from investors and others who believe they have lost money because of the rates manipulation.

Under the Libor settlement, the world's top interdealer broker,  ICAP, and Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank are among those that will be  fined, the person said. The names of the other two financial institutions were not immediately clear.

Switzerland's UBS will not be  fined because it was the first member of the group to come clean during the European Commission's investigation into wrongdoing, two sources familiar with the case confirmed to Reuters.

European lawmakers have responded to public anger over the cost of bank bailouts with tough measures that include the first bonus cap in the world for bankers.

Almunia wants to hand out the  fines by the end of the year, reinforcing his reputation for cracking down hard on banks' wrongdoings since the financial crisis struck five years ago.

"The total  fine could be at least 1.5 billion euros ($2.02 billion)," the financial industry source told Reuters of the Libor settlement. That would beat the current record of 1.47 billion euro  fine for a cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

The financial source said the group of banks had admitted to wrongdoing in yen Libor, the rate associated with the Japanese currency, in exchange for a 10 percent cut in the fine.

The fines, which can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, are nonetheless set to be significant.
RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds and Rabobank
13.5 billion euros.  ICAP's turnover was 1.47 billion pounds. RBS, Barclays, Rabobank,  ICAP and UBS
declined to comment.

The European Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment.

For its Euribor settlement, Brussels is also set to  fine six global banks, including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, a source has told Reuters.
Barclays, which alerted the  European Commission to the suspected wrongdoing in relation to
Euribor, will not be  fined.
All of the banks named in relation to either settlement declined to comment.

Almunia's investigators say  interest rate derivatives' traders colluded to rig the Libor and Euribor benchmarks, using advanced knowledge of the cost of borrowing to bolster their profits. Such cartels are illegal.

Libor is based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans. Other regulators have already found that traders colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits.

In the Libor settlement, all the banks have admitted to wrongdoing to reduce the size of their  fine, but in the Euribor settlement several of the banks are contesting the size of the proposed penalties.

HSBC, Europe's largest bank, is one of those, two sources said. In these cases, the banks are likely to face formal charges next month, followed by  fines next year, one of the people said.

HD         EU poised to set record for Libor  fines

Brussels is preparing to hit banks and brokers with record  fines for market manipulation in its investigation into  yen Libor.

The European Commission is likely to collect more than €1.5 billion (£1.3 billion) from a group of banks and brokers in a settlement by the end of the year, a source told Reuters. Additional  fines for manipulation of Euribor, the eurozone equivalent of Libor, are also likely.

TD
Those under investigation for manipulation of benchmark interest rates include Barclays, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Rabobank, UBS and the broker Icap. Joaquín Almunia, the European Union commissioner in charge of the investigation, said over the summer that settlements should be reached by the end of the year in a case that has been continuing for at least two years.

The EU has been running its own investigation rather than take part in joint efforts between Japanese, American, British and Dutch regulators. Brussels has the power to  fine banks up to 10 per cent of their global turnover for violation of antitrust rules. In theory that could amount to  fines worth tens of billions of pounds.

The Brussels inquiry into Euribor could snare more banks than the Libor investigation because 44 lenders contribute to its calculation, compiled by the European Banking Federation (EBF), compared with smaller numbers who send in data for Libor.

The panel banks contribute to calculating the rates by estimating what they would have to pay to borrow for various lengths of time in different currencies and send their guess to the EBF, which calculates an average and releases it as a daily benchmark rate. The rate is used as a basis for financial products worth trillions of euros, from mortgages to complex  derivatives.

The European Commission's biggest  fine for antitrust violations amounted to €1.5 billion for a cartel making cathode ray tubes. LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung were among those  fined last year for the violations. Microsoft was  fined €561 million in March for failing to offer users the choice of non Microsoft web browsers on Windows.

HD         EU poised to set record for Libor  fines

Brussels is preparing to hit banks and brokers with record  fines for market manipulation in its investigation into  yen Libor.

The European Commission is likely to collect more than €1.5 billion (£1.3 billion) from a group of banks and brokers in a settlement by the end of the year, a source told Reuters. Additional  fines for manipulation of Euribor, the eurozone equivalent of Libor, are also likely.

TD
Those under investigation for manipulation of benchmark interest rates include Barclays, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Rabobank, UBS and the broker Icap. Joaquín Almunia, the European Union commissioner in charge of the investigation, said over the summer that settlements should be reached by the end of the year in a case that has been continuing for at least two years.

The EU has been running its own investigation rather than take part in Joint efforts between Japanese, Ameri-can, British and Dutch regulators. Brussels has the power to  fine banks up to 10 per cent of their global turnover for violation of antitrust rules. In theory that could amount to  fines worth tens of billions of pounds.

The Brussels inquiry into Euribor could snare more banks than the Libor investigation because 44 lenders contribute to its calculation, compiled by the European Banking Federation (EBF), compared with smaller numbers who send in data for Libor.

The panel banks contribute to calculating the rates by estimating what they would have to pay to borrow for various lengths of time in different currencies and send their guess to the EBF, which calculates an average and releases it as a daily benchmark rate. The rate is used as a basis for financial products worth trillions of euros, from mortgages to complex  derivatives.

The European Commission's biggest  fine for antitrust violations amounted to €1.5 billion for a cartel making cathode ray tubes. LG Electronics, Philips and Samsung were among those  fined last year for the violations. Microsoft was  fined €561 million in March for failing to offer users the choice of non Microsoft web browsers on Windows.

HD       EC Fines Firms Over Rates Derivatives Manipulation

The European Commission on Tuesday finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion ($2.34 billion) as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest  rate derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to  interest rate derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro  interest rate derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the
Commission, the cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro  interest rate derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement cartel procedure. For the cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against  ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

HD        UPDATE 2-EU readies multi-million euro benchmark rigging fines -sources

BRUSSELS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will impose record multi-million euro  fines on six banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland on Wednesday for rigging key interest rate benchmarks, sources said.

The sanctions, the first by the European Commission for rate manipulation and expected to top 1.5 billion euros ($2.04 billion), follow hefty fines on top banks for similar offences from authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere.

TD
The benchmarks involved in the three cases - the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo and the euro area equivalents - are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to  derivatives.

JPMorgan and Barclays were also in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.

The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 percent reduction in  fines. UBS alerted the  European      Commission to the yen interest rate derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates. French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.

It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its Euribor involvement on Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent Euribor  fines on Nov. 5.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is expected to announce the  fines for the three cases at 1030 GMT on Wednesday, a second person said.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Commission spokesman for competition policy Antoine Colombani could not be immediately reached for comment.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker  ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's
Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds. Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

HD       Europe to unleash heavy rate-fixing fines

LP
Brussels will unveil heavy fines as soon as Wednesday on a group of global banks that allegedly formed cartels to rig two key global interest  rate benchmarks, in a settlement set to break European antitrust enforcement records.

The latest regulatory crackdown over benchmark manipulation is expected to target up to 10 financial institutions. Some will admit wrongdoing while others will face formal charges alleging they colluded to fix Euribor,  Yen Libor or both. The settlements will involve combined  fines of hundreds of millions of euros apiece for most cartel members.

TD
The decision to be announced by Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, will add to the escalating costs of a scandal that has rocked the financial sector. The multi-bank deal will also provide a more comprehensive account of alleged collusion between traders at different institutions, people
familiar with the settlements said.

Each of the two cases - one focused on the  Yen Libor and the other on Libor's European sister benchmark - involve around half a dozen banks or brokers, the people said. Most banks involved in each cartel - including Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and Citi - will settle and pay fines for attempting to act in concert to rig the benchmarks and profit from related  interest rate              derivatives. RBS and Deutsche will face  fines for both cartels.

Barclays and UBS are to avoid  fines for Euribor and Libor manipulation, respectively, because they alerted EU officials to the illegal practices. Both banks will admit wrongdoing, a move that could still leave them vulnerable to private damages claims in the courts. Barclays declined to comment on whether it would face  fines for Libor.

Some banks - JPMorgan, HSBC and Crédit Agricole - have been involved in the talks but were last month balking at signing a joint Euribor settlement. Banks that hold out are expected to face formal charges that could pave the way for  fines at a later stage. Interdealer broker  ICAP is not part of the joint settlement on Libor.
The announcement will be an unwelcome reminder of past sins for an industry still struggling to cope
with a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and consumer products
to alleged manipulation of foreign exchange benchmarks. The  European Commission decision is to be
formally adopted by the college of commissioners on Wednesday, according to the meeting agenda.

The exact level of  fines remains confidential, unknown even to the banks involved. But the commission warned some banks that it is seeking a  fine of as much as €800m each for groups involved in both cartels. The range of  fines for the individual banks will vary significantly and the precise level will depend on a mix of culpability and leniency for co-operation.

Once the investigation is complete and all banks are fined, the penalty is expected to break antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. One person familiar with the case said the  fines for Libor are expected to be significantly smaller than the penalties for Euribor manipulation.

Page 19 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There are EU guidelines for calculating cartel  fines but the rules have never been applied to markets in financial instruments. The commission can impose a maximum penalty equivalent to 10 per cent of a company's global turnover for each cartel it is found to be involved with.

Four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker  ICAP have already paid a total of $3.5bn in fines to settle with regulators around for world for Libor-related abuses. However, the EU antitrust authorities have not been party to those deals and for three years pursued its own investigation relating to breaches of antitrust law. A third EU cartel probe into alleged Swiss franc Libor abuses is still in progress.

Unlike US antitrust regulators, Brussels will not settle with individual cartel members and it only concludes cases simultaneously with all or most of the companies involved. Those banks refusing to settle would face formal charges - a so-called statement of objections - that could eventually lead to an antitrust ruling and a  fine.

The main incentive to settle under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet against the cartel, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out have the opportunity to fight the charges in commission-organised hearings and eventually to appeal against any decision in the courts.
All the banks and the commission declined to comment.

HD     2ND LEAD: EU fines banks, traders 1.7 billion euros for rate-rigging By dpa correspondents Eds: Adds bank reax, Almunia  quotes, lenders who refused settlement
WC    721 words

LP
Brussels (dpa) - The European Union imposed Wednesday a record fine totalling 1.7 billion euros (2.3 billion dollars) on six financial institutions for manipulating interest-rate benchmarks, with the bloc's top competition official vowing that more is yet to come.

Suspicions about rate-rigging date back to the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmarks involved - most notably Libor and Euribor - serve as references for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

TD
The EU believes that lenders colluded illegally by discussing the interest rates they would submit for the benchmarks' calculation and sharing other commercially sensitive information.

"The aim of these talks between traders was to increase their banks' profits and in turn their own bonuses," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in Brussels, calling the conduct "appalling."

The firms fined Wednesday entered settlements with the EU to end cartel investigations into their activities, paving the way for their  fines to be reduced by 10 per cent.
A further three banks and one trader have refused to settle. Those inquiries will continue, Almunia said. Germany's Deutsche Bank faces the stiffest penalty at 725 million euros, followed by France's Societe
Generale with 446 million euros and Britain's RBS with 391 million euros.

The amounts are meant to both punish the institutions and dissuade others from following their example, Almunia said. He spoke also of the need to restore trust in financial markets.
All three lenders blamed the rate-rigging on individual employees.

"Societe Generale firmly condemns such inappropriate behavior, which is in total contradiction with its internal code of conduct," the bank said in statement.

Since 2008, it has "completely overhauled" its  interest-rate submission processes, the statement added, assuring that the  fine would not affect the bank's financial goals for 2013.

Financial markets nevertheless turned against all three of France's major lenders, with Societe Generale shares down more than 1 per cent shortly after the EU announcement.

Deutsche Bank also insisted that it has made provisions in advance to pay the EU penalty, with no need for extra funds to be set aside.

RBS chairman Philip Hampton, meanwhile, said Wednesday's news was "another sobering reminder of ... past failings."

"Nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue," he added. "There were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees."
Prior to the EU's  fine, RBS had already paid penalties totalling 391 million pounds (640 million dollars) to
US and British authorities, for its role in manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate.

Britain's Barclays had also landed at the centre of the Libor scandal last year, but escaped an EU  fine on
Wednesday - along with Switzerland's UBS - for blowing the whistle on the cartels.
The other banks hit with  fines were US lenders JP Morgan and Citigroup, which face penalties between
70 and 80 million euros. The British broker firm RP Martin was slapped with a 247,000-euro  fine.
A spokesman for RP Martin declined to comment.
Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe General and RBS were involved in manipulating interest rate             
derivatives denominated in euros from 2005 to 2008, the  European Commission found.
Inquiries on this rate-rigging continue into France's Credit Agricole, Britain's HSBC and JP Morgan. Manipulations of  derivatives denominated in the Japanese  yen were chalked up to UBS, RBS, Deutsche
Bank, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin, with infringements found between 2007 and 2010. The cash
broker ICAP remains under investigation.

There are estimates that benchmarks - which include major indices such as Libor and Euribor, but also those used to set cocoa or oil prices - are a reference for financial instruments and contracts valued at more than 1,000 trillion euros.

The commission is probing whether other benchmarks such as currency exchange rates were also manipulated.

Banks involved in a financial cartel that colluded to fix crucial benchmark rates have been levied with
fines that total EUR1.7bn by the  European Commission, it was reported on Wednesday.

These benchmarks included the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents. The benchmark rates are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to  derivatives.

The rate rigging was described by  European Commission vice-president Joaquin Almunia as “appalling examples of misconduct”.

UK bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is among the banks that had the record breaking  fines imposed for fixing yen Libor and Euribor rates. Other organisations involved were Deutsche Bank, which received the biggest fine of EUR725.36m, Societe Generale and broking firm RP Martin, which is said to have facilitated one of the infringements by using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor. Two US banks, JP Morgan and Citibank, were also involved in the cartel.

Barclays bank escaped being  fined EUR690m, as it had voluntarily reported that the cartel was rigging Euribor rates. Swiss bank UBS also avoided a  fine of EUR2.5bn for exposing the cartel in  yen Libor fixing. The European Commission said it will continue investigating Credit Agricole, HSBC, JPMorgan and brokerage ICAP for similar offences. Credit Agricole has reportedly refused to settle and is likely to
face sanctions in 2014, while HSBC has also contested the penalty proposed by the  European                 Commission.

Financial regulators in the UK and US have already levied  fines on financial institutions including UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  ICAP for attempts to manipulate key interest rates. Also, certain individuals are facing criminal charges.

Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of RBS, was cited as saying: “Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS.”

HD       Joaquín Almunia,  Vice President  Of The European Commission Responsible For Competition
Policy - Introductory Remarks On Cartels In The Financial  Sector

Today the Commission has taken decisions in two cartel cases in the financial sector.

We have reached settlements with 8 financial institutions which violated EU antitrust rules and we have sanctioned them for these infringements. The total  fines imposed today amount to 1.7 billion euros. This is the highest total amount ever imposed by the Commission for breaches of antitrust rules - even if
some entities under investigation have not participated in the settlement and our proceedings continue for them. The companies who concluded today's settlements are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, UBS, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin.

TD
Among these 8 companies, 4 participated in a cartel in the market for  interest rate derivatives denominated in euros (Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale). 6 participated in one or more bilateral cartels in the market for  interest rate derivatives denominated in yen (Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, RP Martin and UBS). Deutsche Bank and RBS participated in both infringements.

Interest rate derivatives, such as swaps, futures, options or forward rate agreements, are financial contracts which are used by banks or companies. These financial products play a very important role in the economy, since they work as a kind of insurance mechanism against the fluctuations of interest rates. They are meant to allow for an efficient management of the risk that such variations entail.

Thousands of European companies may use these products, for example if they have contracted a loan with a variable interest rate and want to hedge their risk. Those companies that are active internationally may also want to protect themselves against changes in interest rates in foreign currencies such as the Japanese  yen.

Investment banks compete with each other in the trading of these financial  derivatives. Indeed, for these markets to work properly and bring benefits to the real economy, transparency and healthy competition are crucial.

Obviously, the picture may look very different if  derivatives markets are rigged to benefit the private interests of a few, because financial institutions decide to collude instead of competing. The decisions taken today provide appalling examples of such misconduct.

Let me recall, before I get to the facts, that these financial instruments derive their value from the level of a benchmark interest  rate, such as LIBOR – which is used for various currencies including the
Japanese yen (JPY) – or EURIBOR, for the euro. These benchmarks are meant to reflect the cost of interbank lending in a given currency. They reflect an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of banks who are members of a panel.

In the cartel covering euro  derivatives, we found that the participating banks coordinated with each other to influence the EURIBOR benchmark. They also discussed confidential and commercially sensitive information that they are not allowed to share with other market players. They exchanged on their pricing and trading strategies and trading positions. As I said before, the banks included in our settlement here are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale.

We also found a series of bilateral infringements covering  yen derivatives. The settlement here covers five leading global banks – UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Citigroup – as well as one cash broker, RP Martin, who facilitated the collusion. There were discussions between the
Page 24 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
banks' traders about the upcoming submissions to the panels for the relevant benchmarks – i.e.  Yen LIBOR and, in one case, Euroyen TIBOR, which is an  interest rate benchmark set in Tokyo. The aim of these talks between traders was to increase their banks' profits and in turn their own bonuses. They also shared commercially sensitive information of the type that competitors normally keep secret.

I repeat that the two decisions taken today in the euro and the  yen cases are addressed to companies that agreed to settle with the Commission. These companies have decided to turn the page and acknowledge their wrongdoing under EU competition law. As a result, the investigation for them was shorter than it would otherwise have been – and I can add that these are two of the swiftest cartel settlements the Commission has concluded since the introduction of our settlement procedure in 2008.
In line with that procedure, all companies received a 10% reduction of their respective  fines for agreeing to settle.

Barclays (in the euro case) and UBS (in the  yen case) received full immunity from  fines because they were the first to reveal the existence of the infringement to the Commission. Similarly, Citigroup received immunity from  fines in relation to one of the infringements relating to  yen.

Immunity, as well as  fines reductions for other companies that cooperated with the investigation, was granted in the context of our leniency programme. Let me stress that this has proved to be an extremely effective tool in the fight against cartels. Because they are secret, cartels are very difficult to detect and prove. Providing such incentives to companies that choose to reveal the existence of a cartel to the Commission is simply indispensable for any public authority that is serious about detecting and sanctioning cartels.
Our investigations will now continue for a number of parties.
In the euro case, we have opened proceedings also against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan
Chase. In the  yen case, we have also opened proceedings against the cash broker  ICAP.

While we fully respect the presumption of innocence until the end of antitrust proceedings, the Commission is of course determined to pursue all those who may have been involved in a cartel. If their participation is established, we will launch the corresponding Statement of Objections against them, and if our concerns are confirmed, they will indeed receive the adequate sanction.

I am convinced that the rigorous enforcement of competition rules against financial institutions that infringe them – including the facilitators of such violations – is essential for restoring trust in financial markets and in benchmark rates. Of course other efforts are needed at the regulatory level. This is why the Commission has proposed legislation to improve the reliability of financial benchmarks in September. The objective of the draft regulation is to avoid conflicts of interest, make sure that benchmarks reflect
the economic reality they are intended to measure and that they are used appropriately.

But on top of this, we need to ensure that there is no collusion, just like in any other sector of the economy. Antitrust enforcement therefore comes in complement to the action of financial regulators and authorities worldwide, including those that have sanctioned market abuses. Indeed, what is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not just the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the setting up of genuine cartels between a number of financial players.

Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Enforcing competition rules can help ensure that financial markets truly work at the service of the real economy, not the interests of a few.

THE EUROPEAN Commission is set to impose heavy  fines on a number of global banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and RBS later this morning, over allegations that they rigged key  interest    rate benchmarks.

The fines could break European antitrust enforcement records and run to several hundred million euros each, based on the level of involvement in rate manipulation and each bank's cooperation with the EU investigation.

TD
Some banks have already admitted wrongdoing over claims that they fixed Euribor,  Yen Libor or both, and RBS has settled with UK and US authorities over its role in Libor rigging, paying out £390m in fines. Barclays and UBS have been granted immunity from  fines as they blew the whistle on the manipulation, according to the EU report.

The benchmarks the banks are accused of fixing are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets, from mortgages to  derivatives. Other banks involved include: JP Morgan, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole and HSBC.

So far RBS, Barclays, UBS, Rabobank and  Icap have been fined $3.7bn (£3.25bn) by authorities around the world for manipulating rates. Seven people face criminal charges.
Antoine Colombani, spokesman for competition policy, could not be reached for comment. Certified Distribution from 30/09/2013 till 06/11/2013 is 122,683

HD      EU fines banks record $2.3B over Libor

Updated at 7a E.T.; Adds details on cartels, size of  fines, EU still pursuing some banks, industry background.

LONDON (CNNMoney) -- The European Union has levied a record antitrust  fine of €1.71 billion ($2.3 billion) on six European and U.S. banks and brokers for rigging benchmark interest rates.

TD
Deutsche Bank was hit with the single biggest penalty of €725.4 million for participating in illegal cartels to manipulate the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and London interbank offered rate, or Libor.

"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said Joaquin Almunia, Europe's top antitrust official.

Other banks  fined Wednesday were Societe Generale (€446 million), Royal Bank of Scotland (€391 million), JP Morgan (€79.9 million) and Citigroup (€70 million). U.K.-based broker RP Martin was  fined
€247,000 for facilitating one infringement.

EU investigators said the Euribor cartel operated for nearly three years between 2005 and 2008, as traders discussed submissions used to calculate the benchmark rate, and compared trading and pricing strategies.
They also discovered illegal collusion in the setting of Libor in Japanese  yen between 2007 and 2010. UBS and Barclays, who have already been  fined by regulators in the U.K. and U.S. for Libor rigging,
were spared further punishment because they cooperated with the  European Commission investigation.
They dodged new  fines of €2.5 billion and €690 million respectively.

The scandal broke in the middle of 2012 when Barclays admitted trying to manipulate Libor, which together with related rates is used to price trillions of dollars of financial products around the world.

Before Wednesday's announcement, banks had already paid $3.6 billion in  fines and a handful of traders have been charged with criminal offenses.

The EU fine is the latest blow to an industry trying to rebuild its reputation and finances in the wake of a series of legal battles over foreclosure abuses, misleading clients over mortgages, payment protection insurance and other products.

Some of the biggest banks are also facing a global probe into allegations that they manipulated foreign exchange benchmarks to profit at the expense of clients.

And the Libor story is not over yet. The European Commission is still going after HSBC, Credit Agricole and JP Morgan on related charges, and broker ICAP, who opted out of the settlement on  yen Libor.
More legal action is likely to follow.

U.S. government-backed Fannie Mae filed a lawsuit in October against nine banks arguing it lost money on mortgages and interest rate swaps when Libor rates were set artificially low. U.S. law firms are also leading civil actions on behalf of investors who claim they lost out due to the market manipulation.

The previous record for a European antitrust  fine was 1.47 billion euros, imposed a year ago by the European Commission on six companies who fixed the markets for television and computer screen tubes for a decade.

HD      Banks fined £1.4bn over rate fixing

Eight banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank have agreed to pay a combined 1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) to the  European Commission to settle breaches in relation to Libor and Euribor.

TD
RBS has agreed to pay £324 million in relation to Libor and Euribor competition breaches.

RBS has agreed to pay 260 million (£215 million) in relation to Libor and 131 million (£108 million) in relation to Euribor.

According to the  European Commission, four of the banks participated in a 'cartel' relating to  interest    rate derivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to  interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese  yen.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Socit Gnral have agreed to settle in relation to their breaches over Euribor between 2005 and 2008. Barclays was not  fined as it benefited from immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to the commission.

RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JPMorgan and broker RP Martin settled over their  yen-denominated Libor breaches between 2007 and 2010. UBS benefited from full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to the commission and Citigroup received immunity over one infringement.

Joaqun Almunia,  European Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

'Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.'
Both RBS payments are covered by provisions already made by bank.

Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, said: 'We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees. Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS.'
The commission's investigation into Euribor breaches started with unannounced inspections in October
2011 and with proceedings opening in March 2013.
During this investigation the commission also issued proceedings against Crdit Agricole, HSBC and
JPMorgan. It said that these investigations are continuing.
The commission opened up its investigation  Yen interest rate derivative breaches in February 2013.

Broker ICAP is still being investigated by the commission.
The fines imposed by the European Commission are as follows:

Deutsche Bank: 259.4 million (£214.7 million) for two infringements in relation to Libor and 465.8 million (£385.6 million) for Euribor. Socit Gnrale: 445.8 million (£385.5 million) in relation to Euribor. RBS: 260 million (£215 million) for three infringements in relation Libor and 131 million (£108 million) for Euribor. JP Morgan: 79.9 million (£65.9 million) for one infringement in relation to Libor. Citigroup: 70 million (£57.9 million) for two infringements, one was fully discounted, in relation to Libor. RP Martin: 247,000
(£204,427) for one infringement in relation to Libor. UBS: avoided a 2.5 billion (£2 billion) fine for revealing the existence of the Libor cartels. Barclays: avoided a 690 million (£571 million) fine for revealing the existence of the Euribor cartel.

A group of leading European and American banks will be  fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4bn) by the European Commission for the rigging of  interest-rate benchmarks, a source close to the investigation revealed today.

The banks to be  fined are Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Barclays and Societe Generale.
'The total  fine is 1.7 billion euros,' a source told Reuters news agency.
If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest anti-trust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the

The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents.
They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives. JPMorgan and Barclays were in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank
offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 per cent reduction in  fines. UBS alerted the  European
Commission to the yen interest rate derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates.

French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.

It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its Euribor involvement on Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent Euribor  fines on Nov. 5.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker  ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds.

Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

The current record for an EU cartel  fine is 1.47 billion euros for a cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

The group has already been  fined £390million in the wake of the market manipulation scandal, where traders rigged the £180 trillion Libor rate.
It has also set aside £2.6billion to compensate millions who were mis-sold PPI insurance.

The bank has been forced to call in lawyers Clifford Chance after admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall.
The group was accused of putting companies into bankruptcy before buying up their property. RBS was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 for £45billion, and is still 82per cent owned by the
government.

French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged rigging of the rate known as Euribor.
HSBC and Credit Agricole are likely to be penalised next year after refusing to settle the case with the
Commission. Barclays blew the whistle on the group and will not be  fined.

It was not immediately clear if JPMorgan will be sanctioned for its Euribor involvement on Wednesday or next year. Reuters reported the imminent Euribor  fines on Nov. 5.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. HSBC and Credit Agricole were not immediately available to comment.

Commission spokesman for competition policy Antoine Colombani could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.

Authorities around the world have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker  ICAP $3.7 billion for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. For a factbox on the biggest  fines handed down to banks.

EU fines can reach up to 10 per cent of a company's global turnover. RBS had a turnover of 25 billion pounds last year, while Barclays was 29 billion pounds.

Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.

The current record for an EU cartel  fine is 1.47 billion euros for a cartel involved with cathode-ray tubes.

* Group of major U.S. and European banks sanctioned by  EU Commission
* Figure is the highest anti-trust penalty ever imposed by the EU body

* Involves London interbank offered rate, Tokyo and euro area equivalents
* Rates are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets

A group of leading European and American banks have been fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4bn) by the European Commission for forming illegal cartels to rig of interest-rate benchmarks.
The banks fined are Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Barclays and
Societe Generale.
'The total  fine is 1.7 billion euros,' a source told Reuters news agency.
If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest anti-trust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the
EU's competition regulator.

The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents.
They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives. JPMorgan and Barclays were in the group charged with manipulating Libor and the Tokyo interbank
offered rate Tibor, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks admitted liability in return for a 10 per cent reduction in  fines.

UBS alerted the  European Commission to the yen interest rate derivatives wrongdoing and will not be penalised.

Deutsche Bank and state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland will also be penalised for rigging benchmark euro zone interest rates.

The fine is the latest in a string of sanctions levied against RBS, which is set to reward its bankers with bonuses of £500million this year despite plunging losses at the taxpayer-backed lender.

Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are among a raft of global banking giants  fined a record €1.7 billion euro (£1.4 billion) for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.

Eight banks have agreed penalties with the  European Commission (EC) over allegations they formed cartels to fix two key rates used to set the price of trillions of dollars of financial products from mortgages to complex financial products.
RBS will pay €391 million (£325 million) for its role in the attempted rigging of the  Yen Libor and
Euribor - the Tokyo and euro area equivalents of the London interbank offered rate (Libor).

But Barclays is immune from a potential €690 million (£573 million) penalty after blowing the whistle on the Euribor cartel.

The sanctions - the first from the EC on rate manipulation - are the highest yet for European antitrust enforcement.
Barclays and state-backed RBS have already been  fined following an investigation into the rigging of
Libor, paying penalties of £290 million and £391 million respectively.

Other banks  fined by the EC in the Euribor case are German group Deutsche Bank and French player Societe Generale.
Those involved in the  Yen Libor case are RBS, Swiss group UBS, Deutsche Bank, US giants
JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup and UK-based wholesale broker RP Martin.
UBS avoided a hefty 2.5 billion euro (£2.1 billion)  fine after flagging up the  Yen Libor cartel with the
EC.

Fellow British bank HSBC is understood to have pulled out of the Euribor settlement talks, alongside US group JPMorgan Chase & Co and French group Credit Agricole, while broker  ICAP is said to have refused settlement in the  Yen Libor probe.
The EC said cartel investigations involving these firms will continue.
Joaquin Almunia, EC vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking about the
Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by

Page 41 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

'Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.'

The EC sanctions serve as the latest reminder of wrongdoing in the industry, which has been left reeling following a series of scandals in recent years.

Authorities worldwide have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS has paid the largest penalty yet in the clampdown,  fined 1.5 billion US dollars (£917 million) late last year.

But Barclays was the first to settle and suffered a major reputational blow, which claimed the scalp of former chief executive Bob Diamond and has led to a major overhaul of practices and culture in the bank.

Barclays said it 'voluntarily' reported the Euribor cartel to the EC and 'co-operated fully' with the investigation.

Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are among a raft of global banking giants  fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.

Eight banks have agreed penalties with the  European Commission (EC) over allegations they formed cartels to fix two key rates used to set the price of trillions of dollars of financial products from mortgages to complex financial products.
RBS will pay €391 million (£325 million) for its role in the attempted rigging of the  Yen Libor and
Euribor - the Tokyo and euro area equivalents of the London interbank offered rate (Libor).

But Barclays is immune from a potential €690 million (£573 million) penalty after blowing the whistle on the Euribor cartel.

The sanctions - the first from the EC on rate manipulation - are the highest yet for European antitrust enforcement.
Barclays and state-backed RBS have already been  fined following an investigation into the rigging of
Libor, paying penalties of £290 million and £391 million respectively.

Other banks  fined by the EC in the Euribor case are German group Deutsche Bank and French player Societe Generale.
Those involved in the  Yen Libor case are RBS, Swiss group UBS, Deutsche Bank, US giants
JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup and UK-based wholesale broker RP Martin.
UBS avoided a hefty 2.5 billion euro (£2.1 billion)  fine after flagging up the  Yen Libor cartel with the
EC.

Fellow British bank HSBC is understood to have pulled out of the Euribor settlement talks, alongside US group JPMorgan Chase & Co and French group Credit Agricole, while broker  ICAP is said to have refused settlement in the  Yen Libor probe.
The EC said cartel investigations involving these firms will continue.

Joaquin Almunia, EC vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

'Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.'

The EC sanctions serve as the latest reminder of wrongdoing in the industry, which has been left reeling following a series of scandals in recent years.

Authorities worldwide have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.

UBS has paid the largest penalty yet in the clampdown,  fined 1.5 billion US dollars (£917 million) late last year.

But Barclays was the first to settle and suffered a major reputational blow, which claimed the scalp of former chief executive Bob Diamond and has led to a major overhaul of practices and culture in the bank.

Barclays said it 'voluntarily' reported the Euribor cartel to the EC and 'co-operated fully' with the investigation.

HD          RBS among six global banking  giants hammered by Brussels with record £1.4bn fine over interest rate rigging

LP
Some of the world’s biggest banks have been  fined a record £1.4bilion by Brussels for operating an
‘illegal cartel’ to rig interest rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six hammered by the  European Commission on Wednesday, receiving a £325million penalty.

TD
German’s biggest lender Deutsche Bank, French giant Societe Generale and JPMorgan are among those accused of colluding to manipulate interest rates in order to rig their own trades.

Barclays was also involved in the conspiracy, but escaped a £390million penalty because it notified the European Commission about the cartel. Swiss giant UBS received immunity after blowing the whistle, avoiding a record £2.1billion  fine.

The combined fine marks the biggest ever imposed by the EC for breaching anti-trust rules, exceeding a £1.2billion fine levied last year on Royal Philips Electronics and nine others for a TV parts cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EC’s vice president in charge of competition policy, said: ‘What is shocking is about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.’
Global fines for rate rigging hit £5billion following the latest settlements which included a £390million
fine for Deutsche Bank and £370million for Societe Generale.
But the costs are expected to soar as banks face a raft of lawsuits and investigations.

A number, including Barclays and RBS, have already been  fined by US and UK regulators for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor. The latest  fines are the result of a separate probe by the  European Commission into Libor rates denominated in euros and the Japanese yen. These are called the Euro Interbank Offered Rate – or Euribor – and JPY Libor.

These rates are used to price complex financial instruments called  interest rate derivatives which are traded in huge volumes. By manipulating the interest rates, traders managed to rig bets on these derivatives in their favour.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS were involved in the euro cartel, which operated between 2005 and 2008. The  Yen cartel included UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup
and London-based broker RP Martin between 2007 and 2010.

On Wednesday the EC confirmed it is also investigating whether HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole were involved in the euro cartel.  ICAP, the broker founded by former Tory Party treasurer Michael Spencer, is also being investigated.

The EC is also probing whether the Swiss franc Libor rate was manipulated. At least 15 banks, including RBS and Barclays, are being investigated over allegations they rigged the £3trillion a day foreign currency market.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six global banking giants to accept  fines totalling €1.7billion (£1.4 billion) from the  European Commission today for their involvement in the latest  interest rate rigging scandal.

The fines have echoes of last year’s then record penalties handed out as part of the Libor scandal, which saw Barlcays and RBS  fined £290million and £390million respectively by US and UK regulators.

The scandal also saw the resignations of both Barclays’ chief executive Bod Diamond and the bank’s chairman Marcus Aigus.

Deutsche Bank, UBS, Societe Generale, RP Martin and JPMorgan are the other banks which have accepted fines.

The settlements follow allegations they formed cartels to fix two key interest rates used to set the price at which banks lend money to each other for trillions of dollars-worth of financial products, from mortgages to complex financial products.

RBS has agreed to pay €391million (£325 million) for its role in the attempted rigging of  Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London market  interest rate  - known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Remarkably the bank's shares were little changed following the announcement, up 0.36 per cent at 332.2p.

The sanctions are the first from the Commission on rate manipulation and the highest yet for European antitrust enforcement.
Barclays bank avoided a potential €690 million (£573 million) penalty for blowing the whistle on the
Euribor cartel. The bank's shares were 1.26 per cent lower at 262.85p at mid-day however.
Swiss bank UBS also avoided what would have been the largest financial penalty of €2.5billion
(£2billion) after it alerted regulators to rate rigging in the  Yen Libor market.

As a result Deutsche Bank received the largest  fine of €724million (£601million) after it admitted colluding to rig both the  yen Libor rate and the Euribor rate.

Page 49 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Citigroup received a discount of €55million (£45million) for cooperating over one of the cartels and so received a fine of €70million (£58million) rather than €120million (£100million).

But Credit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan have all refused to settle with the Commission over the investigation into Euribor rate-rigging, which means investigations will continue and could lead to much bigger fines being imposed on the banks.
City inter-broker  ICAP is also being prosecuted by the Commission for alleged  yen Libor rigging.

ICAP, founded by Michael Spencer was  fined $87million (£53million) by UK and US regulators the for manipulating Libor between 2006 and 2010.

EC antitrust commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: ‘What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

‘Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.’
He also told reporters that today's  fine were ‘not the end of the story’.

‘Even for the  yen case, we have investigations going on against those firms who have not wanted to settle, he said. ‘We have more work to do on the collusion around those two benchmarks, and beyond these benchmarks.’

Mr Almunia added the Commission was also investigating whether there had been manipulation in the foreign currency exchange market.

Authorities worldwide have so far  finedUBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS has paid the largest penalty yet in the clampdown,  fined $1.5 billion (£917 million) late last year. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bank's bosses ‘condemn the behaviour’ of those
involved in attempted rate rigging.

He said: ‘We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

‘Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue.’

A statement released by Barclays bank said: 'The  European Commission has today announced that it has reached a settlement with Barclays and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning Euribor. The settlement acknowledges that the banks’ conduct infringed EC competition law by attempting to distort the normal course of pricing components for  interest rate        derivatives referencing Euribor.

'As today’s announcement from the Commission confirms, Barclays voluntarily reported the Euribor conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied'

A group of six financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN), U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. (C) and broker RP Martin were also fined by the European Commission in the latest chapter of the rate-rigging scandal that has shaken the financial sector.

TD
The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the  yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as Euribor, and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the  yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the  yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their  fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the Euribor settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage.  ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

BRUSSELS--A group of six financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the  yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as Euribor, and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the  yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the  yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their  fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the Euribor settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage.  ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

HD         Rate-rigging row reignited: EU commissioner set to fine banks millions

LP
The interest rate-rigging scandal that has damaged the reputation of the banking sector looks likely to be reignited today as Brussels is expected to impose multimillion-pound  fines on several major firms for manipulating crucial benchmarks.

The action by Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, will pile further pressure on Royal Bank of Scotland, the bailed-out bank already dealing with the fallout from a major systems meltdown that left millions of customers without access to cash and allegations - which it denies - of mistreating its small business customers.

TD
The 81% taxpayer-owned bank is reported to be among at least six major players in the financial markets, including Deutsche Bank in Germany and Citigroup in the US, caught up in the cartel investigation. The EU is said to be ready to impose record-breaking  fines for alleged collusion for rigging key benchmark rates.

Brussels is thought to have focused on  yen Libor, based on Japanese interest rates and priced out of London; Euribor, the Brussels equivalent to Libor; and the Tokyo rate known as Tibor. Almunia has been in discussions with banks for weeks and the resulting penalty is expected to surpass the record euros 1.5bn (pounds 1.24bn) imposed on a cartel.

Each cartel could face combined  fines of as much as euros 800m, although it was unclear last night what the exact penalties would be and how the sums would be divided. Penalties for breaches of antitrust rules can theoretically be as much as 10% of turnover. The  fines are the latest to be levied on banks and financial firms for manipulating key benchmark rates. Five firms have already been  fined by market regulators on both sides of Atlantic in an ongoing investigation into the manipulation of the rates, used to set interest rates on loans granted around the world.

Barclays was fined pounds 290m in June 2012 in a move that led to the resignation of chairman Sir Marcus Agius and chief executive Bob Diamond. Other banks who have since been  fined by US or UK regulators are RBS, UBS of Switzerland and Rabobank of the Netherlands. The money broker  Icap has also been fined and the FCA's investigations are ongoing.

The Libor investigation has sparked interest in a number of other benchmarks used to price financial products, particularly the foreign exchange markets, which are now being investigated by a number of regulators around the world, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.

Reuters reported that UBS had alerted the  European commission to the yen interest rate manipulation and would not be penalised. The Financial Times said Barclays would avoid a  fine for Euribor rigging for similar reasons.
Between six and 10 banks are reported to be facing  fines, including Citigroup, which would be the first
US bank to become embroiled in such high-profile penalties for manipulation of key rates.

Deutsche Bank and RBS will be penalised for rigging the benchmark eurozone interest rates known as Euribor. French bank Societe Generale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged Euribor rigging, according to Reuters.
The news agency said HSBC and French bank Credit Agricole had not reached a settlement, while the
FT said the US bank JP Morgan had also failed to do. They may face  fines later.

Reuters said Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, RBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup declined to comment; HSBC and Credit Agricole were not available.

The European Commission has fined eight international banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, a record 1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) for rigging crucial  interest rate benchmarks

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of the benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between the banks which are supposed to be competing with each other."

TD
Almunia, pictured, added: “If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these cartel traders you will be appalled."

RBS, the taxpayer-controlled bank, has been  fined  391 million. That is on top of the £390 million it paid to UK and US regulators earlier this year.

Barclays, which was  fined £290 million last year and saw the resignations of its chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius over the Libor-rigging scandal, escaped a European  fine because, along with UBS, it acted as a whistleblower to the commission.

If it had not done so it would have been  fined  690 million and UBS 2.5 billion. The Swiss bank has already paid the equivalent of $1.5 billion (£915 million) in  fines of rate rigging.

Deutsche Bank landed the largest EC  fine of 725 million. France’s Société Générale was  fined  446 million. JPMorgan has to pay 80 million, Citigroup 70 million and London broker RP Martin 247,000. Today’s fines take the total imposed by UK, US and European regulators to $6 billion.

Almunia said: “Today’s decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a
few."

The benchmarks involved were the  Yen London interbank rate and Euribor. These rates are used to price assets running into hundreds of trillions of dollars ranging from  derivatives to mortgages.

Three banks — HSBC, Credit Agricole and JPMorgan — rejected the commission’s offer to settle early on the Euribor case and London broker  ICAP  on the Yen case. All face formal antitrust charges which could lead to larger  fines.

HD        UPDATE 3-EU Commission fines banks 1.7 bln euros for benchmark rigging

LP
BRUSSELS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators vowed to keep investigating rate- rigging on Wednesday as they slapped a record 1.7 billion euro ($2.3 billion) penalty on six financial institutions including Deutsche Bank, RBS and JPMorgan.

The fines by the Commission, which along with authorities around the globe has been examining the manipulation of London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro equivalent Euribor, takes the tally of penalties related to the scandal to almost $6 billion.

TD
Confirming what a source familiar with the matter had previously told Reuters, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he had been shocked at the scale of the scam and was sending a clear message that Brussels would fight and impose sanctions on cartels.

Deutsche Bank, which has yet to be  fined by U.S. and UK regulators as part of separate investigations into benchmark interest-rate fixing, received the highest  fine of 725.4 million euros.
Germany's largest lender and RBS were  fined for their involvement in both the Euribor and Libor cartels. Also fined were JPMorgan and Citigroup, France's Societe Generale and UK-based brokerage RP
Martin.

Swiss bank UBS and Britain's Barclays avoided  fines of 2.5 billion euros and 690 million respectively for revealing the existence of the cartel.

U.S. and French banks were penalised for the first time in a scandal in which traders fiddled rates used as a reference point to price around $400 trillion worth of products worldwide, from  derivatives to mortgages and student loans.

Some banks declined to settle with the EU. France's Credit Agricole and UK-based HSBC are disputing allegations, while the role played by UK-based brokerage  ICAP remains under investigation.
JPMorgan has only settled allegations relating to  yen-denominated Libor, not Euribor.

Almunia said the Commission would continue to investigate collusion allegations in other benchmarks, including the Swiss Franc currency and foreign exchange markets.

"This will not be the end of the story, neither for  interest rate derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks," Almunia told a Brussels news conference.

"And one of the areas where, as you know, we have received some elements of information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex, forex markets and the relations with forex benchmarks."
SOBERING REMINDER

RBS Chairman Philip Hampton said the bank's board and new management team condemned the behaviour of individuals involved in rate rigging.


Page 65 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue," Hampton said.

Deutsche Bank said it had already set aside enough money to cover the costs of the fine, while JPMorgan and HSBC vowed to vigorously defend themselves over Euribor allegations. ICAP, RP Martin and Societe Generale declined comment.
Banks that have settled the EU allegations qualified for a 10 percent reduction in their  fines. Authorities around the world have so far handed down a total of $3.7 billion in  fines to UBS, RBS,
Barclays, Rabobank and  ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.
UBS paid a record  fine of $1.5 billion late last year to U.S. and UK regulators for rate-rigging. EU fines in such instances can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover.

LONDON — Demonstrating a new resolve to punish bank misconduct, the  European Union  fined a group of global financial institutions a combined 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) on Wednesday to settle charges that they colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.

The settlement was the largest combined penalty ever levied by the European competition authorities and is the first time that American banks have been  fined in a set of  interest rate scandals that have also drawn scrutiny from regulators in Britain and United States. Those regulators still have their own investigations underway.

TD
“By European standards, it’s a large  fine,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “It signals that the time when only the U.S. can impose big  fines is probably over.”
Still, the action on Wednesday showed some of the limits to the European Union’s ability to ride herd
on financial institutions. The settlement was announced not by bank regulators but by antitrust officials,
highlighting Europe’s lack of a central financial markets enforcer with powers similar to the  Securities
and Exchange Commission or the Justice Department in the United States, or the Financial Conduct
Authority and the Serious Fraud Office in Britain. Nor are there any concrete plans to create such an
enforcer for the European Union.

At a news conference in Brussels, Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner responsible for competition policy, said an investigation had uncovered a collusive scheme by traders at some of the world’s largest banks.  Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Deutsche Bank , Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale were found to have improperly influenced the  London interbank offered rate , or Libor, as it relates to the Japanese  yen and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.

Those benchmark interest rates affect trillions of dollars of business and consumer loans and credit each year. Nearly 18 months ago, the British and American authorities handed down the first financial penalty related to Libor manipulation, against  Barclays of Britain.

Since then, five financial institutions, including  UBS , Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, have admitted wrongdoing and paid more than $3 billion in  fines to regulators worldwide. The European Union’s antitrust authorities were not part of those previous settlements.

“The commission is determined to fight these cartels in the financial sector,” Mr. Almunia said in announcing the settlement.

But there are limits to the ability and authority of Mr. Almunia’s office to police financial institutions. To reach the settlement, the European Union antitrust authorities had to build a case based on collusive conduct among a group of financial firms, rather than improper behavior by a single entity or group of traders at one bank.

The European Central Bank will take over supervision of banks in the euro zone next year as part of efforts to create a banking union. But even then, the E.C.B. will not have police powers or direct responsibility for financial markets.

“There is a big need for better supervision of financial markets in Europe,” said Falko Fecht, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. “We don’t have a single supervisor for financial markets. This is a flaw in the design of the banking union so far.”

To set the Libor and Euribor rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and varying maturities. Investigations in the past two years have found evidence that traders at the various banks benefited from falsely reported rates.

The announcement on Wednesday means that for the first time two American institutions, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, will pay penalties in the rate-fixing investigations. But they will pay only about
$200 million, combined — hardly a significant financial hit to banks with tens of billions of dollars in revenue a year.

And the activity under question by the European Union against the American banks only covered short time periods, the longest lasted about three months — not the sort of long-term manipulation that investigators could point to as evidence of an entrenched pattern of corruption. By way of comparison, some of the European banks were engaged in activity that went on for about three years.

“We are pleased to resolve this matter with the European Commission and to put this investigation behind us,” Citigroup said in a statement.

JPMorgan said that its part of the settlement, in which it agreed to pay $108 million, related to the conduct of two former traders during a one-month period in early 2007. The settlement did not find that JPMorgan management had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue or that their actions affected the firm’s Libor submissions, the bank said.

The largest penalty was against Deutsche Bank, which agreed to pay about $980 million. The German bank said on Wednesday that the size of the penalty reflected its status as one of the biggest players
in the market for derivative securities tied to interest rates, rather than any particularly egregious conduct by its employees.

Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the co-chief executives of Deutsche Bank, said in a statement: “The settlement relates to past practices of individuals which were in gross violation of Deutsche Bank’s values and beliefs.”

Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and other large American banks are among the financial institutions still under investigation by the authorities in the United States and Britain.

Additional penalties may be assessed in those investigations as early as next year. But it remains unclear if any American banks will ultimately face action in those cases, according to people briefed on the investigations.

For Deutsche Bank, the settlement was a milestone in its efforts to cope with numerous lawsuits and official inquiries related to its conduct in recent years. The settlement amount was within expectations, and the bank said it would be covered by the $6 billion already set aside for legal expenses.

Deutsche Bank shares fell less than 1 percent in Frankfurt and New York trading as investors took the settlement in stride. Shares of Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were also little changed in New York.
Royal Bank of Scotland said it had undertaken efforts to improve its systems and controls regarding
Libor and other benchmark rates since it first became aware in 2011 of the improper conduct.

“We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees,” said Philip Hampton, the R.B.S. chairman. “Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue,” he said.
Société Générale did not respond to requests for comment.

BRUSSELS--A group of eight financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Societe Generale SA (GLE.FR) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB), were  fined a record-breaking EUR1.71 billion ($2.32 billion) by European Union regulators Wednesday for collusion in fixing key benchmark rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN), U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. (C) and broker RP Martin were also fined by the European Commission in the latest chapter of the rate-rigging scandal that has shaken the financial sector.

TD
The EU's antitrust watchdog said the institutions were involved in illegal cartels either in the  yen Libor rate or its euro-area counterpart, known as Euribor, and some were involved in manipulating both benchmarks. The rates are used to price trillions of dollars in assets around the world from  derivatives to mortgages.

The highest  fine in the Euribor case was handed down to Deutsche Bank, at EUR466 million, while France's Societe Generale was  fined EUR446 million. In the  yen Libor probe, RBS was  fined EUR260 million, Deutsche Bank EUR259 million and JPMorgan EUR79.9 million.

The U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) avoided a  fine for Euribor manipulation while Swiss lender UBS AG (UBS) won't be penalized in the  yen Libor probe because they blew the whistle on the illegal practices and cooperated in the investigation, though both admit wrongdoing. Whistleblowers can win immunity in cartel cases or see their  fines reduced under EU rules designed to encourage corporate wrongdoers to self-report collusion.

JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) have been involved in the talks, but refused to settle the Euribor settlement and now face formal proceedings that could pave the way for large fines at a later stage.  ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), an interdealer broker, wasn't part of the joint settlement.

HD             RBS fined €391m for interest rate-rigging

Royal Bank of Scotland is among six global financial institutions  fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) by the European Commission for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.

Deutsche Bank was hit with the largest  fine of €725 million, while RBS will pay €391 million. The banks admitted participating in two cartels to rig the euro Libor rate - or Euribor - and  yen Libor.

TD
Other banks admitted taking part in a single cartel. Société Générale will pay €446 million for attempting to manipulate the Euribor benchmark. For  yen Libor, JP Morgan has been  fined €79.8 million and Citigroup €70 million. The London-based broker RP Martin will pay €247,000 for facilitating the  Yen cartel.
The Commission said it was still pursuing three banks in its Euribor case: HSBC, JP Morgan and
Credit Agricole.  Icap is being investigated in regard to  yen manipulation.

The five banks and a broker benefitted from a 10 per cent discount when their  fines were calculated because they co-operated. Banks that have held out against today’s settlement will have to pay the full amount if they are found guilty.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. However, the two banks accepted that they took part in the Euribor and  Yen Libor cartels respectively.

The fines are the result of a two-year investigation by the Commission into wrong-doing by banks over the benchmark rates, which underlie trillions of derivative trades daily, and come after UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  Icap have together already paid $3.7 billion (£2.3 billion) to US and UK regulators for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the cartels were “appalling examples of misconduct" over financial products which “thousands of European companies" rely to protect themselves against  interest rate rises.

In a warning to the financial institutions which have not settled, Mr Alumnia said they were aware of “what we know" from evidence handed over by the other banks, “but it is up to them to decide what to do". He added: “This is not the end of the story."

As well as pursuing the hold-out institutions, the Commission was looking “beyond the two benchmarks" at other possible areas of wrong doing, including over Swiss Francs.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said: “We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees. Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings."

A Barclays spokesman said the bank “voluntarily reported the Euribor conduct to the Commission
and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays
has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied."

Arlene McCarthy MEP, vice-chair of the economic and monetary affairs committee and draftswoman on EU Market Abuse rules, said the  fines plus “new EU rules on market abuse will ensure those intent on committing market abuse can be sent to jail and companies engaging in this manipulation will face high penalties".

Ms McCarthy added: “ The rules close a major loophole which has allowed benchmarks to be manipulated. The key question is how the banks will find a way to pay these  fines. Neither governments, taxpayers or consumers should foot the bill for this flagrant and scandalous abuse. These rules close the gap and send a clear signal that there is no soft option or safe haven for perpetrators of market abuse."
UBS has paid out the highest single amount over Libor, handing over $1.5 billion late last year to the
US Department of Justice and the UK’s Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging.
The record for an EU cartel  fine is €1.47 billion for one involved with television cathode-ray tubes.

LP
Royal Bank of Scotland is among six global financial institutions  fined a record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) by the European Commission for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.

Deutsche Bank was hit with the largest  fine of €725 million, while RBS will pay €391 million. The banks admitted participating in two cartels to rig the euro Libor rate - or Euribor - and  yen Libor.

TD
Other banks admitted taking part in a single cartel. Société Générale will pay €446 million for attempting to manipulate the Euribor benchmark. For  yen Libor, JP Morgan has been  fined €79.8 million and Citigroup €70 million. The London-based broker RP Martin will pay €247,000 for facilitating the  Yen cartel.
The Commission said it was still pursuing three banks in its Euribor case: HSBC, JP Morgan and
Credit Agricole.  Icap is being investigated in regard to  yen manipulation.

The five banks and a broker benefitted from a 10 per cent discount when their  fines were calculated because they co-operated. Banks that have held out against today’s settlement will have to pay the full amount if they are found guilty.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. However, the two banks accepted that they took part in the Euribor and  Yen Libor cartels respectively.

The fines are the result of a two-year investigation by the Commission into wrong-doing by banks over the benchmark rates, which underlie trillions of derivative trades daily, and come after UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  Icap have together already paid $3.7 billion (£2.3 billion) to US and UK regulators for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the cartels were “appalling examples of misconduct" over financial products which “thousands of European companies" rely to protect themselves against  interest rate rises.

In a warning to the financial institutions which have not settled, Mr Alumnia said they were aware of “what we know" from evidence handed over by the other banks, “but it is up to them to decide what to do". He added: “This is not the end of the story."

As well as pursuing the hold-out institutions, the Commission was looking “beyond the two benchmarks" at other possible areas of wrong doing, including over Swiss Francs.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said: “We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees. Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings."

A Barclays spokesman said the bank “voluntarily reported the Euribor conduct to the Commission
and cooperated fully with the Commission’s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays
has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied."

Arlene McCarthy MEP, vice-chair of the economic and monetary affairs committee and draftswoman on EU Market Abuse rules, said the  fines plus “new EU rules on market abuse will ensure those intent on committing market abuse can be sent to jail and companies engaging in this manipulation will face high penalties".

Ms McCarthy added: “The rules close a major loophole which has allowed benchmarks to be manipulated. The key question is how the banks will find a way to pay these  fines. Neither governments, taxpayers or consumers should foot the bill for this flagrant and scandalous abuse. These rules close the gap and send a clear signal that there is no soft option or safe haven for perpetrators of market abuse."

Simon Hunt, PwC financial services partner, said: “Banks have been undergoing significant remediation efforts to improve their systems and controls in this area with regulatory focus and challenge only increasing. This continues to highlight the need for strong governance and controls within the trading environment."
UBS has paid out the highest single amount over Libor, handing over $1.5 billion late last year to the
US Department of Justice and the UK’s Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging.

HD     EU fines banks over rate-rigging

The European Commission has fined eight banks – including RBS – a total of 1.7bn euros (£1.4bn) for forming illegal cartels to rig interest rates.
The cartels operated in markets for financial  derivatives, which are products used to manage the risk of
interest rate movements.

TD
Two of the eight, Barclays and UBS, were excused their financial penalties for revealing the cartels' existence.
The Commission said it was shocking that competing banks were in collusion.

UBS and Barclays stood to pay the largest  fines of 2.5bn euros and 690m euros, but avoided paying anything because they assisted the investigation.

A number of banks were engaged in the rigging of  interest rate products intended to reflect the cost of interbank lending in euros, while another group fixed prices for products based on the Japanese  yen.
The rates are used to set the price of trillions of dollars of products, including mortgages.
Some were involved in both markets and more than one cartel, including RBS, which was  fined a total of
391m euros (£325m).
‘Scandal'

Aside from RBS, Barclays and UBS, the other organisations involved were Deutsche Bank, which received the biggest  fine of 725.36m euros, Societe Generale, JP Morgan, Citibank and the brokers RP Martin.
Banks that have not yet settled fines but are being investigated are HSBC and Credit Agricole, as well as
JPMorgan, which accepted a fine for rigging in one market but not another.
The fine, the first for  interest-rate rigging from the EU, is also a record for its regulators.
Other global authorities have  fined financial institutions including UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and
ICAP for manipulating rates.
A handful of individuals are facing criminal charges. Previous fines
Barclays and RBS, which is 81% owned by the government, have already been  fined for rigging the price of interest rate products based on the London  interest rate market, Libor.
Barclays paid £290m and RBS £391m for their involvement.

Barclays was the first to be  fined for that, a move that put it ahead of the pack and drew to it both public and political attention.
That was followed by the departures of both its chief executive, Bob Diamond, and its chairman, Marcus
Agius.



Page 82 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Barclays said it “voluntarily" reported this latest wrongdoing to the Commission and “co-operated fully" with the investigation.

UBS has been given the heaviest  fine, of $1.5bn (£917m) – and was also in line for the largest in this investigation, but avoided it by co-operating.
‘Sobering'

Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: “What is shocking about the… scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.

“Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bank condemned the behaviour of those involved in attempted rate-rigging.

He said things had since changed at the 81% state-owned bank: “We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

“Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue."

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to  interest rate derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million.

"What is shocking about the [Libor] and [Euribor] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. "Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for
financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro  interest rate derivatives market, which covered Euribor and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005-May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of Euribor as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, which covered JPY Libor and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel discussed certain JPY Libor submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive
information relation to either trading positions or future JPY Libor submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY Libor submissions.

In relation to the euro  interest rate derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement cartel procedure. For the cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against  ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

HD        EU fines banks €1.7bn for fixing  global interest  rates

Six banks and one broker were hit with a record €1.7bn  fine from Europe's top competition enforcer on
Wednesday after admitting to participating in a cartel to rig two global  interest rate benchmarks.

The multi-party settlements unveiled by the  European Commission are the first results from a sweeping two-year probe into separate conspiracies to fix the Japan focused  Yen Libor and its European sister benchmark Euribor, which allegedly involves a total of up to 10 financial groups.

TD
Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland accepted taking part in both cartels and will pay  fines of
€725m and €391m respectively. Société Générale will pay €446m for attempting to rig the Euribor
benchmark and profit from related  derivatives. For Yen Libor related abuses JPMorgan accepted a  fine
of €79.8m and Citi €70m. The broker RP Martin will pay €247,000 for facilitating the cartel.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. But the banks accepted participating in the Euribor and  Yen Libor cartels respectively.

UBS's own fine would have totalled €2.5bn had it not won immunity for  Yen Libor, putting the already record total fines in the shade.

Barclays'  fine for euribor transgressions would have totalled €690m without immunity, the commission said. The bank said in a statement that it was not part of the commission's investigation into the manipulation of  Yen Libor.

Several banks and interdealer brokers - HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Crédit Agricole for Euribor and the broker ICAP for Yen Libor - rejected a settlement and are likely to face formal antitrust charges from Brussels, which will pave the way to a  fine at a later point.

JPMorgan said in a statement that its  Yen-Libor fine related to "two former traders during a one-month period in early 2007" and added that it would "defend itself fully" against the commission's allegations of Euribor-rigging.

Even with these holdouts, the EU penalty breaks antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. Additional  fines for other members of the cartel would be expected in a year or two.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commission, said the cartels were "appalling examples of the misconduct" in the financial sector.

"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."
The EU settlement  fines bring the financial sector's total penalty tally for benchmark manipulation to
$5.8bn, a sum that is expected to continue rising as regulators conclude probes and private lawsuits
stack up.


Page 88 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
More than a dozen banks and interdealer brokers were originally under the spotlight of the three separate EU probes, which cover  Yen Libor, Euribor and the less advanced Swiss Franc Libor case.

Before the EU decision, four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker  ICAP settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses. Most of the penalties related to manipulation or false reporting, until now RBS was the only institution that admitted violating antitrust rules in its settlement with the US Department of Justice.

While the full details of the settlement have yet to be published, the multi-bank EU cases provide a more rounded account of collusion across the sector, shedding light on the abuses within banks and the links between traders acting in concert to influence rate movements to their own advantage.

So-called hybrid cartel settlements are rare in the EU. Unlike the US authorities, the commission prefers to close cartel cases simultaneously with all groups involved rather than pursue one group at a time. The only other example of a hybrid settlement is an animal feed phosphate cartel late in 2010, where all but one company settled.

The main incentive to settle a cartel under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out can fight the charges in Commission organised hearings and eventually appeal against any decision in the courts.

The hybrid deal, however, reduces the advantages from settling early. Brussels must still devote resources to completing its investigation of the holdouts and defending any decision through the courts. This full decision will also include a fuller assessment of facts, providing extra ammunition for private lawsuits against groups that settled as well.

RBS chairman Philip Hampton said it was a sobering reminder of those past failings: "We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but
also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees.

Citigroup said it was "pleased" that the commission's investigation was over while Deutsche Bank said it had invested €1bn in improving its compliance and did not need to make extra provisions to cover the costs of today's  fines.

Six banks and a broker agreed to pay  fines for taking part in at least one cartel, two were spared  fines for having alerted authorities to the issue, and the rest have rejected settlements and are likely to face formal antitrust charges from Brussels.
The agreements mark the first time that Deutsche, SocGen, Citi and JPMorgan have agreed to pay
fines in connection with the wide-ranging global rate-rigging scandal.

Deutsche and Royal Bank of Scotland accepted taking part in both cartels and will pay  fines of €725m and €391m, respectively. SocGen will pay €466m for attempting to rig the Euribor benchmark and profit from related  derivatives. For Yen Libor-related abuses JPMorgan accepted a  fine of €79.8m and Citi,
€70m. The broker RP Martin will pay €247,000 for facilitating the cartel.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. But the banks accepted participating in the Euribor and  Yen Libor cartels, respectively.

UBS's own fine would have totalled €2.5bn had it not won immunity for  Yen Libor, putting the already record total fines in the shade.

Barclays'  fine for Euribor transgressions would have totalled €690m without immunity, the commission said. The bank said in a statement that it was not part of the commission's investigation into the manipulation of  Yen Libor.

Several banks and interdealer brokers - HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Crédit Agricole for Euribor and the broker ICAP for Yen Libor - rejected a settlement and could face charges and  fines at a later point.

JPMorgan said in a statement that its  Yen Libor fine related to "two former traders during a one-month period in early 2007" and added that it would "defend itself fully" against the commission's allegations of Euribor-rigging. HSBC also said it would defend itself "vigorously" against the allegations it colluded to fix interest rates.

However, even with these holdouts, the EU penalty breaks antitrust records in Europe; to date the highest combined EU  fine for a cartel is around €1.5bn. Additional  fines for other members of the cartel would be expected in a year or two.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said the cartels were "appalling examples of the misconduct" in the financial sector.

"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."
The EU settlement  fines bring the financial sector's total penalty tally for benchmark manipulation to
$5.8bn, a sum that is expected to continue rising as regulators conclude probes and private lawsuits
stack up.

More than a dozen banks and interdealer brokers were originally under the spotlight of the three separate EU probes, which cover  Yen Libor, Euribor and the less advanced Swiss Franc Libor case.

Before the EU decision, four banks - Barclays, RBS, UBS, Rabobank - and broker  ICAP settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses. Most of the penalties related to manipulation or false reporting - until now, RBS was the only institution to admit violating antitrust rules in its settlement with the US Department of Justice.

While the full details of the settlement have yet to be published, the multi-bank EU cases provide a more rounded account of collusion across the sector, shedding light on the abuses within banks and the links between traders acting in concert to influence rate movements to their own advantage.

<>So-called hybrid cartel settlements are rare in the EU. Unlike the US authorities, the commission prefers to close cartel cases simultaneously with all groups involved rather than pursue one group at a time. The only other example of a hybrid settlement is an animal feed phosphate cartel late in 2010, where all but one company settled.

The main incentive to settle a cartel under EU rules is the 10 per cent reduction in  fines and a shorter and less detailed charge sheet, which limits the potential for private damages claims. Those holding out can fight the charges in hearings organised by the commission and eventually appeal against any decision in the courts.

The hybrid deal, however, reduces the advantages from settling early. Brussels must still devote resources to completing its investigation of the holdouts and defending any decision in the courts. The full decision will also include a fuller assessment of facts, providing extra ammunition for private lawsuits against groups that settled as well.

Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, said the settlement was a sobering reminder of past failings: "We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees."

Citi said it was "pleased" that the commission's investigation was over while Deutsche Bank said it had invested €1bn in improving its compliance and did not need to make extra provisions.

HD       Euribor  fines reveal vital pieces to scandal's puzzle

The fines were big on number but short on detail.

The €1.7bn of  fines meted out by the  European Commission on Wednesday to six financial institutions, lacked the accompanying embarrassing chatroom conversations - where traders have agreed to alter a benchmark rate in exchange for a bottle of Bollinger, or even day-old sushi - that has become de rigueur in settlements arising from the sprawling Libor scandal.

TD
This is because Europe's top competition watchdog does not publish findings until the conclusion of all relevant investigations. With HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JPMorgan refusing to settle allegations that they attempted to rig Euribor, and with broker  ICAP's role still undetermined - plus a continuing parallel probe into the manipulation of Swiss franc denominated Libor - it could be at least two years before similarly incriminating messages are published.

But even without the tawdry details, the commission's settlement announcement still provided vital pieces in the fragmented jigsaw puzzle that the Libor scandal has become.

While as many as 20 financial institutions are being probed by at least 10 authorities around the world, only five companies before Wednesday had settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses - Barclays, UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland,  ICAP and Rabobank.

For Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, JPMorgan and Citigroup, the EU settlement constituted the first public admissions that they had been involved in benchmark-rate manipulation; and when institutions settle with the commission they must admit antitrust infringements.

These admissions mean the benchmark-manipulation scandal is pushed squarely into the eurozone and the US.

Deutsche and SocGen, the twin pillars of the eurozone's financial markets, landed the two largest individual fines, at €725m and €446m respectively.

While Deutsche's settlement with US, UK and German authorities has been pushed back until next year, its fine from the commission does not bode well for its overall exposure. The bank said it had
provisioned for its commission  fine.

The Financial Times first reported 18 months ago that Deutsche and SocGen were part of an alleged cartel being probed by authorities. Philippe Moryoussef, a francophone trader formerly at Barclays, allegedly communicated with traders at banks including Deutsche, SocGen, Crédit Agricole and HSBC, the FT reported at the time.
At the time French politicians portrayed Libor-manipulation as a London problem.

A lawyer for Mr Moryoussef, who is based in Singapore, did not respond on Wednesday to an email seeking comment.

One person familiar with the Euribor investigation said the bulk of email evidence parsed by the commission is written in French. Some of the anonymised and translated emails, seen by the FT, include one trader boasting about how many other traders at rival banks he was in contact with.

"Could you tell the guys in the treasury department to put a low 12-month fixing?" he writes to a trader at another bank.

"OK, done," comes the reply. The trader then writes: "Thanks! If you need high or low fixings, do not hesitate... I ask 4 or 5 banks in general."

The geographic politics of Libor have been highlighted by its global nature. While the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission was the first regulator to start probing rate-rigging back in 2008, it is yet to fine a US bank. This has led to some criticism - from the UK in particular, which has hitherto borne the brunt of the Libor settlements - that the investigation has become overly political.

Citi could hardly escape involvement - a  yen-derivatives trader who joined the bank from UBS now faces criminal charges in the US and the UK. He is yet to enter a plea to either set of charges.

On his UK indictment, the trader is alleged to have conspired with employees at all the institutions named in the Yen-Libor cartel by the commission on Wednesday - RBS, Deutsche, JPMorgan, Citi and RPMartin. In addition, however, he is accused on the UK indictment of conspiring with employees of HSBC, Tullett Prebon and Rabobank.

Despite Rabobank's $1bn  fine that it paid to US, UK and Dutch regulators in October - and the departure of its chief executive - the Dutch co-operative escaped even a mention by the commission on Wednesday, even though it responded to the commission's request for information more than a year
ago.
Both Rabobank and the commission declined to comment.

However legal experts expressed concern that the commission's investigation could have been curtailed for expediency's sake.

"It seems to me that the commission have likely compromised the scope of their investigation in the very obvious rush to be seen to deal with this quickly," said Lianne Craig, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld & Co, which is advising claimants in the US and UK with Libor-related damages claims. "It is also telling that the two currencies that have been omitted are sterling and US dollar - those relating to the jurisdictions where claimants are most likely to bring claims, and where claimant law firms are most active."

Moreover, the timeframe that the commission investigated could also limit banks' exposure to follow-on damages actions.

"Where people have lost out on Libor-manipulation, they have lost out due to systemic manipulation where banks were lowballing their rates during the credit crisis, as opposed to when traders were colluding to benefit their own trading books," said Stephen Critchley, a competition lawyer at Collyer Bristow.

Not only did lowballing tend to occur in sterling and dollar-denominated Libor but also it occurred as the worst financial crisis in a generation took hold in 2008 - the very end of the period of Euribor-rigging that the commission investigated.

European  Commission  Text: Seven 'Infringements' Found

BRUSSELS (MNI) - The following are excerpts from the announcement
Wednesday
by the European  Commission  of fines levied against several European and U.S. banks for collusion in the alleged manipulation of key international benchmarks:



Antitrust: Commission fines banks E1.71 billion for participating in cartels in the interest rate derivatives industry

The European  Commission  has fined eight international financial institutions a total of E1.712 billion for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). Four of these institutions participated in a cartel relating to interest              ratederivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or
more bilateral cartels relating to interest  rate  derivatives denominated in Japanese yen. Such collusion between competitors is prohibited by Article 101 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the
EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's cartel settlement procedure; the companies' fines were reduced by 10% for agreeing to settle.

Joaquin Almunia, Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy,
said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing
with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.
Healthy
competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly,
at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

Interest  rate  derivatives (e.g. forward rate agreements, swaps, futures, options) are financial products which are used by banks or companies for managing the risk of interest  rate fluctuations. These products are traded worldwide and play a key role in the global economy. They derive their value
Page 95 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
from the level of a benchmark interest  rate, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) - which is used for various currencies including the Japanese yen (JPY) - or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), for the euro.
These benchmarks reflect an average of the quotes submitted daily by a number of
banks who are members of a panel (panel banks). They are meant to reflect the cost of interbank lending in a given currency and serve as a basis for various financial derivatives. Investment banks compete with each other in the trading of these derivatives. The levels of these benchmark rates may affect either
the
cash flows that a bank receives from a counterparty, or the cash flow it needs to pay to the counterparty under interest  rate  derivatives contracts.

The cartel in Euro interest  rate  derivatives (EIRD) The EIRD cartel operated between September 2005 and May 2008. The settling parties are Barclays ,
Deutsche Bank , RBS and Societe Generale . The cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for these derivatives. Traders of different
banks discussed their bank's submissions for the calculation of the EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

The Commission's investigation started with unannounced inspections in October 2011. The Commission opened proceedings in March 2013. Barclays was not
fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency
Notice
for revealing the existence of the cartel to the Commission. Deutsche Bank , RBS
and Societe Generale  received a reduction of their fines for their cooperation
in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. These companies
received a further fine reduction of 10% for agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against
Credit Agricole , HSBC  and JPMorgan  and the investigation will continue under the
standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.


the
The cartels in Yen  interest  rate  derivatives (YIRD) In the YIRD sector,
Commission uncovered seven distinct bilateral infringements lasting between one
and 10 months in the period from 2007 to 2010. The collusion included discussions between traders of the participating banks on certain JPY LIBOR submissions. The traders involved also exchanged, on occasions, commercially sensitive information relating either to trading positions or to future JPY LIBOR submissions (and in one of the infringements relating to certain future submissions for the Euroyen TIBOR - Tokyo interbank offered rate). The banks involved in one or more of the infringements are UBS , RBS, Deutsche Bank , Citigroup and JPMorgan . The broker RP Martin facilitated one of the infringements by using its contacts with a number of JPY LIBOR panel banks that
did not participate in the infringement, with the aim of influencing their JPY LIBOR submissions.

The Commission opened proceedings in February 2013. UBS received full immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing to the Commission the existence of the infringements. Citigroup also benefited from full immunity for its participation in one bilateral infringement. For their cooperation with the investigation, the Commission granted fine reductions to Citigroup , Deutsche Bank , RBS and RP Martin, under the Commission's leniency programme. The companies have also been granted a fine reduction of 10% for

agreeing to settle the case with the Commission.

In the context of the same investigation, the Commission has also opened proceedings against the cash broker ICAP. This investigation continues under the
standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.

The fines The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006
Guidelines on fines.

In setting the level of fines, the Commission took into account the banks'
value of sales for the products concerned within the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringements, their geographic scope and respective durations.

--


and
UBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels
thereby avoided a fine of around E2.5 billion for its participation in five of the seven infringements. Citigroup  received full immunity for one of the infringements in which it participated, thereby avoiding a fine of around E55 million.

Background on the products concerned Derivatives are contracts traded on financial markets that are used to transfer risk. They serve as an insurance mechanism against price movements and reduce the volatility of companies' cash flows, which in turn results in more reliable forecasting, lower capital requirements, and higher capital productivity. In recent years derivatives
have
developed into a main pillar of the international financial system and are an indispensable tool for risk management and investment purposes.

The most common basic interest rate derivatives are: forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, interest rate options, and, interest  rate futures. Interest rate derivatives may be traded over the counter (OTC) or, in the case of interest rate futures, exchange traded. They derive their value from
a benchmark interest  rate.

The products concerned by the EIRD cartel are Euro interest                                 ratederivatives linked to the EURIBOR and/or the Euro Over-Night Index Average (EONIA). The products concerned by the cartels are the Japanese Yen  interest       rate  derivatives linked to the JPY LIBOR (and in the case of one infringement also Euroyen TIBOR).

The EURIBOR, JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR are benchmark interest rates intended to reflect the cost of interbank lending in Euros or Japanese Yen respectively. These benchmarks are widely used in the international money markets and they are based on the relevant panel banks' individual quotes submitted daily to the relevant calculation agent.


used
On 18 September 2013, the Commission proposed a Regulation on indices
as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts such as LIBOR
or
EURIBOR. See IP/13/841. The planned measures aim at helping restoring confidence
in the integrity of benchmarks following the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals.

Today's decisions are the eighth and ninth settlement decisions since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008. They are
one
of the swiftest cartel settlements decided by the Commission, showing the full

potential of the efficiencies offered by the settlement procedure. Under a cartel settlement, companies that have participated in a cartel acknowledge their participation in the infringement and their liability for it. The cartel settlement procedure is based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 and allows
the
Commission to apply a simplified procedure and thereby reduce the length of the
investigation. This is good for consumers and for taxpayers as it reduces costs;
good for antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cases; and good for the companies themselves that benefit from quicker
decisions and a 10% reduction in fines.

HD     CARTELS : LIBORGATE': COMMISSION SLAPS FINE OF 1.71 BN EURO ON BANKS WC     804 words

LP
The verdict is out. After a three-year investigation, the  European Commission announced, on 4
December, a first round of  fines of €1.71 billion for participation in cartels in markets for financial
derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). This record combined financial penalty for
cases concerning cartels or abuse of dominant position has been slapped on six banks and a broker that
cooperated with the EU executive. Other cases are pending.

TD
The institutions involved participated in regular, organised exchanges of their strategies and commercially sensitive information in breach of EU competition rules, practices that led to large-scale manipulation of benchmark interest rates to the advantage of banks, either to settle transactions to their advantage or to mask their financial situation. These rates are used as a reference for the pricing or remuneration of hundreds of thousands of billion euro in assets and financial products worldwide, including mortgages and derivatives. The case surfaced in 2012 and has already resulted in  fines of US$3.5 billion, imposed among others by the United States on four banks - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Union des Banques Suisses (UBS) and Rabobank - and on a British cash broker,  ICAP.

With this decision, the Commission "has two aims: to punish and to deter," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. It nevertheless took into account the cooperation of eight financial institutions that recognised their wrongs and reached a settlement with it. This resulted in either a reduction of their  fines or total immunity for revealing the fraud. The executive distinguished two types of infringement: one concerning euro  interest rate derivatives (Euribor), which involved four institutions, and the other consisting of one or more bilateral cartels concerning  yen (JPY) interest rate derivatives, involving six entities. Certain banks - RBS and Deutsche Bank - participated in both infringements. Deutsche Bank alone has been  fined €725 million (see table).

For the Euribor rate cartel, which lasted from September 2005 to May 2008, Deutsche Bank, RBS, Gale and Barclays settled with the EU executive. They benefited from immunity, thus dodging a  fine of €690 million.

For the JPY Libor and Tibor (Tokyo interbank offered rate) cartel, which ran from 2007 to 2010, the institutions concerned by the decision are RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan, as well as UBS, which received immunity for its cooperation in the investigation, thus avoiding a  fine of around €2.5 billion for its participation in five of the seven infringements. The British broker RP Martin was  fined
€247,000 for facilitating one of the infringements by using its contacts with a number of JPY Libor panel banks that did not participate in the infringement, with the aim of influencing their JPY Libor submissions.
OTHER CASES

"But this is not the end of the story," explained Almunia. In the Euribor investigation, a procedure has been initiated against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, he said. "If their participation is confirmed, the companies will be sent a statement of objections" in the context of a standard cartel procedure. Crédit agricole and HSBC chose to discontinue their negotiations with the Commission because they refused to assume the responsibilities entailed. Their case is expected to be settled by the next competition commissioner. "We intend to defend ourselves vigorously," said an HSBC spokesman. In the Libor and Tibor yen cartel, a procedure opened against the cash broker  ICAP is still under way.

Other investigations are also under way regarding possible cartels on benchmarks for the gas market
(see Europolitics 4528) and foreign exchange markets (4726).
DECLARATION SYSTEM AT ISSUE

What is questionable in the determination of Libor and Euribor rates, and to a lesser extent in the other cases under way, is the fact that they are based on declarations by the entities that use them. The Libor consists of the average rate that 16 leading banks in London declare that they would be willing to pay to borrow for different borrowing periods. On that basis, the British Banking Association (BBA) sets an average rate published daily. The Euribor is set by the European Banking Federation on a sample of 44 banks.

This type of declaration system is under fire from the EU in particular, which wishes to see an independent entity assume responsibility for setting benchmarks.

Brussels, 04/12/2013 (Agence Europe) - On 4 December, the European Commissionfined seven international banks (Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup) and one broker (RP Martin) a record €1.71 billion in total for membership of an illegal cartel on the interest  rate derivatives market and for manipulating inter-bank  interest rate benchmarks in euro (Euribor) and yen (Libor and Tibor). The companies colluded to set rates and exchanged sensitive information about trading practices.

Commissioner Almunia said that this was the highest total  fine ever levied by the Commission for breach of competition rules and reflects the serious nature of the crimes committed - fiddling interest rates used by banks around the world. He said the  fines were meant by the Commission as a punishment for the guilty and a disincentive to ensure similar cartels are not set up in the future. The Commission has reduced the fines by 10% for banks that accepted their guilt and reached an arrangement with the Commission.

For the Euribor benchmark, four banks - Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank - were involved. The first three were  fined €465.86 million, €445.88 million and €131 million, reduced by 30.5% and 50% because they collaborated in the investigation. Barclays'  fine of €690 million was cancelled entirely because it provided information to the Commission about the cartel. The investigation will now continue in the normal manner into Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, which refused to negotiate.

Five banks were involved in the Libor/Tibor cartel, namely UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Citigroup, along with RP Martin. They participated in one or more cartels, exchanging information about their negotiating positions and future bidding plans. UBS, which committed five breaches of the rules, was granted full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels to the Commission and therefore does not have to pay any of its €2.5 billion  fine. RBS (3 breaches), Deutsche Bank (2 breaches), JP Morgan (1 breach) and Citigroup (3 breaches) have been fined €260 million, €259.5 million €79 million and €70 million respectively, with various reductions in fines under the clemency procedure for collaborating in the investigation. RP Martin has been  fined €247,000 for facilitating the crimes and abusing its connections with a number of banks. The investigation will continue along the usual lines into currency broker  ICAP, which refused to negotiate. Commissioner Almunia says that Dutch bank Rabobank was not involved in this cartel, but may have been involved in other cartels being investigated by the Commission.

On the scale of the  fines, Commissioner Almunia commented: “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few”. The Commission set the  fines on the basis of the banks' derivatives sales in the European Economic Area, the serious nature and long duration of the abuse and their geographical scope.

HD          RATE RIGGING BANKS HIT BY £1.4BN RECORD FINE BY          BY JAMES SALMON

SOME of the world's biggest banks have been  fined a record £1.4bn by Brussels for operating an
'illegal cartel' to rig interest rates.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six hammered by the  European Commission yesterday, receiving a £325m penalty.

TD
German's biggest lender Deutsche Bank, French giant Societe Generale and JPMorgan are among those accused of colluding to manipulate interest rates in order to rig their own trades.

Barclays was also involved in the conspiracy, but escaped a £390m penalty because it notified the European Commission about the cartel. Swiss giant UBS received immunity after blowing the whistle, avoiding a record £2.1bn  fine.

The combined fine marks the biggest ever imposed by the EC for breaching anti-trust rules, exceeding a £1.2bn fine levied last year on Royal Philips Electronics and nine others for a TV parts cartel.

Joaquin Almunia, the EC's vice president in charge of competition policy, said: 'What is shocking is about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.'
Global fines for rate rigging hit £5bn following the latest settlements which included a £390m  fine for
Deutsche Bank and £370m for Societe Generale.
But the costs are expected to soar as banks face a raft of lawsuits and investigations.

A number, including Barclays and RBS, have already been  fined by US and UK regulators for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor. The latest  fines are the result of a separate probe by the  European Commission into Libor rates denominated in euros and the Japanese yen. These are called the Euro Interbank Offered Rate - or Euribor - and JPY Libor.

These rates are used to price complex financial instruments called  interest rate derivatives which are traded in huge volumes. By manipulating the interest rates, traders managed to rig bets on these derivatives in their favour.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and RBS were involved in the euro cartel, which operated between 2005 and 2008. The  Yen cartel included UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup
and London-based broker RP Martin between 2007 and 2010.

Yesterday the EC confirmed it is also investigating whether HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole were involved in the euro cartel.  ICAP, the broker founded by former Tory Party treasurer Michael Spencer,
is also being investigated.

The EC is also probing whether the Swiss franc Libor rate was manipulated. At least 15 banks, including RBS and Barclays, are being investigated over allegations they rigged the £3trillion a day foreign currency market.
***

÷ LAST night Labour said the news raised questions for the Economic Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid. Javid was a senior investment banker at Deutsche Bank while it was part of an  interest rate rigging cartel. He quit for a career in politics in 2009.

In a letter Labour's shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson asked whether he was aware of the wrong-doing and whether any of the traders involved worked for him.

The already battered reputation of banks took an expensive new hit yesterday when the  European       commission slapped a record euros 1.7bn (pounds 1.4bn) fine on six firms - including the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland - for colluding to fix key interest  rate benchmarks.

Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner, warned that further  fines were on the cards as three more banks, including HSBC, and one broker have refused to settle the long-running investigation by Brussels.

TD
He revealed the authorities were in the process of unmasking a fresh scandal in the currency markets that could further damage the industry and add to the vast sums banks have had to pay for their mistakes since the financial meltdown.

"This will not be the end of the story, neither for  interest-rate derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks," Almunia said. "One of the areas where we have received information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex [foreign exchange]."

The latest  fines - the first levied on a financial cartel by Europe since the banking crisis began - take the total penalties for rigging Libor and other key  interest-rate benchmarks to pounds 3.5bn.

Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) to be published next week will put a total of pounds 100bn on the costs of misconduct for 10 major banks, including RBS, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, in the five years to the end of 2012. That total has now risen by a further pounds 30bn, according to an analysis for the Guardian by MSCI ESG Research.

Roger McCormick, the LSE professor who led the research team, said: "To put that into context, the one year's budget of the 24 richest nations for international aid is pounds 80bn, and the national health service budget is pounds 100bn to pounds 110bn every year."

Yesterday's announcement saw two US banks, Citigroup and JP Morgan, receive their first  fines over the interest-rate rigging scandal, while the other banks received fresh penalties on top of those already imposed by regulators.

Barclays, the first bank penalised for rigging Libor when it was  fined pounds 290m in June last year, was also part of the Euribor cartel, the European equivalent of Libor.

However, this time the UK bank blew the whistle. In return for that help Barclays was let off another pounds 570m fine.


Page 105 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Similarly the Swiss bank UBS escaped a pounds 2.1bn  fine by telling regulators about the cartel that had been rigging yen Libor. It had already paid pounds 940m in  fines related to manipulating the London Libor rate.

Almunia said: "What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

The biggest  fine - pounds 600m - was on Deutsche Bank, putting pressure on the Treasury minister Sajid Javid, who was previously head of global credit trading for Asia and had seat on the board of Deutsche's international operations division until he left in 2009.

Javid said last night that while at the German bank he was not responsible for the departments hit by the fine and as a minister he had not held any talks with Brussels or any of the firms involved.

The commission also inflicted more pain on RBS, which has suspended four traders and will now pay another pounds 320m on top of pounds 390m already handed over to US and UK regulators. The new fine adds to its public image problems following a systems meltdown this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers.

Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said: "Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities."

The Euribor investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale. In  yen Libor the banks involved were UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin was also involved, and fined for using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor.

Other banks yet to agree fines for fixing Euribor rates - apart from HSBC - are Credit Agricole and JP Morgan. The money broker Icap, run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is still facing penalties for rigging yen Libor.

Almunia said: "Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector."

Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI ESG Research, questioned whether the penalties were as hefty as they first appeared. "If you look at RBS it is the equivalent to its revenues for five weeks. That's not much. If you think about the manipulation of a global  interest rate where several trillion dollars are priced to it you'd think they'd be more punitive."

RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan among banks  fined by European commission for colluding to fix  yen
Libor and Euribor rates

The interest rate-rigging scandal was reignited on Wednesday as the  European commission levied a record €1.7bn (£1.4bn)  fine on five major banks and a broking firm – including bailed out RBS – for colluding to fix crucial benchmark rates.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, European competition commissioner, warned that further  fines were on the cards as three banks and one broker had refused to settle on other claims being investigated by Brussels.

"This will not be the end of the story," said Almunia, who added that foreign exchange markets were also facing an investigation for potential manipulation.
The record-breaking fines – the first to be levied on a financial cartel – cover  yen Libor and Euribor, the
European equivalent of the rate set in London, and follow  fines by financial regulators in the UK and
US for attempts to manipulate the key interest rates.

"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other," said Almunia.

For the first time two US banks – Citigroup and JP Morgan – were named in the  interest rate scandal while other banks which had already been  fined received fresh penalties. Royal Bank of Scotland will pay another £300m on top of £390m already handed over to US and UK regulators, adding to its public relations difficulties following a systems meltdown earlier this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers.

Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of RBS, said: "Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS."

Barclays – the first bank to be  fined for Libor rigging in June 2012 when it paid £290m – avoided another £570m fine for blowing the whistle on a cartel in Euribor while Swiss bank UBS escaped a
£2bn fine for exposing the cartel in  yen Libor rigging. The Swiss bank has already been  fined £940m for offences related to the manipulation of the key benchmark rate.

The commission said the Euribor investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale. In  Yen Libor the banks involved in one or more of the infringements are UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin facilitated one of the infringements by using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor.

At a press conference to announce the  fines, Almunia said more penalties would follow as some of the firms it had been investigating had failed to settle. "We would have preferred all the parties would have

Page 110 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
been ready to settle – it is easier for them and for us. Three banks and one broker informed us they were not ready to settle," he said.

This appeared to be reference to Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan in relation to Euribor and the money broker Icap in relation to  yen Libor.

JP Morgan said it has reached a €79m settlement over  yen Libor but would defend itself against allegations of wrongdoing in relation to Euribor.

"Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector," Almunia said. "Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

The commission said these were the first two decisions concerning cartels in the financial sector since the start of the financial crisis in 2008.

YESTERDAY'S record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion)  fine imposed by the European Commission on five banks and one broker is a timely reminder that our lenders are far from out of the woods when it comes to fiscal punishment.

As competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, pictured, said: "If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these cartel traders, you will be appalled."

TD
Those conversations which have so far been released by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are truly shocking. Bankers, who could have been in no doubt that they were doing something illegal when they
got rate-setters at their own and other banks to fix Libor and other benchmarks to their benefit, simply joked about their crimes.

Almunia made it absolutely clear that the commission had found and would not tolerate a massive cartel across the European banking system.

It is prepared to go further in its pursuit of the miscreants. Three banks, HSBC, JPMorgan and Crédit Agricole and our very own broker, Icap, declined the commission's offer to settle early. In doing so, they lost a potential 10% discount on their fines and face the prospect of a full-blown anti-cartel investigation. The ensuing fines could be even greater than those handed down yesterday.

While the UK, US and now European regulators have  fined 10 banks or brokers, regulators in Japan have done little other than  fineRabobank and suspend a couple of other banks from trading for a couple of weeks. Given that much of the rigging, particularly in the  yen Libor market, emanated from Tokyo, there is almost certainly more to come.

Other regulators in the Far East, notably Singapore, are probing the scandal. Canadian watchdogs are looking at the behaviour of at least half a dozen banks in that country.

On top of the  fines banks still face the likelihood of having to pay out to investors and/or clients if they can prove they lost money.

A civil lawsuit in the US District Court in Manhattan is seeking damages from Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan, Lloyds, RBS, The Norinchukin Bank, UBS, WestLB, Rabobank Group, HBOS, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, RBC and Société Générale. The banks are defending this case.

That's just the rate-rigging scandal. We are now moving rapidly into its successor, the investigation into alleged forex market fixing. This could quite easily turn out to have been far bigger than the Libor affair.

Next comes the matter of mortgagebacked securities, where JPMorgan is thus far the only bank to have settled with regulators and investors for a hefty $18.6 billion (£11.4 billion).

Then there is the never-ending payment protection insurance misselling scandal, a uniquely British affair. The total the banks have set aside to handle complaints and pay compensation is now more than £17 billion. The rate of new claims may be slowing slightly but the load will stretch on for several more years.

Smaller but similar are the  interest rate hedge products sold to small and medium-sized businesses. This one is being played out in the courts as much as it has been overseen by the regulators.

THEN there are the one-offs like Barclays' alleged fixing of the Californian electricity market (which it denies), Standard Chartered's $327 million sanctionbusting  fine and HSBC's $1.9 billion
money-laundering payout. The point is these are not negligible numbers. As the Bank of England pointed out in its Financial Stability Report last week, UK banks forked out £3 billion in so-called "conduct costs"
in the first six months of this year. That takes the total since 2011 to £20 billion.

That is exactly the sum the taxpayer had to pump into Lloyds in 2009 to rescue it from the brink of collapse.

These fines and settlements do not simply knock banks' profits. They also damage their balance sheets at a time when every regulator in the world is demanding that they should hold more capital against their risk weighted assets.

It is absolutely right that banks and bankers should be punished for their heinous crimes. But the more prudent regulators will try to ensure that while the punishment fits the crime, it does not threaten the global and local economic recovery.

CORRECTION APPENDEDLONDON -- The European Union has  fined eight banks a combined 1.7 billion euros in a historic accord over alleged collusion to fix two benchmark interest rates.

The settlement, worth about $2.3 billion and announced by European Union antitrust officials on Wednesday, relates to alleged actions by traders at some of the world's largest banks, including Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank. The banks were accused of fixing rates for the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, as it relates to the Japanese  yen and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor.

TD
''The commission is determined to fight these cartels in the financial sector,'' said Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner, at a news conference in Brussels.

The penalties come after five financial institutions, including Barclays, R.B.S. and UBS, previously admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay more than $3 billion combined to regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland over collusion to fix the Libor rate.

European Union antitrust authorities were not part of those previous settlements and conducted their own investigation.

The agreement marks the first time that American banks Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase will pay penalties in the rate-fixing investigations.

Barclays and UBS, which alerted European Union officials to the improper practices, will avoid  fines as part of the settlement. Citigroup, which will pay a total of €70 million in  fines, also avoided a €55 million penalty by cooperating with investigators.

The banks that agreed to settle received a 10 percent reduction in the total amount of  fines they could have faced, European Union officials said.

The fine exceeds a €1.47 billion penalty levied last year against seven companies over collusion in the manufacturing of cathode-ray tubes for computer monitors and televisions.

The banks that reached settlements related to Euribor are: Barclays, Deutsche Bank, R.B.S. and Société Générale. The improper activity took place between September 2005 and May 2008, officials said.

Mr. Alumnia said that the antitrust regulators had opened Euribor investigations of HSBC, J.P. Morgan and Crédit Agricole related to Euribor.

The banks that reached settlements related to  yen Libor are: UBS, R.B.S., Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. The British broker R.P. Martin also agreed to a  fine over Yen Libor. The improper activity took place between 2007 and 2010, officials said.



Page 114 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Union has also opened an investigation regarding  yen Libor against the British financial firm  ICAP, which has already agreed to pay British and American authorities $87 million related to Libor.

To set the Libor and Euribor rates, banks submit the rates at which they could borrow money, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and varying maturities. Those rates are averaged, after the highest and lowest ones are eliminated, and that becomes that day's rate.

HD     Banks face prospect of more fines at time of rising  capital demands

So, just how is an investment banker supposed to earn a living? The news of a record €1.71 billion in fines slapped by the European Commission on eight financial institutions for rigging interest rates, with the prospect of more penalties on the way on both sides of the Atlantic, comes just as regulators keep turning the screw on capital requirements.

EC authorities have not even finished with their investigations into the cartels that manipulated euro and Japanese yen interest rates. Probes continue into HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Crédit Agricole Group as well as  ICAP Plc, a broker, which all rejected settlements.

TD
The €1.71 billion in fines announced Dec. 4, the highest European penalty ever against cartels, adds to
$3.7 billion in previous fines over LIBOR rigging in Europe and the U.S. And U.S. authorities have yet to
weigh in on the euro and yen rate cartels. Additionally, there are still whole new probes into the foreign
exchange market pending.
Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca wonders where it all might stop, although the analyst suspects that
European authorities at least might eventually cut the financial sector some slack.

He recounted a recent conversation with a senior investment banker who told him that officials on the old continent were beginning to worry that they might be at risk of pummeling their top institutions out of existence.

"His view is that Europe has suddenly woken up to the fact that if they're not careful, they will have no major investment banking entity able to be active in the capital markets, particularly the fixed-income markets," Wheeler told SNL Financial.

"Europe may start to take a small step back from this, say, 'Hang on a minute. We need national champions here, because the only ones that can compete are Barclays and Deutsche and we need them to survive. Otherwise, we're completely at the mercy of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citibank.' I don’t think that's attractive to them."

Evidence of this, according to Wheeler, came last week from the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which backed down on its original idea of forcing banks to cover so-called Pillar 2A exposure, which includes pension risks, with 100% core equity Tier 1 capital. Banks had complained loudly at this prospect, and the PRA eventually decided they only needed up to 56% of the more expensive CET1.
"I think that this was indicative," Wheeler said.

Deutsche Bank AG said most of its €725 million  fine, for participating in both the  yen and euro cartels, will be covered by its existing litigation reserves. Société Générale SA got slammed with €445.9 million over the euro cartel, and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc has a bill for €391.1 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and brokers RP Martin also received hefty penalties.

All of these  fines would have been dwarfed by the €2.5 billion  fine that the EC said it would have levied on UBS AG had the Swiss bank not turned informer and revealed the existence of the cartels. Barclays, which also informed, would have had to have paid €690 million in relation to the euro cartel and Citigroup an additional €55 million.

Page 118 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now U.S. authorities may turn their attentions to the euro and  yen cartels, according to Wheeler.

"We could have further  fines. Then there is the question of will this start the whole argument again about third-party litigation, whereby investors who have lost because they feel that the rate was manipulated sue the institution? It's very difficult to prove but it's a risk."

After that, he said, "everyone is going to start to wind forward and say, 'Just how bad is the foreign exchange rigging situation going to be?'"

UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Barclays, HSBC, RBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG have all launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators regarding possible attempts to manipulate foreign exchange markets, according to the Financial Times.

The probes come as investment banks record falls in their revenues from fixed income, currencies and commodities.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a 44% year-over-year drop in third quarter net revenues from FICC client execution, as investors worried about a possible tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. Other banks reported year-over-year drops in FICC that ranged from 8% to 26%, according to RBC analyst Fiona Swaffield in an Oct. 17 report.

Meanwhile, banks are facing having to meet new leverage ratio and Basel III capital adequacy requirements. Globally systemically important lenders will have to put up additional buffers.

No wonder then that eight of 10 European lenders expect to be making single-digit ROEs in 2015, according to a recent Roland Berger study.

The size of the  interest rate manipulation fines probably exceeds officials' estimates of how much profit the banks involved gained from participation in the cartels, according to Mario Mariniello, a research fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, who worked on competition policy at the EC.

"You should also take into account in your  fine the probability of detection of the cartel, so the  fine should not be just the profits that the banks have made. It should be a bit more than that," Mariniello told SNL.

However, as only one in six cartels is discovered, the  fine itself is unlikely to prove sufficient deterrent to alter banks' behavior, he said.

"You need much more structural changes in order to reduce the margin of maneuver of banks," according to Mariniello, pointing to efforts to reform the LIBOR benchmark. "You need to show that this type of agreement is not tolerable, because they can have a huge impact on the rest of the economy."

The European Commission on Dec. 4 imposed a collective penalty of €1.71 billion on eight international financial institutions for their involvement in two cartels that manipulated  interest rate derivatives.

Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for participating in a cartel that discussed EURIBOR submissions as well as trading and pricing strategies. Barclays Plc avoided a  fine of about €690 million for its participation as it received full immunity for revealing the cartel's existence, the EC said.

TD
The three banks  fined received discounts of 10% on their  fines for agreeing to settle, as well as reductions under the commission's leniency program for cooperating with the investigation. RBS'  fine was reduced by 50%, Deutsche Bank's by 30% and SocGen's by 5%.

In the context of the EURIBOR investigation, proceedings were opened against JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Crédit Agricole SA, and the probe will continue under the standard, nonsettlement cartel procedure.

For a second cartel that discussed submissions related to Japanese  yen LIBOR and the euroyen TIBOR, the EC fined RBS €260.1 million, Deutsche Bank €259.5 million, JPMorgan €79.9 million, Citigroup Inc.
€70.0 million and RP Martin €247,000.

UBS AG received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and avoided a  fine of about €2.5 billion, while Citigroup received immunity for one infringement related to the cartel and was exempted from a penalty of about €55 million.

A fine reduction of 10% was given for agreeing to settle, and RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and RP Martin received varying degrees of leniency reductions for cooperating with the probe. Proceedings were opened against ICAP Plc and the investigation continues under the standard nonsettlement cartel procedure.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks … but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

Banks' value of sales for the  derivatives products concerned within the European Economic Area, the "very serious nature" of the breaches, their geographic scope and respective durations were taken into account for determining the level of  fines, the EC said.

UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Barclays, HSBC, RBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG have all launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators regarding possible attempts to manipulate foreign exchange markets, according to the Financial Times.

The probes come as investment banks record falls in their revenues from fixed income, currencies and commodities.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a 44% year-over-year drop in third quarter net revenues from FICC client execution, as investors worried about a possible tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. Other banks reported year-over-year drops in FICC that ranged from 8% to 26%, according to RBC analyst Fiona Swaffield in an Oct. 17 report.

Meanwhile, banks are facing having to meet new leverage ratio and Basel III capital adequacy requirements. Globally systemically important lenders will have to put up additional buffers.

No wonder then that eight of 10 European lenders expect to be making single-digit ROEs in 2015, according to a recent Roland Berger study.

The size of the  interest rate manipulation fines probably exceeds officials' estimates of how much profit the banks involved gained from participation in the cartels, according to Mario Mariniello, a research fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, who worked on competition policy at the EC.

"You should also take into account in your  fine the probability of detection of the cartel, so the  fine should not be just the profits that the banks have made. It should be a bit more than that," Mariniello told SNL.

However, as only one in six cartels is discovered, the  fine itself is unlikely to prove sufficient deterrent to alter banks' behavior, he said.

"You need much more structural changes in order to reduce the margin of maneuver of banks," according to Mariniello, pointing to efforts to reform the LIBOR benchmark. "You need to show that this type of agreement is not tolerable, because they can have a huge impact on the rest of the economy."

The European Commission on Dec. 4 imposed a collective penalty of €1.71 billion on eight international financial institutions for their involvement in two cartels that manipulated  interest rate derivatives.

Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for participating in a cartel that discussed EURIBOR submissions as well as trading and pricing strategies. Barclays Plc avoided a  fine of about €690 million for its participation as it received full immunity for revealing the cartel's existence, the EC said.

TD
The three banks  fined received discounts of 10% on their  fines for agreeing to settle, as well as reductions under the commission's leniency program for cooperating with the investigation. RBS'  fine was reduced by 50%, Deutsche Bank's by 30% and SocGen's by 5%.

In the context of the EURIBOR investigation, proceedings were opened against JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Crédit Agricole SA, and the probe will continue under the standard, nonsettlement cartel procedure.

For a second cartel that discussed submissions related to Japanese  yen LIBOR and the euroyen TIBOR, the EC fined RBS €260.1 million, Deutsche Bank €259.5 million, JPMorgan €79.9 million, Citigroup Inc.
€70.0 million and RP Martin €247,000.

UBS AG received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and avoided a  fine of about €2.5 billion, while Citigroup received immunity for one infringement related to the cartel and was exempted from a penalty of about €55 million.

A fine reduction of 10% was given for agreeing to settle, and RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and RP Martin received varying degrees of leniency reductions for cooperating with the probe. Proceedings were opened against ICAP Plc and the investigation continues under the standard nonsettlement cartel procedure.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks … but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

Banks' value of sales for the  derivatives products concerned within the European Economic Area, the "very serious nature" of the breaches, their geographic scope and respective durations were taken into account for determining the level of  fines, the EC said.

HD       Exemplary  fines for banks' major crimes are good, but may rock the global recovery

LP
Yesterday’s record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion)  fine imposed by the European Commission on five banks and one broker is a timely reminder that our lenders are far from out of the woods when it comes to fiscal punishment.

As competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, pictured, said: “If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these cartel traders, you will be appalled."

TD
Those conversations which have so far been released by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are truly shocking. Bankers, who could have been in no doubt that they were doing something illegal when they
got rate-setters at their own and other banks to fix Libor and other benchmarks to their benefit, simply joked about their crimes.

Almunia made it absolutely clear that the commission had found and would not tolerate a massive cartel across the European banking system.

It is prepared to go further in its pursuit of the miscreants. Three banks, HSBC, JPMorgan and Crédit Agricole and our very own broker, Icap, declined the commission’s offer to settle early. In doing so, they lost a potential 10% discount on their fines and face the prospect of a full-blown anti-cartel investigation. The ensuing fines could be even greater than those handed down yesterday.

While the UK, US and now European regulators have  fined 10 banks or brokers, regulators in Japan have done little other than  fineRabobank and suspend a couple of other banks from trading for a couple of weeks. Given that much of the rigging, particularly in the  yen Libor market, emanated from Tokyo, there is almost certainly more to come.

Other regulators in the Far East, notably Singapore, are probing the scandal. Canadian watchdogs are looking at the behaviour of at least half a dozen banks in that country.

On top of the  fines banks still face the likelihood of having to pay out to investors and/or clients if they can prove they lost money.

A civil lawsuit in the US District Court in Manhattan is seeking damages from Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan, Lloyds, RBS, The Norinchukin Bank, UBS, WestLB, Rabobank Group, HBOS, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, RBC and Société Générale. The banks are defending this case.

That’s just the rate-rigging scandal. We are now moving rapidly into its successor, the investigation into alleged forex market fixing. This could quite easily turn out to have been far bigger than the Libor affair.

Next comes the matter of mortgage-backed securities, where JPMorgan is thus far the only bank to have settled with regulators and investors for a hefty $18.6 billion (£11.4 billion).

Then there is the never-ending payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, a uniquely British affair. The total the banks have set aside to handle complaints and pay compensation is now more than
£17 billion. The rate of new claims may be slowing slightly but the load will stretch on for several more years.
Page 126 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Smaller but similar are the  interest rate hedge products sold to small and medium-sized businesses. This one is being played out in the courts as much as it has been overseen by the regulators.

Then there are the one-offs like Barclays’ alleged fixing of the Californian electricity market (which it denies), Standard Chartered’s $327 million sanction-busting  fine and HSBC’s $1.9 billion
money-laundering payout. The point is these are not negligible numbers. As the Bank of England pointed out in its Financial Stability Report last week, UK banks forked out £3 billion in so-called “conduct costs"
in the first six months of this year. That takes the total since 2011 to £20 billion.

That is exactly the sum the taxpayer had to pump into Lloyds in 2009 to rescue it from the brink of collapse.

These fines and settlements do not simply knock banks’ profits. They also damage their balance sheets at a time when every regulator in the world is demanding that they should hold more capital against their risk weighted assets.

It is absolutely right that banks and bankers should be punished for their heinous crimes. But the more prudent regulators will try to ensure that while the punishment fits the crime, it does not threaten the global and local economic recovery.

HD       Five banks hit with €1.7bn fine by European Commission for roles in rate rigging

The European Commission today fined five international banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, and one London broker a record €1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) for their roles in rigging crucial  interest rate benchmarks.

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of the benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between the banks which are supposed to be competing with each other."

TD
Almunia, pictured, added: “If you take the opportunity to see the conversation between these cartel traders you will be appalled."

RBS, the taxpayer-controlled bank, has been  fined  €391 million. That is on top of the £390 million it paid to UK and US regulators earlier this year.
“If you see the conversation between these cartel traders you will be appalled"

Barclays, which was  fined £290 million last year and saw the resignations of its chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius over the Libor-rigging scandal, escaped a European  fine because, along with UBS, it acted as a whistleblower to the commission. If it had not done so it would have been fined  690 million and UBS 2.5 billion. The Swiss bank has already paid the equivalent of $1.5 billion (£915 million) in fines of rate rigging.

Deutsche Bank landed the largest EC  fine of 725 million. France’s Société Générale was  fined  446 million. JPMorgan has to pay 80 million, Citigroup 70 million and London broker RP Martin 247,000. Today’s fines take the total imposed by UK, US and European regulators to $6 billion.

Almunia said: “Today’s decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few."

The benchmarks involved were  the  Yen London interbank rate and Euribor. These rates are used to price assets running into hundreds of trillions of dollars ranging from  derivatives to mortgages.

Three banks — HSBC, Credit Agricole and JPMorgan — rejected the commission’s offer to settle early on the Euribor case and London broker  ICAP  on the Yen case. All face formal antitrust charges which could lead to larger  fines.

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six global financial institutions  fined €1.7 billion by the  European  Commission yesterday for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates. The lender will pay
€391 million (£324 million). Deutsche Bank was hit with the largest  fine of €725 million. Both admitted to participating in two cartels to rig the euro Libor rate — or Euribor — and  yen Libor.

Other banks admitted taking part in a single cartel. Société Générale will pay €446 million for trying to manipulate the Euribor benchmark. JP Morgan has been  fined €80 million and Citigroup €70 million for actions relating to  yen Libor. RP Martin, the Londonbased broker, will pay €247,000 for facilitating the yen cartel.

TD
The European Commission said that it was still pursuing HSBC, JP Morgan and Crédit Agricole in its
Euribor case. Icap is being investigated in regard to  yen manipulation.

The five banks and the broker involved in the settlement were given a 10 per cent discount when their fines were calculated because they co-operated with the commission. Banks that have held out against the settlement will have to pay the full amount if they are found guilty.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. However, the banks conceded that they took part in the Euribor and  yen Libor cartels, respectively.

Highlighting the extent of their involvement, UBS would have had to pay €2.5 billion while Barclays would have been on the hook for €690 million.

The fines are the result of a two-year investigation by the  European Commission into wrongdoing by banks over the benchmark rates, which form the basis for trillions of dollars' worth of derivative trades daily. UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  Icap have together already paid $3.7 billion (£2.3 billion) to American and British regulators for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

Joaquín Almunia, the European Competition Commissioner, said that the cartels were "appalling examples of misconduct" over financial products that "thousands of European companies" relied upon to protect themselves against  interest rate rises. In a warning to the banks that have not settled, Mr Almunia said that they were aware of "what we know" from evidence handed over by the other banks, "but it is up to them to decide what to do".

An HSBC spokesman said: "We intend to defend ourselves vigorously." The  European Commission was " looking "beyond the two benchmarks" at other possible areas of wrongdoing, including over Swiss francs, it said.
Deutsche's prominence in the settlement prompted questions about the role of Sajid Javid, the
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who held senior positions in its investment bank from 2000 to
2009, overlapping when the cartels were in place. The Treasury did not respond to questions from
Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, about whether Mr Javid had known of any
wrongdoing.

Justice and the Financial Services Authority.

Joaquín Almunia, the European Competition Commissioner, said that the cartels were "appalling examples of misconduct" over financial products that "thousands of European companies" relied upon to protect themselves against  interest rate rises. In a warning to the banks that have not settled, Mr Almunia said that they were aware of "what we know" from evidence handed over by the other banks, "but it is up to them to decide what to do".

An HSBC spokesman said: "We intend to defend ourselves vigorously." The  European Commission was " looking "beyond the two benchmarks" at other possible areas of wrongdoing, including over Swiss francs, it said.

Deutsche's prominence in the settlement prompted questions from Labour about the role of Sajid Javid, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who held senior positions in its investment bank from 2000 to
2009, overlapping when the cartels were in place. The Treasury said: "Mr Javid is not thought to have known about manipulation of any benchmark rates when he worked at the bank."

Royal Bank of Scotland was among six global financial institutions  fined €1.7 billion by the  European
Commission yesterday for forming illegal cartels to rig benchmark interest rates.
The British lender will pay €391 million (£324 million). Deutsche Bank was hit with the largest  fine of
€725 million. Both admitted to participating in two cartels to rig the euro Libor rate — or Euribor —
and yen Libor.

TD
Other banks admitted taking part in a single cartel. Société Générale will pay €446 million for attempting to manipulate the Euribor benchmark. JP Morgan has been  fined €80 million and Citigroup €70 million for actions relating to  yen Libor. RP Martin, the London-based broker, will pay
€247,000 for facilitating the  yen cartel.

The European Commission said that it was still pursuing HSBC, JP Morgan and Crédit Agricole in its Euribor case. Icap is being investigated in regard to  yen manipulation.
The five banks and the broker involved in the settlement were given a 10 per cent discount when
their fines were calculated because they co-operated with the commission. Banks that have held out
against the settlement will have to pay the full amount if they are found guilty.

Barclays and UBS were spared penalties after being the first to alert authorities to the violations. However, the banks conceded that they took part in the Euribor and  yen Libor cartels respectively. Highlighting the extent of their involvement, UBS would have had to pay €2.5 billion while Barclays would have been on the hook for €690 million.

The fines are the result of a two-year investigation by the  European Commission into wrongdoing by banks over the benchmark rates, which form the basis for trillions of dollars’ worth of derivative trades daily. UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and  Icap have together already paid $3.7 billion (£2.3 billion) to American and British regulators for manipulating rates. Seven individuals face criminal charges.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU Competition Commissioner, said that the cartels were “appalling examples of misconduct" over financial products that “thousands of European companies" relied upon to protect themselves against  interest rate rises.

In a warning to the financial institutions that have not settled, Mr Alumnia said that they were aware of “what we know" from evidence handed over by the other banks, “but it is up to them to decide what to do".“This is not the end of the story," he said. An HSBC spokesman said: “We intend to defend ourselves vigorously."

The European Commission was looking “beyond the two benchmarks" at other possible areas of wrong doing, including over Swiss francs, it said.

Deutsche’s prominence in the settlement prompted questions from Labour about the role of Sajid
Javid, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who held senior positions in its investment bank from

2000 to 2009, overlapping when the cartels were in place. The Treasury said:  “Mr Javid is not thought to have known about manipulation of any benchmark rates when he worked at the bank."

The settlement marks the first time that Deutsche, SocGen and JP Morgan have admitted wrongdoing in the global investigation into Libor and painted a wider picture of abuse of benchmark rates.
UBS has paid out the highest single amount over Libor, handing over $1.5 billion late last year to the
US Department of Justice and the British Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said that the  fine was “ a sobering reminder of past failings". A Barclays spokesman said that the bank “voluntarily reported the Euribor conduct to the commission".

HD     Banks face prospect of more fines at time of rising  capital demands

So, just how is an investment banker supposed to earn a living? The news of a record €1.71 billion in fines slapped by the European Commission on eight financial institutions for rigging interest rates, with the prospect of more penalties on the way on both sides of the Atlantic, comes just as regulators keep turning the screw on capital requirements.

EC authorities have not even finished with their investigations into the cartels that manipulated euro and Japanese yen interest rates. Probes continue into HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Crédit Agricole Group as well as  ICAP Plc, a broker, which all rejected settlements.

TD
The €1.71 billion in fines announced Dec. 4, the highest European penalty ever against cartels, adds to
$3.7 billion in previous fines over LIBOR rigging in Europe and the U.S. And U.S. authorities have yet to
weigh in on the euro and yen rate cartels. Additionally, there are still whole new probes into the foreign
exchange market pending.
Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca wonders where it all might stop, although the analyst suspects that
European authorities at least might eventually cut the financial sector some slack.

He recounted a recent conversation with a senior investment banker who told him that officials on the old continent were beginning to worry that they might be at risk of pummeling their top institutions out of existence.

"His view is that Europe has suddenly woken up to the fact that if they're not careful, they will have no major investment banking entity able to be active in the capital markets, particularly the fixed-income markets," Wheeler told SNL Financial.

"Europe may start to take a small step back from this, say, 'Hang on a minute. We need national champions here, because the only ones that can compete are Barclays and Deutsche and we need them to survive. Otherwise, we're completely at the mercy of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citibank.' I don’t think that's attractive to them."

Evidence of this, according to Wheeler, came last week from the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which backed down on its original idea of forcing banks to cover so-called Pillar 2A exposure, which includes pension risks, with 100% core equity Tier 1 capital. Banks had complained loudly at this prospect, and the PRA eventually decided they only needed up to 56% of the more expensive CET1.
"I think that this was indicative," Wheeler said.

Deutsche Bank AG said most of its €725 million  fine, for participating in both the  yen and euro cartels, will be covered by its existing litigation reserves. Société Générale SA got slammed with €445.9 million over the euro cartel, and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc has a bill for €391.1 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and brokers RP Martin also received hefty penalties.

All of these  fines would have been dwarfed by the €2.5 billion  fine that the EC said it would have levied on UBS AG had the Swiss bank not turned informer and revealed the existence of the cartels. Barclays,

Page 138 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
which also informed, would have had to have paid €690 million in relation to the euro cartel and Citigroup an additional €55 million.
Now U.S. authorities may turn their attentions to the euro and  yen cartels, according to Wheeler.

"We could have further  fines. Then there is the question of will this start the whole argument again about third-party litigation, whereby investors who have lost because they feel that the rate was manipulated sue the institution? It's very difficult to prove but it's a risk."

After that, he said, "everyone is going to start to wind forward and say, 'Just how bad is the foreign exchange rigging situation going to be?'"

UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Barclays, HSBC, RBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG have all launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators regarding possible attempts to manipulate foreign exchange markets, according to the Financial Times.

The probes come as investment banks record falls in their revenues from fixed income, currencies and commodities.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a 44% year-over-year drop in third quarter net revenues from FICC client execution, as investors worried about a possible tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. Other banks reported year-over-year drops in FICC that ranged from 8% to 26%, according to RBC analyst Fiona Swaffield in an Oct. 17 report.

Meanwhile, banks are facing having to meet new leverage ratio and Basel III capital adequacy requirements. Globally systemically important lenders will have to put up additional buffers.

No wonder then that eight of 10 European lenders expect to be making single-digit ROEs in 2015, according to a recent Roland Berger study.

The size of the  interest rate manipulation fines probably exceeds officials' estimates of how much profit the banks involved gained from participation in the cartels, according to Mario Mariniello, a research fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, who worked on competition policy at the EC.

"You should also take into account in your  fine the probability of detection of the cartel, so the  fine should not be just the profits that the banks have made. It should be a bit more than that," Mariniello told SNL.

However, as only one in six cartels is discovered, the  fine itself is unlikely to prove sufficient deterrent to alter banks' behavior, he said.

"You need much more structural changes in order to reduce the margin of maneuver of banks," according to Mariniello, pointing to efforts to reform the LIBOR benchmark. "You need to show that this type of agreement is not tolerable, because they can have a huge impact on the rest of the economy."

The European Commission on Dec. 4 imposed a collective penalty of €1.71 billion on eight international financial institutions for their involvement in two cartels that manipulated  interest rate derivatives.

Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for participating in a cartel that discussed EURIBOR submissions as well as trading and pricing strategies. Barclays Plc avoided a  fine of about €690 million for its participation as it received full immunity for revealing the cartel's existence, the EC said.

TD
The three banks  fined received discounts of 10% on their  fines for agreeing to settle, as well as reductions under the commission's leniency program for cooperating with the investigation. RBS'  fine was reduced by 50%, Deutsche Bank's by 30% and SocGen's by 5%.

In the context of the EURIBOR investigation, proceedings were opened against JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Crédit Agricole SA, and the probe will continue under the standard, nonsettlement cartel procedure.

For a second cartel that discussed submissions related to Japanese  yen LIBOR and the euroyen TIBOR, the EC fined RBS €260.1 million, Deutsche Bank €259.5 million, JPMorgan €79.9 million, Citigroup Inc.
€70.0 million and RP Martin €247,000.

UBS AG received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and avoided a  fine of about €2.5 billion, while Citigroup received immunity for one infringement related to the cartel and was exempted from a penalty of about €55 million.

A fine reduction of 10% was given for agreeing to settle, and RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and RP Martin received varying degrees of leniency reductions for cooperating with the probe. Proceedings were opened against ICAP Plc and the investigation continues under the standard nonsettlement cartel procedure.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks … but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."

Banks' value of sales for the  derivatives products concerned within the European Economic Area, the "very serious nature" of the breaches, their geographic scope and respective durations were taken into account for determining the level of  fines, the EC said.

The European Commission on Tuesday finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion ($2.34 billion) as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest  rate derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to  interest rate derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro  interest rate derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the
Commission, the cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro  interest rate derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement cartel procedure. For the cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against  ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

The European Commission on Tuesday finedDeutsche Bank, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin a combined total of EUR1.71 billion ($2.34 billion) as part of an investigation into manipulation of the interest  rate derivatives market. UBS avoided a  fine of EUR2.5 billion ($3.42 billion), while Barclays avoided a fine of EUR690 million ($942.38 million), as both received full immunity under the 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the so-called cartel to the Commission.

The Commission becomes the latest body to hand out  fines in relation to  interest rate derivatives manipulation, with UBS, Barclays, Rabobank and RBS among a number of firms that have already settled with local regulators globally. Among those  fined by the Commission, Deutsche Bank received the heaviest total  fine of EUR725.36 million ($990.67 million).

“What is shocking about the [LIBOR] and [EURIBOR] scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission v.p. of competition policy, in a statement. “Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few.”

For the investigation related to manipulation in the euro  interest rate derivatives market, which covered EURIBOR and EONIA for the period between Sept. 2005 and May 2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and SocGen all settled with the Commission. According to the Commission, the cartel aimed to distort pricing in euro interest rate derivatives, with traders of different banks discussing submissions for the calculation of EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.

For the investigation related to manipulation in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, which covered Japanese yen LIBOR and euro/yen TIBOR for the period between 2007-2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin all settled with the Commission. According to the
Commission, the cartel discussed certain JPY LIBOR submissions, and, on occasion, exchanged commercially sensitive information relation to either trading positions or future JPY LIBOR submissions. RP Martin was cited by the Commission as using its contacts with some JPY LIBOR panel banks that did not participate in the infringement in the  yen interest rate derivatives market, in an attempt to influence their JPY LIBOR submissions.

In relation to the euro  interest rate derivatives cartel, the Commission is set to continue proceedings against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan under the non-settlement cartel procedure. For the cartel in yen interest rate derivatives, the Commission is continuing proceedings against  ICAP, also under the non-settlement cartel procedure.

SE        EURIBOR SCANDAL
HD       Vital pieces in a fragmented jigsaw puzzle; News analysis

Settlement lacked details but a clearer picture is emerging, write Caroline Binham and Alex Barker
The fines were big on number but short on detail.

TD
The €1.7bn of  fines meted out by the  European Commission yesterday to six financial institutions, lacked the accompanying embarrassing chatroom conversations - where traders have agreed to alter a benchmark rate in exchange for a bottle of Bollinger , or even day-old sushi - that has become de rigueur in settlements arising from the sprawling Libor scandal .

This is because Europe's top competition watchdog does not publish findings until the conclusion of all relevant investigations. With HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JPMorgan refusing to settle allegations that they attempted to rig Euribor, and with broker  ICAP's role still undetermined - plus a continuing parallel probe into the manipulation of Swiss franc denominated Libor - it could be at least two years before similarly incriminating messages are published.

But even without the tawdry details, the commission's settlement announcement still provided vital pieces in the fragmented jigsaw puzzle that the Libor scandal has become.

While as many as 20 financial institutions are being probed by at least 10 authorities around the world, only five companies before yesterday had settled with regulators in the UK, US and other jurisdictions over core Libor abuses - Barclays, UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland,  ICAP and Rabobank.

For Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, JPMorgan and Citigroup, the EU settlement constituted the first public admissions that they had been involved in benchmark rate manipulation; and when institutions settle with the commission they must admit antitrust infringements. These admissions mean the benchmark manipulation scandal is pushed squarely into the eurozone and the US.

Deutsche and SocGen, the twin pillars of the eurozone's financial markets, landed the two largest individual fines, at €725m and €446m respectively.

While Deutsche's settlement with US, UK and German authorities has been pushed back until next year, its fine from the commission does not bode well for its overall exposure. The bank said in a statement that it had provisioned for its commission  fine.

The Financial Times first reported 18 months ago that both Deutsche and SocGen were part of an alleged cartel being probed by authorities. Philippe Moryoussef, a trader formerly at Barclays, allegedly communicated with traders at banks including Deutsche, SocGen, Crédit Agricole and HSBC, the FT reported at the time.
French politicians portrayed Libor manipulation as a London problem around this date.



Page 148 of 162 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A lawyer for Mr Moryoussef, who is based in Singapore, did not respond yesterday to an email seeking comment.

One person familiar with the Euribor investigation said the bulk of email evidence parsed by the commission is written in French. Some of the anonymised emails, seen by the FT, include one trader boasting about how many other traders at rival banks he was in contact with.

"Could you tell the guys in the treasury department to put a low 12-month fixing?" he writes to a trader at another bank. "OK, done," comes the reply.

The trader then writes: "Thanks! If you need high or low fixings, do not hesitate . . . I ask four or five banks in general."

The geographic politics of Libor have been highlighted by its global nature. While the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission was the first regulator to start probing rate-rigging in 2008, it is yet to  fine a US bank. This has led to criticism - from the UK in particular, which has hitherto borne the brunt of the Libor settlements - that the probe is overly political.

Citi could hardly escape involvement - a  yen-derivatives trader who joined the bank from UBS now faces criminal charges in both the US and the UK. He is yet to enter a plea to either set of charges.

On his UK indictment, the trader is alleged to have conspired with staff at all the institutions named in the Yen-Libor cartel by the commission yesterday - RBS, Deutsche, JPMorgan, Citi and RPMartin. In addition, however, he is accused on the UK indictment of conspiring with employees of HSBC, Tullett Prebon and Rabobank.
Despite Rabobank's $1bn  fine that it paid to US, UK and Dutch regulators in October the Dutch
co-operative escaped even a mention by the commission yesterday, even though it responded to the
commission's request for information more than a year ago.
Rabobank declined to comment, while the commission said: "We go where the evidence takes us." However, legal experts expressed concern that the commission's investigation could have been curtailed
for expediency's sake.

"It seems to me that the commission have likely compromised the scope of their investigation in the very obvious rush to be seen to deal with this quickly," said Lianne Craig, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld & Co, which is advising claimants in the US and UK with Libor-related damages claims.

Moreover, the timeframe that the commission investigated could also limit banks' exposure to follow-on damages actions.

"Where people have lost out on Libor manipulation, they have lost out due to systemic manipulation where banks were lowballing their rates during the credit crisis, as opposed to when traders were colluding to benefit their own trading books," said Stephen Critchley, a competition lawyer at Collyer Bristow.

Not only did lowballing tend to occur in sterling and dollar-denominated Libor, but it also occurred as the worst financial crisis in a generation took hold in 2008 - the very end of the period of Euribor rigging that the commission investigated.

HD      Commission fines banks for participating in cartels in interest rate derivatives industry

<p itemprop="description">The  European Commission has fined eight international financial institutions EUR 1.7bn for participating in illegal cartels in markets for financial  derivatives covering the European Economic Area (EEA). Four of these institutions participated in a cartel relating to  interest rate                derivatives denominated in the euro currency. Six of them participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to interest  rate derivatives denominated in Japanese  yen.

Such collusion between competitors is prohibited by Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Both decisions were adopted under the Commission's cartel settlement procedure; the companies'  fines were reduced by 10 per cent for agreeing to settle.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said: “What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined
to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a
few."

The EIRD cartel operated between September 2005 and May 2008. The settling parties are Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale. The cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for these  derivatives. Traders of different banks discussed their bank's submissions for the calculation of the EURIBOR as well as their trading and pricing strategies.
In the context of the same investigation, proceedings were opened against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
JPMorgan and the investigation will continue under the standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.

In the context of the same investigation, the Commission has also opened proceedings against the cash broker ICAP. This investigation continues under the standard (non-settlement) cartel procedure.

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the banks' value of sales for the products concerned within the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringements, their geographic scope and respective durations.
The fines imposed for the EIRD cartel are as follows (Participants:  Fine)
- Barclays: 0
- Deutsche Bank: EUR 465,861,000
- Société Générale: EUR 445,884,000
- RBS: EUR 131,004,000

Barclays received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel and thereby avoided a  fine of around EUR 690m for its participation in the infringement.

UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin were involved in one or several of the infringements of EU competition rules.

The fines imposed for the YIRD cartels are as follows (Participant:  Fine)
- UBS (5 infringements): 0
- RBS (3 infringements): EUR 260,056,000
- Deutsche Bank (2 infringements): EUR 259,499,000
- JPMorgan (1 infringement): EUR 79,897,000
- Citigroup (3 infringements): EUR 70,020,000
- RP Martin (1 infringement): EUR 247,000
UBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartels and thereby avoided a  fine of around
EUR 2.5bn for its participation in five of the seven infringements. Citigroup received full immunity for one
of the infringements in which it participated, thereby avoiding a  fine of around EUR 55m.

These decisions are the eighth and ninth settlement decisions since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008. They are one of the swiftest cartel settlements decided by the Commission, showing the full potential of the efficiencies offered by the settlement procedure.

The European Commission (EC) has fined eight banks a total of €1.71 billion for manipulating benchmarks affecting the interest  rate derivatives industry.

TD
The EC ruled that from 2005-2008, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale participated in a cartel manipulating the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), affecting  interest rate derivatives denominated in Euros. The EC also found that from 2007 to 2010, UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan participated in one or more bilateral cartels relating to  interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese  yen by manipulating the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

In doling out  fines, Barclays received immunity for revealing the existence of the Euro  interest rate          derivatives cartel, and by doing so, the bank avoided a  fine of approximately €690 million. Of that group, Deutsche Bank received the steepest  fine of nearly €466 million, followed by Société Générale at nearly
€446 million and RBS at €131 million.

For the yen interest rate derivatives cartel, the EC granted immunity to UBS for revealing its existence, and thus the bank avoided an approximate €2.5 billion  fine. RBS and Deutsche Bank received  fines for this case of around €260 million each, while J.P. Morgan was  fined nearly €80 million, and Citigroup was fined €70 million.
The EC also  fined broker RP Martin €247,000 for its role in the  yen cartel.
For Euro derivatives manipulation, the EC still has proceedings open against Crédit Agricole, HSBC and
J.P. Morgan. For the yen derivatives, the EC has a proceeding open against cash broker  ICAP.

HD     Banks pay price for benchmark rigging

As global regulators intensified their investigation into benchmark manipulation, a number of the world's largest banks agreed in 2012 and 2013 to pay hefty  fines to settle probes relating to their involvement in the misconduct.

On Dec. 4, the  European Commission announced a record combined penalty of approximately €1.71 billion on eight financial institutions for their participation in two cartels that rigged  interest rate                 derivatives.

TD
Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for taking part in one cartel that discussed EURIBOR submissions, as well as trading and pricing strategies.
The EU executive body also asked Deutsche Bank and RBS to pay additional  fines of €259.5 million and
€260.1 million, respectively, for participating in a second cartel that discussed submissions related to
Japanese yen LIBOR, with JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin  fined €79.9 million,
€70.0 million and €247,000, respectively.

Barclays Plc and UBS AG escaped  fines of roughly €690 million and €2.5 billion, respectively, attaining full immunity for informing the authorities about the cartels.

Before that, on Oct. 29, Rabobank Group said it settled investigations into its historical LIBOR and EURIBOR submission processes, agreeing to pay €70 million to the Dutch Public Prosecutor, £105 million to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, $475 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and $325 million to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The agreement, in the wake of which Rabobank CEO Piet Moerland resigned, came roughly a month after ICAP Plc unit  ICAP Europe Ltd. reached a £55 million deal with British and U.S. regulators over the involvement of certain brokers in the attempted manipulation of  yen LIBOR by bank traders.

Back on Feb. 27, The Wall Street Journal had reported that  ICAP, Rabobank Group and Lloyds Banking Group Plc could be next in line to settle with global authorities following RBS' Feb. 6 disclosure that it settled LIBOR-rigging charges with the U.K. FSA for £87.5 million and the U.S. CFTC and the U.S. DOJ for $325 million and $150 million, respectively. John Hourican, CEO of RBS' markets and international division, stepped down the same day.
In late 2012, on Dec. 17, UBS said its board approved LIBOR-related accords that saw the bank pay
fines of $1.2 billion to U.S. authorities; £160 million to the U.K. FSA; and CHF59 million to Swiss regulator
Finma. CEO Sergio Ermotti said unacceptable behavior was exhibited by certain UBS employees, but
added that their misconduct "does not reflect the values of UBS nor the high ethical standards to which we
hold every employee."
The first bank to settle benchmark manipulation charges was Barclays, which on June 27, 2012, struck a
£290 million deal with global authorities, after rumors of rate-rigging surfaced a few months earlier.
Barclays CEO Bob Diamond resigned shortly after the settlement.

More fines and settlements could come still, with regulators investigating whether or not gold and silver rates also were rigged.

As global regulators intensified their investigation into benchmark manipulation, a number of the world's largest banks agreed in 2012 and 2013 to pay hefty  fines to settle probes relating to their involvement in the misconduct.

On Dec. 4, the  European Commission announced a record combined penalty of approximately €1.71 billion on eight financial institutions for their participation in two cartels that rigged  interest rate                 derivatives.

TD
Deutsche Bank AG was  fined €465.9 million, Société Générale SA €445.9 million and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc €131.0 million for taking part in one cartel that discussed EURIBOR submissions, as well as trading and pricing strategies.
The EU executive body also asked Deutsche Bank and RBS to pay additional  fines of €259.5 million and
€260.1 million, respectively, for participating in a second cartel that discussed submissions related to
Japanese yen LIBOR, with JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and RP Martin  fined €79.9 million,
€70.0 million and €247,000, respectively.

Barclays Plc and UBS AG escaped  fines of roughly €690 million and €2.5 billion, respectively, attaining full immunity for informing the authorities about the cartels.
