BRUSSELS, Dec 16, Reuter - Belgian shares closed 0.47 pct up in moderate trade on the last day of the two-week trading account, but trade was marked by steep losses of steel maker Cockerill Sambre and shipping group CMB.

The Bel-20 index of leading shares closed 5.22 points up at 1,106.35. Some 910 million francs worth of Belgian shares were traded.  CMB fell 7.0 pct to 1,470 and Cockerill Sambre dived 6.6 pct to 85. Both fell to new year lows.

TD
Oil major Petrofina, which fell 6.8 pct Tuesday on dividend cut news, ended 0.4 pct down at 7,440 in a late burst of selling after having been slightly higher most of the day.

One dealer said CMB fell on French newspaper reports that the company could face a European Commission fine of 100 million French francs on charges that it had abused a dominant position in transport between Europe and Africa.

Another dealer said he thought  CMB was still too expensive at current levels. "They are still coping with a big debt burden and tramp shipping business remains difficult," he said.

He said he did not believe today's sellers were foreign. "There's not that much  CMB stock in foreign hands," he said.

But other dealers said a foreign investor apparently wanted to shed its  CMB portfolio before the end of the trading account.

A dealer said Cockerill's fall -- on a volume of 205,000 shares -- was triggered by a sell recommendation by Belgian investment newsletter. He said Cockerill could still go lower.

Other dealers said Cockerill was also hurt by media reports that a Dutch environmental group had started a court action against Cockerill, and by general weakness of the steel sector.
"On the one hand there's the court case and then there's the difficult situation of steel," said Frank
Dumont at Busschaert & Co.
A Cockerill spokeswoman said the company had not received notification of the reported court action. One dealer said he believed Cockerill's woes would make it decide to drop its preferred dividend for
1992. Cockerill fell more than 50 pct since it touched its year-high of 176 in June.

Business in Petrofina -- 19,840 shares -- was mainly fuelled by professional trade. "It's just spielerei", one dealer said. "There's no fundamental selling or buying."

She said she was puzzled by Tuesday's 6.8 pct fall. "I thought a dividend cut had already been partly incorporated in the share price," she said.

She said it was hard to predict whether Petrofina would move further towards 7,000, or towards 8,000 francs.
One dealer also noted short-covering in the share and covering of Petrofina options contracts.

Leading insurance companies Royale Belge and AG were the day's main gainers. Both jumped 1.8 pct, Royale Belge to 4,265 francs and AG to 2,035.

One dealer said AG profited from a buy recommendation in an investment letter and that Royale Belge followed in the slipstream.

Leading banks Generale Bank -- which also won a buy recommendation in the letter -- Kredietbank and BBL all ended higher amid continuing hopes of lower rates.

Dumont said he expected selling pressure to continue for the remainder of the year with market players squaring books.
"The market can still go a bit lower," he said.

Other dealers, in a reference to  CMB and Cockerill, said price movements on the Belgian market were somewhat exaggerated because of the low volumes.
"We see the fluctuations on the back of thin volumes," one said. -- Bert Lauwers 02/287-6815 (c) Reuters Limited

The report said  CMB would be charged for the abuse of a dominant position in maritime traffic between Europe and Africa.

EC sources have said some major decisions on competition cases are due to be issued by the
Commission next week. At  CMB, no one was immediately available to comment.

CMB closed down 110 francs, or seven pct, at its year-low of 1,470. A high 18,600 shares changed hands.

BRUSSELS, Dec 17, Reuter - Belgian shares closed fractionally lower on the first day of the new forward market account, failing to benefit from a technical recovery in oil major Petrofina and a surge in steel maker Cockerill Sambre.
The Bel-20 index of leading shares closed 0.36 points lower at 1,105.99, with total trading volume in
Belgian shares amounting to some 850 million francs.

TD
Cockerill surged more than 17 pct in early afternoon trading after the company stated it would stick to its plans to pay an unchanged 1992 net preferred dividend of nine francs. There was speculation recently that the company would omit its dividend.

In September, Cockerill's president Jean Gandois said the company would pay its 1992 dividend, but the steel sector's bad shape had worried some market participants about the feasibility of the dividend pay-out.

"I'm not quite sure if this is a wise decision," one trader said, "but it definitely made the price move." Another one said he remained sceptical. "The 1992 dividend may be the last one."
Cockerill, which had fallen to a new year-low of 79 francs in early trading, finally closed 10 francs, or
11.8 pct, higher at 95. Trading was temporarily stopped when the stock touched a day-high of 100
francs.
Oil major Petrofina, hard-hit in recent days after announcing a severe cut in its 1992 dividend, closed up
100 francs, or 1.3 pct, at 7,540. The share was 50 francs above Tuesday's close when it dived almost
seven pct.

"There's been some technical buying on the first day of the trading account, but I doubt this is the start of a buying wave because volume was too low," one trader said.

Retailer Delhaize, today's most traded stock, closed at a new year-low of 1,334, down 24 francs, or 1.8 pct, from Wednesday. "The stock apparently has lost investors' confidence," one trader said.
Delhaize's major Belgian competitor GIB, which had been actively traded at the start, fell 12 francs to
1,256.
Fellow retailer Colruyt bucked the trend with a rise 60 franc rise to 5,010.

Shipping company CMB, Wednesday's biggest loser when it ended seven pct lower after a newspaper reported it might be fined over 100 million French francs by the European  Commission on abusing its dominant position on maritime transport between Europe and Africa, recovered 20 francs to 1,490.
Traders said the stock had clearly been supported around 1,500 francs. -- Rudi Van Tricht 02/287 6817 (c) Reuters Limited

HD        CMB and Nedlloyd  face EC penalties.
BY       By Sean Moloney, Shipping Correspondent
WC      365 words
PD       17 December 1992
SN       Lloyd's List International
SC       LL
LA        English
CY       (c) 1992 of Lloyd's of London Press Limited

LP
The European Competition Directorate (DGIV) has recommended imposing punitive charges against CMB Transport and Nedlloyd Lines over alleged competition infringements on the Europe to Central Africa trades.

Shares in CMB NV plunged 7% on the Brussels market yesterday following reports that  CMB Transport might be fined more than FFr100m ($18.6m) by the EC  Commission. Shares in the Belgian maritime group closed down FFr110 to a year-low of FFr1,470. A total of 18,600 shares changed hands.

TD
The DGIV recommendation has been put before the main  Commission body and will be on the agenda of the final meeting of the current  Commission on December 23.
Both CMB Transport and Nedlloyd have not ruled out taking the  Commission to the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg if they are found guilty.

The lines are part of the Associated Central West Africa Lines (Cewal) Conference. Experience shows that the level of punitive charge is often determined by the extent of a line's involvement in the trade. This could suggest that Nedlloyd faces a relatively small fine. However, the Dutch line is opposed to the principle of the action and will wait until the Commission's verdict before deciding on what future action
to take.

A CMB Transport spokesman told Lloyd's List: "A complaint was lodged in 1988 and the case has been heard and external submissions given. We are aware that DGIV has given a recommendation but are not aware of the content. We await the decision of the  Commission on December 23," he said.

The spokesman said the company believed it had a strong case and said that if any  fines were to be levied, "we hope they will be levied on the conference and membership as a whole".
DGIV officials refused to comment on the disclosure of its recommendations.

This latest move follows on the heels of a  Commission decision in April of this year to impose a FFr105m fine against France's Scac-Delmas-Vieljeux (SDV) for alleged past abuse of its dominant position in the Europe to West Africa trade.

BRUSSELS, Dec 18, Reuter - Cie Maritime Belge SA, threatened with a large European  Commission anti-trust  fine, is being charged by  Commission anti-trust officials on three counts of abusing EC competition rules concerning its business with Zaire,  commission sources said.

The probe covers an alleged share-out with other shippers of traffic between northern Europe and Zaire, unfairly low prices and the use of a fidelity clause between CMB, other shippers and clients in Zaire, the sources said. The sources said the full 17-member Commission would decide on the  fine to be proposed by EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan next Wednesday.

TD
One source said CMB was expected to be  fined up to 29 million Ecus. But other sources said some commissioners were challenging two of the three charges on which the  fine proposed by Brittan is based. CMB officials were not available to comment.
The commission sources said there was a row about the case in a meeting today of top  Commission
officials preparing for next week's decision.

CMB's shares fell this week in Brussels on reports of the  fine. The share closed down 2.0 pct at 1,460 francs today.

BRUSSELS, Dec 18, Reuter - Belgian shares closed almost one pct higher, boosted by a rise on Wall
Street, a stronger dollar and strength on other European share markets.

But dealers doubted the rally would last. Banque Bruxelles Lambert analysts said earlier the bourse should brace itself for more gloomy company news in early 1993. They forecast Belgian companies
1992 dividends falling an average of six pct.

TD
The Bel-20 index of leading shares closed up 10.92 points, or 0.99 pct, to 1116.91, just off its day's high of 1116.99. A total 1.10 billion francs worth of Belgian shares changed hands.
Delhaize made a late spurt as Wall Street opened higher.

The dollar-sensitive retailer closed up 2.8 pct to 1,372 francs, with a high 108,800 shares traded. However, the rise was partly a recovery from Thursday's new year low of 1,334 francs.

Market bellwether stock, oil major Petrofina, rose 2.1 pct to 7,700 francs in a recovery from a plunge earlier in the week, triggered by a plan to halve the 1992 dividend. But the share was 310 francs lower than a close of 8,010 francs a week ago.
Pharmaceutical and chemical stock UCB, benefitting from recent buy recommendations, rose 1.6 pct to
22,475 francs with a higher than usual 3,440 shares traded. Brokerage Corluy earlier said in a study on
UCB the share price was 20 pct too low.

Utility and industrial holding company Tractebel was unusually active, closing up 0.8 pct to 7,900 francs with a high 22,075 shares traded. Earlier in December, a consortium led by Tractebel was awarded a
90 pct stake in a natural gas distribution unit in an Argentine privatisation tender.
Dealers could not explain Tractebel's activity Friday.

Shipping group  CMB closed lower, hit by reports that the European  Commission was set to fine the shipping company up to 29 million Ecus next week for a serious violation of EC anti-trust rules. CMB closed down 2.0 pct to 1,460 francs, but off its low of 1,430 francs. -- Jane Morrison 02 287 6816

BRUSSELS, Dec 18, Reuter - The European  Commission is set to fine Belgian shipping firm Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) up to 29 million Ecus next week for a serious violation of European Community anti-trust rules, a senior  Commission source said.
A proposal from Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan imposing the  fine is expected to be approved by the
Commission next week, the source said.

TD
The source said the  fine was for a serious violation of EC treaty rules prohobiting companies from taking part in cartels or abusing a dominant market position (Articles 85 and 86) but gave no details on the nature of the offence  CMB was being charged with.

The Commission fined French shipper Bollore an even larger sum earlier this year for operating a cartel on shipping routes between Europe and Africa and has been investigating a number of similar cases since then.
The Commission decision on CMB is expected to be taken on Wednesday. (c) Reuters Limited

HD         EC fines Belgian shipper  CMB for cartel practices. WC        332 words

BRUSSELS, Reuter - The European  Commission said on Wednesday it  fined four shipping companies a total of 10.1 million Ecu ($12.4 million) for anti-competitive practices.
The company worst hit was Belgian shipper Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB), which will have to pay
9.6 million Ecu ($11.8 million) within four years, the  Commission said in a statement.

TD
The remaining 500,000 Ecu was divided between Woermann Linie and Dafra Line (both currently owned by CMB) and Dutch shipper Nedlloyd.

CMB shares rose sharply immediately after the news, as the  fine was less than expected.  CMB closed up 4.2 per cent at 1,490 francs ($45.5) on the Brussels bourse forward market.
Earlier this month, a European  Commission source said the Commission was set to fine CMB up to
29 million Ecu for violation of EC anti-trust rules.

The Commission said that Wednesday's decision, the first against a shipping cartel, primarily concerns the Associated Central West African Lines shipping conference (CEWAL) which groups together
several shipping companies to provide a regular service between West European ports and the ports of
Zaire and Angola.
The decision only applies to traffic between Northern European ports, excluding Britain, and Zaire. The Commission said it found that on these routes the members of CEWAL abused their dominant
market position in three different ways in order to eliminate competition from their chief rival, G-C, a
common service between the Belgian ship owner Cobelfret and Italy's Grimaldi.

The statement said the CEWAL members agreed exclusive cargo arrangements with Zairean maritime authorities, colluded on setting freight rates and imposed punitive loyalty clauses.

A CMB spokesman declined to comment on the decision. He said the company had not officially been informed of the  Commission's decision yet.

CMB's 1991 group net profit amounted to 747 million francs ($22.8 million). Consolidated cash flow was
5.9 billion francs ($180.3 million).

BRUSSELS, Dec 23, Reuter - Belgian shares closed around half a pct lower in quiet pre-Christmas holiday trading marked by profit-taking after two days of gains, dealers said.

The Bel-20 index of leading shares ended down 5.91 points, or 0.52 pct, at 1,135.65 points with 754 million francs worth of Belgian shares traded.

TD
Holding company Ste Generale de Belgique, which set the highest volume, was a prominent loser, falling 2.6 pct to 1,840 francs. But shipper  CMB jumped 4.2 pct to 1,490 francs in reaction to a statement by the European  Commission it had imposed a smaller than expected anti-trust  fine on the company.

The Commission, which had been expected to  fine CMB up to 29 million Ecus, said it  fined CMB 9.6 million Ecus, out of a total 10.1 million Ecu levied on four shipping companies.

Oil major Petrofina exemplified quiet business. A modest 4,360 shares were traded. It ended 80 francs down to 7,600.

"I had expected some window dressing in Petrofina," said Stefan Casteleyn at Corluy & Co, adding he still believed the stock was expensive at current levels.

Ste Generale de Belgique, the subject of heavy buying in the past few days, fell victim to a sudden lack of buyers at the end of the session.
Casteleyn said there was no reason for the surge earlier this week in Ste Generale de Belgique.
"It remains sensitive to the economic climate," he said. "We remain very careful. Everybody has faith in
Societe Generale (de Belgique). I don't."

Casteleyn said today's performance by the Brussels share market showed the rise in recent days had merely been a technical reaction to losses in the past weeks.
"In fact there's no reason for a rise. The economy remains weak."

Casteleyn said he expected the same kind of trade -- quiet and in a downward mode -- in the remaining days of 1992, with some window-dressing at the very end."

Figures released by Generale Bank showed share issues by Belgian companies tumbled 61 pct in 1992 to 7.8 billion francs from 19.8 billion in 1991.
The sharp fall was a continuation of three years of declines since 1989 when share issues amounted to
131.1 billion francs.

HD         Brussels in anti-trust move: Guidelines for national  courts  published
BY         By ANDREW HILL

THE European  Commission yesterday encouraged national courts to handle more Community
anti-trust cases, publishing guidelines about how the existing responsibilities of national and central EC
authorities could be split.

The initiative is part of the  Commission's effort to decentralise responsibilities, in the face of accusations that too much power is conferred on the Brussels bureaucracy.

TD
However, the  Commission continues to exercise substantial powers in the area of competition, as it demonstrated yesterday by publishing nearly 40 anti-trust and state aid decisions, including a hefty Ecu10.1m (Pounds 8.17m)  fine on a Belgian-run shipping cartel.
The Commission, which will continue to supervise deals with Community-wide significance, said
anti-trust action through national courts would almost certainly be quicker than at European level, and
would enable successful complainants to receive legal costs or damages, which Brussels cannot
award.

But most national authorities will still have to consult Brussels before making decisions, in case the rulings conflict with existing  Commission decisions.
Brussels will also help national authorities by offering advice on EC law and statistical support.

The guidelines are part of wide-ranging procedural reforms put forward by Sir Leon Brittan, who will step down as competition commissioner on January 6 when he takes over responsibility for external economic relations.

The Commission decided yesterday to  fine the Associated Central West Africa Lines shipping conference for allegedly restricting competition in the shipping service between Europe and Zaire and Angola.

The bulk of the  fine, amounting to some Ecu9.6m, was levied on the quoted Belgian company,  CMB, which was the principal member of the conference.  CMB will have four years to pay the  fine.

Separately, the  Commission has opened a four-month in-depth inquiry into last month's decision by Siemens of Germany and Philips of the Netherlands to bring their optical fibre and telecommunications cables activities under the control of two new joint companies.
The Commission said it was worried about 'the narrow supply structure' created by the deal.

HD        EC Commission Issues Rulings  At End of Term
CR        An Asian Wall Street Journal Roundup
WC       998 words

LP
BRUSSELS -- The European  Commission, nearing the end of its four-year term, issued a veritable squall of rulings as it cleared the decks for the new  commission to start work on Jan. 6.

In more than 50 separate announcements, the outgoing European Community executive issued statements covering topics ranging from a Portuguese van plant to Germany's ice-cream market.

TD
In one, the  commission cleared a joint venture between auto makers Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor
Co. to build vans in Portugal after the companies agreed to "important" conditions to protect competition.

The conditions on the 454 billion-escudo ($3.16 billion) venture aim to prevent the blunting of competition between the two companies in car and light-van production and sales of the vans, it said.
The most important condition sets a 25% ceiling on the number of Volkswagen diesel and
high-performance engines that Ford can sell in vehicles made by the venture, it said. The percentage
will be calculated over three-year periods, it added. They are also banned from extending the engine
cooperation to other engine types. The  commission said the type of engine was a key factor for buyers.

As well, a full-scale inquiry lasting up to four months will study plans by Siemens AG of Germany and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands to set up a joint venture making fiber-optic and telecommunications cables, the  commission said.
An initial one-month study found grounds for a full examination of the plan, it said.

"The commission found that the proposed merger raised serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market," it said in a statement.

And two German ice-cream makers were told by the  commission that they must suspend until 1998 arrangements that have effectively frozen the U.S.-based confection maker Mars Inc. out of Germany.
But the  commission stopped short of fining the two firms -- Langnese-Iglo GmbH, a unit of Unilever
PLC, and Scholler Lebensmittel, for their arrangement.

Mars is trying to break into European markets with a range of ice-cream bars styled on its popular chocolate products, but the German firms flouted EC rules in a bid to shut Mars out by barring shops selling their ice creams from selling Mars products.

The commission also adopted a notice to encourage the application of EC competition rules by national courts when there isn't any important EC interest at stake.

The move aims to identify respective fields of competence for the  commission and national courts and explain how the commission should help national courts dealing with EC competition rules, it said.

In order to prevent conflicts, national courts should determine whether the  commission has already issued a decision on the case they are considering. They also should suspend their own proceedings while awaiting the outcome of a  commission action in a case relating to the same matter, it said.

If the  commission hasn't ruled, the national courts can be guided by the case law of the Court of
Justice or by existing  commission decisions, the statement said.

Decentralizing the application of EC antitrust rules will enable the  commission to concentrate on cases that have a particular political, economic or legal significance for the EC, the statement said.

And despite tough regulations taking force next month setting the world's toughest pollution standards, the commission decided further steps were necessary.

The proposal, to cut carbon monoxide emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles to 2.2 grams a kilometer and hydrocarbon and nitrous oxide output to just 0.5 grams, is to come into effect for all new vehicles from January 1996 and for all vehicles from the following January.

The limits for diesel-engined vehicles are even tougher at just one gram of carbon monoxide and 0.7 grams of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons.

The January 1993 rules -- which mandate 2.72 grams of carbon monoxide and .97 grams of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons for gas-engine vehicles -- were designed to cut noxious fumes by about 90% from 1970 levels. The  commission said the new proposal would chop these levels by another 35%.

And four shipping lines were  fined 10.1 million European currency units ($14 million) for anticompetitive practices in a cartel on shipping between northern Europe and Zaire, a  commission statement said.

A fine of 9.6 million ECUs had been imposed on Antwerp, Belgium-based Cie. Maritime Belge NV because of its leading role in the cartel. The remainder was imposed on Woermann Linie, Dafra Line -- both owned by CMB -- and Nedlloyd NV of the Netherlands.  CMB has four years to pay the  fine, it said.
Legal protection for semiconductors designs from several countries and territories was extended. The commission said that patent rights for U.S. chips would be extended to Dec. 31, 1993, and for
some British territories until Dec. 31, 1994. They were originally due to expire Jan. 1.

And it extended from Jan. 1 permanent protection to chips from Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
Also, the  commission cleared state aid to two steelmakers in Germany and one in Spain. Among its other ruling, the  commission:
-- Decided to set up an emergency committee to deal with problems arising out of implementation of the barrier-free internal EC market from Jan. 1.
-- Approved state aid to U.K. newsprint maker SCA Aylesford.
-- Released a first 191.2 million-mark ($120.1 million) portion of aid for Germany's
Meeres-Technik-Werft shipyard.
-- Opened a procedure against state aid for the Italian ceramics sector.
-- Approved Portugual's privatization program.
-- Granted three million ECUs in aid to factory making Kevlar body armor in Northern Ireland.

-- Approved Germany's so-called 100-year coal contract preventing electricity generators in the country from importing coal from other EC member states.

-- Proposed to speed up investigation of competition cases and raise the threshold triggering inquiries into joint ventures.

BRUSSELS, Dec 24, Reuter - Large off-bourse block trades in some Belgian blue chip stocks, reported to the bourse authorities before the opening, were the main feature at today's shortened session,
where Belgian shares closed slightly up.

The Bel-20 index of leading shares closed up 1.94 points, or 0.17 pct, at 1,137.59. Total volume of Belgian shares traded amounted to a high 1.3 billion francs. "But if you don't take the blocks into account, I don't think volume was as high as 300 million francs," one trader said.

Traders said the blocks, cross-trades between institutions, were typical end-of-year operations by investment funds.

Flagship holding company Ste Generale de Belgique, which fell strongly in the last minutes of trade on Wednesday when the stock was hammered 2.6 pct down, recovered most of yesterday's losses, closing up 2.7 pct at 1,890.
Shipper CMB, which on Wednesday was imposed a lower-than-expected anti-trust  fine by the
European Commission, extended yesterday's gains with a rise of 35 francs to 1,525.

CMB had fallen almost ten pct since a French newspaper reported last Wednesday it would be  fined
100 million French francs on abusing its dominant position on maritime transport between Europe and
Africa. -- Rudi Van Tricht 02/287 6817

From Nigel Tutt, Brussels

The European  Commission has fined Belgian shipping company  CMB Ecu9.6m for anti-competitive practices within the Associated Central West Africa Lines conference.

TD
CMB has suffered the major portion of a Ecu10.1m fines package with the remainder imposed against
Woermann Linie, Dafra Line, both currently owned by CMB, and Nedlloyd, the  commission said.

In deciding the level of  fines the commission took account of the minor role played by the three lines other than  CMB and their small market share. It has given  CMB four years in which to pay the  fine.

The commission's investigation, spearheaded by Sir Leon Brittan, followed complaints from the Danish government and from several shipowners. The investigation covered 11 shipowners' committees and four liner conferences - Cewal, Mewac, Cowac and Ukwal - and led to heavy fines on the committees in April on traffic between France and 11 west and central African countries, the commission said.

Yesterday's decision, the first against a maritime conference, mainly concerns Cewal which provides shipping service between western European ports and ports in Zaire and Angola. The decision only covers traffic from northern European ports, except the UK, to Zaire.

The commission found that members of Cewal abused their dominant market position in three different ways to eliminate competition from G and C, a common service between Belgian shipowner Cobelfret and Italian shipowner Grimaldi.

The first tactic was a co-operation agreement between Cewal and the Zairean maritime authorities under which all cargo on this line would be carried by Cewal members, it said.

The second tactic was to counter any cheaper rates from competitors by calling a meeting of Cewal and agreeing to undercut the competitor and scheduling sailing at or around the same time as competitors to win over its customers, it said.

Charges equivalent to the losses incurred by the competitor would then be shared out among Cewal members, it said.

The third tactic was 100% loyalty rebates under which Cewal members would have to surrender all their cargo to the conference in order to qualify for a rebate, it said.

Blacklists were drawn up of shippers who broke the 100% rebate system and this went beyond certain relaxations granted to shipping conferences under EC anti-trust rules.

The commission found that all three conferences agreed not to compete on the geographical territory of the other two but decided not to impose a  fine for this infringement, it said.

CMB said the fine was being imposed on its 51% unit  CMB Transport.

HD         EC Commission Ends Term With Avalanche  of Rulings
CR         A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

LP
BRUSSELS -- The European  Commission, nearing the end of its four-year term, issued a veritable squall of rulings as it cleared the decks for the new  commission to start work on Jan. 6.

In more than 50 separate announcements, the outgoing European Community executive issued statements covering topics ranging from a Portuguese van plant to Germany's ice-cream market.

TD
In one, the  commission cleared a joint venture between auto makers Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co. to build vans in Portugal after the companies agreed to "important" conditions to protect competition.

The conditions on the 454 billion-escudo ($3.16 billion) venture aim to prevent the blunting of competition between the two companies in car and light-van production and sales of the vans, it said.
The most important condition sets a 25% ceiling on the number of Volkswagen diesel and
high-performance engines that Ford can sell in vehicles made by the venture, it said. The percentage
will be calculated over three-year periods, it added. They are also banned from extending the engine
cooperation to other engine types. The  commission said the type of engine was a key factor for
buyers.

As well, a full-scale inquiry lasting up to four months will study plans by Siemens AG of Germany and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands to set up a joint venture making fiber-optic and telecommunications cables, the  commission said.
An initial one-month study found grounds for a full examination of the plan, it said.

"The commission found that the proposed merger raised serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market," it said in a statement.

And two German ice-cream makers were told by the  commission that they must suspend until 1998 arrangements that have effectively frozen the U.S.-based confection maker Mars Inc. out of Germany.
But the  commission stopped short of fining the two firms -- Langnese-Iglo GmbH, a unit of Unilever
PLC, and Scholler Lebensmittel, for their arrangement.

Mars is trying to break into European markets with a range of ice-cream bars styled on its popular chocolate products, but the German firms flouted EC rules in an bid to shut Mars out by barring shops selling their ice creams from selling Mars products.

The commission also adopted a notice to encourage the application of EC competition rules by national courts when there isn't any important EC interest at stake.

The move aims to identify respective fields of competence for the  commission and national courts and explain how the commission should help national courts dealing with EC competition rules, it said.

In order to prevent conflicts, national courts should determine whether the  commission has already issued a decision on the case they are considering. They also should suspend their own proceedings while awaiting the outcome of a  commission action in a case relating to the same matter, it said.
If the  commission hasn't ruled, the national courts can be guided by the case law of the Court of
Justice or by existing  commission decisions, the statement said.

Decentralizing the application of EC antitrust rules will enable the  commission to concentrate on cases that have a particular political, economic or legal significance for the EC, the statement said.

And despite tough regulations taking force next month setting the world's toughest pollution standards, the commission decided further steps were necessary.

The proposal, to cut carbon monoxide emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles to 2.2 grams a kilometer and hydrocarbon and nitrous oxide output to just 0.5 grams, is to come into effect for all new vehicles from January 1996 and for all vehicles from the following January.

The limits for diesel-engined vehicles are even tougher at just one gram of carbon monoxide and 0.7 grams of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons.

The January 1993 rules -- which mandate 2.72 grams of carbon monoxide and .97 grams of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons for gas-engine vehicles -- were designed to cut noxious fumes by about 90% from 1970 levels. The  commission said the new proposal would chop these levels by another 35%.

And four shipping lines were  fined 10.1 million European currency units ($14 million) for anticompetitive practices in a cartel on shipping between northern Europe and Zaire, a  commission statement said.

A fine of 9.6 million ECUs had been imposed on Antwerp, Belgium-based Cie. Maritime Belge NV because of its leading role in the cartel. The remainder was im posed on Woermann Linie, Dafra Line -- both owned by CMB -- and Nedlloyd NV of the Netherlands.  CMB has four years to pay the  fine, it
said.
Legal protection for semiconductors designs from several countries and territories was extended. The commission said that patent rights for U.S. chips would be extended to Dec. 31, 1993, and for
some British territories until Dec. 31, 1994. They were originally due to expire Jan. 1.

And it extended from Jan. 1 permanent protection to chips from Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
Also, the  commission cleared state aid to two steelmakers in Germany and one in Spain. Among its other ruling, the  commission:
-- Decided to set up an emergency committee to deal with problems arising out of implementation of the barrier-free internal EC market from Jan. 1.
-- Approved state aid to U.K. newsprint maker SCA Aylesford.
-- Released a first 191.2 million-mark ($120.1 million) portion of aid for Germany's
Meeres-Technik-Werft shipyard.
-- Opened a procedure against state aid for the Italian ceramics sector.
-- Approved Portugual's privatization program.
-- Granted three million-ECUs in aid to factory making Kevlar body armor in Northern Ireland.

-- Approved Germany's so-called 100-year coal contract preventing electricity generators in the country from importing coal from other EC member states.

-- Proposed to speed up investigation of competition cases and raise the threshold triggering inquiries into joint ventures.

The firms listed in Futures 1993 SourceBook are broken down into four broad groups - brokers/advisors, electronic/computer services, information suppliers/publishers and professional services - with a number of categories within each group. Some categories are defined precisely by the National Futures Association (NFA) or Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC); some are self-explanatory. In other cases, firms placed themselves or were placed into categories that seemed to best fit what they offer or do.

Firms usually were limited to no more than four main categories, so some may fit in more categories than are indicated in this section - the newsletter category, for example, may not list all brokers or advisory services that actually publish a newsletter.

HD          CMB anger over competition fine.

Belgium's  CMB Transport has slammed outgoing European competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan who fined the company Ecu9.6m for anti-competitive practices within the Associated Central West Africa Lines (Cewal) conference.

CMB Transport is to seek shareholder approval to contest the  fine at the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg.

TD
The move could form part of a united action by Cewal member lines against the competition directorate
(DGIV).

Luc Mikolajczak, a CMB Transport executive committee member, said Sir Leon's dogmatism had gone too far.

Mr Mikolajczak criticised DGIV for "making parallels" between the central West Africa trades and the commission's fining this year of French operator Scac-Delmas-Vieljeux (SDV) for alleged past abuse of its dominant position in the Europe to West Africa trades.

"Why does the  Commission not touch the transatlantic agreement or the Europe to Far East trades? Sir Leon is a disaster as far as shipping is concerned," he said.
Sir Leon is one of a number of EC Commissioners who will assume new responsibilities when the new
commission is formed this month.
He will take over a top position in the external trade portfolio. Outgoing transport commissioner Karel
Van Miert will take over from Sir Leon as commissioner for competition.

Mr Mikolajczak said it was "good news" that Sir Leon was now not in charge of DGIV. "It is high time we got someone who knows what transport really is," he said.

CMB suffered the major portion of a Ecu10.1m  fines package with the remainder imposed against
Woermann Linie, Dafra Line, both currently owned by  CMB, and Nedlloyd.

In deciding the level of  fines in the middle of December, the  commission took account of the minor role played by the three lines other than  CMB and their small market share. It has given  CMB four years in which to pay the  fine.

The commission's investigation, spearheaded by Sir Leon, followed complaints from the Danish government and from several shipowners. It covered 11 shipowners' committees and four liner conferences - Cewal, Mewac, Cowac and Ukwal.

It found that members of Cewal abused their dominant market position in three different ways to eliminate competition from G and C, a common service between Belgian shipowner Cobelfret and Italian shipowner Grimaldi.

HD         Nedlloyd  to decide on appeal against fine. BY          By Sean Moloney, Shipping Correspondent

Nedlloyd Lines will decide over the 'next few days' whether to take the European  Commission to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg following its decision to  fine the liner company Ecu100,000 for alleged infringements of European competition law.

The fine, decided at the final meeting of the last  commission on December 23, related to alleged anti-competitive practices within the Associated Central West Africa Lines (Cewal) conference.

TD
Belgian liner operator  CMB Transport, which was  fined Ecu9.6m in the same ruling, is to seek shareholder approval to contest the  fine in Luxembourg.

A Nedlloyd spokesman described the  fine as "unfair" and said the operator would decide whether to take legal action unilaterally or collectively with other companies that have been  fined.

CMB Transport suffered the major portion of a Ecu10.1m  fines package with the remainder imposed against Woermann Linie and Dafra Line, both currently owned by  CMB, and Nedlloyd. They have three months to pay.

The commission found that members of Cewal abused their dominant market position to eliminate competition from G and C, a common service between Belgian shipowner Cobelfret and Italian shipowner Grimaldi.
The Nedlloyd spokesman said the whole matter was the result of a "clash of legislation" between
African and European states. "It is up to the governments to solve," he said.

He added: "We are meeting internally to determine what course to take. We will know in the next few days."
Cewal member lines have expressed satisfaction that Sir Leon Brittan has been replaced as European
Competition commissioner by the outgoing transport commissioner Karel Van Miert.
The European  Commission is due to decide later this year whether to  fine member lines of the
Continent West Africa Conference (Cowac) for alleged breaches of EC competition law.

- For abuse of dominant position.

BRUSSELS, 06/01/1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The European  Commission's decision finding the members of the CEWAL maritime conference (Associated Central West Africa Lines) guilty of abuse of dominant position and imposing a  fine of 9.6 million ecus on the Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and smaller fines on three other shipping firms active on the same routes (see EUROPE of 24 December 1992, page 10) is being contested and is raising questions and perplexities in certain quarters close to the shipping companies in question. The  Commission is being criticized for taking a purely legal and bureaucratic approach without taking account of the political and economic context of the case, which involves the following elements:

TD
- most of the practices considered to be an infringement were virtually imposed by the authorities of Zaire;
- the economic situation in Africa is such that the  CMB and most of the other shipping firms belonging to
CEWAL make no profits and have negative balance sheets;
- the level of the  fine imposed on CMB is such that the company could envisage terminating its activities;

- the abusive nature of certain practices for which CEWAL is criticized (CEWAL-Ogefrem agreement; "black lists") has not been proved.

The same sources observe that: the Committee on Concerted Practices (in which the Member States are represented) did not issue an opinion (lack of a majority in favour of a finding of infringement); the Commission has noted that this was an "exemplary case" (and also proposed  fines of 30 million ecus),
i.e. a decision that would serve as an example, disregarding the particular circumstances mentioned above. The reasons and content of the  Commission decision

The Commission's decision had two components. On the one hand, it found the CEWAL members active on the trade routes between northern Europe (with the exception of the United Kingdom) and Zaire guilty of abuse of dominant position, and on the other it condemned CEWAL, COWAC and UKWAL for concerted agreements.

The first aspect - pursuant to Article 86 of the EEC Treaty - imposed a  fine of 10.1 million ecus, 9.6 million of which on the Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and the remainder on three other shipping firms belonging to CEWAL (Woermann, Dafra and Nedlloyd). According to the  Commission, this amount and its distribution take certain attenuating circumstances into consideration, as well as the minor role played by the three other shipping firms mentioned and their small market share in comparison to  CMB's. The companies are accused of:

(a) participating in a cooperation agreement with Zairean maritime authorities under which all cargo on this line would be carried by CEWAL members;

(b) use of the "fighting ships" method on prices and scheduled sailings in order to undercut competitors and win over their customers;

(c) use of a system of rebates involving a black list of those not complying with the system and going beyond the terms of the block exemption rules for shipping conferences (EC Regulation 4056/86). These

practices were intended to eliminate the most important competitors, in particular G-C, a common service between the Belgian firm Cobelfret and the Italian shipper Grimaldi.

The second aspect involves infringement of Article 85 of the Treaty (prohibition of concerted practices) by CEWAL, COWAC and UKWAL consisting of a market-sharing agreement. Under this agreement, each member of one of these conferences refrained from competing on the geographical territory of the other two conferences. The  Commission nevertheless decided not to impose a  fine for this infringement.

Summary

The European  Commission has imposed a 10.1 million Ecus  fine on four shipowners accused to have abused the dominant position (Article 86 of the Treaty) they gained through membership of the CEWAL shipping conference (Associated Central West Africa Lines), active between Northern Europe and Zaire. The heaviest  fine, 9.6 million Ecus, was imposed on the Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB), although the company has been given 4 years to pay it. The remainder of the  fine will be shared by CMB subsidiaries, Woerman Line and Dafra Line, and the Dutch shipping giant Nedlloyd.

TD
The Commission decided to investigate the activities of the shipping conferences following a complaint from the Danish Government and several shipowners. It is the first such  fine ever imposed on a shipping conference ( a group of operators who coordinate their activities on a given route). The CEWAL operated lines, which were the focus of the  Commission's decision, ran between ports in Northern Europe and Zaire and Angola. The  Commission said it had taken its decision for three reasons:
CEWAL participated in a cooperation agreement with the Zairean maritime authorities (Ogefrem: l'Office
Zairois de gestion du fret maritime) which gave an exclusive right to carry freight to CEWAL members.

They used the so-called "figting ships" method to undercut the rates offered by competitors and obtain all their freight business. Charges equivalent to the loss of the competitor would then be shared between the conference members.

CEWAL offered "loyalty rebates" only to those that gave all their freight to the conference. Blacklists would be drawn up of companies who broke the rule. The  Commission said this breached the block exemption (EEC 4056/86) of shipping conferences from its competition rules.

In addition, the  Commission found that CEWAL, as well as two other shipping conferences, COWAC and UKWAL, had breached Article 85 of the Treaty by means of a market-sharing agreement. Through this, each shipowner refrained from operating on the geographical territory of the two other members. However, the Commission said it was not imposing a  fine on this arrangement.

Europe's shipowners association said that "the amount appeared exorbitant" and it believed that "given difficult trading conditions, the decision will add to the general gloom".
