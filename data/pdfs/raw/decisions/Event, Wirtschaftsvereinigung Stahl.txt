TAKEOVER OF ACERALIA (STEEL, SPAIN) BY THE LUXEMBOURG  STEEL COMPANY ARBED IS COMPATIBLE WITH  ECSC AND EEC  COMPETITION RULES.

Brussels, 20/11/1997 (Agence Europe) - The  European  Commission has authorised a proposed operation in the  steel sector whereby the Luxembourg group Arbed acquires control of the Spanish company, Aceralia Corporacion Siderurgica, by the purchase of 35% of the shares of this company from the Spanish State institution, Sociedad Estatel de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), the public body for privatising certain nationalised sectors in Spain. The operation, part of which was assessed in the light of
the EC regulation on mergers and the other part under the angle of Article 66 of the ECSC Treaty, is in fact not likely to give the parties the means to push prices upwards or hinder the play of competition.

TD
The acquisition of Aceralia, the number one of the Spanish  steel industry with an overall turnover of ECU
2,086 million in 1996 for a production of 4.3 million tonnes of crude  steel, marks the beginning of its
privatisation. The next two stages of this process are planned in the near future, namely the sale of about
11% of the shares to Spanish companies with interests in the  steel sector and, through introduction on the
Madrid Stock  Exchange, those still held by SEPI to financial bodies and individuals.

The steel products under the EEC Treaty, and hence the merger regulation, represent at least 12% of the combined turnover achieved by the parties on the European Union  steel market. These concern, among other things, the manufacture of  steel tubes, wire and wire products, for which the two companies overlap. With regard to wire and wire products, the combined market shares of the two undertakings is less than 5% at the European level, because Aceralia is essentially active in the Iberian Peninsular, while Arbed (less established there than major rivals) sells products not manufactured by its partners, mainly galvanised wire. With regard to tubes, the overlapping of activities only concerns two products for which the combined
market share is less than 8% at European level. In addition, whatever the product or Member State considered, competition is significant.

As far as the investigation under Article 66 of the  ECSC is concerned, the operation meets the conditions for authorisation set in paragraph 2 of this article. On all product markets concerned, in fact, the parties to the operation are confronted by the  competition of the largest EU  steel groups, mainly: British  Steel, Thyssen Krupp Stahl, Usinor-Sacilor, Riva-Ilva, Cockerill Sambre, Hoogovens, Preussag and Voest-Alpine.
In the sector of hot rolled products, Arbed and Aceralia will together hold a share, in Europe, going from
4.2% (quarto plate products) to 13.3% (plate cut from strip). For cold-rolled and coated flat products the
new entity will have shares of sales ranging between 5.2% for organically coated sheets and 22.7% for cold
rolled strip. In the long products sector, where the production of the parties are largely complementary, the
only areas of overlap are beams and rails. The combined share will be around 26% for the former and 9%
for rails compared to the overall sales of these products. Finally, regarding distribution, their activities are
also complementary (except in the UK, where their total market share however will not exceed 10%).

The European  Commission has given its regulatory approval to plans by Luxembourg  steel group Arbed SA to acquire control of Aceralia Coroporacion Siderurgica. Announcing authorisation for the deal on November 20 under the EU Merger Regulation and Article 66 of the  European  Coal and Steel                    Community (ECSC) Treaty, the Commission explained that the merger will not pose a threat to fair competition in the Community  steel industry or allow the parent companies to manipulate market prices.

TD
Arbed is the parent company of a large group engaged primarily in the production and distribution of  steel (flat products, long products and stainless  steel) and in the distribution of scrap, iron ore and coal - activities which fall under the  ECSC Treaty. The group also manufactures and distributes tubes, wire and wire products - which fall within the scope of the Treaty of Rome. In 1996, it produced 11.5m tonnes of crude steel, generating global turnover of ECU 5,841m. Aceralia, active in the production and distribution of steel and the manufacture of tubes and wire products, is Spain's largest  steel producer, turning out
4.3m tonnes of crude  steel in 1996 for a global turnover of ECU 2,086m.

Arbed is to purchase a 35% stake in Aceralia from the Spanish state holding company Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), effectively the first stage in the privatisation of Aceralia. Subsequently, SEPI is planning to sell a further 11% of the shares to a range of Spanish companies with interests in the steel industry and then the remainder will be placed with financial institutions and individual investors via the Madrid Stock  Exchange.

Commission sector experts saw the deal posing no  competition problems. The merged entity will enjoy aggregate EU market share of 22.7% for cold rolled strip and 13.3% for hot-rolled plate cut from strip, but market shares in other products worked out at 4.2% for quarto plate products, 5.2% for organically coated sheets 2.6% for beams and 9% for rails. In the tubes segment, the only overlap in activities is in commercial tubes and structural hollow sections, where EU aggregate market share will not exceed 8%. As regards steel distribution, the two companies' operations are largely complementary, the only overlap
being in the UK, where the combined market share will still not exceed 10%. Moreover, the Arbed/Aceralia operation will face stiff  competition from major Community  steel companies such British  Steel, Thyssen Krupp Stahl, Usinor-Sacilor, Riva-Ilva, Cockerill Sambre, Hoogovens, Preussag and Voest-Alpine, note the Commission experts.

Sixteen  steel firms planning to  exchange market information on a monthly basis are set to have their request for EU regulatory approval turned down by the  European  Commission on the grounds that the arrangement is basically anti-competitive. The Commission is expected to rubber-stamp on November 26 a Decision drafted by the Directorate-General for  Competition (DG IV) on the basis of Article 65 of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty, enjoining the companies in question - which
belong to the German steel producers association the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl - to refrain from putting the data  exchange into operation.

TD
DG IV experts concluded that, against the background of a highly-concentrated market in flat  steel products, plus such long products as  steel beams and stainless-steel wire, the data-swap might lead to distortions of  competition by encouraging the firms to freeze their respective market shares and carry out concerted attacks on any individual company seeking to expand its business.

Article 65 of the  ECSC Treaty (which parallels Article 85 of the EC Treaty) outlaws all agreements, associations, decisions or concerted practices between  steel firms which would tend to restrain or distort the normal play of competition on the Community market. The Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl, which embraces practically 100% of steel-making capacity in Germany and whose member companies belong to six major EU steel groups in Belgium and Luxembourg as well as Germany - Usinor, Cockerill-Sambre, Preussag, Arbed, Thyssen and Krupp - requested an exemption from these rules for the proposed information  exchange in May 1996. On March 4, the Commission sent a formal statement of objections to the companies, which were unable to convince DG IV officials at a hearing on April 29 that their pact was completely innocuous. With EU market share of over 25% in nine of the 12 separate market segments identified for non-alloyed  steel products, the German-based producers were deemed to be in a powerful position to collude to the detriment of free and fair  competition.

COMMISSION BANS PROPOSED DETAILED AND REGULAR INFORMATION  EXCHANGE BETWEEN GERMAN  STEEL INDUSTRIES CONCERNING HOMOGENEOUS PRODUCTS.

Brussels, 26/11/1997 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has decided to ban a system of exchange of information notified by the association of German steel enterprises, the Wirschaftsvereinigung Stahl. The system, which has not yet been set in place, proves to be incompatible with Article 65 of the  ECSC Treaty as far as the markets of homogeneous products are concerned. For the other markets targeted, the Commission, however, raises no objection to the  exchange of sensitive information because of the large number of competitors present.

TD
Above all, the system in question would have allowed the members of the association, including the main German producers, to exchange sensitive, recent and individualised data on supplies of over forty  steel products, according to steel quality details. The  exchange of information would also have concerned the shares held by the companies on the German market. For the requirements of its investigation, the Commission made a distinction between two kinds of markets: those where  competition is intense and which are therefore not threatened by the system and those where products are more homogeneous and therefore at risk. The latter, including all flat products, beams, sheets, track material and machine rod in stainless steel, are in fact characterised by a high level of concentration, low access to imports, great stability of exchange flows between Member States and chronic over-capacities. In this connection, the Commission concluded that the system would have the effect of restricting  competition. Market transparency would be such that any independent act of  competition on the part of one of the participant enterprises would be immediately revealed by its competitors, which would then immediately take targeted retaliatory measures (systematic customer canvassing, the practice of selective, temporary or local discounts, etc.). Companies would cease trying to gain market shares. Furthermore, the frequency of information exchanges (maybe monthly) and recent nature of data exchanged (1 month) considerably reduce the time lapse in which a company may benefit from a competitive action.

The Commission's decision thus directly comes within its constant decision-making practice, as confirmed by the Court of first Instance, ie., that the  exchange of sensitive, recent and individualized data, on a concentrated market of homogenous products is restrictive for  competition, a spokesperson stressed.

As expected, the  European  Commission decided on November 26 not to authorise a pact between sixteen steel enterprises belonging to the German Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl association to  exchange sensitive market information on a certain range of  steel products. The Commission ruled that the association's plan for exchanging up-to-date monthly data on market share and product quality on flat steel products and in the long product segments for beams, rails and stainless  steel wire was potentially anti-competitive, as it would encourage the rival companies to mutually freeze their respective market shares (for details see last issue of European Report). These segments are marked by tight concentration of the market - with few producers competing for sales - and sparse imports.

TD
In reaching its Decision under Article 65 of the  European  Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty, the Commission also relied on a ruling handed down in October 1994 by the European Court of First Instance (T-34/92 and T-35/92) to the effect that exchanging recent individualised data on homogeneous products
in tight markets constituted a breach of  competition rules. However the EU executive said it would raise no objection to exchanges of information on any of the  steel market segments where numerous firms compete for business.

Summary:

"The coal industry employs approximately 150,000 workers and a highly-developed research effort is essential, particularly for the use of coal in energy production", points out the  European  Coal and              SteelCommunity Consultative Committee in a Resolution adopted last month on plans for a research
fund to continue funding R&D work in the coal and  steel industries after the  ECSC Treaty expires in 2002. In view of the value of collaborative research in terms of technical progress and job creation, the Committee says it is of "great importance" to ensure appropriate use of the  ECSC reserve funds that have been built up from the levy applied to the coal and  steel industries over the 45 years the Treaty has been in force. The  ECSC advisory body wants to see the post-2002  ECSC reserve fund kept separate from the EU's General Budget and suggests transferring it to an independent foundation, run by coal and  steel industry interests themselves.

TD
The Consultative Committee is convinced that  ECSC collaborative research can continue to be of great value in the future, not only because the effects on the labour market are considerable, but also because technical progress is dependent on a high level of material research and optimum use of energy. While, as the ECSC Committee points out, everyone agrees that collaborative  ECSC research is one of the essential elements to be maintained beyond the expiry of the Treaty, the Industry Ministers' debate on
November 13 just went to show that the Member States do not yet beat as one on the  European               Commission's proposal for this research fund (see last issue of Europe Energy).

The ECSC advisory body's Resolution says "the willingness of the coal and  steel industries to forego their own regulatory structure on expiry of the Treaty is combined with the urgent wish for a careful assessment to be made of which aspects of coal and  steel policy have proved successful and which instruments are needed to ensure the continuation of a successful Community policy". It once again applauds the collaborative research undertaken over the years as "highly effective, especially with regard to the
opening up and consolidation of new markets". "It has led to a division of the work of the research institutes that has crossed all the internal borders of the European Union, thus preventing an unnecessary and costly overlap of activities, without, however, eliminating  competition between ideas relating to both technical and social aspects", the Resolution continues. Not only has this research effort led to fruitful cooperation between coal and steel producers and consumers, processors and suppliers, but it has also promoted an intensive exchange between the scientific and industrial world. And the Committee feels it has provided the necessary conditions for launching research projects that promised results not just in the short term but in the medium to long term.

Its Resolution urges the Council of Ministers to keep management of the  ECSC reserve fund after 2002 separate from the EU's General Budget. The transfer to an independent foundation run jointly not only by the Commission and the European Parliament but also by representatives of the coal and  steel industries and their employees, consumers and dealers, would be a suitable scheme.

Recalling that the  ECSC reserves have been built up from levies charged to coal and  steel firms "independent of their profitability and which constituted a special European tax with no equivalent in any other field of European Union policy", the Consultative Committee is keen to see the money invested wisely, based on the principle of optimising returns, i.e. aiming at the highest possible returns with the highest possible level of security. But it feels the use of assets as a guarantee for risks incompatible with these principles should not be considered. The full returns on the investment minus the administrative

costs involved should be used for the benefit of technical and social coal and  steel research. And
branches upstream and downstream in each industry should all be considered on equal terms. Finally, the
Committee says that, when sharing out returns between coal and  steel research projects, a ratio should
be determined based, inter alia, on the level of contributions from the two industries to the total proceeds
of the levy during the life of the  ECSC Treaty.

EU/STEEL - GERMAN  STEEL PRODUCERS ANNOUNCE ACTION BEFORE COURT OF JUSTICE AGAINST COMMISSION DECISION TO BAN THEIR INFORMATION  EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

Brussels, 17/12/1997 (Agence Europe) - The "Wirtschaftsverband Stahl", the association of German  steel companies, expressed regret over and criticised the  European  Commission decision to ban the information  exchange system that it had envisaged establishing in Germany and which would have allowed its members to share among themselves any sensitive, recent or individualised information on the sales of over forty  steel products (including the market shares that each of these companies hold on the German market). The Commission considered that the system would have the effect of restricting
competition on the German market (see EUROPE of 27 November, pp.14/15). The German producers do not accept this decision and have announced they will appeal before the European Court of Justice.

TD
It is the opinion of "Wirtschaftsverband Stahl" that the Commission decision is "along the wrong lines" as: (a) it does not recognise that  competition is particularly intense on the "transparent" markets, that this transparency already exists in many sectors without it having been challenged so far and that complete information of the economic operators on a market constitutes a precondition for the correct functioning and equilibrium of markets; (b) it does not acknowledge the fact that "cyclical industries" such as the  steel industry need an early warning statistical system in order to be able to react in time to harmful economic developments, all the more as the  steel industry requires a minimum of long term planning security in order to make the necessary investments; (c) it forgets that one of the main targets of the  ECSC Treaty is precisely to contribute to a situation of transparency on the steel market and that this objective was confirmed and supported (even beyond the expiry date of the ECSC Treaty in 2002) by the members of the ECSC Consultative Committee; (d) it is counter to the jurisprudence of the EU Court of First Instance which noted that the transparency between economic operators constitutes, in principle, an appropriate means to strengthen  competition on a market.
