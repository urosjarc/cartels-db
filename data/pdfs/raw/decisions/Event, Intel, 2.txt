(Adds commissioner comment, AMD comment,  Intel comment, background.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Intel Corp. (INTC) will have to pay a record EUR1.06 billion  fine for breaking European antitrust laws, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

TD
The executive arm of the European Union found the world's largest computer chip maker illegally kept smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) out of  competition by paying computer manufacturers and retailers not to use its products.

The commission said Intel provided rebates to computer makers on condition they bought most - often up to 95% - of their computer chips from  Intel. Intel also made direct payments to major retail chain MediaMarkt so it would only sell computers with Intel's chips, the commission said.

Intel also paid computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of the residual number of computers that contained AMD's chips to further reduce customer choice, the commission said.

The commission has ordered  Intel to stop these practices immediately, and said it would actively monitor Intel's compliance with its decision.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the E.U.'s antitrust rules can't be tolerated," said  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The commission has made a list of practices that won't be tolerated, Kroes added, pointing out that while rebates themselves aren't illegal, the practice of tying them to market abuses is.

Intel said it would appeal the decision, disagreeing strongly with the commission's findings.  Intel operates in a highly competitive marketplace and its investment in innovation and manufacturing enable it to discount its products, said  Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini.

Prices of computers and chips have fallen at a 100-to-1 ratio, said Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel.

While Intel will comply with the commission's order to desist from providing certain kinds of rebates, it finds the request ambiguous as it only provides one kind of rebate, Sewell added. The more products you buy from us, the more we will discount, he said.

Intel made payments to Acer (2353.TW), Dell (DELL), Hewlet Packard (HPQ), Lenovo (0992.HK) and
NEC Corp.(6701.TO).

The commission estimates the world market in the specific chip set in question, namely x86 CPUs, to be worth about EUR22 billion a year, with Europe accounting for approximately 30%.

The fine is the highest the European  antitrust enforcer has ever levied in a  monopoly case and concludes a nearly 10-year investigation. It began in 2000 following a complaint filed by AMD, which said Intel was blocking its access to the market.

"The E.U. decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said Giuliano Meroni, president of AMD for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Intel Corp. (INTC) Wednesday said it will appeal the  European                   Commission's antitrust decision, finding it baseless.
"We completely disagree [with the commission's findings],"  Intel's general counsel Bruce Sewell told
Dow Jones Newswires.
The comments follow the commission's decision to  fine the computer chip manufacturer a record
EUR1.06 billion  fine for anticompetitive behavior.

The commission ruled the  Intel provided rebates and direct payments to computer manufacturers and a major retailer to pressure them to buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD).

Intel said the accusation is completely without merit as "at no point" did  Intel pay a manufacturer not to buy AMD products, nor has  Intel made a rebate conditional on not buying products from AMD..

"We discount the price of the products, based on volumes bought, we do not require them to buy exclusively from Intel," Sewell said.

However, the commission's findings said it had evidence Intel had made rebates conditional on a manufacturer to exclusively, or near exclusively to buy Intel chips. The commission said it has proof Intel gave payments to manufacturers as a reward for postponing the launches of specific computers using AMD chips.

Intel said the commission relied on "weak evidence," inferring facts from subsets of documents which can be taken to mean several things.
"Intel is going to court to see whether it is reasonable to infer from such documents," Sewell said. While Intel will do "everything to be compliant" with the commission's order to desist from providing
certain kind of rebates, it finds it ambiguous as  Intel only provides one kind of rebate, Sewell said.

certain kind of rebates, it finds it ambiguous as  Intel only provides one kind of rebate, Sewell said.
If the commission is right and can prove that  Intel used rebates to lock in market share,

European case law against rebates which aim to lock in market share is solid, and the commission has stuck closely to existing rulings, Brussels-based lawyers said.
"There is nothing in the commission's decision that pushes the established law," said Thomas Vinje an
antitrust partner at law firm Clifford Chance.



Page 11 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ultimately the case will come down to Intel's word against that of the commission on whether or not the rebates were tied to excluding the competition or just used as a regular sales practise, lawyers said.

"Usually when it comes to contesting the interpretation of facts at the European Court of First Instance, the commission has the upper hand," said Stephen Kinsella, a partner at lawfirm Sidley Austin.
The only way Intel can win this appeal is if the commission is wrong about the facts, Vinje added.

HD            Intel faces biggest  ever EU competition fine Intel vs AMD BY           By Rupert Neate

"STEELY'' Neelie Kroes, the European Competition Commissioner is expected to hit microchip maker
Intel with the largest-ever European anti-competition fine today.

Ms Kroes is expected to rule that  Intel abused its dominance of the microchip market to bully its customers into buying only its chips in the hope of squeezing Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), its nearest competitor, out of the market.

TD
The European Commission alleges that  Intel offered its customers, such as Hewlett Packard and Dell, special deals if they signed up to massive orders, which its far smaller rival AMD would have been unable to compete against.

The original 48-page colourfully-worded lawsuit filed by AMD in 2005 alleged that  Intel had "resorted to

old-fashioned threats, intimidation and kneecapping'' to build its near-monopoly in the market for x86 microprocessors, the chips that run personal computers. AMD has already successfully convinced competition authorities in Japan and South Korea to rule against  Intel. Intel is appealing against the Japanese ruling.

Under European legislation Ms Kroes could  fine Intel up to 10pc of the company's annual revenue which, based on sales of $37.6bn ( pounds 24.5bn) last year, could result in a maximum  fine of almost
$4bn.

Duncan Gillespie, a partner and  competition expert at law firm DLA Piper, said the fine is unlikely to reach the maximum but could "easily'' be in excess of euro1bn ( pounds 893m). A fine of that magnitude would be the largest ever anti-competition fine ever handed out by the European Commission, which is determined to open the market to competition and banish illegal business practices from Europe.

"Intel has committed a very serious infringement of the law,'' Mr Gillespie said. "They were effectively going to PC manufacturers and saying 'if you only use us we will give you a massive discount'.''

Today's decision is the climax of an eight-year investigation into  Intel's marketing practices, but Mr Gillespie says the case is certain to rumble on for at least another two or three years as  Intel is "absolutely certain'' to appeal the ruling and level of  fine. Intel will also be forced to put aside money to pay the  fine and will be ordered to "cease and desist'' the illegal marketing and sales practices.

An Intel spokesman said: "Intel's business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and good for consumers.''

Mr Gillespie also warned that a "guilty'' verdict from the  European Commission could open up Intel to an avalanche of civil litigation from its competitors, including AMD, and possibly even class-action lawsuits from businesses and consumer groups. "Individual consumers could claim that  Intel keeping AMD out of the market meant that prices were kept artificially high,'' he explained.

Robert McLeod, founder of mLex, an expert journal covering  European Commission competition legislation enforcement, said  Intel could also face a similar lawsuit in America as the US department of Justice this week embarked on a more interventionist approach to  antitrust issues.

Christine Vareny, head of the DoJ's  antitrust division, said on Monday that she was revoking President George W Bush's administration's light touch approach, which she said advocated "extreme hesitancy in the face of potential abuses by  monopoly firms''.

Experts say Ms Varney has been charged with applying particular scrutiny to large technology companies including Intel, Google, Microsoft and IBM, all of which have been hit by  antitrust legislation.

The largest  European Commission anti-competition fine to date was euro497m brought against Microsoft in 2004 for freezing out competitors from products such as media players. Microsoft was also subsequently subjected to a further euro899m  fine for failing to comply with the original cease and desist order.

"Intel must watch out as the  European Commission and now the Americans are getting much tougher on anti-competitive business practices,'' Mr McLeod said.

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Now on "CAVUTO." The poll at the mall. Shoppers drop out, stocks drop off. Time to turn the spending spigot on? Why what ails you jazzes them. Washington coming to the rescue, but us footing the bill. And today, plans for a doozy of a healthcare bill. The president says money well spent, a critic who says they were just spent, and a congressman who says we're nearly spent. Then, Dick Morris on the White House push to rein in financial pay even at companies who never saw a dime of financial taxpayer dough. All that and when veeps rip and the White House buckles, who says this guy is so crazy?

TD
Well hold the phone, we are not out of the woods. Time to dig out the check book. Welcome everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto and here is the deal. Recovery on pause. Shoppers on hiatus. Retail sales unexpectedly falling four times more than most economists thought they would last month. Renewing concerns this year and whether the recovery some thought in the shopping bag has been now been bagged which had stocks in the bag. The Dow tumbling and Washington in the drink. Politicians scrambling for more spending.

To be these guys, a great economic news means we need more spending to keep things going and bad economic news means we need more spending to assure it doesn't go period. Oh, to be them writing the checks. Oh, to be us paying for them. So, are the economic numbers so bad they may just inspire more government spending?

David Walker fears that they will we received that way. He is the former head of the Government Accountability Office, now the CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. That is your big fear, right? That this justifies more spending?
DAVID WALKER, FMR. U.S. COMPTROLLER GENERAL: Well, Neil, it's good to be back with you. CAVUTO: Same here.
WALKER: I'm less concerned with regard to short-term spending. We are in a recession and we do face some unprecedented challenges with regard to financial institutions, housing, the ripple effect, I'm more concerned about the large and growing structural imbalances. Yesterday, the social security Medicare trustees which I used to be one came out and said that within 10 years Medicare is not going to be able to pay its bills when due, on Medicare part A and that social security is going to start taking in less than it's paying out. That is a real warning sign and we are not doing anything about it.

CAVUTO: All right. Now, that's one that we're going to be addressing as well in the next (inaudible) but the long-term health care concerns and one of the prescriptions being bandied about but we have a lot of bills to pay, David, and not apparently a lot of money or nearly enough to pay them.

So the better part of valor has been going after the rich an whether it's a 250 grand or 235 grand, whatever it is but Dick Cheney with me yesterday saying you're going to have to go lower and if you're going to want to pay for all of this, you're going to have to raise the rate higher. Do you agree?

WALKER: There's no question that taxes are going up. There's no question that we can deal with our fiscal challenge by only looking at people making $250,000 or more. The numbers don't come close to working.

The fact of the matter is the longer we wait to be able to restructure entitlement programs, constrain spending and engage in tax reform, the higher taxes are going to go for three reasons - math, demographics and political activism. Which segments of the population are active? And which ones aren't?


Page 15 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CAVUTO: Invariably, some of the all-time easier fixes for social security and I'm not even talking about means testing but changing the math quotient on how you adjust four yearly increases, it causes hellfire, and you know, we keep punting. We keep punting. You've warned us ahead of everybody that you can't keep punting but we keep punting. So what happened?

WALKER: Social security is a lay up. You know you can miss a lay up but the odds are pretty good that you're going to make it, you know. It is only about money, it's not about life and death. There are ways to be able to gradually phase in changes and the benefit formulas, the retirement age to raise the taxable waste base cap but not eliminate it, not change the tax rate. There are things we can do.
CAVUTO: But they don't. They don't. They don't.
WALKER: We got to save social security. They don't. But we should save social security first.

CAVUTO: Now, they always have - both parties, you can always count on the social security. So it's going to be always around but if we keep going in this direction it won't be around. So we are a few years away from spending out more than we are taking in. And many argue technically we are doing that now. So what is the near-term sort of dramatic adjustment we would have to make as a result of pushing this down the road?

WALKER: Well, the answer is we don't need to make a dramatic adjustments to social security. We can make modest adjustments and phase them over time. The real thing that will bankrupt this country is healthcare cost and the risk is what's going to happen with health care reform this year? Are we going to
get health care reform that's going to improve our financial condition and long-range outlook or is it going to make it worse?

CAVUTO: All right. Now, the cynic in me, you know David, I should not say this that I don't want to be jaded, a half empty glass kind of guy because I don't think I am. That the government with the best of intentions tends to make efficiency less efficient, if you will, but even President Bush when he had a Medicare drug prescription plan that started around $150 billion.

It soon ballooned, last I checked, to over half a trillion and it's still growing. And that was with the republican president. Now we got a democratic one who also wants to rein in cost. God bless him but I know how this goes. How is it going to go?

WALKER: Well, first Medicare part D according to the trustees' report that came out yesterday is in the whole $7.2 trillion. $7.2 trillion in current dollar terms. You know, the last thing we need is Medicare Part D on steroids. And there is a risk that that might happen if we are not careful.

CAVUTO: All right. Let's look at what's happening in the meantime though. In England they just raise - the top rate is now north of 60 percent. That didn't get Michael Caine upset and in his movies he's never upset. So that is a noteworthy development. Now many say in this country, we're bound to be heading in that direction even though it's going to be 39.6 percent in 2011, they could tinker with a lot of stuff ahead of then and even after that raise it all the more. Where do think that top rate, which right now is kicking in at
235,000 but will probably go lower, where do you think it stops?

WALKER: Look, it is yet to be determined and it depends on where we end up doing a deal. The fact is that we need to broaden the tax base in order to keep marginal tax rates as low as possible but marginal tax rates will go up as compared to current levels because the math just doesn't come close to working. We're probably going to look at some type of a supplemental consumption based tax dedicated to health care in addition to reform of the existing income tax system.

CAVUTO: What about the idea that we're going to raise this sort of fitness trainer of all things, a little later in the show - things like soda tax, more sin taxes, that kind of thing?
WALKER: Well, I think that's something that might be politically popular. The fact is that they - CAVUTO: Not if you like soda a lot.
WALKER: Well I understand that. I understand that. But let me tell you what, we do have a major obesity problem in this country. We're number one in the world in health care spending per capita. We're number one in the world in obesity and that's the leading indicator of heart disease, diabetes and a variety of other maladies.

CAVUTO: All right. It is always the thin fit guys who recommend that. David, always good seeing you. Thank you very much.
WALKER: Good to see you, Neil. Thank you.

Page 16 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CAVUTO: David Walker, always great on these stuff.

In the meantime, what better time to pile on more spending particularly, as David pointed out, in health care reform that is if you get to reform. The administration says we'll be sicker for it if we do not. And New Jersey democrat Bill Pascrell here to make sure that we get it done pronto.
Congressman, always good to see you.
REP. BILL PASCRELL (D), NEW JERSEY: Neil, always a pleasure.

CAVUTO: How are we going to ultimately pay for this? You can't get there from here by just going after the rich, right? So what are you going to do?

I think David was absolutely right, David Walker. Now that we know the numbers - up to date number on the Medicare and Medicaid, it makes it even more urgent, Neil, that we have a bill by this August that will reform health care not simply throw money at the problems that exist in health care because that's not going to solve the problem and it is not sustainable.

If we continue and do nothing right now, it is not sustainable. We got to bring down the cost of healthcare. And I think we're going to have a combination of a public plan and a private plan. People will be able to keep their doctors. People will be able to keep the plans that they like and we're not going to force anybody, at least I wouldn't support that into any kind of a situation. The question is -

CAVUTO: But you might not have to force them, right? Congressman, if your company is sick and tired of escalating health costs and I know for a fact a lot of companies it is their number one cost.
PASCRELL: Well, they have been dropping out. You're absolutely right.
CAVUTO: Right. So they're going to drop out and will say let the government do it, right?

PASCRELL: The only way we can do that - the only way we're going to do this is to have reduction of cost. And we can do this. In a public plan, we can have as much easier to pay for performance. We have to have standards in health care. We need to address health care unlike any other way we ever approached it before.

CAVUTO: Well God bless you. You have been on the forefront of this more than a lot of your colleagues. I'm talking about republican and democrat, congressman.
PASCRELL: I'm trying.

CAVUTO: I know you are. But I'll always go back to and this is a republican who tried it. President Bush's effort to rein in Medicare drug prescription costs by having more covered, start out like I said around, I think
$175 to $200 million. It's half a trillion and counting last I checked. The efficiencies there are yet to be borne out. Now, I guess what I'm asking you, this would be like all of that on the proverbial steroids as David pointed out. Then what?

PASCRELL: Well, first of all, I voted against that deep(ph) plan. Remember that great vote that lasted three and a half hours into the night. I voted against it because it wasn't sustainable. We never came up with the idea of how we are going to pay for it. Whatever we do in health care reform, we must pay for it. And I don't believe the best way to pay for healthcare reform is simply to tax our way to the conclusion. Because we
will never have the reduction in cost that I'm talking about.

We need to stop recidivism. We need to stop people returning to the hospitals. We need to stop the infections that are going on in our hospital. All of these things force the cost of health care up. And let me say this one thing, Neil. When we had Secretary Sebelius before us and we have had eight meetings in the Ways and Means Committee on healthcare reform over the last two weeks including a lot of hearings.

I asked her a question about what about the end of life? I could have never seen myself, to be very honest with you, asking this question 10 years ago. The end of life is the most expensive part of a person's life.
CAVUTO: You're right.

PASCRELL: We need to address it and be honest about it and not simply prolong agony and prolong pain in many cases. That is an individual conscious ethical decision that people are going to have to make.
CAVUTO: I mean, I'm not suggesting it will be the government's decision, right? I mean that's going to be - PASCRELL: Well, you don't want the government.

Page 17 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CAVUTO: It's going to be a tricky -

PASCRELL: It will be a standard. I think it will be standard. And by the way, you're going to get Medicare, you should sign an end of life agreement as to what you want, what do you personally want at the end of your life. You see many families - we have arguments within the family and I think that this is a major - if this is a major cost as I am saying -
CAVUTO: Yes.

PASCRELL: -- in health care let's address it. What about chronic diseases? I mean, diabetes is as choking as asthma is choking this economy. The relationship between health care costs and the general economy is now 40 percent. 40 percent of personal bankruptcies, health care costs. We got to do something about this. The patient is in the emergency room.

CAVUTO: Congressman, while I have you and I don't want to sabotage issue here but this back and forth with Nancy Pelosi and whether she should be investigated about what she knew about torture or interrogation, whatever they are calling it and when she knew it, I raised this with the former vice president yesterday. And now Steny Hoyer is looking into the possibility just to get this behind us we should hold a hearing I think I am just getting the gist of his wishes. How big a deal is this for democrats?

PASCRELL: Well, I think what is a big deal is the question of whether this country endorses or looks the other way or doesn't ask any question about the possibilities of torture. We have not received any data to
my knowledge, Neil, that indicates that this kind of punishment, this kind of interrogation brings us anything.
CAVUTO: Well I know that - PASCRELL: Of value.
CAVUTO: I am not here to debate that. I'm just here to debate whether democrats debate the role of Nancy
Pelosi and what she knew. This is the big issue. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
PASCRELL: I'm responding to your question. Therefore that is the thing that we should be concentrating
on. If Nancy have that decision before her and she is my leader I support her. I think she's doing a great job
at a tough time. If she had it in 2003 what did she do at that time? Did she talk to somebody within
intelligence to express whether she was against this or not or she waited until now? Knowing Nancy, I
cannot believe that she waited until 2009. That's my feeling. That's my attitude.
CAVUTO: So if indeed she did raise objections early in 2003 but said there was a legislative process for
this and she wouldn't interfere with that, a, it is earlier than we thought congressman and b, that is kind of a
wimpy response if that was her response, right?

PASCRELL: Well, I don't think it is a wimpy response but I can see how some people would interpret it that way. Nancy defends herself and she does not need a defender but I believe it is a very tough issue. It's a very embarrassing issue for our country and I think the slight embarrassment may cause some democratic leaders right now. The major issue is what I pointed out earlier and trying to respond to your question.

CAVUTO: All right. So real quick and you have been very patient with this. Steny Hoyer, if he wants to pursue this, would you support him pursuing this?
PASCRELL: Yes, I would.
CAVUTO: You would. OK. Congressman Pascrell, always good seeing you. Thank you very, very much. PASCRELL: Always a pleasure, Neil.
CAVUTO: Same here.

Now in the middle of all of these, we got this. A page one story in today's " Wall Street Journal" that as the administration seriously considering paid standards for the entire financial industry, even those companies that did not, did not receive a single taxpayer bailout dime. Now Dick Morris wrote a book about this kind of thing. It was called "Fleeced." This he calls fleeced on steroids. Wow, what do you think of that?

DICK MORRIS, WWW.DICKMORRIS.COM: Well, it is Obama's goal to limit this compensation. He genuinely believes that that's what he would call fairness. I don't think he realizes that's going to mean he's going to get people ride out of business school, running huge banks, nobody else will. But it's incredible
and the thing that's even more insidious about is those standards are not going to be set in Washington. They're going to be set in Brussels and Strasbourg because executive pay in the financial industry was identified by the G20 as a subject for rulings by the financial stability board, the multinational body of which the U.S. is a member.
Page 18 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CAVUTO: Here's what scares me, Dick, and you an I mentioned that one thing to go after companies that and pay structures of companies that got taxpayer money, there is a twisted argument all right, you're on the dough, you pay the piper but for those who do not?
MORRIS: Yes.
CAVUTO: That is a slippery slope.

MORRIS: Well, yes, of course, it is. And the European codicil, the communique from that meeting spoke of all firms who didn't differentiate between government aid or not -
CAVUTO: That's very true.

MORRIS: And I think that is really what you are looking at. I think that Obama's goal is to create the Japanese system in the United States where the government into the MITI, in that case, the bureaucrats, not elected, tell the business what to do. Business remains in private hands but its essentially manipulated and dominated by the government. And that is the system I think that he wants to create. I know that the liberals were pushing very hard in the Clinton administration. I always have to fight against it. Bob Rice was pushing for it, for legislation -
CAVUTO: Has he just completely gone mad since the last couple of years? MORRIS: Well, his ideas are at the core of the Obama administration.
CAVUTO: I know that but he is a nice guy, very smart guy but he seems like he is just completely whacked-out.

MORRIS: Well, I don't know but his concept back then was that you have to pay a higher corporate tax rate unless the CEO pay was only a certain multiple of average employee compensation.

CAVUTO: And he was also the one who said, you know, $1 million should satisfy anyone. In other words that a million dollars was  fine. And you know there are others who I talked to one woman in Sacramento that you guys are with me and you might remember her name who was telling me, well $500,000.
MORRIS: Yes,  fine.
CAVUTO: In other words, that there are levels which, that's it. MORRIS: That's right.
CAVUTO: When you think of that mind set and where it is going.

MORRIS: But I think that the main point here is that the jurisdictional point has been totally overlooked. Everybody saying well maybe one, maybe two, maybe three, maybe half a million, what about private enterprise. These are not government-owned companies.
CAVUTO: Right.

MORRIS: These are companies that are hiring CEOs who are allegedly responsible to their shareholders, to their consumers but not the government. And -
CAVUTO: You better watch out, Dick, because that's like a chapter in your book. MORRIS: Well it is. It is basically my next one.
CAVUTO: No. But I mean, you know, you're a the pamphlet - you're right it's a multi-bestseller and they're going to go chase your revenue.

MORRIS: But I really, really believe that you're talking about a president that wants to control the economy and he is using the financial system.
CAVUTO: You don't buy it when he says I don't want to control car companies? I don't want to control - MORRIS: I don't think he wants to own them but I sure do think he wants to control them.
CAVUTO: All right. Dick Morris, thank you. Dickmorris.com, multi- bestseller. The administration is now going after his revenues and saying how much he can make with a best seller. It might be interesting to follow.


Page 19 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
All right. When we come back, 235,000 bucks, do I hear 225,000? How about 215,000? Going once, twice. The tax man cometh but who know he cometh after folks who never feared he would never cometh after them. Good thing you are watching all this in HD where you can literally see and almost taste sticking a knife in you in vivid color and wolf screaming, wailing annoying sound.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: Who are the rich? Now the White House says those earning 250,000 smackers or more would fit that bill and should pay it. But it turns out 235,000 will do. Somebody has some explaining to do and today the White House has a lot of explaining and our Major Garrett, a lot of report. All right. So major, what the heck is it? 250, 235, what accounts for the difference?

MAJOR GARRETT, FOX BUSINESS: Well, let's bring our accountants on the set, Neil. It's 250,000 just in gross income which the White House argues allows it to go to 235 when you deduct for allowable deductions, real income could be as low as $235,000. That is their on the record explanation so far.
But Neil, as you are well aware this administration has already showing a pension to tax people who earn
far less than that. Remember the state children's health insurance program. That is financed by a $0.61 per
pack increase on cigarettes. And government research shows 80 percent of those who were hit by that
earn less than some $75,000 a year and the democrats are contemplating or at least have asked the
Congressional Budget Office to consider taxes on liquor and soda pop which will also affect folks who earn
far less than 235,000 or 200,000.

So there is this taxation question, the administration deals with that at the 235,000 level only with as it regards to adjusted gross income but I think it is fair to say, based on what we have seen so far with this White House that the tax continuum rises and falls as it needs and searches for additional revenue.
CAVUTO: Do any of the birds chirping behind you earn 235 grand? (LAUGHTER)
GARRETT: No but they do serenade me in a quite, beautiful way - (CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: Like a Snow White thing -
GARRETT: Every time I walked out they just come right along - (CROSSTALK)
GARRETT: Absolutely.

CAVUTO: Seriously, funny(ph) point and I'm just wondering if the administration -- they are very smart folks there. They've crunched a lot of the numbers. They know what they have got even allowing fregonomic(ph) improvements will we paid for just based on tax on the wealthy, some of these other taxes that you talked about. Do they share that you even anonymously or off the record? Look, we have crunched this and we know that you are right, Major.

GARRETT: No. They will not go that far. They continue to believe and tell themselves and they run the numbers in way they believe are credible that they can bridge this gap. That they can get all these things accomplished and spend all of the money, retire the debt or at least control deficits over the next few years without raising taxes beyond the threshold that they have established. And what's going to happen is the day of reckoning is going to come but Neil, the legislation has already been passed for health care and for energy. Both of which will include taxes. That is obvious.
CAVUTO: All right.

GARRETT: And when the legislation passed and people say well, wait a minutes, you're taxing me, the president will say says sorry. The law is already passed.
CAVUTO: And now I understand why those birds are so upset. Major Garrett, thank you. Always
(inaudible), thank you, my friend.

Meanwhile we got this Fox Business alert. Alert you to the oil boards. For a while a barrel closer at $60 a barrel, ending the day down about $0.83 at $50 a barrel but many say it's a (inaudible) direction up and gasoline right with it. And my next guest says something is wrong. There is no rational reason for prices to be gyrating like they are specially today, notwithstanding gyrating up. He is Michael Fox of the gasoline and automotive service dealers. Now, Michael, you think price gouging is going on?
Page 20 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MICHAEL FOX, GASOLINE AND AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE DEALERS: Yes. I think it's a form of price gouging. I am clear in my mind that there is no definition of the word price gouging when it comes to oil companies but what we are seeing here is market fundamentals. We have not seen inventory levels of both crude oil and gasoline like this since the early 90's. At the same time -
CAVUTO: By that you mean, the levels are high? FOX: That's correct.
CAVUTO: Which means prices should be lower -

FOX: Well, not just high, in other words, we measure crude-oil and gasoline inventories using a five-year average because you have to have some flexibility for demand fluctuations. Because demand fluctuations in our industry are billions of barrels a day. So the use of five-year average, we're almost off the chart, Neil.
They have been making these charts for 50 years, they might have to create a new one because it's off the top.
CAVUTO: What is off the top specifically?
FOX: Crude oil inventory and gasoline is quickly approaching it. CAVUTO: All right. So there is a lot of these stuff piling up.
FOX: Correct and at the same time - CAVUTO: What about demand?
FOX: At the same time, demand is down eight percent this year alone and continuing down even more.
And just today OPEC, we always blame them, revised its numbers down even further for world demand. So
if we have the market fundamentals all over the top why are prices skyrocketing?
CAVUTO: Wait a minute. If you say demand is down with eight percent in a year in the year - FOX: Eight percent in one year.
CAVUTO: All right but prices, you know, for the gyrations are awful and a lot more than that, right? FOX: Eight percent from what?
CAVUTO: From the highest we had.

FOX: No. Listen that is what I think this is all about. That is the game we are being primed for right now to accept 2.75, $3, $3.25 gasoline as being the new normal.

CAVUTO: No I'm not - I don't know what is the new normal. I'm just saying that if one thing has declined eight percent and we have seen from our highs we are down more than 50 percent, what is the real level that you think prices will be?

FOX: If I look back to the 1990s, look at those inventory levels. I start to factor in the tax differences that we have.
CAVUTO: Right.
FOX: I would say somewhere around $1.75 a gallon, retail.

CAVUTO: Really? OK. But there is this dollar issue, right? OPEC and oil, it's all priced in dollars and the dollar is you know, (inaudible) So I mean, how much does that factor?

FOX: Can you have it both ways? Can you say when the fundamentals are down we have to raise the price? But when the dollar is down, we have to raise the price.
CAVUTO: But who would be the bogeyman here?

FOX: I am not sure who the bogeyman is. I think profits tell who the bogeyman is. If the profits of the major oil companies continue to go up when they bought crude oil at $33 a barrel and now they're making excess profits I would call them on gasoline margins then the bogeyman would be the oil companies. If taxes are too high by your state, setting the retail price, then the tax structure -
CAVUTO: Your profits are still substantial but they are way down.

Page 21 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FOX: OK. They're down from a five-year highs of a five-year high.
CAVUTO: No. They're down from a year ago. FOX: OK.
CAVUTO: They are down - (CROSSTALK)
FOX: You are a smart man, Neil. For five years in a row they have set record-breaking profits.

CAVUTO: No doubt. No. I am trying to say is I'm trying to find a more rational type of way to look at this than what seems to me and you know, your business well, this popular view that well it has to be the oil companies gouging.

FOX: Again, there is no definition of gouging. We all throw the word around but what we're really saying is what is a fair return on investment and what is a fair profit margin? I do not think when the world economy is going in the toilet, I do not think when people are struggling to heat their homes, feed their families --
CAVUTO: Right.

FOX: That big business should be increasing their profit levels above a record setting profit five years in a row.

CAVUTO: Then let me ask you this. We have this global slowdown still gripping us. We have the latest signs of that again with retail sales are down so maybe the consumers hiccuping and I see a lot of people are still combining trips and trying to conserve on gas. So maybe the demand quotient doesn't change that much.

In other words, if anything it gets even worse. So the demand goes down, that supply (inaudible) that the market will catch up with that? You know what I'm saying that it will get closer to your level because this stinkiness continues for a while? Well, the question I though is why is the price going up today?

Yes, I understand that market price for crude oil is $60 a barrel. So what they're doing is buying - they bought the crude oil at $30 a barrel. They put it through the refinery and now they're selling to us gasoline priced at $60 a barrel. Somehow it doesn't seem to stimulate the economy or help us out. Sell me the gasoline based upon what your cost was, what cost of acquisition was, what your cost for putting a refinery was, I have no problem with that. Pick a fair profit margin. You can't have it both ways.
CAVUTO: All right. You have to deal with when you go to the gasoline business (inaudible) (CROSSTALK)
FOX: 24 years in this business. You got to be a little thick skinned. CAVUTO: Michael, thank you very much.
FOX: Thank you, Neil, for having me. CAVUTO: Very interesting.
Well if spending is our advice, if it's our advice, how about just taxing our vices? (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO: Get ready to shell out more for that can of soda or Slurpee at 7-Eleven. Senate leaders are seriously considering new federal taxes on sugary drinks like soda to help pay for the president's very ambitious plans to overhaul the health care system.

Antigym Revolution CEO Michael Karolchyk is all for this. Michael, you're one of my favorite guests. I love having you on. But I always like you on via remote, because if I ask you nasty questions, you really can't hit me or anything so. Why is a big, strapping strong guy like you for hiking taxes on anything?

MICHAEL KAROLCHYK, ANTIGYM REVOLUTION CEO: Well, you know what, Neil? You know I love Ronald Reagan, supply side economics. But this is for supply-wide economics. The reason is the following: if you -- if you raise taxes on something, there will be less consumption.

So guess what? People will then do like my grandfather said, hey, Michael, drink Sun Tea. Yes, that nasty stuff. You put the tea outside and it is cheap.
Page 22 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Right now, soda is less money, almost four times less than milk. It is almost fours times less as bottled water. It is ridiculously cheap.
so if you raise prices, guess what?

CAVUTO: Aren't you afraid it leads to other things? They keep hiking taxes on cigarettes? You're right in that case. Cigarette use has gone down in this country. But those who still like to smoke are paying, what,
5,000 dollars a pack cigarettes? it is out of control.
KAROLCHYK: It is out of control.

CAVUTO: I'm just wondering define sin on given day. It's soda one day. It's going to be Ring Dings the next. You're probably eating like celery and carrots. Where does it end?

KAROLCHYK: Neil, right now, you can't get a bottle of wine or beer or what have you without being taxed. Thanks goodness. If Napa wine was as cheap as soda, if I could go get my Merlots or Cabernets Silver Oaks for the price of 79 cents, which is what a two-liter bottle is right now of soda, I would become an alcoholic, which is why people are becoming chubby.

Here's Something all you Reagan fans like myself should like, Barney Frank, Al Franken, Donna Brazile, all the chubbies --OK -- they're going to be paying taxes for their Mango Slurpees. Don't you feel good about
at least that?

CAVUTO: Let me ask you this. That is putting the government in an odd role that you're pretty good at, you know. The government then policing behavior, via the tax code, to get what you get out of folks in the gym.

KAROLCHYK: True, but you and I both know that national health care, unlike the early '90s, when Clinton didn't have a chance to get it slammed down, it looks like something is going to be passed, some
quasi-type of plan. So at least make the people -- at least make the people -- at least make the people that go for the Mountain Dew put the money where their mouth is. Put the money where their mouth is. If you're going to grab a soda, OK, guess what? Like my grandfather said, money where the mouth is. You need to pay.

Nobody likes to pay the taxes. But the obese people are the ones that are causing health insurance and all the other hospitals to be overburdened. So let's make them at least put their money where their mouth is.

CAVUTO: Well, you raise a good point. Here's the thing, in aggregate, across the nation, the money we've been getting from cigarette taxes, tobacco-related taxes has been going down, even as we are taxing these people who smoke like crazy. And they're still willing to pay, a core group, but the group has shrunk.

So let's play this out. Let's say the soda drinkers and all these fatsos are having those sodas that you're beating the crap out of in the gym. Let's say they do what you say, they just stop it. Now the government has to say, gee, how will we pay for it now? Let's go after prime rib. No, that's not going to do it. Not enough prime rib. I got it, let's go after apple pie. You see where this goes?

KAROLCHYK: Neil, here is the thing, you're exactly right, but eight to 12 years from now, when this country had enough, OK, of all these taxes, when this soda tax is through, people are going to be skinnier.
CAVUTO: No, they're going to be skinnier because they are going to be broke. That's what. KAROLCHYK: We're going to have less money. They will have -- our health insurance will go back to
private and it will be less money. And that's why --

CAVUTO: You are dreaming, Michael. You're so lucky I'm here in New York. Because I would go down there and kick your ass for saying that. There is no way you believe that. There is no way you believe that. You know as soon as the government is in the role of taxing like crazy, it doesn't end there. It starts willy nilly deciding what you should have and shouldn't have. If it doesn't deem that this particular food group makes the cut, then it's going to tax it to hell. You know that?

KAROLCHYK: Neil, you know what, you are partially right on that. I know better than anybody. I'm almost like the Ann Coulter of the fitness people. The most angry people in the world -- they don't like me -- are the big chubbies. Guess what? They're going -- if they get angry with this tax -- maybe it's soda that finally puts everybody over the edge.
CAVUTO: You're just -- I think you're afraid of me. And I'm coming to get you. That's all I'm saying. KAROLCHYK: Neil, I'm still waiting for the challenge. We challenged each other for the pull-ups and push
ups last time. I'm still waiting for it.

Page 23 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CAVUTO: I've got a like hoagie in one hand. I've got a Napoleon in the other. It's going to be good stuff. Michael, always fun having you. Great guest.
KAROLCHYK: Thank you, Neil. Remember, no chubbies. Barney Frank, stay away from the Mango
Slurpees.
CAVUTO: Oh man, the letters are coming in. Meanwhile, European regulators slapping Intel with a record
1.45 billion dollar  fine, accusing the American chipmaker of violating  antitrust laws. Intel's CEO says that
the company plans to appeal. Our next guest says this move by the EU could backfire and stifle the
European's economic recovery.
Ryan Radia is a tech policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Ryan, why are they doing this? RYAN RADIA, COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: The  European Commission is doing this
because they have a flawed approach to competition policy. They look at whether a competitor is having
problems, and they use that to assess fines.

The fact is that there is no evidence that Intel has harmed consumers in the process or market. It is a vibrant market. It is a poster-child for competition. There has been a fierce price war between  Intel and AMD, Intel's arch rival. Over the last 10 years, there has been rapidly increasing innovation, faster CPUs.

The only loser here is AMD. But the latest market numbers show that AMD is actually picking up some against Intel.

CAVUTO: Well, let's -- I am going to even give the Europeans the benefit of the doubt on this and say they're right. Somebody  Intel is doing -- maybe it's making superior stuff, too much of it, that has got the Belgians upset. If you're arguing, as you did with President Obama at recent international summit, that America is the reason why we're in this global financial funk, then why would you go after one of our premier companies that would almost assuredly prolong it?

RADIA: The European Union has a long history of going after successful American businesses. They have been going after Microsoft for over a decade. They are now thinking about forcing Microsoft to remove Internet Explorer from Windows. The European Union has no trouble going after American business, even when it doesn't help consumers.
This is only going to make the economic crisis worse. That is 1.5 billion dollar  fine on Intel, is 1.5 billion
less that Intel can spend on research and development and creating wealth. It's going to do nothing to help
the economy or consumers.
CAVUTO: What's the track record on this? Whether you go after the Honeywell/GE merger years ago or
Microsoft, it seems like all the time, or now  Intel, where does this all lead?

RADIA: This all leads to a distorted marketplace and a marketplace where companies that have trouble competing see antitrust as an excellent vehicle for gaining market share. Why innovate when you can simply pay lobbyists and go to government? Government will do the hard work for you.

It makes the market work less effectively. It hurts wealth creation. It essentially takes away from the market's ability to discipline companies. The fact is, especially nowadays, the market is superior to regulators.

CAVUTO: All right. Ryan, thank you very, very much. Just when you thought shoppers were back, they back off. Now are all bets off too?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: Well, they shopped till they dropped, and now apparently they have just dropped, dropped out, driving stocks lower by about 184 points. Retail sales falling a surprising four tenths of a percent last month. That was worse than expected.

So if the consumer is tapped out, are the markets soon to be as well? Jonathan Hoenig says as long as Uncle Sam is calling the shot, we're in for a tough road ahead. Let's find out what the rest of the All-Stars think, including Howard Rosencrans, John Layfield, Tracy Byrnes.
Jonathan, you don't think unless the government gets out of the way, it is over, right?

JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: That's right, Neil. Listen, the consumer is important. But what really drives the economy are the producers, right? It's not the guy that buys the iPod, but the Apple Computer that manufacturers it, that creates it. That is what really drives the economy.

Page 24 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Right now, that whole process is really being usurped by Washington. You've been talking about it all show long. The government is going to be taxing soda, regulating derivatives and credit cards and the entire financial business. It is hard to plan for the future when, once again, the rules are being changed on a
day-by-day basis. That is exactly what this administration is doing and it is wreaking havoc with the markets.

CAVUTO: What happened last month interrupted a trend, John, where we were seeing consumers inching back.
JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: Yes.
CAVUTO: Now they have pulled back. Is the trend our friend or what happened last month? LAYFIELD: The consumer -- look, the market is the one that brought the consumer down. Now you're
seeing the consumer bring the market down. You have 32 percent year-over-year mortgage foreclosures
increase, 14 percent house prices down. It is accelerating right now, despite the fact we talked about the
bank's balance sheets are better because of marketing conditions that are favorable to them.

The consumer now is being dragged down. That is going to drag the market down for the foreseeable future.
CAVUTO: Howard?

HOWARD ROSENCRANS, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: We have to look where we came from. We came from a dead stop in the economy between October and February. There was absolutely nothing going on. No, we're not going to see a lot of green shoots popping up. I wish Obama would stop talking about it.

But the reality is we are making progress. Companies -- if you looked at where we were, what people were saying two or three months ago, we're night and day different. And there are clearly signs of progress.
CAVUTO: Trace?

TRACY BYRNES, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: Numbers, if you break them down - - first of all .4 drop is not a huge drop. These numbers are usually revised. But you break through, you see that actually home remodeling, gardening, all these kinds of things were up. Auto parts were up. People are doing things themselves. They're taking matters into their own hands. They're still being frugal. But they're out there purchasing some stuff.

They're still not buying the big flat screens or the autos. That will come. Eventually, the replacement factor kicks in. I was saying, I must be the only person in the whole world that still has a tube in her television. But you can only fix that so many times until you say, all right, I have to get a flat screen. That happens with vehicles as well. Eventually, you throw in the towel and you get out there and shop. So the consumer will get back there again.

CAVUTO: Hear is the thing, Tracy. We're working on demo thing. We want young people going to watch us. You making comments like that, you really do set us back. Like our whole crew, they're combined age is half my age. They hear that, we're going to Nickelodeon. That's it. We're done.

Jonathan Hoenig, here is what -- we had Vice President Cheney yesterday. One of the things he says we'll have a pickup in activity. He is worried about the wave after that, the expectations that, to be fair, his old administration started with these bail outs. But it is -- there's going to be hell to pay from this government largess, because it's way beyond what even he and the former president envisioned. What do you think of that?

HOENIG: Well, Neil, that's always been the case historically, right? You might have that 10,000 dollars in your pocket. But you might find it only buys you a cup of coffee and a doughnut, because of the rampant inflation prompted by all this government spending and takeover of the private economy.

The consumer discretionary stocks that really led the recovery have now broken down severely right now. So the consumer, at least from the market's perspective, isn't looking that healthy.
CAVUTO: Are there any forward-looking indicators to any of you guys that are? Howard? ROSENCRANS: I don't see any meaningful turn. I am just going to take a shot at what Jonathan said
though. In terms of inflation, I see deflation all over. I see huge excess capacity throughout this system.
You can simply say hey, we reinflated so much -- the government has thrown so much into the system. But
the reality is you're still getting prices in general that are really falling. I don't see that as a headwind.
BYRNES: Look at gold. Gold is ready to take off. It looks like it is on a tear. Somebody is out there --
Page 25 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ROSENCRANS: Gold is inverse fear metric, right?
BYRNES: It is getting there. CAVUTO: Gold is a what?
ROSENCRANS: It is a metric that relates to fear. CAVUTO: Inverse fear metric?
ROSENCRANS: Did I --
CAVUTO: That is good. That makes up for the daisy duke thing. That was information that had value. ROSENCRANS: Gold hit almost 11 dollars on Bear Stearns. It's still below that.
LAYFIELD: I went to public schools in Texas. I have no idea what my friend Howard just said.

CAVUTO: Don't be modest. -- suddenly "Time Magazine's" 100 people to watch. Just an average Joe. That is not working. In fact, I don't care what you have to say.
LAYFIELD: The waiters and the security guards love me. CAVUTO: I bet.
LAYFIELD: Nobody else cared.

CAVUTO: We're going to take a break here. Imagine the government limiting your pay just because, for no reason. When your imagination may soon become reality.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CAVUTO: We've got the president, a government, dictating salaries at these institutions rescued, which I
guess happens if you take taxpayer dollars, and dictating their very business, right?

CHENEY: Well, the thing I find objectionable is that people are taking what was done with respect to the financial sector, and, without discriminating, trying to do the same thing for a broader range of sectors. And
--
CAVUTO: Do you think it went too far?
CHENEY: I think so. I would have kept it focused on the financial institutions. (END VIDEO CLIP)
CAVUTO: Yes, that was me, talking to the former vice president. But enough about me. The former VP voiced his concerns yesterday about how government is deciding how much bank and auto executives can make. That was before today's report that the White House wants to stick its nose in the pay for those working at firms that don't get any federal money.

Now this, word that Chrysler will start claiming its executives are really working for Fiat to skirt the compensation rules. So everyone gets real teeny boxy car.
Man, oh, man, Layfield. What do you think of this?

LAYFIELD: This is like out of "Frost/Nixon" where he says, look, it's not illegal if the government does it. You can't do this.
CAVUTO: He said not legal if the president does it. LAYFIELD: He said the president.
CAVUTO: I like you say, it is the president.

LAYFIELD: These guys stepped in and fired Rick Wagoner, who was the CEO of General Motors. They said secured bond holders in Chrysler don't matter. They're working with the auto unions, because they're ones that support them.
Page 26 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This is absolutely insane. The government has grossly overstepped their bounds here.

CAVUTO: You know, all deference to Dick Cheney, they started it. They let the genie out of the bottle, did they, Jonathan?

HOENIG: Well, of course they did, Neil. We decried it at the time. We decried the first round of auto bail outs. Honestly, if the president is so smart that he knows what compensation structure should be at private companies, maybe he could explain where that 15 billion dollars we gave the auto companies six months ago has gone?

Honestly, the government's job is to protect people's rights, not to run an insurance company, not to run a mortgage firm, and certainly not to dictate pay at private enterprises.

CAVUTO: He is so going after Fox anchors. I know. It's going to be like me and Girl Scout cookies. I will have that Jim guy chasing me.
HOENIG: It is a shocking  abuse of power.
CAVUTO: But, you know, the seeds are sown, right?

BYRNES: This whole thing is so disconcerting because he keeps pushing back on the stuff that he wants to see. If he wants to save jobs in the U.S., he is just sending more of them overseas, between his corporate tax proposal and --
CAVUTO: Well, not necessarily. BYRNES: Why would you work here?
CAVUTO: He is going to tax you on shipping those jobs overseas.

BYRNES: You go move overseas. And you go match your revenues and expenses. And I will go work in a plant in Switzerland and make more money there. Why would I want --
CAVUTO: Are you threatening me? Are you going to be like our reporter from Switzerland. BYRNES: No, I'm not blond.
CAVUTO: OK.

CAVUTO: Could be. What do you make of this? Because this is what scared me today, quite seriously, when they said, all right, now pay at companies that aren't rescued?
ROSENCRANS: I think it is sad that Barack is -- excuse me, Obama --
CAVUTO: I always admired that. You call him Barack. I love that. That is power. Continue. ROSENCRANS: He has got to step up and take a position occasionally that is not a populist position. He
should not be dictating. He should not be dictating salaries.
CAVUTO: I think he believes this. It is not populist. He does believe it.

ROSENCRANS: I think he is a populist guy. Inherently in his heart he does and he would like to see the world quasi-socialist.
CAVUTO: Even man of the people Layfield is find this a bit offensive.

LAYFIELD: They found Eliot Spitzer's good time money. They couldn't find Bernie Madoff. You've got to be kidding me. These guys have never run a business. Now they're stepping into businesses, saying hey, we're going after the guy in the corner office. It is a great populist message. But it doesn't really work.

ROSENCRANS: It is important to recognize though that we had a laissez-faire system that did not have an adequate regulate --
BYRNES: Oh, lord, Howard. It is not populist. (CROSS TALK)
CAVUTO: Two at a time.



Page 27 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LAYFIELD: We had an entire group at the SEC that was supposed to watch things like Madoff and they didn't watch it. It is not a matter of regulation. It's a matter of proper regulation. That is the government.
(CROSS TALK)
CAVUTO: All right, all of you, turn yourselves around. After this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO: So man, oh, man, Dick Cheney speaks and the media says he should stop. You ever wonder why? Because protocol says he should, right? Or because they just wish he would? Because they think he is crazy for saying it, and they don't want to listen. Or he is not at all crazy for saying it, and they're afraid a lot of folks will listen.

Who knows? This much I do know; he is pretty much free to speak his mind, just as critics of the vice president are free to say he has lost his mind. His call, not theirs. If he is crazy to think releasing interrogation photos compromises our image and security around the world, then why has administration that has all but called him crazy seen the wisdom of his crazy case?

Now the White House objects to releasing thousands of those photos, just like it continues to object to the release of CIA memos that might give some context to those photos.

Don't worry now, because no photos now, just like no memos now. No telling who is right, the crazy VP, who continues to pound his point, or the oh so cool pres who continues to ignore it.

Weird, because the crazy guy just go the cool guy to cool it. Which makes you wonder whether the cool guy is really all that cool or the crazy guy that crazy. Just drives me nuts. That is just me.
Did I tell you I talked to Dick Cheney? No? That's silly, because that would be self-promotion.

All right, we're going to be all over this market trend, whether what is happening with consumers is going to continue tomorrow. We're all over that. We continue on FBN now.

LP
ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Coming up this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, how much did the government really know about those AIG executive bonuses? It looks like much more than we thought.
New reports say federal officials knew about the payments as early as last September. All this, as CEO Edward Liddy heads back to Capitol Hill today, details just ahead.

And the Obama administration looking to change compensation practices at financial services companies and it includes --excuse me, companies not receiving any federal bailout money. Is that really fair?

TD
And oil surging, the black gold climbing over $60 a barrel for the first time since last year. Supplies are at record levels. And demand is down. So why are prices up? And how high will they go?
We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. Good morning and welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.
Coming up, President Obama wants to curb executive compensation for financials, but is it fair? Even those not participating in the TARP.

And it's been more than a year since the collapse of Bear Stearns. We're going to take you inside the walls of the former investment bank for a look at the final hours. Some of the details will be just down right shocking.

And later, a rags to riches story. Chris Gardner went from being homeless to working on Wall Street to having his life turned into a movie starring - - there you see it -- Will Smith. He's here with advice on surviving these really tough economic times.

And John Bogle [AUDIO GAP] of Vanguard Group, he's going to join us to talk about all things economy related. You never want to miss Jack. He always has the most colored comments and he tells them like he sees them. He's going to be joining us in a little while as well.

All right, let's take a look at the futures this morning. Across the board in the red, we're down 33 on the S&P -- I'm sorry, down 33 on the DOW. Down four on the S&P. Down about 11 points on NASDAQ. So across the board we're down about four and eight-tenths of a percent.
We've got a lot to digest in the markets. Ashley Webster is in London. Connell McShane is here in our New
York studio. Let's get started with Connell. Good morning gentlemen.

CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Alexis. Let's go to the breaking news here on the mortgage applications first.

The weekly number is just out for the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market index down by more than eighth and a half percent, an 8.6 percent decline in market index; these purchases went up though by one half of one percent.

Always want to look at refinancing is going in this environment, given the rates and where they are. Re-fis have dropped compared to the week before. Remember these are volatile numbers. The re-fis dropped by
11 percent; 11.2 percent decline in refinancing.

In the meantime, the average 30-year mortgage rate slipping by three basis points, it came in at the week at 4.76 percent -- 4.76 percent the average as far as the 30-year mortgage is concerned.
All right so we have that.

Futures as Alexis said pointing to the down side this morning. A kind of mixed signals on the economy and where we're going from here given the rally that we've seen and the bit of sideways action that we've seen so far this week; down 33 on the DOW futures.

Intel certainly is a stock that everybody is focused on today. It looked like it would be up big in the
pre-market. It is still up, but it's been up and down this morning. Paul Otellini the CEO came out with some
comments last night that were taken as encouraging; says the condition that the economy is in or that the
company is in -- given its order situation is not as bad as people think.
He says orders pattern indicating that things are a little bit better actually than they had expected it to be.
So again,  Intel is up in the pre-market presumably on that. But there's a lot of other  Intel news this morning
and actually most of it coming out of Europe where Ashley is standing by with that and the rest of the
markets for us -- Ashley.

ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, thank you Connell. Mr. Otellini has some other comments for the  European Commission this morning. We'll get to that in a moment.

Quickly, let's take a look at the markets in Europe that have been rather choppy from the get-go here in London. The FTSE still down about half a percent. Meanwhile in Paris on the CAC-40 also down about a third of a percent. And as you can see the DAX index now gaining some downward momentum, down almost one percent in Frankfurt.

All right, let's get to this Intel story. The European Union has  fined Intel a record $1.4 billion for what it calls "monopoly abuse." It is ordering the chipmaker to halt sales tactics that it says essentially blocked AMD from selling computer chips.

Now, the EU says the company gave price discounts to manufacturers for buying all of their chips from Intel. By the way, Intel has three months to pay the  fine. Intel CEO Paul Otellini saying that -- Otellini, that is, saying that Intel will appeal the ruling and take strong exception to the commission's decision. This was pretty much expected. But $1.4 billion is a lot of cash.

The German State of Hess with a reject that's too expensive; a federal proposal for a temporary takeover of GM's Opel unit if indeed the parent company files for bankruptcy that's according to a state official in Hess which is home to Opel's headquarters. But reports say that the state may be prepared to guarantee some short-term bridging loans. By the way, GM stock having a nice day in Frankfurt, up eight percent.
Busy day for news. Let's go back to Alexis Glick in New York -- Alexis. GLICK: It is always busy, Mr. Webster. It's unbelievable.
WEBSTER: It is?
GLICK: We haven't had a quiet day yet in a long time. All right, Ashley, thank you very much.
Well, yesterday oil prices topped $60 a barrel for the first time since the end of last year. Now it is hovering as you can see. We're at 59.31, still up a little less than one percent. But the last time oil cost this much was, believe it or not, back in November. And the cost to fill up your car, well, it's also on the rise.

The average price of gas has jumped 17 cents in just the last week. One of the largest weekly rises, $2.25 a gallon according to Triple A. So why the surge?

Well, Phil Flynn is senior market analyst at Alaron Trading. He's also happens to be a Fox Business contributor. And Michael Fox is executive director of Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America. Good morning, gentlemen. Good to see you guys.
PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.
MICHAEL FOX, GASOLINE AND AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE DEALERS OF AMERICA: Good morning. GLICK: All right. Phil, number one, why are we at $60 a barrel when as I understand it, and I look at those
weekly inventory numbers, we got plenty of supply and not a lot of demand, so why is oil at $60 a barrel?


Page 30 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FLYNN: You know, I'll tell you, Alexis, a lot of people are asking that very same question. I get it all the
time. Even old-time analysts and traders are saying what the heck is going on? And I'll tell you what's going
on.

We are seeing a situation where government policy and fed policy is driving up the cost of oil. In fact, if you look at where oil really started this really strong run was the day that the fed moved the quantitative easing. That has had a major impact on commodity prices and has been a major driving force in this rally in oil.

GLICK: You know, it's interesting, guys, there as we speak this morning, OPEC came out with some headlines. I want to review a couple of these headlines and get your thoughts on this.

First of all, they said they see oil demand in 2009 falling according to their original forecast by 2.2 million what's it -- BPD. Remind me again British...
FOX: Barrels per day. FLYNN: Barrels per day.
GLICK: Barrels per day. My apologize. FLYNN: Correct and no problem.
GLICK: And they also said that they expect 70 percent of pledged supply cuts in April that was revised, of course, at 82 percent. I mean, basically they are walking through all their supply figures, Michael, little by little across the board.
Surprise to you or not that they continue to see a continuing lack of demand in oil supplies?

FOX: Yes, absolutely. Demand is off eight percent from last year, and if we still go back a couple of years, when you talk about an eight percent reduction in demand, that's huge. You are usually looking at one or two percent increases in demand let alone an eight percent reduction in one year. Those numbers are phenomenal.

When you looked at inventory, we haven't seen inventories of crude oil like this since the early `90s. Go back then the price of gas, $1.26. This is pure gouging by the major oil companies and market forces just trying to make more money.

GLICK: Ok, so, Phil, this is an issue. Everybody talked about speculation in the markets. I mean, I mean, look,...
FLYNN: Yes.

GLICK: I've got to be honest with you Phil I have been talking so much about financial about six months. That even I am looking at these oil numbers and I'm forgetting barrels per day. I mean, I haven't talked about this story...
FLYNN: Yes.
GLICK: ...in six months. But we were talking about price-gouging and manipulation a year ago. FLYNN: Yes.
GLICK: Could that actually be happening again? FLYNN: Right.
I -- I -- It isn't happening. This is a big misconception that people that look at these markets they are looking at the fundamentals in traditional ways. You have to realize that the economy has gone through one of the biggest shocks since the Great Depression.

And all of the historic economic stimulus across the globe that we are pumping into the system to save the economy has consequences. One of those consequences is inflation. And we are seeing inflation being driven in the cost of oil.

It's not about supply and demand anymore. It's about the value of the dollar, how many dollars we're printing, and if you don't think that doesn't show up in the cost of crude oil, it does, and that is a fundamental.
GLICK: Yes, and that's...

Page 31 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FLYNN: It's a very strong fundamental.
GLICK: And that's basically, Phil, why you're suggesting that this is in part because of what the Federal
Reserve Bank has been doing by pumping money into the system. You know, look, Michael, the dollar...
FOX: Absolutely.

GLICK: ...is at a seven-week low. We've often times seen the inverse relationship between oil and the price of the dollar. Let's speak though, specifically to gasoline prices because at least where I live out on Long Island, I saw $2.49 a gallon. Where are we headed this summer?

FOX: I thought we were headed down because when you look at those fundamentals, everything said the price should be radically dropping rather than radically going up. Now I think we're headed back close to $3 a gallon.

In my opinion, this is all about getting us all used to that $3 a gallon. When we say throw out the fundamentals that just logically doesn't make any sense to me.
FLYNN: Yes.

FOX: If you don't use fundamentals, then what do you use? When the fundamentals don't work, they claim it's the dollar. When the dollar doesn't work, they claim it is fundamentals. Wait until you see their profits when we see them in about two and a half months.
GLICK: Ok, so how do we -- if you think that is an issue.

FLYNN: Refining profits though have been terrible. The bottom line is that the refiners have had one of the worst years in decades. In fact refineries are in danger of going out of business.
The big oil companies have had major drops in profits over the last few years.
FOX: Major drops in profits from a five-year high, though. I mean major drops in profits relative to what? FLYNN: Well you know what...
FOX: ...relative to $45 billion in profits? I feel sorry for them.

FLYNN: Relative to economic growth, right. Well, you should feel sorry for them because I'll tell you what, what's good for Exxon Mobil has been good for America.
GLICK: Even Michael has sarcasm.

FOX: No, those are facts, I mean, $45 billion in profits. The rest of us are worried about our jobs and we're supposed to feel sorry for them if they only make $30 billion in profits?
FLYNN: Yes.
GLICK: Yes, I mean...

FLYNN: Yes we should be because it's a reflection of the economy. You know, when the oil companies were making record profits, the economy was on fire.
GLICK: We have good tax receipts.

FLYNN: We were seeing the improving standards of living across the globe. Unemployment was low. What we're seeing in the drop in the oil company's profit is a drop in economic growth.

If you, you know, look at economic growth, and you look at the profits of the oil company, they've gone hand in hand.

GLICK: Ok, let me ask you guys this because one of the things that Connecticut Attorney General actually Richard Blumenthal is trying to do something about this. He's pretty outraged about the fact that prices have escalated so quickly with so much supply out there.

You basically saying Michael, you can't do this on a state by state, individual situation by individual situation basis. There needs to be a collective movement here to say why is it that they are paying $30 a barrel and charging $60, or on gasoline prices purchasing at x and selling it at y?
Explain how we get to the root of that.

Page 32 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FOX: Exactly. When you look at one attorney general, no matter how big or how small the state is, you're never going to take on just Exxon Mobil let alone all these companies collectively.

So what we need is a task force of attorney generals similar to what happened with AIG and the bonus outrage and then we've got to work within the federal government's  antitrust division. We need to get back at market fundamentals.

I'm part of the Commodities Futures Market Oversight Coalition. Get these speculators out of the market. That's people trading paper saying that crude oil is $60 a barrel. They never take possession for it. But you and I are paying gas prices based upon $60.
GLICK: Based on the price. This was a huge source... FLYNN: Right.
GLICK: ...of debate last summer, Phil. And the thing -- the thing I don't understand is why we haven't cured some of that. Are you not concerned, Phil, that we're going to create the same inflated bubble because we think, for example, that China is going to recover first, you look at their actual imports this month.

In fact they are, I think, one of the best that we've seen this year, year over year gains. Could we be, you know, I mean people want to know at home are they going to be paying more because of traders in an oil market?

FLYNN: Well I mean, you know, the bottom line is that the traders and the oil market do react to the fundamentals. And it's just the fundamentals that you're looking at. He chooses to ignore the major fundamental with what's going on with the economy.

The reason why oil prices ran up in the beginning of the year to $147 a barrel is because the dollar was collapsing and people were looking for safe haven. Even if you took every speculator out of the market, the price of oil still would have gone up to $147 a barrel, probably would have gone up to $200 a barrel because people couldn't find a safe haven away from the collapsing economy.

The bottom line is, is that when you look at what's happened to the price of oil, it is reflecting what's going on in the economy right now. It is reflecting the fact that the Obama administration's policies are
inflationary, that when you have a huge budget deficit, you are spending more money than you take in, you print more dollars. That is going to make everything more expensive. Oil is included in that.

GLICK: All right. Well, you sort of fulfilled my point which is that in part it's just really reaction to the economic data and to what's going on with the U.S. dollar more than anything.
FLYNN: It is.
GLICK: More than real supply or demand. Phil, love seeing you as always. FLYNN: It is.
GLICK: Michael you are terrific. We'd love to have you back. FOX: Thank you.
GLICK: And that was good. I need to retool myself to be talking about this conversation again. Thanks so much, guys.

All right, joining Fox Business this afternoon of course 4:00 p.m. for a special edition of "BULLS AND BEARS." It's actually going to be live from Las Vegas. Special guest is going to be T. Boone Pickens and Boone knows a thing or two about this topic indeed especially natural gas.
All right. Banking news now.

The Obama administration wants to change the way people are paid in the financial services industry. The "Wall Street Journal" says that includes companies that did not get any federal bailout money. The administration wants pay to be in line with the firm's performance. Government officials say they want to make sure employees are not rewarded for putting a bank in jeopardy. The banking industry is likely to put seriously a fight up against this legislation.

There could also be a shakeup on Citigroup's board of directors. The "Financial Times" reports that shareholder activists are calling on former At&T CEO Michael Armstrong and former CIA chief John Deutch to step aside because they were re-elected using a rule that is about to be scrapped. Citi has already replaced five of its 14 directors and more changes could be coming.

Goldman Sachs real estate fund White Hall is talking to lenders about restructuring its debt. One of those lenders includes Goldman itself. Critics see this as a conflict and say any concessions granted by White Hall may benefit Goldman at the expense of the initial investors.
Coming up, Chrysler is cutting at least 800 dealers. Details just ahead.

And Intel's CEO offering a positive outlook for the second quarter saying quote, "so far so good." What impact will that have on the tech sector? We're going to answer those questions coming up next as MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns live here from New York City.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: In auto news now, Chrysler is expected to cut up to 800 dealerships tomorrow and renegotiate franchise agreements with 2,400 others. This is according to a lawyer looking to represent dealers. Chrysler says the 800 number is just speculation. The automaker says a final list of dealers to cut has not been made just yet.

And Fiat will be allowed to take a bigger stake in Chrysler if the Italian auto maker meets certain milestones. Fiat will start off with a 20 percent stake. Then it will go up 5 percent if it makes engines in the United States, introduces a Fiat-developed vehicle that gets 40 miles per gallon of gasoline and if it generates 1.5 billion dollars in sales outside of North America. Fiat could eventually wind up owning as much as 51 percent of Chrysler. That's been raised from 35 initially.

And ford raises $1.4 billion by selling 300 million shares of common stock. CEO Alan Mulally says it is a big step towards turning a profit once again.

Well the European Union  fined chipmaker Intel a record $1.4 billion for  monopoly abuse. Intel says it plans to appeal the ruling.
Fox Business's Shibani Joshi is here with more details on this. This, in the wake of an announcement from
Otellini about progress in the second quarter.

SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And the stock is up right now. You get a $1.4 billion  fine but you say your profits may be up and well you get...
GLICK: There you have it.
JOSHI: I guess that's that word magic prescription in this market.
Let's talk about what came out just this morning. The European Union has directed  Intel to pay a record
$1.4 billion fine for breaking antitrust laws; Intel CEO Paul Otellini saying that the company will in fact
appeal. Also part of the EU's order the chipmaker will have to stop certain sales tactics which blocked rival
AMD from selling computer chips.

You know,  Intel is accused of paying European retailer Media Market to only sell  Intel computer chips. The company is also accused of giving price discounts to manufacturers for buying all their chips from  Intel.

Some of the computer manufacturers named in this dispute include Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo as well as NEC some of those companies as you mention trade right here on the New York stock exchange
as well as on the Nasdaq. CEO Paul Otellini vowing to appeal the ruling saying this morning he's not taking it sitting down.

The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins, the other company does not.  Intel never sells products below cost.

Intel stock as I mentioned is up a little more than 1 percent in pre-market trading. AMD also getting a slight boost, up close to 1 percent. Investors also weighing comments from  Intel's Otellini yesterday saying he has a positive outlook for the second quarter saying that chip orders have been, quote, "a little better than expected."

So right now a lot going on with the chip sector. Again, Otellini coming back and saying he's not going to take this sitting down. He's going to appeal the ruling. He stands behind his practices.

What do you do in a circumstance when there's only two players in this industry, AMD and  Intel, Intel clearly the dominant winner in this space. They say we're just trying to do business as usual. This is how it works.



Page 34 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: Speaking of fewer players, a lot of speculation brewing about another deal in the software sector, perhaps a deal between Microsoft and SAP. This coming on the heels of the Oracle-Sun deal, IBM was in the mix, oh my goodness, it's a tangled web.
What's the latest? I hear there's a lot of action in some of the options markets; a lot of speculation brewing. JOSHI: Steve Ballmer came out yesterday and said these are all just rumors, speculation, we can't speak
about it. SAP has come out and said the same thing. But really, when a company that has $25 billion, $30
billion dollars in cash comes out and raises $3.5 billion, you kind of got to wonder what are you going to do
with it?

A lot of people I'm talking to are saying they are going to more than likely buy back their own stock, but you never know because -- and Microsoft has not been transparent; has not been transparent about this whole Microsoft-Yahoo! thing, coming out saying one thing doing another. You never know in this market.
GLICK: Tech sector is hot and a lot of action going on there. Thank you very much. All right, Shibani.
Belgium financial markets regulated; this morning announced Belgian banks will undergo stress tests to determine their ability to withstand varying levels of economic deterioration. This, one day after the International Monetary Fund's European director said European Union governments needed to apply these tests to all European banks. This, a week after EU officials said they would not follow the U.S.
government's lead on banking stress tests.
It's complicated. Let's get into it.

Frederick Erixon is the director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels, Belgium. And joining us in Frankfurt, Germany is Annerose Tashiro, an insolvency lawyer for the law firm Schultze and Braun who is joining us from Frankfurt.
Good morning guys. Thanks for being here.

Frederick, let me first start with you. There have been varying discussions, different disagreements as to whether or not the European banks should conduct a stress test. It appears as though according to the very latest data that I'm reading here from the committee of European banking supervisors that there will be a test of the 27 countries involved in the EU.
What will those stress tests look like? And will they look anything like what we had here in the United
States?

FREDERICK ERIXON, DIRECTOR, EUROPEAN CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY: Well, it's a very good question. I don't think you will find an answer to it. How these stress tests will be done.

One thing we could say for sure is that there are a lot of differences between European banks. Banks find themselves in different positions both in terms of the amount of problems they find themselves in but also in terms of their ability to recapitalize by interest revenues.

So I think it's -- I don't think we're going to know how these tests are going to be done, but we can know for sure that these sort of tests if they are going to be public, they will basically show that some banks might need to find more capital. But overall I think the tests will show that banks in general in particular the banking system at large has caused the worst troubles and that it is about to become better.

GLICK: Ok. Annerose, let me switch to you. You've been following the situation specifically what's been happening with the German banks. A lot of conversations in Germany right now about the concept of creating a good bank-bad bank structure for all these toxic assets. It's been exceptionally controversial.
Tell us a little bit about what's going on behind the scenes and why we should care about this.

ANNEROSE TASHIRO, INSOLVENCY LAWYER, SCHULTZE & BRAUN: Certainly. The bid (ph) has been just in the process of passing parliament and all of these authorities. The question is -- or the idea is to set up bad banks for each singular bank as its own subsidiary. And of course the criticism and the question is whether or not the taxpayers and the consumers will pay at the end for those toxic assets.

The idea behind it is that banks shall be allowed to put out any toxic assets into these bad banks, but at the end of the day, at the moment and this, of course, some kind of inconsistent to me says that the banks will still be liable for the difference between the purchase price and the actual value.

Page 35 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So putting it out of the balance sheet into a bad bank will end up liability on the balance sheet at the end.

GLICK: Annerose, I hate to interrupt you but it is so reminiscent of the precise conversation that occurred here in the United States.

Frederick, let me just jump we understand in this specific stress test in Europe, is that it would seek to assess risks in the market rather than determine the capital injections needed. Already over $400 billion has been raised by these specific financial institutions overseas in Europe. But this is fraught with a lot of controversy because a lot of this relies on the health and well being of specific countries.
Walk us through why that makes this stress test even more complicated. TASHIRO: This stress test...
ERIXON: Well, I mean, again there are big differences between countries and banks here, you have... GLICK: Go ahead, sorry, Frederick.
ERIXON: All right. Sorry. There are big differences between banks and countries here. You will find some countries and some banks like German banks for instance that are highly exposed to different systemic default risks in the eastern part of Europe. You have other countries that are facing similar problems as well.
They are not, perhaps so much exposed to sub prime problems as the American banks are, but that extra
-- that extra addition of a systemic risk makes it even more difficult to make, you know, honest plausible
stress tests in a way that make any sense.

I mean, I'm sure that many banks themselves -- I hope that many banks themselves have done these sort of tests...
GLICK: Right.

ERIXON: ...and what the -- what government authorities or what other more cross border authorities can do isn't particularly much especially at a time when the most important vehicle for banks today in order to recapitalize themselves is to raise private equity and to use increased revenues.

GLICK: Right. Ok. I hate to do this, guys. Frederick, Annerose, my apologies; we have to leave it here. But it sounds like you are having the exact same dialogue we have been having in the United States for six months. We will continue to follow it with both of you. Thank you very much, guys.
We're going to take a quick break. We will be right back with much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. Chris Gardener, "Pursuit of Happiness," joining us next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WEBSTER: Good morning everybody. I'm Ashley Webster joining you from London. Time now for a quick look at the headlines.

The National Transportation Safety Board will hold a second day of hearings on February's deadly plane crash in Buffalo, New York. The panel will look into the hiring and training of the pilot and first officer.

Yesterday transcripts of the cockpit voice recorder aboard the Colgan Air Flight 3407 were released. The pilot and co pilot can be heard talking about their anxiety and lack of training for flying in icy conditions just moments before the crash. All 49 people aboard that flight were killed including one person who was killed on the ground.

While in Jesus's birthplace Pope Benedict XVI is calling for a sovereign Palestinian homeland. It is his strongest public support yet for Palestinians. For more on this we turn to Fox News's Middle East reporter Mike Tobin who is in Bethlehem this morning. Mike?

MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST REPORTER: And Ashley, you really should have heard those cries echoing up from Manger Square: "Yaish il Papa" (ph); Arabic for "Long Live the Pope." The cries coming from thousands of faithful who spent hours navigating the narrow cobblestone streets that were bogged-down with cumbersome and redundant security all to get here -- the spot where Jesus was born and hear a mass from the Holy Father. This on a day when the Pope took his most partisan stance yet calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state.



Page 36 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Speaking to the Palestinian crowd, particularly those who were able to make their way from Gaza, he told them, "I know how much you have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the turmoil that has affected this land for decades." Now this could very well put him at odds with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has thus far refused even to speak about the potential of establishing a Palestinian state.

Meantime, the Pope at this moment is visiting a hospital on the outskirts of Bethlehem. From there he will go to the Aida refugee camp, also on the outskirts of Bethlehem. He will meet with families displaced. He will meet with families of political prisoners. And he will also see that controversial wall that separates Bethlehem and the rest of the West Bank from Israel. Ashley?

ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: All right, Mike Tobin in Bethlehem. Mike, thank you very much.

Meantime, a new report revealing a record-breaking increase in U.S. home foreclosures. Realty track finds that the number of households facing foreclosure jumped 32 percent in April from last year.
More than 342,000 homes received at least one foreclosure notice last month that comes out to 1 in every
374 homes. The report says that much of the foreclosure activity is in the beginning stages.

All right. We'll have much more later on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. But coming up, the Obama administration wants to change the way financial companies pay employees and executives. So the question is, is that really fair?

And a story you do not want to miss. From homeless to Wall Street to the inspiration behind one of Will Smith's characters on the big screen. Christopher Gardner joins us with advice on staying positive in the toughest of times. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm
Alexis Glick.

Coming up, how much did the government really know about those AIG executive bonuses? AIG CEO Edward Liddy is on the Hill today where lawmakers will likely want to know the answer to that very important question. We're going to get to details of that in a moment.

Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, will join us in the next hour to talk about all the headline grabbing news. What caused this current financial crisis? And how do we fix parts of the problem? This is going to be a terrific interview. He -- Jack is always so -- he tells the greatest stories. I guarantee you will not want to miss it.

And President Obama wants to curb compensation for financial institutions. We want to get your thoughts on this. Should the administration change compensation practices for the entire financial services industry? Should President Obama be allowed to control this? Should the administration be the ones who are
making these types of decisions?
A lot of talk on the Fed and Treasury as to whether or not they would do this.

E-mail us at moneyforbreakfast@FOXBusiness.com. We'll read some of those coming up in our roundtable discussion at 8:00 because you know it will be heated.

All right. Let's take a quick look at the futures right now. We've been in the red all morning as have all the European markets. And we are getting progressively worse. We're down almost a percent here on the Dow. Down 78 points. S&P down 1 percent. NASDAQ down 1.3 percent.
Let's get caught up on some of those markets. Ashley Webster is in London with the very latest. Ashley? WEBSTER: Yes, good morning, Alexis. And good morning, everybody. Generally positive in Asia overnight
but certainly the sentiment in Europe turning more sour even as we talk.

Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you. Here in London on the FTSE 100 down 1 1/4 percent, now more than 50 points. Same story in France on the CAC-40 in Paris down 1 1/3 percent. And in Germany
the DAX 30 index down right around 100 points now. That's about 2 percent. So certainly the momentum is downward at this hour.

Meantime, Intel CEO Paul Otellini saying that he takes strong exception to a record fine announced today by the European Commission. The commission fining  Intel $1.4 billion for what it calls monopoly abuse.

Page 37 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission says Intel gave price discounts among other things to computer makers who bought all their chips from  Intel, essentially blocking out their big rival AMD.  Intel says you know what? We've done nothing wrong and will certainly appeal the  fine.

In other news a growing belief that the global economic slump is letting up, certainly, has pushed the dollar down to a seven-week low now against the euro. We've also seen the yen weaken after some encouraging reports out of China.

The growing confidence is certainly sapping demand for both the U.S. and Japanese currencies as a refuge. At this hour, the euro is still up against the dollar at 1.36. Meanwhile, the pound down slightly against the dollar now at 1.51.
Another busy morning just as we like it. Let's go back to Alexis in New York. GLICK: All right. Ashley, thank you very much.
Well, checking media news now. Ticketmaster is closer to merging with Live Nation. Ticketmaster's lenders approved the union but it's still being analyzed by the U.S. Justice Department for potential  antitrust violations.

Ticketmaster earned 12 cents a share in the first quarter, 5 cents short of estimates profits fell by 78 percent.

And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is questioning the way General Mills advertises Cheerio's. The FDA wants the company to stop saying the cereal can lower cholesterol by 4 percent which the agency says amounts to marketing Cheerio's as a drug.
General Mills says the dispute is over language in the ads, not the science behind them.

And former vice presidential candidate and Alaskan governor Sarah Palin will be writing a memoir. Governor Palin has signed an estimated $11 million deal with Harper Collins Publishers.

The book should be out by next spring. Of course, Harper Collins is owned by the parent company of this network Newscorp.

All right. Well, the new book from the author, "The Pursuit of Happyness," for which the 2006 Will Smith film was based on his life is looking to offer hope in these tough economic times.

"Start Where You Are" by Christopher Gardner takes lessons from his rise from homelessness to a top earner on Wall Street and offers advice on how to succeed.

Christopher Gardner, who is also the CEO of the brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Company, is here with me now in studio.
Great to see you.

CHRIS GARDNER, GARDNER RICH LLC OWNER AND CEO: And you should add Christopher Gardner did not get $11 million for his book.
(LAUGHTER)
GLICK: Yes. That was a...

GARDNER: Let me be real clear on that. Whoa. However, I (INAUDIBLE) Harper Collins. I know we're going to have to have a conversation.
GLICK: You are going to have to have a conversation. GARDNER: Yes, we are.
GLICK: Yes. The bus stop is just right around the corner. All right. Let's talk a little bit about why you wrote this book. I asked you when you sat down before, I said how long did it take to write? This took a long time. Tell me a little bit about it.

GARDNER: It took about two and a half years. I started making some observations as I was traveling across the country and around the world. And having conversations with people everywhere I went -- first
of all, back up, "Pursuit of Happyness," by the way, has been published now in 16 languages so that mean
-- we heard from people.
GLICK: How many have been sold at this point?
Page 38 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GARDNER: Who knows. Who knows.
GLICK: Unbelievable.
GARDNER: The one person that does know is Rupert Murdoch. (LAUGHTER)
GARDNER: But we're hearing from people around the world and they were all asking the same questions. Why didn't you quit? What made you think that you could? Why did you keep going forward?

So what we've done here is offer some stories from my life and lives of others, folks who have inspired me, and we tell some stories to answer all of those questions.
GLICK: You know, your story is a story that has garnered such a great deal of attention and a guy like Will
Smith was one of -- I mean, I couldn't think of anybody better to play the role.

I was saying to you when you sat down that even my sons were so entrenched in your personal story. And it speaks to the kind of world we're living in now more than ever.

What kind of advice? What kind of inspiration are you giving to people who probably stop you on the street every single day asking you how, how is it possible?

GARDNER: The one thing I do share with people is you've got to find something that you are passionate about. You've got to find -- forget about making money. Let's find something that you want to do so badly the sun cannot come up soon enough in the morning because you want to go and do your thing. That's number one.
Number 1 a, no one has to dig it but you. You don't need someone else to co-sign it or sign off on it. And I
don't mean that in a disrespectful sense.
GLICK: Mm-hmm.

GARDNER: 1 b, there is no plan b. Plan b sucks. Plan b is for everyone who's not committed to plan a. And these are some of the very, very practical things that we're sharing with people.

Folks will ask me, sometimes they do, Alexis, well, what do I have something to fall back on? We already have something to fall back on. It's called a butt. Right?
GLICK: Great. Yes.
GARDNER: And when you're on your butt, sometimes you've got to ask yourself how did I get here? GLICK: It's interesting. I wonder for somebody like you, I thought about a lot of about this new
administration, and a lot of people look at President Obama and say he was this brand new charismatic
leader who's reaching out to people across the country.

We're at a time when we're also putting things in place like extensions of unemployment benefits, in some cases upwards of 50 weeks. There is some who suggest it is needed more now than ever, but on the other hand, that perhaps it would create less of a passion to go out there and pursue that plan a because you know that the government or specific programs are going to be there in place to help you.
What do you make of some of these policy decisions?

GARDNER: OK. Let's -- not even dealing with the policy decisions, the mentality of OK, someone else is going to take care of me. This sense of entitlement.

I was just talking with Charles backstage. And we both agree that sense of entitlement has got to change. It has got to change. I believe it is happening right now because folks are realizing sense of entitlement, a lot of folks thought I could work for this company forever and they are going to take care of me.

Well, guess what? That stock you own is now worthless. The company is out of business or the jobs have been sent overseas. And a lot of folks have gotten that the only person to look out for me is me.

And I will share this with you, and I believe this in my heart, in all sincerity, the person that cares the most about you and your family lives in your house, not the White House.

GLICK: Great point. You know you talk a lot about going out there and getting things done. I was reading some of the points you make. You say, "Baby steps count, too, as long as you go forward. No test, no testimony."
Page 39 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
These are some of your core principles. What does that mean? Because you've been tested.

GARDNER: I have been tested. I'm continually tested, but you know what? The cool thing about being where I am right now in this environment, this economic environment, no one on the planet was ever built to thrive in this environment better than I have been.

So when a lot of folks around are freaking out saying the sky is falling, I'm saying no, those are pennies from heaven. This is a tremendous time for us to be building. And that's what we're doing in our business. We're building.
GLICK: So would you suggest that the American dream is alive and kicking?
GARDNER: I'm going to give the commencement speech at the University of California in Berkeley on the
22nd of May. The basis of my speech is why I believe in the American dream.

The American dream is absolutely alive and kicking. It's not on the front pages of the newspapers. That's OK. It's out there in places like Omaha, Nebraska and Blaine, Washington, and all these other little places that I've had an opportunity to visit with and get to know folks.
That's where the American dream lives. It does not live on the front page of "The New York Times." GLICK: Everybody wants to know what's your son doing now?
GARDNER: My son has made a decision that he wants to be in the music business. GLICK: All right.
GARDNER: Of all the businesses in the world. GLICK: He's not following dad.
GARDNER: As impossible as that is. You know what's interesting? I am the one parent on the planet that cannot say you can't do that.
GLICK: That's.
GARDNER: I'm the one parent that's got to say if that's what you want to do, go make it happen.

GLICK: Follow your dreams. One of your key mentors was Muhammad Ali. And we were talking a little bit about boxing before, because I'm a little addicted. Tell me a little bit about that relationship.

GARDNER: You know what? To have the rapport and the relationship with an Ali -- as a kid, we got our first television, the first person I ever saw on television was Cassius Clay.
GLICK: Yes.
GARDNER: I thought everybody on TV was going to be black. (LAUGHTER)
GLICK: Hey, well -- you've made some progress.

GARDNER: I thought wow, man, this is all right. But to watch and to see the growth beyond the athletic competitions, the growth as he's a spiritual being acknowledged around the world, not for being the greatest, but for being one who stood up for what he believed.

We don't have a Muhammad Ali today. Any place in athletics, there hasn't been one since, and I don't think there ever will be because these guys are more -- they are concerned about their shoe contracts.
GLICK: Interesting. Well, let's hope that they follow those pursuits of passion. And before we go, the Y in
"Happyness." We only have about 10 seconds. Why is there a Y in "Happyness."

GARDNER: The Y in "Happyness" is there to talk about you and your happiness and what makes you happy.
GLICK: You and your -- OK, great. Chris Gardner, great seeing. GARDNER: Man, it's been fabulous. Good seeing you.
GLICK: Wonderful having you on the show.

Page 40 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GARDNER: Thank you so much for having me.
GLICK: You are such an inspiration. GARDNER: OK.
GLICK: Thanks so very much.
GARDNER: I'm going to see Mr. Murdoch about that $11 million. GLICK: I know. You go talk to him about that.
(LAUGHTER)
All right. Well, keep in mind Chris's book is available online and in bookstores. And once again, "Start
Where You Are."
All right, guys, we'll be right back after the break. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back, everyone.

Well, how much did the government really know about those executive bonuses at AIG? It looks like much more than we thought. The "Washington Post" reporting this morning federal officials knew about those controversial bonus payments as early as last September.

Officials at the New York Fed did not flag the bonuses as a potential problem until February, however, a month before payments were made. Meanwhile, CEO Edward Liddy heads back to Capitol Hill today to give an update on AIG's progress.

For more I'm joined by Tim Call, the chief investment officer for Capital Management Corporation, and joined also by FOX business contributor and Wall Street Strategies CEO, Charles Payne.
Thank you both for joining us.

Sam, I want to start with you. Treasury secretary Tim Geithner was running the New York Fed at the time the government learned about the bonuses but according to the "Washington Post," he didn't know the details.

Talk to me about these conflicts of interest and how we're going to separate the two considering that the government now owns AIG.

TIM CALL, CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION: Well, he was attending meetings and receiving memos in which a lot of this information was brought up or mentioned. And so he's stated such but he says he really didn't know the details and didn't know much about it until later.

But he as the head of the New York Federal Reserve at the time was the point man for the treasury and for the Federal Reserve in New York. He was the expert for New York, and when there's an AIG bailout last September, or when there's a decision to save Bear Stearns or to let Lehman go bankrupt, it's the New York Fed president who's playing a very central role in that process.

JOSHI: Right, so Charles, talk to me about this. Talk to me about this. We're talking about accountability. We're tracing back the stats. But here we're pointing to our government as sort of overlooking a major flaw which is these major bonus payments.
CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.

JOSHI: But we're focusing on other things. Are we, in fact, focusing on the right thing, or should we be looking ahead?

PAYNE: Well, two things, A, I think right at this point we definitely should be looking ahead. I felt that this whole time, although the number was a large number, and it has really resounded around the world oh
$163 million for guys who crashed the big business, the fact of the matter is at the same time we sent $100 billion around the world to people at par.

You know, to me, it was a way of getting money from our government to other places around the world to carry favor. You know part of the White House is to get the rest of the world to like us again. Also billions of dollars went to Goldman Sachs. Unfortunately, the public doesn't -- if you were to ask the average person on the street right now, they will remember this pay scandal.
Page 41 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the hundred billion dollars that went out there, their taxpayer dollars that just went out there with no accountability, they don't know about that. So the White House was very successful in that regard.
JOSHI: So there are bigger issues on the table. And again why again.

PAYNE: And by the way, Timothy Geithner, you know what? This is a big problem, too. I mean he knew business as usual -- to say he didn't know the details is one thing, but you know how Wall Street operates where everyone knows the bonus structures and you know those bonuses were going to be big.
JOSHI: Yes. Tim, talk to me about what we can expect. We know that Liddy is going to testify on Congress
-- on Capitol Hill again today. What are we going to hear from him today that was different than any other
times that he's been on the Hill?

CALL: I don't think there will be much different. Hopefully he gives a progress update as to the divestitures taking place and the cash being paid back to the government. He's going to state that AIG hopefully does not need any more government money.
But when is the government going to be getting its money back? JOSHI: Yes.
CALL: Both he and the three trustees should be there. And I don't think they'll be able to give a good answer to that question.
JOSHI: So it's kind of like why are we wasting our time on Capitol Hill? And Charles.

PAYNE: Because these dog and pony shows work really great. If you're a politician, you know, you say to yourself well, how can I look better? The only one -- the one way a lot of people, particularly Congress people, can look better is to drag up AIG because those are the -- Wall Street is one of the few groups of people that have lower ratings right now than the people in Congress.

But to your point, and to Tim's point, it's almost overkill at this point. Now one of the things they should do, Liddy, in my opinion, is to ask Congress to give them some more room. Don't make them sell assets now that they can get a much better price for in the future.

Let them breathe. Let them get this thing out. The notion of them paying back $180 billion any time soon or ever may be out of the question.

JOSHI: Yes, we'll see. Getting breathing room in this environment when you've taken a lot of the taxpayers money and the taxpayers own 80 percent, that's not something that we're seeing a lot -- really happening in today's environment.
Thank you very much, Charles and Tim, for your thoughts.

Coming up next, the Obama administration wants to change the way financial companies pay employees and executives. But is that really fair? We're going to debate that next. And I know Alexis has got a few thoughts.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: The Obama administration looking to change compensation practices in financial services companies. According to the "Wall Street Journal" this morning, the Obama administration wants to change the way financial companies pay employees and executives.

Now that includes companies not receiving any federal bailout money. The idea is not to reward employees for doing something that could jeopardize the health of the bank. But is this really fair?

It is going to be a contentious issue. Let's talk about one of our e-mails that came in from David of South Carolina. He says, "No government should ever set the compensation of any private sector business. The government needs to stay out of the private sector."

Well, I have to tell you, David, you're probably in some of the majority here. I think a lot of people are pretty frustrated about it. And you know, at what point do we say enough is enough? I mean I understand we've got to be careful about systemic risk, but the regulators fell down, too.

We're going to get into that in the 8:00 roundtable discussion. A lot of populism conversations in this country, a lot of populist outrage. Completely understood. But at what point are we taking it too far in one direction across the pendulum? We're going to debate that.


Page 42 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Also, coming up, April retail sales numbers due out in just about a half hour. We're going to bring you inside the collapse of Bear Stearns in the final hours. An inside scoop you will not want to miss.
And Jack Bogle, the creator of Vanguard, he's here with us, too. Great hour coming up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.

President Obama has an army of advisors and they may include your neighbor, or perhaps even you. We're going to look at some of those economic ideas. We'll explain in just a moment in our roundtable.

We're also going to go inside the walls of Bear Stearns in the final hours of the investment bank. We're going to find out the role some Bear Stearns executives played in the collapse. It's an interview I guarantee you, you will not want to miss.
We're also going to get those retail sales numbers coming up at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and then Jack
Bogle, founder of Vanguard, is going to talk to us about the financial crisis and some of the cures.

Take a look at the market. We're in the red across the board. The Dow down just a little less than 1 percent. S&P down 1 percent. Nasdaq down 1.2 percent. So across the board we're in the red.
Let's get specifically to the markets. Ashley Webster is in London. Connell McShane is here in our New
York studio. Let's get start with Connell.

CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, I'll start you off with some breaking news because the earnings are just out from Macy's, one of the big retail figures that we were looking for this morning. And that number looks to be a little bit -- not as bad as expected I guess is the way to phrase it. They lost money in the most recent quarter. Sixteen cents a share, excluding certain items. But the
street was looking for a wider loss. A 20 cent loss was the estimate from Macy's.
And the revenue came in, although it's down from last year, right in line with where the expectation was.
$5.2 billion in quarterly revenue from Macy's. Again, that's down by 9.5 percent from the same time a year
ago.

It says it's -- about the future that it expects it will be able to exceed the guidance it's giving, 40 to 55 cents a share for the full year, if the economy improves the second half of the year. So that's kind of, if this happens, then this is what we'll do. The stock at $12.35. Obviously had a huge fall here. It's been hit hard by the drop in consumer spending. But a big gain here. Look at what Macy's has done here just over the past couple of months. We've seen a big run. About 20 percent of the stock here year to date in 2009.

But again, Macy's in with a loss, just not as big of a loss as analysts had been expecting. M will be a stock to watch today, although it's not moving yet in the pre-market.

As we get set for the open of trading here in the United States, the futures, after being higher earlier, now are pointing to the downside. Let's see what Europe is looking like with Ashley Webster over in London.
ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Connell.

We, too, are on the downside, although perhaps coming off the session lows just a little bit. Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you, get you up to speed on where we stand at this hour.

The FTSE 100 index here in London still down about 1 percent or more than 50 points. Meanwhile, across the English Channel on the CAC 40 in Paris, still down 1.5 percent. And perhaps the weaker performing of the major indexes in Europe is the DAX 30 index in Frankfurt, down now more than 2 percent.

Intel's CEO Paul Otellini saying he is taking strong exception to a record  fine announced today by the European Commission. The ongoing story, the commission fining  Intel $1.4 billion, a record amount, for what it calls monopoly abuse. The commission says  Intel gave price discounts to computer makers who bought all their chips from Intel, essentially blocking out rival AMD. Intel says, you know what, we have done absolutely nothing wrong and says it will appeal that record fine.

Elsewhere, some earnings to report. ING, the largest Dutch financial services company, posting a third consecutive quarterly loss because of equity write downs, higher loan loss provisions and some costs associated with reorganization. The first quarter net loss was just over $1 billion. ING stock down 4 percent in Amsterdam.
That's the very latest. Let's go back to Alexis in New York.

Page 43 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: All right, Ashley, thank you very much.

Well, President Obama rode to the White House utilizing the Internet as a communications tool. From online town meetings, to a website dedicated to his American Recovery and Reinvest Act, the web is a key tool for this president.

Another initiative, something you may not have heard a lot about, is something called the Citizens Briefing Book. It was released just a couple of days ago. Citizens from all over the country, they offered and voted on policy ideas from tax cuts, to legalizing online poker.

Well, one of the bigger vote getters was more laws that "protect the welfare of American citizens and less laws that benefit big banks and big corporations." Well, maybe the administration has listened because today "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting that the Obama administration has begun serious talks about how it can change compensation practices across the financial services industry, including at companies that did not receive federal bailout money.

So we've seen a populist movement here with the president. Something we've seen a lot about. Well, here's my thoughts. Populist outrage is clearly warranted. Where were the regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing the credit markets? How did this financial crisis happen in the first place?

Number two, populism may be the word of the day, but we have to be careful. How much we allow populism to squash the ideals that have lead to the American dream -- free capital markets. Let us not forget, free capital markets.

And number three, the president has garnered tremendous support from the American people for his transparency. He has allowed the American people into the White House. A refreshing and welcome change. But let's be careful that we don't allow this populist rhetoric to govern our country and too many of our industries.
We want to hear more of your thoughts. E-mail us at moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com.

Well, to get their take on some of the entries in the Citizens Briefing Book and some of the announcements today, political strategist and syndicated columnist Will Durst from San Francisco. In Washington, Nick Gillespie, the editor in chief of the political website reason.tv and reason.com. And Dick Dadey, the executive director of the independent, non-partisan, civic organization Citizens Union.
Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you all for being here.

Before we get into everybody's reaction to some of these movements as a result of some of the things said in this Citizens Briefing Book, tell me, just if you don't mind, first, Dick, why was this book created? And
how is it that we're only finding out about it just a couple of days ago?

DICK DADEY, CITIZENS UNION EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Well, I think it was created during the transition as an opportunity for Americans to participate in giving ideas to the president-elect then about what they would like to see him address. So this has been an ongoing process for the last couple of months. And you're seeing the fruition of those efforts.

GLICK: And explain to people at home how many people participate. I mean I have a copy of the briefing book here with all the comments. But how many people send in comments?
DADEY: There were several hundred thousand people.

GLICK: OK. Will, let me talk to you. You know, people say crack down on big business and today comes word that the administration is going to try to create very specific guidelines for executive compensation. Is the president and this administration looking at this and saying, this was a pretty useful tool for seeing what the populist outrage looks like in this country?

WILL DURST, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Well, I think the tool -- I think the whole briefing book is a great idea. It's more like a suggestion box kind of at a high school. And you're not just letting the teachers make the suggestions, you're also letting the students and the fans who come into the football game. So I'm not sure how much he's going to get out of it, but I'm glad he asked. It was nice of him to ask.

GLICK: Well, you know, it's interesting, guys, I was reading through the briefing book and I'm looking at some of these things. I'm going, wow, it sounds an awful lot like some of the things he's been talking about in the first three or four months of his presidency. Let's speak specifically about one of the comments. It's not one, actually, it was repeated by many of the tens of thousands of people who have participated. And that was about revoking the George W. Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent of the country. Of course, the biggest vote getters in terms of wanting to change tax policy and create some equality in the tax code.

Page 44 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nick, are you surprised about that or is that just the mood of the country right now that people want a share in the wealth?

NICK GILLESPIE, REASON.TV & REASON.COM EDITOR IN CHIEF: Well, first off, I mean recognizing the this Citizens Briefing Book is part of an orchestrated B.S. PR campaign for Obama to appeal to the common man. And we all might take a step back and say, you know, if there's one thing worse than being governed by Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and a bunch of idiot Republicans, it's being governed by our neighbors who have brain farts and write e-mail letters to the president.

The total biggest vote getter in that book, almost by a factor of two, was to say legalize marijuana, end the prohibition on marijuana. Now that's a good idea. It's a great idea not only for freedom, it's also a great idea for tax revenue. You can capture a whole new revenue stream.

Now in terms of, you know, repealing the income tax on the top 1 percent, that's going to have negligible effect on government -- on the government balance sheet because, in the end, the top 1 percent don't make enough to make up for the massive spending that we're going on, which is totally in line with the populist message and it's a big problem. If Chrysler and Ford and GM can't govern themselves, it's highly, highly unlikely that a bunch of politicians in D.C. who can't balance their budget can do that.
GLICK: All right. OK. Nick, interject (ph) -- OK. Wait. Nick . . .

DADEY: I think he's missing the point of the Citizens Briefing, but this was an opportunity to inform the policy debates around some of these issues, not necessarily allow the American people to govern themselves. That's why we have a representative democracy, to elect officials to make the decisions . . .
GILLESPIE: Yes, yes, yes, but, come on, come on, what is it. Half of the entry . . . GLICK: Yes, but, Nick, in fairness . . .
GILLESPIE: Wait, wait, wait.
DADEY: Citizens should not be asked to participate in the government that they're being governed by? GILLESPIE: Yes, obviously, yes, no, no, they absolutely shouldn't. Citizens should just get in line and do
what they're told. I'm just saying that this is part of a public relations campaign to change public opinion in a
way that is not representative in any way, shape or form.

GLICK: Yes, but this guy got elected into office. I mean, Will, he's got approval ratings in the high 60s. The American people, one of the key things in this Citizens Briefing Book, is they want greater transparency. That's what he's offering by allowing people to participate with some of these ideas. It doesn't mean, as Dick points out, that they're going to become policy. But don't you feel a little bit better that you have a little more insight, a little more perspective into the legislative process, or do you not, Will?

DURST: You know what, I'm glad he did. I'm glad he asked. And I'm not sure that any of these things are ever going to be implemented. I mean the number two on the economy here, the number two vote getter was more honesty and transparency in government.

Well, we haven't been asking for that for long. Maybe 236 years, you know. But my favorite is when the jocks spoke up. The jocks want pot and they want online gambling. That's their -- I think it's a little . . .
(CROSS TALK)
GILLESPIE: And those are two things that the people will not get under this administration.
Hold on, you're talking about transparency. And this is a huge aspect of Obama's appeal. The fact is, is
that recovery.gov, the official stimulus money tracking site that the government is putting together, won't be
online on October. Last week "USA Today" said it's probably more likely it won't be online with any
meaningful information until some time next year, well after most of the money has been spent.
GLICK: Which is a valid point.
GILLESPIE: That's not transparency, it's obfuscation. GLICK: Absolutely. Yes.
GILLESPIE: It's obfuscation.
GLICK: No, it's . . .


Page 45 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GILLESPIE: There is already a private sector site at recovery.org with is free and open to the public, which is already doing that. We're not getting transparency from the Obama administration, we're getting a sham.

DADEY: Are you suggesting that there should not be any kind of effort to engage citizens in the government?
GLICK: Well, but, Dick, here's a point through. Which is . . .

GILLESPIE: I'm just saying don't pretend. Look at the cover. I urge everyone to read through the Citizens Briefing Book, where 90 percent of the comments seem to come from one or two web commenters. And where it says to Barack Obama from the people of America. This is phony propaganda. It's well done, but let's not pretend that this is some kind of meaningful channel to talk to the president.

GLICK: OK. All right, Nick, let me interject here. OK, let's get back on track for a moment, because the transparency -- I love this debate because it is a big issue because a lot of people were outraged, Dick, about the fact that the president talked about transparency, that he was going to give legislators 48 hours to review that stimulus package before they were going to have to go vote on it and most of those legislators who were -- it was basically jammed on their lap and many of them didn't even read the legislation before they signed that fiscal stimulus package. So there's been a lot of back and forth about whether or not he's lived up to some of those transparency. Nick.

But, Dick, -- but, Dick -- just hold on one second -- there is populist outrage, though. There is anger about the financial institutions, about executive compensation, about the tax structure. There's a lot of outrage about it. He's talking about perhaps changing compensation in financial institutions today. Is he crossing the line?
DADEY: No, not at all. I mean I think people want to be sure that their government is listening to them.
That they have an opportunity to express their opinions. And, you know, given what has happened over the
last, you know, eight to 20 years, where government was not necessarily seen as being responsive either
at the local, state or federal level, I think it's a huge step forward to have citizens be able to express
themselves.

GLICK: OK. But, Will, how much is big government becoming the defining factor of this administration, as opposed to allowing things like small business owners who create the job growth in this country to have a bigger say? It's almost as though the things that he asks for in the Citizens Briefing Book are the things that he's not really eliciting, particularly in the business community when he's talking about more big
government, more restrictions, more regulation. It's counter intuitive.

DURST: You know what I think it is? I think it's the pendulum swing, Ms. Glick. I think it's -- we had the government staying out of everything for so long and then the economy didn't do so well. You may have noticed that. And now the government is re-exerting its pressures at its force. And I think it's just the pendulum swing. And it always happens, you know, when the economy is good, then the government stays out. When the economy is bad, then the government steps in.

GLICK: OK. So, Nick, you're clearly frustrated about what has happened. You're not thrilled about either the calls of transparency, the PR, the marketing, the branding behind it.

GILLESPIE: No, I'm actually very -- I like the idea of transparency. I would like to see it. Part of the problem is that people constantly confuse -- whether you're a right wing or a left wing -- of rhetoric with reality. The fact is -- and you can look it up. You can look it up at reason.com.

George Bush put more regulations on the economy than any president before him. He was not a hands off president. People in America are confused where they say, we want cheap money, we want access to credit, and we want housing prices that will go up forever. And then we want to punish the banks that give us all of that who then ask for a government bailout partly because the government said you've got to start loaning more to more people under George Bush and people like him.

GLICK: So, Nick, does this briefing book benefit politics or policy? I mean is the political divide in this country becoming greater because this recession is, frankly, one of the most challenging and because we're doing so much to sort of over regulate?

GILLESPIE: Here, let me put it this way. This briefing book will disappear shortly and it might even have disappear shortly before this segment ended. It is not meaningful. What we should take away from it is an understanding that Barack Obama, which we all understand, is a very adept politician at massaging and managing the public. Whether or not his policies will have the effects that he claims they will is a totally different matter.


Page 46 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And one of the things that we should always be worried about, America is a country of limited government. We know from the experience of east Germany that governments are not very good at running car companies. That's going to be the same here as elsewhere.

And to the extent that we understand that, like you live and die by your efforts. And when the government backstops every housing loan, every mortgage, every credit card in the country, you get bad behavior on the part of individual citizens and you get really bad behavior on the part of big companies. And that's the problem.
GLICK: Dick, you have the last word. We only have about 10 seconds.

DADEY: I think this is so significant that he's reshaped the office of public liaison to be office of public engagement. The Citizens Briefing Book is but one part of that. He's saying to the American public, I want to hear what you're thinking and here's an opportunity for to you communicate with me in my office.
GLICK: And he continues to do the town halls even after being president. GILLESPIE: And he won't talk about the legalization of pot.
GLICK: All right, guys, I have to end it here.
GILLESPIE: And he won't talk about the legalization of pot, which was the highest vote getter in the
Citizens Book.

GLICK: All right, guys. Gentlemen, I would love to have all three of you back to continue the conversation. Clearly we could go on for hours. Will, Nick, and Dick, thanks so much, gentlemen. I appreciate it.

All right. Coming up, Charles Payne is going to give us his "Charles' Choices." His picks. The former CIO of Stanford Financial indicted on criminal charges. Find out what they were specifically when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: In court now, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernie Madoff assets is suing a major investor for $5.1 billion. Investor Jeffery Picower, his wife and Picower Foundation were all named in the suit. Trustee Irving Picard charges that the foundation received annual returns of as high as 950 percent and wants the money that was withdrawn from the firm. The Picowers were decades old friends with the Madoffs and claimed they were wiped out by Madoff schemes. Nine hundred and fifty percent.

All right. Well, the former CIO of Stanford Financial indicted on criminal charges. Laura Pendergest-Holt was charged with conspiracy to obstruct the SEC's investigation into the company. He's also been charged with obstructing justice. The new charge claims she met with Stanford executives and attorneys in order to "prevent detection of an ongoing fraud."
And the former president and COO of Monster Worldwide has been convicted of stock option fraud. James
Treacy wrongfully backdated millions of dollars worth of employee stock option grants. Treacy faces up to
25 years in prison at his sentencing in August.

All right. Now it is time for "Charles' Choice." And, as usual, Charles has some things to teach us, a thing or two.
What are you watching today, Charles.

CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: You know what, I am going to teach you something. I'm going to show the folks today at up channels. All three stocks today had the same -- there you go. All of them had the same sort of characteristic.

Well, first of all, they all also -- this is Mechel's deal, I've got to tell you, Alexis. I got crushed in this stock. Mechel -- Putin (ph), rather, made a big move here for these Russian companies. And this stock was absolutely hammered. But it's starting to trade higher. This is what we call an up channel where you have resistance on this side, support here, and all of the charts are really doing that. That means it's making higher lows and higher highs.
This stock also on the verge of a real nice breakout here. It's got room at $10 from $8. That would be a
nice percentage gain. And then from there, I think it has room to 12. Obviously it's been hammered, so you
know that there's excessive risk here, but a lot of up side potential as well. Russia getting back on its feet
as oil prices move higher.


Page 47 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The second idea is Graham. The company does a lot of things, including making plants (ph) (INAUDIBLE) companies. Same sort of thing, look at this, we've got a real nice up channel here. Again, making higher highs, higher lower lows. The stock's on the verge of breaking out real soon. Could actually get back up to here, which would be a real big move. Right now $15. I think it's going to move up to $22 at the very least.
And finally, ICE. We've talked about this one before. And you know what's really, really interesting about
this one, again, same thing, this is beautiful. Look at this chart. Higher highs, lower lows, and it's coming up
on a major resistance point. $101 is a big breakout.

However, I want to point something out. The last six brokerage opinions on this stock all downgrades. Amazing, nobody likes this stock, which makes me like it even more. This one breaks out big time to the up side if it can get through $101.
Of course, don't forget to check out my exclusive pick at foxbusiness.com/moneyforbreakfast.

And coming up, well, we're going to tell you what former Vice President Dick Cheney thinks of the bailouts by the Obama administration.

And there could be a shake up on Citigroup's board of directors. We're going to tell you who when we return.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: In banking news now, the Obama administration wants to change the way people are paid in the financial services industry. "The Wall Street Journal" says that includes companies that did not get any federal bailout money. The administration wants pay to be in line with the firm's performance. Government officials say they want to make sure employees are not rewarded for putting a bank in jeopardy. The banking industry is likely to put up a fight against any legislation.

And there could be a shake up on Citigroup's board of directors. The Financial Times reports that shareholder activists are calling on former AT&T CEO Michael Armstrong and former CIA Chief John Deutch to step aside because they were reelected using a rule that is about to be scrapped by the SEC. Citigroup has already replaced five of its 14 directors and more changes could be coming.

Finally, Goldman Sachs real estate Vaughan (ph) Whitehall is talking to lenders about restructuring his debt. And one of those lenders includes Goldman Sachs itself. Now critics clearly see this as a conflict and say any concessions granted by Whitehall may benefit Goldman at the expense of investors. Hmm, interesting.

All right. Let's go to Ashley Webster in London. Let's get a look at some of the latest headlines this morning.
Ashley.
WEBSTER: Good morning, Alexis. Good morning, everybody.

President Obama is expected to announce this morning that House Democrats have pledged to pass a health care reform bill by July 31st. He'll be meeting with leading House Democrats this morning. Details about key issues, such as funding, coverage and access will not be announced. The White House believes this pledge will advance its goal of a new health care law by the end of the year.

Some breaking news now. Verizon Communications is selling 4.8 million access lines in 14 states to Frontier Communications Corporation for $5.2 billion in Verizon stock. This makes Frontier Communications the nation's largest communications provider focused on rural areas.

Well, today's down economy is cutting into Medicare and Social Security payments in the future. An annual report by trustees for the program says that each program has less funding than expected. The report says that Medicare will be tapped out by 2017. That's two years earlier than expected. And Social Security expected to run out of money by 2037. That's four years sooner than projected. The government says it is working on finding a solution.
All right. You are now up to date on the Fox Business Network. Now back to Alexis in New York. Alexis.
GLICK: All right, Ashley, thank you very much.



Page 48 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Well, former Vice President Dick Cheney says the bailout of major banking institutions was crucial to the health of the economy, but calls the current administration's actions to bail out other sectors of the economy objectionable. Cheney was on "Cavuto" last night. Here's what he had to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NEIL CAVUTO, "CAVUTO" HOST: You think it went to far? You think it's gone to far?

DICK CHENEY, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think that's a mistake. I think so. I would have kept it focused on the financial institutions. But I do -- I worry that the current situation is a set of circumstances where the administration is using the excuse of the economic difficulties in order to significantly broaden the power and authority of the government over the private sector. And I think that's a huge mistake.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GLICK: All right. Well, you can catch "Cavuto" here at 6:00 p.m. every single night. We'll be right back. Retail sales numbers coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) GLICK: Welcome back.
We're just about 10 seconds away from the April retail sales number and import prices. Retail sales expected to be unchanged. That was after a decline of 1.2 percent last month, ex auto up 0.2.
Let's go directly to Connell and get the numbers.

MCSHANE: Yes, just coming across here, Alexis, and let's see what we actually got on the retail sales figure for the month. Down by 0.4 percent. Again, as you said, it was supposed to be unchanged, but it wasn't. It was down. Down by 0.4 percent. So down again this month.

When you exclude autos, which they do, you get a separate number here excluding the automobiles, you're down by half a percent. So down 0.5 percent when you take out autos.

Now the consensus there was for a gain. So down 0.5 on the autos. And, again, down on the headline when we were expecting a flat number to be reported there.
Now let's get to the import/export prices here, Alexis, as well, before we get back to you.

Import prices up by 1.6 percent. That is more than expected. The consensus was for a .4 percent gain there. Export prices up by a half a percent, .5 percent. The consensus was for a drop of .2 percent.

So what we saw, really, with the import/export prices is, in April, the petroleum part of the component of this on the import side went up by 15 percent plus, by 15.4 percent on petroleum prices, and that's the largest monthly increase in petroleum prices going back to March of 2002. But again -- so that's the monthly number. Now yearly, year-over-year in April, you had import prices with a record 16 percent decline, and export prices down by 6.8 percent.
So, again, a quick recap here.

Retail sales came out instead of being flat. We're down .4 percent in the month, Alexis. And once you exclude autos, we were also down, and down by more than we expected to be.
Now, futures, we're dropping more here than we were. We were down 80 points on the Dow futures just as
Alexis came up to me to give these numbers. Now we're down 129.
We were down 10 on the S&P futures, now we're down 15. And we were already down 16-plus on the
Nasdaq futures, and now we're down almost 24.

So you're looking at pretty big declines across the board here, 1.5 or more percent for a market that earlier today was looking, if anything, higher, and has now turned decidedly lower, thanks in large part, it looks like, to this economic data which is just out, Alexis.
Back down to you.
GLICK: All right, Connell. Thanks so much for breaking down the numbers.

Craig Johnson is the president of Customer Growth Partners. He's joining me to break it all down very specifically. And Charles Payne is here, of course, our contributor.
Page 49 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for being here.

All right. Craig, these are disappointing numbers. The market is definitely reflecting it. We thought we were starting to see perhaps a little bit of signs of life with some of those same-store sales numbers, some of the chain store numbers.
It doesn't look that way.

CRAIG JOHNSON, PRESIDENT, CUSTOMER GROWTH PARTNERS: Well, we have not been seeing it at all. The only kind of strength at all is in the consumables, the food and consumables.

We like to hone in on the discretionary categories -- apparel, home improvement, home furnishings, appliance, electronics. And those numbers continue down, and not just down, down at multiyear levels down. It's simply extraordinary, the ratcheting back in consumer demand we've seen.
GLICK: OK.

Now, some of this, Charles, could be a good thing for the savings rate in this country, something that we've seen, at least it's been ticking up. We had a negative savings rate at this time a year ago. Now it's about
4.5 percent, but this is a sign here that the consumer is not back.

PAYNE: Absolutely. And you have to wonder, how could we even believe that the consumer could be back?

I mean, so many economists are coming out and saying this, I don't see how 600,000 people every month could lose their jobs and we think that we've turned the corner, no matter how backward looking you think the number is. You know, and this number just sort of reflects that.

But to your point, if Americans are to reboot, they do need to save. And that means we have to go sideways or have to have these sort of numbers for a long period of time. And I think that's the problem.

The administration wants us to go spend. Obviously Wall Street wants us to go spend. But what might be better for us is that we save a little bit of money and rebuild our balance sheets.

GLICK: It's interesting. I'm going to talk to Jack Bogle about this in a little while, and this topic makes him crazy, because we're just telling people to go out and re-spend their way out of the recession.
I also want to bring in, guys, Joseph Brusuelas. He's with us as well. He's the director of
MoodysEconomy.com.

And Joseph, the numbers are probably not that big a surprise, but it's one more indication, perhaps, that all this talk about these bloody green shoots, which the whole world drives me nuts, may be dying down a little bit because perhaps things aren't improving as quickly as everybody would like them to.

JOSEPH BRUSUELAS, DIRECTOR, MOODYSECONOMY.COM: Well, the numbers were a clear disappointment this morning. We thought we would have seen the increase on the Easter holiday, and the increase in tax rebates that we've seen through April, which were more than double what they were last year, feed through into retail sales.

Without a doubt, the consumer is still stressed. And I do think that the consumers are still in the process of trying to evaluate where they're at individually. Those job losses that we see certainly are abating, but I would imagine for the median consumer, they're a little more than a little frightening.

GLICK: You know, Craig, I want to go back to something about the import/export prices, where we saw the monthly gain in petroleum prices up 15.4 percent. This is something you've been very concerned about. You talked a lot about it last year, because this is what many would assume has been a tax relief for consumers, and it's now becoming a tax hike on consumers.
What could this do to the continued retail sales picture?

JOHNSON: Well, this is not going to help. Clearly, gas prices are hugely lower than they were a year ago. They're about $2.20 or so now. But I was driving back and forth to D.C. over the last couple of days. In the space of one day down and one day back, up a dime.

We've seen the fastest increase of about 18 to 20 percent over the last week, an increase in gas prices, faster even than the run-up last year. It's simply exceptional.

So that comes in on top of the existing weakness in terms of job losses Charles was talking about. This is not going to help.

Page 50 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: So who is doing well? I mean, we've talked a lot here on this show about the Family Dollars, the
Wal-Marts. Who is working in this economy?

JOHNSON: Well, there are still retailers that are working. Smart retailers can even make money in a down economy. And so the folks that are working on the consumable side, the food side -- so you mentioned
Wal-Mart. BJ's is still very strong.

The deep discount, the dollar stores, the Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Trees, are all well. And the discounters on the off-price side, the Ross's, the TJXs, are doing well. Consumers (ph) flow, there is a continued flight to value. That has not let up.

GLICK: Joseph, you look at this economic data all the time. What is the next piece of data that you are most concerned about?

BRUSUELAS: Well, we're going to be looking at the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index to be released later this week. We think that we're going to see further signs in deterioration in pricing pressure.
If anything, that increase in import prices is somewhat welcome. Let me make the case here.

Because of the slack in the economy, we're going to see prices continue to deteriorate. We expect to see core CPI well under one percent at the end of this year. That will not give much comfort to the Federal Reserve, which is still on guard against a breakout of deflation.

This is why the integration of fiscal and monetary policy needs to proceed. And indeed, the Fed may want to consider upping its purchase of treasuries later this year to effectively keep control of the yield curve.

I'm sure to some of your consumers this seems counterintuitive. Even though we're seeing some stabilization in the economy, some firming in demand, this number notwithstanding, and some firming in housing starts, things are not where they need to be. And we're going to need support from the federal government for a certain amount of time going forward.
GLICK: All right, guys. I hate to do this. I have to leave it here.

I'd love to continue the conversation with you guys, but Jack Bogle is waiting and I want to get his thoughts on this as well.
Charles, Craig, Joseph -- Gentlemen, thank you very much.

Coming up, as I mentioned, Jack Bogle is going to be joining us. Also, we're going to go inside the failure of Bear Stearns. You won't believe some of the details.
That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: How would you prevent a future financial crisis similar to the one we're in now? The National Constitution Center in Philadelphia is looking to tackle that topic today with an event scrutinizing the social, cultural and moral causes of this current recession.

Our next guest will deliver the lecture at the event. Jack Bogle is the chairman emeritus of the National Constitution Center. He's also the founder of The Vanguard Group and the president of Bogle Financial Markets Research.
All right, Jack. Great to see you. There's so much to talk about, I don't even know where to begin. So what is...
JACK BOGLE, PRESIDENT, BOGLE FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH: This is a busy world, Alexis.

GLICK: It is. I mean, what is the root cause? When you're talking about the social, the moral implications of this financial crisis, what were they?

BOGLE: Well, let me start out with them, my kind of subtitle for nice (ph) lecture, and that is that it's the headline of a "Wall Street Journal" op- ed I did a few weeks ago. And that is, I called it "A Crisis of Ethic Proportions." And the substitution of the word "epic" or "a crisis of epic proportions," what you would normally say, was intentional. And that is we've seen a big deterioration in our business standards, and a lot of professions, perfectly good professions, have become businesses, concerned only with the bottom line.


Page 51 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We have this bottom line society, as I'll say in my remarks tonight, in which we worship money over achievements, charisma over character, the ephemeral over the enduring. And I even have the temerity to say man (ph) over God. And those aren't necessarily good things for our society at all.

GLICK: All right. So you and I have talked about this. As a matter of fact, we talked about that op-ed piece just a couple weeks ago. And you talked about some of the issues surrounding perhaps the mutual fund business. They're all owned by financial institutions. At the end of the day, were we really doing what is best for the individual consumer?

You see what this administration is doing on so many different fronts. Do you feel we're moving in the right direction, or are we making some very calculated mistakes?

BOGLE: Well, I don't think anybody is making calculated mistakes. I think we have a -- whether we like it or not -- and I don't like much to have to do it, but the whole stimulus program and the staggering debt it's going to bring upon us, all of which carries interest -- if there was no interest on the debt, we'd be in good shape. That's not the way the world works.

And so that has to be done, this Wall Street that has ruined life for Main Street, and it has to be bailed out by Main Street. And that seems to me pretty grotesquely inequitable. So that has to be done.

It's also clear -- there is no point in ducking it -- that this administration has its own social agenda. They want to improve health care. They want to improve education. They want to deal with the environment.

Those things ultimately have to be done, and I think really the only issue is, can we afford to plunge into them at this rate, this quickly? It would be nice if money were free, but it's not.

GLICK: You know, one of the things you and I have talked about here is the savings rate in this country. And what we're kind of suggesting to people right now is the way to cure the recession is to go out there and spend. Let's provide more access to credit, even though leverage is what kind of got us into this mess in the first place.
Where does the savings rate in this country need to get to? How do we change the way we consume? BOGLE: Well, there has to be a cutback in consumption. You know, it's what John Maynard Keynes, the
great British economist, called the paradox of thrift. And that is, each of us individually, as families or
individuals, should be saving more. But for our society, it would be better if we all spent more. But that's not
going to happen.

We're going to look after our own. We can't let our own financial situation, our own house, if you will, collapse under the weight of too much debt.

And I think there's a lot of bad news on debt still to come. The mortgage crisis is nowhere near over. We're now seeing very difficult signs of credit card defaults chronicled in the press these last few days.

So people are going to have to save more, even if it comes to only paying off the debt that they have, and that has to be done first before you can actually save. And those savings figures are a little worrisome, the way they do the data, because I believe it's true if you payoff a debt, you're saving. And there is certainly no truth to that, but you're not putting anything aside.

GLICK: Just finally, Jack, before we go here, you know, you're going to look forward. You're going to talk about some of the cures to this financial crisis.

If you were to sit down with the president right now and say one, two, three, top three priorities, what are they?

BOGLE: Well, I think we have to tackle the current issues first, the issues I've just discussed. But in the long run, for me, by far the highest priority, which I've talked about, is to straighten out our financial market system and the behavior of our money managers.

We have gone from a culture focused on investment and owning business to a culture focused on speculation and trading stocks because of prices. Prices go up and down, and we trade back and forth with each other, creating no value at all except for the croupiers in the middle.

That's where all those green shoots are, Alexis. They're all on Wall Street in the brokerage and investment banking. They're still making a lot of money there.
GLICK: They are.


Page 52 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BOGLE: So I'd say we need a federal statute that says money managers have a fiduciary duty to represent those that they -- those whose money they're running -- mutual fund managers, pension fund trustees. And if we do that, we will then get these managers who own 75 percent of the stock in America to make sure those corporations we own -- they're also fiduciaries, corporate officers -- are run in the interest of their shareholders. And that is our ultimate shareholders. So that's kind of the whole loop, if you will, which goes from the money managers' behavior influencing the corporate behavior, and finally bringing some sense and some profits to the American man on the street and woman on the street.
GLICK: Jack Bogle, as always, wonderful having you on the show.

My father reminded me when I went on Wall Street, don't forget every day, when they're trading those hundreds of billions of dollars, you're doing it for your grandparents, your parents, your friends, and sometimes we seem to forget that.
Jack, thanks so much for being here. BOGLE: Good to be with you, Alexis. GLICK: All right.
Well, now something very juicy. A new book is offering an inside look at the final hours of former financial titan Bear Stearns, how executives led the firm to its death bed.

"Street Fighters: The last 72 Hours of Bear Stearns" looks into the firm's final three days, which show its stock opened $30 to $2. But Bear was actually sold to JPMorgan Chase, which analysts say began this current financial crisis.

Kate Kelly is the author of this book, "Street Fighters," and a Wall Street journal reporter who covers the financial industry. We've known each other for a very long time throughout this.
Kate, great to see you.
KATE KELLY, AUTHOR, "STREET FIGHTERS": Great to see you. GLICK: What a terrific book.
KELLY: Oh, thanks.
GLICK: This is so tantalizing, so interesting, very sad.

Walk us through. What were you most shocked about? You've been covering this industry for a very long time. What surprised you the most?

KELLY: You know, it was surprising how fast the bank run took off on Bear Stearns. I mean, they were literally OK on a Monday, out of cash on the following Thursday. And the way the market rumor mongering and stock drops and the rise in the cost of credit default swaps, or insurance against them defaulting on their debts, kind of spun out of control in a matter of days was shocking. And they were shocked by it.
(CROSSTALK)

GLICK: You know, you talk in the book about how they had $3 billion, and they didn't even know that they only had $3 billion left of cash. And we knew the credit default swap markets were going ballistic. They were going crazy.

What went down? I mean, what was the management team doing that they didn't realize this was happening?

KELLY: What was happening, I think, that they could not predict was that hedge fund clients and other folks that had money in their prime brokerage were pulling out billions of dollars out throughout that week at an alarming week. Bear basically had to front them the money to get their money back to them.

The SEC, because of somewhat arcane rules in this area, locks up that money for a period of time. So they couldn't get it back right away. It was hard to get a clear reckoning.
GLICK: They couldn't see that it was happening. KELLY: Yes. Yes.
GLICK: It's interesting, because they went to their prime broker, which is JPMorgan, and they had some conversations with Jamie Dimon, hoping that he would rescue them. He was a little bit cautious.
Page 53 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Tell us about the conversations that went on and why the Fed ultimately had to get involved.

KELLY: Sure. So, you've got Thursday night, 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., Jamie Dimon is out celebrating his birthday with family. He gets a call from Bear's CEO, Alan Schwartz, saying we need some help. And at the time, Schwartz was thinking maybe a $25 billion loan facility could be extended overnight, because even he knows it's crazy to think of buying a company overnight.

Jamie says, I'll try to help. I mean, there could be a good opportunity here, but I can't do due diligence in five hours.

So he sends a guy over to Bear Stearns at midnight, literally, one of his senior traders, and the guy takes one look and says, you're -- I won't say it on the air. You know, I need to call the Fed because we're going to need federal assistance here. And that is what happened. The Fed stepped in with emergency funding.

GLICK: A lot of people want to know what Geithner's level of involvement in this was, and what it is that Paulson did in terms of orchestrating the beginning of what many people say this was the best example for why the regulatory system was not functioning, what he said to the president. Walk me through some of those conversations.

KELLY: Sure. I mean, Geithner's involvement was very, very deep. And this was a guy who was sort of reviving the role that the New York Fed played during the long-term capital management crisis in 1998, when they tried to get Wall Street players together to create a solution.

In this case, the Wall Street players needed a big assist from the federal government. So he was talking constantly to Jamie Dimon, talking with Alan Schwartz and others, talking to Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, posting him, as well as Hank Paulson. And they were trying to figure out what could be done,
preferably some sort of purchase with another industry player. But in the end, the Fed had to step in Friday with emergency funding, and on a Sunday with a guarantee of Bear's debts.

Paulson, coming from Goldman Sachs, has a strong view about risk management, thinks that Bear has totally dropped the ball on this and is angry about it. And thinks also that there is a real moral hazard issue here in which you don't want to send the message that the government will bail you out even if you don't manage your company well.

So, for that reason, he's thinking the price of this deal has to be extremely low. "Something nominal," were his words.

I think he was thinking a dollar, $2. And initially it was $2. The shareholders rejected it, as you remember, and it ended up at $10.

GLICK: Yes. You know, it's interesting, because when you see what happened on the collapse of that weekend and the backstory there, Goldman Sachs, apparently, something you talk about in the book, knew something was wrong at Bear Stearns well before anybody else. And yet, there were conversations there.

What was the blood? Was it about bad blood between Bear and Goldman? Why did Goldman want in? What's the story there?

KELLY: A couple of interesting issues here. I mean, to be fair to Goldman, I think a lot of people in the marketplace sensed Bear's vulnerability.
GLICK: The options markets were crazy. (CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Absolutely. I'm not suggesting that they got an inside tip, but they acted early, and they called on a
Thursday afternoon and said, gee, we know you're in trouble. Is there anything on your books that we
could help take off your hands to create some quick cash?
Bear, at that time, I don't think even knew the depth of their problem. So that was the first overture.

Then you've got a situation where the markets -- the wagons are circling, other firms are getting wind of what is going on. And Goldman still at the Vanguard, you know, trying to get in, thinking maybe we'll buy Bear, maybe we'll work with J.C. Flowers, the private equity firm, to do something for Bear.

And I think for some of the Bear guys, it was uncomfortable, because some of the senior people at Goldman that were coming over were Bear alums. So imagine the awkwardness of your former colleague coming over to say, gee, I know you guys are in distress, maybe we could buy you.
GLICK: Yes, let me rescue you. Yes.

You know, look, Kate, you have covered a lot of stories in the industry, as I said, for a very long time. I just want to get your thought aside from the Bear Stearns situation right now.

The things that are happening with Geithner, with the Federal Reserve Bank in terms of regulatory oversight, changes of that nature, are they doing the right things right now to reguide the street in the right direction? I mean, you're close to this situation. How do you feel about it?

KELLY: I think they're just on the precipice of creating a new model or even thinking about what that should be. I mean, they've been so busy putting out fires for the last year or so, that only now are they starting to think about the future and what kind of model should be in place.

Of course, there are no investment banks anymore; right? They're all under Federal Reserve Board regulation. So the Fed does have an opportunity here to sort of shape policy.

It's hard to say how things are going to go. They're under a lot of heat from a lot of directions -- obviously taxpayers. Congress is saying that the Fed itself needs better oversight, let alone the Street. Geithner and Obama are trying to push the PPIP, the Public Private Investment Partnership which is up to a very slow start.
GLICK: Yes.

KELLY: So I think it's a little early to say, but there needs to be some decisions made here about what our view as a country is about how regulated these entities should be. And, of course, times of turmoil are the time to change policy, because you don't have the mandate when things are going well.
So it will be interesting to see. I think it's a little early to handicap how it ought to go. GLICK: It's going to keep you very busy...
KELLY: Yes.
GLICK: ... until you have the baby that is right now sitting in there. (LAUGHTER)
GLICK: All right, Kate. Well, congratulations. It's a great book. I love seeing you. KELLY: Thank you.
GLICK: And what a story this is. Wow. KELLY: Thank you.
GLICK: "Street Fighters," by the way, I want to remind everybody, "The Last 72 Hours of Bear Stearns, the
Toughest Firm on Wall Street."
I worked there. I know it was tough.
All right. Coming up, "The One Thing You Should Know." Stay with us. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: All right, guys. "The One Thing You Should Know" is the markets are taking it on the chin this morning after some disappointing retail sales figures. We're going to get into that on "THE OPENING BELL," next. Markets down 1.5 to two percent across the board.
Stay with us.

HD         Otellini: Intel takes "strong exception" to Commission decision

Intel's chief executive believes the decision that led to its €1bn  fine is "wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive marketplace"

Here is the statement by Paul Otellini, chief executive of  Intel, about the  European Commission's largest-ever fine imposed on the company earlier today:

TD
"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace – characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal."

"We do not believe our practices violated European law. The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not. The Directorate General for  Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision. We believe this evidence shows that when companies perform well the market rewards them, when they don't perform the market acts accordingly."

"Intel never sells products below cost. We have however, consistently invested in innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology. The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers everywhere the
efficiencies of being the world's leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors."

"Despite our strongly held views, as we go through the appeals process we plan to work with the Commission to ensure we're in compliance with their decision. Finally, there should be no doubt whatsoever that  Intel will continue to invest in the products and technologies that provide Europe and the rest of the world the industry's best performing processors at lower prices."

HD       EU fines Intel record Eur1 billion in new antitrust battle

Brussels (AFP)--13May2009/812 am EDT/1212 GMT

EU antitrust regulators fined Intel a record Eur1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday, claiming it uses its stranglehold on the microchip market to crush its main rival illegally.

TD
The company hit back promising to fight the ruling with an appeal in EU courts, raising the specter of a new antitrust saga between Brussels and a US technology giant after Microsoft's years of European legal battles.

The European Commission, Europe's top  competition watchdog, accused  Intel of using illegal loyalty rebates to squeeze rivals out of the market for computer processing units--the brains inside personal computers.

The Santa Clara, California-based company dominates the Eur 22 billion market for so-called x86 CPUs with a 70% share during the more than five years it was accused of breaking EU  antitrust rules.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," she added. The commission said that  Intel had used wholly or partially hidden rebates to get PC makers such as
Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC to buy all or almost all their CPU supply from  Intel instead of rival
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

"Naturally, the Commission favors strong, vigorous price  competition, including by dominant firms," Kroes told journalists in Brussels.

"However,  Intel went beyond normal price  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers on the condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their CPUs from  Intel." EU  antitrust regulators also accused Intel of paying computer manufacturers to halt or put off the launch of products containing microchips competing with  Intel's x86.

In addition,  Intel allegedly paid a major electronic retailer,chain store MediaMarkt, to stock computers with its chips.
The commission ordered  Intel to cease any of the ongoing practices that it deemed to break EU rules.

Intel did not hesitate to contest the commission's ruling.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace,"  Intel president and chief executive Paul Otellini said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

Intel's fine topped the previous record Eur899 million Microsoft was ordered to pay last year for failing to cooperate with the  European Commission in its antitrust battles with the US software giant.

Page 58 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, Microsoft has accumulated a total  fines of Eur1.676 billion in  fines and its antitrust struggle with Brussels is still ongoing.

EU regulators have been investigating  Intel since it received complaints from AMD back in 2000 and filed formal  antitrust charges against the company in July 2007 and then again in July 2008.

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said AMD president for Europe, Middle East and Africa Giuliano Meroni.

The commission fines could be only the beginning of  Intel's woes, with the BEUC European consumer-protection association calling for a class action suit against the company to seek compensation.
"For BEUC,  Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices," its director general
Monique Goyens said.
"Consumers have been paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated."

The European Commission fined Intel E 1.06bn ($1.45bn) after finding that the US chip company used anticompetitive tactics against smaller rival AMD. The Commission stated Intel’s threat to withdraw rebates for large manufacturers if they used AMD chips was an abuse of monopoly power, as was Intel’s practice of paying manufacturers to delay the launch of computers using its rival’s chips. Intel was ordered to stop these practices.  Intel claims the rebate agreements were non-exclusive and the discounts did not result in the company selling its chips at below cost.

Intel will challenge the decision at the European Union’s Court of First Instance.

HD         More utility than Borg

Monopolies may be vilified in the popular imagination, but there are few businesses that don’t want one. So the European Commission’s finding that US chipmaker  Intel acted in an anticompetitive manner – and the E1bn fine it levied for doing so – might appear an acceptable cost of business to some shareholders. But that assumes Intel can fully reap the benefits of its quasi-monopoly. Trouble is,  Intel isn’t growing much, and increasing antitrust scrutiny is likely to become a bigger headache.

Intel sells about 80% of all microprocessors. But its revenues have expanded a mere 1% a year since
2000. This is partly because customers aren’t shelling out as much for new, faster chips. Problems
dissipating heat have placed a limit on individual chip speeds.  Intel has responded by putting multiple
microprocessors on a chip, but software that takes full advantage of this design is difficult to develop.
So customers see little reason to bother.

TD
Nonetheless,  Intel’s business is solidly profitable. Operating margins were 23% last year, which is attractive, but not atypical for the company – they were 31% in 2000, for example. The combination of mature revenues and static margins explains investors’ tepid view of  Intel’s stock. Its total return over the past 12 years is zero.
Now throw increasing regulatory scrutiny into the mix.  Intel is fighting accusations of monopolistic
abuse in multiple jurisdictions. The EU decision may increase the likelihood that others follow – and that
the new US administration, which has promised more vigorous enforcement, takes up the cause.

Preventing a company from acting in an anticompetitive manner is great for consumers. It isn’t for the company. If  Intel’s revenues and operating margins remain relatively stagnant, and regulators forbid it to throw its weight around,  Intel will begin to look more like a utility than a dynamic technology company.

The European Commission fined Intel E 1.06bn ($1.45bn) after finding that the US chip company used anticompetitive tactics against smaller rival AMD. The Commission stated Intel’s threat to withdraw rebates for large manufacturers if they used AMD chips was an abuse of monopoly power, as was Intel’s practice of paying manufacturers to delay the launch of computers using its rival’s chips.

EU Orders Intel to Change Business Practices
SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 13, 2009 -- Third Global  Antitrust Agency Condemns Intel's Anticompetitive
Conduct

The European Commission today found  Intel guilty of abusing its dominant position in the global x86 microprocessor market, saying that "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated." The Commission also stated that "there is evidence that  Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments." The EC decision requires Intel to change its business practices immediately and  fines Intel a record EUR 1.06 billion (US $1.45 billion).

"Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," said Dirk Meyer, AMD president and CEO. "AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers."

"After an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion -  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt," said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president for legal affairs. "With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation."
The EC decision stated specifically that:

-- "Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel."

-- "Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active."

-- Intel "interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.  Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products."

Intel has so far failed to convince any  antitrust enforcement agency that its business practices are lawful and pro-consumer.

In 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) issued a 26 billion won  fine (approximately $25.4 million USD) saying that  Intel's abuse of its dominant position included coercing and paying customers millions of dollars on the condition that they use only  Intel chips, delay launches of AMD products, and/or not develop any new products with AMD chips. The KFTC also found that, "South Korean consumers had to buy PCs at higher prices as domestic PC makers were forced to buy  Intel's pricier
Page 62 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CPU." In addition to a  fine, the KFTC ordered  Intel to stop the practice of offering payments to PC makers conditioned upon them not doing business with AMD.  Intel is in the process of appealing the ruling.
In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) ruled that  Intel had violated the country's
anti-monopoly laws by illegally forcing full or partial exclusivity with five Japanese PC makers.  Intel did
not appeal the ruling.

In the United States, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and New York Attorney General's office are investigating  Intel for abuse of its monopoly position. In 2005, AMD filed private litigation in the US District Court of Delaware, which is scheduled for trial in spring 2010.

The Associated Press reported that the European Union finedIntel Corporation EUR1.06 billion ($1.44 billion) on May 13, 2009, saying the computer chip maker used illegal sales tactics to shut out smaller rival AMD. The  European Commission says Intel broke EU competition law by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to keep AMD out of the market that limited customer choice. It is also ordering Intel to cease and desist some sales practices, but refused to say what those were.  Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini said  Intel would appeal to the EU courts because "the decision is wrong" and "there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers."  Intel promised to comply with the EU order but criticized it as extremely ambiguous. The EU says  Intel gave rebates to computer
manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for buying all or almost all their x86 computer processing units, or CPUs, from Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips. Regulators said Intel also paid Germany's electronics retailer, Media Saturn Holding, which owns the MediaMarkt superstores, from 2002 to 2007 to only stock  Intel-based computers.

Dow Jones reported that European Union  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is seeking to fineIntel  Corporation more than EUR1 billion ($1.36 billion) for breaking European  antitrust rules, Bloomberg News reported on its Web site, citing a person with direct knowledge of the case. The  fine, which would be a record, could be reduced, Bloomberg reported the person as saying. The fine could be changed because of its size and the nature of rebate-related  antitrust cases, it said. The European Commission is due to make the ruling known, Bloomberg said.

While you were sleeping: US retail sales drop, Wall St slides

May 14 – U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell last month, dampening optimism for an early economic recovery as the number of jobless Americans soars. Stocks on Wall Street fell and the dollar gained.

TD
Retail sales fell 0.4% in April, after a revised 1.3% decline in March, according to the Commerce
Department.

The U.S. dollar rose from a seven-week low against the euro and the yen gained against most major currencies as the weak retail sales spurred demand for the world&'s biggest currencies as a haven. The euro also fell as European Central Bank council member Marko Kranjec said the ECB may increase asset purchases to more than bonds.

The U.S. dollar rose to $1.3597 per euro from $1.3648 while weakening to 95.33 yen from 96.45. The yen gained to 129.6 per euro from 131.63.

Copper fell for the fourth day in a row as weaker equity markets and concern about a slower recovery drove down the price of the metal used to make pipes and wires.
Copper futures for July delivery edged down or 0.1% to US$2.086 a pound on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.

Crude oil also gave up its gain as Wall Street&'s slide outweighed U.S. government data showing a decline in stockpiles of oil and gasoline. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude inventories in America fell by 4.7 million barrels. Brent crude fell US$1.90 to US$56.91 a barrel. Crude fell 60 cents to US$58.25 a barrel.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast world demand for oil would be weaker than previously estimated this year.

Gold rose as stocks fell and investors sought the precious metal as a haven. Gold for June delivery climbed US$3.60 to US$927.50 an ounce in New York.
The Standard & Poor&'s 500 Index dropped 2.7% to 883.92, its third daily decline, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average slipped 2.2% to 8284.89. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3% to 1664.19.

Wal-Mart Stores declined 1.2% to US$50.03 after retail sales fell. Macy&'s Inc., the second-biggest U.S. department store, fell 6.7% to US$11.52 after reporting a wider first-quarter loss after cutting prices in response to a sales downturn. Walt Disney slipped 3% to US$23.60.

Bank of America tumbled 10% to US$11.01, leading the Dow lower, and Citigroup fell 6.8% to US$3.41. Aluminium producer Alco dropped 8.8% to US$8.63.

Chip-maker Intel fell 0.5% to US$15.13 after EU regulators fined the company a record 1.06 billion euros for antitrust violations. The  European Commission said Intel paid computer makers to hold off products using chips from rival AMD.

General Motors jumped 5.2% to US$1.21. GM and Chrysler may drop as many as 3,000 U.S. dealers as they slash costs, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the plans.
Centex Corp. fell 7.3% to US$9.38 after figures showed foreclosures rose to a record in April, with on in
374 households getting a default notice or having property seized, according to RealtyTrac Inc.

Industrial production in the Euro zone fell a greater-than-expected 2% in March to be 20.2% lower year-on-year, stoking concern the contraction in the region&'s economy may have been greater than expected in the first quarter. The annual decline was a record, according to the European Union's statistics office.

Stocks in Europe fell after the Bank of England said the U.K. economy was recovering only slowly and as the U.S. retail sales slide weighed on sentiment.

"The risks are weighted toward a relatively slow and protracted recovery," BOE Governor Mervyn King said in London.

ING Groep tumbled 10% after posting a quarterly loss. Land Securities Group fell 13% after the U.K.&'s biggest real estate investment trust posted a record full-year loss.

Rio Tinto shed 11% as metal prices fell and after a report in the U.K.&'s Telegraph newspaper said the mining company planned to raise capital.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 declined 2.7% to 200.72.
The U.K.&'s FTSE 100 fell 2.1% to 4331.37, Germany&'s DAX Index slipped 2.6% to 4727.61 and
France&'s CAC 40 shed 2.4% to 3152.90.

The European Union levied a record $1.45 billion  fine against chip giant  Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), saying the company used rebates to thwart  competition.

Intel responded to the decision, saying it takes strong exception and will appeal. The company's CEO, Paul Otellini, said, "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices."

TD
The European Commission said Intel broke rules by threatening to withdraw rebates to large computer manufacturers to pressure them to buy most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival AMD (NYSE: AMD).
The Intel fine is more than double the 497 million euro  fine handed to Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) in 2004.

The European Commission today found  Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) guilty of abusing its dominant position in the global x86 microprocessor market, saying that "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated." The Commission also stated that "there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments." The EC decision requires Intel to change its business practices immediately and  fines Intel a record EUR 1.06 billion (US $1.45 billion).

"Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," said Dirk Meyer, AMD (NYSE: AMD) president and CEO. "AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we
are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers."

TD
"After an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion -  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt," said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president for legal affairs. "With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel's monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation."
The EC decision stated specifically that:

"Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel."

"Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active."

Intel "interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD. Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products."Intel has so far failed to convince any  antitrust enforcement agency that its business practices are lawful and pro-consumer.

WASHINGTON, May 13 -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued the following news release:

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today raised concerns that the  European Commission's levy of a record setting  antitrust fine against Intel is part of a larger, troubling pattern.

TD
"Fines by the Commission have escalated in size in recent years, raising serious concerns about due process and the method for determining these huge  fines," said the Chamber Senior Vice President for International Affairs, Myron Brilliant.

The Chamber agrees with a growing number of Europeans calling for a serious evaluation of how the Commission ensures due process for companies under investigation in competition cases. The Chamber also agrees that a review of the methodology guiding the calculation of fines is warranted.
"Huge fines demand greater due process protections. The current EU guidelines for determining  fine
amounts are too vague," Brilliant added.

The Chamber and its Global Regulatory Cooperation Project advocate before  antitrust authorities around the world for enforcement decisions based on strong economic analysis, evidence of real harm to consumers, and due process in  antitrust investigations.

HD      TECH, FREE-MARKET GROUPS FEAR IMPLICATIONS OF EUROPEAN ANTITRUST RULING AGAINST INTEL

Technology industry groups and free-market advocates today raised concerns about the possible implications of the  European Commission’s finding that  Intel Corp. had violated  antitrust standards, worrying that the commission’s aggressive action could extend into other technology areas and potentially stymie innovation.

The European Commission today announced that it had imposed a  fine of 1.06 billion Euro (U.S. $1.44 billion) on Intel for violating EC Treaty  antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position. The commission found that  Intel, from October 2002 to December 2007, had engaged in illegal practices in the market for x86 central processing units (CPUs), including giving “wholly or partially hidden rebates” to retailers if they stocked only computers with  Intel’s CPUs and making direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors’ CPUs.

TD
The European Commission’s “efforts to manipulate  competition in the technology industry without identifying actual consumer harm are worrying,” said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology (ACT), which represents small and midsize technology companies. “Innovation and competition are thriving throughout the industry, and even the most successful firms must continue innovating and competing on price or risk being toppled.”

Mr. Zuck predicted that an  antitrust case against Intel would be tougher in the United States, even with the Obama administration’s Department of Justice expected to take a more aggressive stance than the Bush administration had in recent years. The difference between the U.S. and the EU is that “U.S. competition agencies will demand proof of actual consumer harm,” he said.

As U.S. policy-makers review the EC decision, they should “think carefully before adopting a  competition policy that handicaps the very companies that are the key to sustaining this country’s long-term economic health,” said Progress & Freedom Foundation President Kenneth Ferree. “Decisions like this do nothing
to illuminate the path to a vibrant and growing economy, but rather obscure it.”

Wayne Crews, vice president-policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the EU “should not rejoice at this seeming triumph over American big business.” Instead, European policy-makers should “ponder if its policies actually make Europe hospitable for innovation,” he said. “Reforms are needed if Europe really wants to sustain a competitive, knowledge-based economy, and not merely the most regulated one. Imposing billions of dollars of  fines on the most conspicuous wealth creators is not the way to go.” - Brian Hammond, brian.hammond@wolterskluwer.com

Computer chipmaker Intel has been fined a record 1.06bn euros ($1.45bn; £948m) by the  European       Commission for anti-competitive practices,  BBC reported. It dwarfs the 497m euro  fine levied on
Microsoft in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position. The Commission found that between 2002 and
2007, Intel had paid manufacturers and a retailer to favour its chips over those of Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD).  Intel has announced that it will appeal against the verdict. "Intel takes exception to this
decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor
market,"  Intel chief executive Paul Otellini said. "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.
Intel will appeal," he added. The investigation followed complaints by AMD in 2000, 2003 and 2006. The
Commission said that Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC had been given hidden rebates if they only used
Intel chips.

TD
It also found that Media Saturn, which owns Europe's biggest consumer electronics retailer Media Markt, had been given money so that it would only sell computers containing  Intel chips. "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules cannot be tolerated." Last year,  Intel made 80.5% of the microprocessors in PCs, while AMD made 12% of them. The Commission has also ordered  Intel "to
cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing". In addition to providing rebates to manufacturers that bought almost entirely  Intel products, the Commission found that the chipmaker had paid them to postpone or cancel the launch of specific products based on AMD chips. Ms Kroes joked in her own news conference that  Intel would now have to change its latest advertising slogan from "sponsors of tomorrow" to "the sponsor of the European taxpayer". Both  Intel and AMD are based in California.  Intel has 83,900 staff worldwide and has a market value of $85.4bn. AMD employs about
11,000 people and has a market value of $2.6bn. "Despite its strong defence, Intel is facing a wall of regulatory resistance to its business practices around the world, with antitrust infringement decisions against it now in Japan, Korea, and the EU, while the US authorities are investigating  Intel as well," said David Anderson, a lawyer at Berwin Leighton Paisner. "It is a major decision that shows the Commission is serious about curtailing abusive behaviour of dominant companies, especially in the high-tech sector."

HD      Intel fined a record €1.06bn in EU anti-trust case

Chip giant charged with harming innovation,  competition and consumers

The European Commission (EC) has finedIntel €1.06bn (£948m) for breaking European anti-trust regulations, marking the largest  fine the body has issued in European history.

TD
Intel was found guilty of giving rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their x86 chips from  Intel, rather than chips offered by competitors such as AMD.

The x86 chips are a key hardware component of every computer, and  Intel holds at least 70 per cent of the market, according to the EC.

Intel was also charged with paying computer manufacturers, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC, to delay products that contained AMD's x86 chips, and to limit the sales channels available to these products.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated," said EU  competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Intel chief executive Paul Otellini said in a  statement that the company will appeal against the verdict because "the decision is wrong " and  Intel's own evidence had not been properly examined. He argued that the EC had ignored the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor market.

"The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that, when one company wins sales, the other does not," he said.

Intel was found guilty of abusing  EC Treaty anti-trust rule Article 82, which relates to companies that hold dominant market positions.
The fine was calculated on the basis of the value of  Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic
Area and the duration of the infringement, which was found to be just over five years.

The fine tops the $1.6bn (£1bn) levied against Microsoft for anti-trust offences five years ago. However, the EC could have  fined Intel as much as 10 per cent of its annual revenue, which would have been about £2.5bn.

Otellini said that, as the company begins its appeal process, it would work with the EC to ensure compliance with its decision, which was the end result of a complaint filed by AMD to the European Union in 2007.

"The decision finds that  Intel's practices did not constitute  competition on the merits of the respective Intel and AMD products, but rather were part of a strategy designed to exploit  Intel's existing entrenched position in the market, " said a report published by the EC today.

In response, Bruce Sewell,  Intel's senior vice president and general counsel, said: "The basic allegation against Intel is that it used lower prices, in the form of rebates, to prevent customers from buying or supporting AMD, or to punish customers when they did so.

"Such claims are false.  Intel has never required a customer to agree not to buy from AMD in order to obtain a discount, nor raised a customer's prices when it decided to buy from AMD.

"Intel believes that consumers benefit from lower prices. Regulations should not prevent one company, no matter how large that company is, from offering discounts or providing incentives."

BRUSSELS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission (EC) said here on Wednesday that it had
finedIntel Corp. a record 1.06 billion euros (1.44 billion U.S. dollars) for illegally blocking  competition
in the microchip market.

The EC, the executive arm of the European Union said that the world's biggest computer chip maker used illegal sales tactics to squeeze rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) out of market.

TD
The fine was much higher than the 899-million-euro  fine the EC gave to Microsoft Corp. last year in
monopoly case.

The Commission said that the U.S. chip maker  Intel violated the EU  competition rule by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to keep AMD out of the market.

It said the  Intel Corp. blocked legal  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for purchasing their x86 computer processing units, or CPUs, from  Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

Besides, it said that Intel paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer Media Saturn Holding from 2002 to 2007 to only stock Intel-based computers, leaving workers at AMD's biggest European plant in Dresden unable to buy AMD-based personal computers in their own city store.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," he said. Enditem

Intel was obeying.

The fine on the chipmaker was based on the value of its illegal chip sales over the past five years and three months in Europe, the EC said.

Intel began to give rebates to computer manufacturers and retailers in 2002 and most ended in 2005, said the commission.

BRUSSELS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission finedIntel Corp. a record 1.06 billion euros (1.44 billion U.S. dollars) on Wednesday, saying the world's biggest chip maker illegally blocked out smaller rivals.
The fine exceeded a 899-million euro (1,220-million-U.S. dollar)  monopoly abuse penalty for Microsoft
Corp. last year.  Intel called the decision wrong and said it would appeal.

TD
The Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said that  Intel used used illegal sales tactics to squeeze rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. out of the market.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has about 80 percent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market and faces just one real rival, AMD.

The Commission said the U.S. chip maker violated EU  competition rules by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to shut out AMD.

Intel was accused of blocking legal  competition by giving rebates to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for purchasing all or almost all of their x86 computer processing units from the chip maker and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

Intel also paid Media Saturn Holding, Germany's biggest electronics retailer, to only stock computers that used its chips.

This meant workers at AMD's biggest European plant in Dresden, Germany, could not buy AMD-based personal computers at their city's main PC store.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."
EU regulators said the  fine was calculated on the value of  Intel's
European chip sales over the five years and three months that it broke the law. Enditem

BRUSSELS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros (1.44 billion
U.S. dollars) on Wednesday for its abuse of its dominant position in the computer chip market.

It was the biggest anti-trust fine imposed by the Commission on a single company. The following are a list of major EU antitrust fines in recent years.

TD
December 2001, the Commission  fined eight companies, including Swiss-based company Hoffman-La Roche, a total of 855.22 million euros (1163 million dollars) for participating in eight distinct secret market-sharing and price-fixing cartels affecting vitamin products. The  fines were later reduced to 790 million euros (1074.4 million dollars) by a EU court.

March 2004, the Commission  finedMicrosoft 497 million euros (675.92 million dollars) for  abuse of its dominant position in the market of computer operating systems. The U.S. software giant was again hit by the Commission with a  fine of 280 million euros (380.8 million dollars) in July 2006 and 899 million euros (1,220 million dollars) in February 2008 for its continued non-compliance with the Commission's ruling that ordered Microsoft to cease illegal practices.

May 2006, the Commission  fined nine companies, including Akzo Nobel, a total of 388.128 million euros (527.85 million dollars) for participating in cartels fixing prices in the hydrogen peroxide and perborate markets.

May 2006, the Commission imposed  fines of 344.5 million euros (468.52 million dollars) on five producers of acrylic glass for price fixing.

November 2006, the Commission  fined five groups of companies, including Bayer, Shell and Dow, a total of 519 million euros (705.84 million dollars) for participating in a cartel to fix prices and share customers for certain types of synthetic rubber.

January 2007, the Commission  fined eleven groups of companies, including Siemens and Toshiba, a total of more than 750 million euros (1,020 million dollars) for participating in a cartel for gas insulated switchgear projects.

February 2007, the Commission  fined the Otis, KONE, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp groups 992 million euros (1,349.12 million dollars) for operating cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
April 2007, the Commission  fined the Dutch brewers Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria a total of more than
273 million euros (371.28 million dollars) for operating a cartel on the beer market in the Netherlands.

September 2007, the Commission  fined YKK of Japan and six others a total of 328 million euros (446.08 million dollars) for operating cartels on the markets for fasteners and attaching machines in Europe and worldwide.

November 2007, the Commission imposed  fines, totaling nearly 487 million euros (662.32 million dollars), on Saint-Gobain of France and three others for coordinating price increases and other commercial conditions for deliveries of flat glass.

HD          Intel: EU antitrust ruling  is "wrong" BY         maolei

SAN FRANCISCO, May 13 (Xinhua) --  Intel Corp. on Wednesday rejected a European Commission (EC) ruling of imposing heavy  fines on the world's largest computer chip maker for antitrust violations, saying the EC decision is "wrong" and the company will appeal.

TD
The European Commission Wednesday fined Intel 1.06 billion euros (1.45 billion U.S. dollars) for violating European antitrust rules and also ordered Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately.

In a statement issued after the ruling, Intel's chief executive officer (CEO) Paul Otellini said the company "takes strong exception" to European Commission's decision.

"We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace -- characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices, " Otellini said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal." he added.

The European Commission said it has found that  Intel engaged in specific forms of illegal practices such as giving rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all or almost all of their chips from Intel.

Intel CEO Otellini defended the company's practices, insisting that "Intel never sells products below cost."

He said Intel has consistently invested in innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology.

"The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers everywhere the efficiencies of being the world's leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors," Otellini said.

The European Commission ruling was welcomed by Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which had filed antitrust complaints against  Intel in Europe and in the United States.

"Today's ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market," Dirk Meyer, AMD's chief executive officer, said in a statement.

"AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Meyer noted.

HD       Brussels fines Intel record €1bn

The European Commission imposed a record €1.06bn ($1.45bn)  fine on chipmaker Intel on
Wednesday and ordered it halt illegal rebates and other practices to squeeze out rival AMD.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," European Union  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

TD
The Ms Kroes said US-based  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely Intel chips, and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
It ordered  Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing".

Intel may continue to offer rebates, so long as they are legal, the commission said.

The EU antitrust fine is the biggest imposed on an individual company, exceeding an €896m penalty last year against glassmaker Saint-Gobain for price-fixing, and a €497m  fine in 2004 on Microsoft for abuse of dominance.

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, was on Wednesday handed a record  fine of €1.06bn ($1.45bn) by the European Union for abusing its dominant market position and using illegal sales practices to encourage manufacturers to use its microprocessor chips.

It is one of the biggest  fines to be levied by Brussels, and tops the penalties given to Microsoft, which in total exceeded €1bn, and the €896m  fine last year against glass maker Saint-Gobain for price-fixing.

However, it is short of the maximum  fine the European Commission could have levied.  Fines can be set at up to 10 per cent of a company's annual global turnover. Given that  Intel made $37.6bn in 2008, the penalty could have been close to $4bn.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said Neelie Kroes, European Union  Competition Commissioner.

"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of consumers…the size of the  fine should come as no surprise," she added

Ms Kroes ordered Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing."

Intel said it would appeal against the ruling. Paul Otellini, chief executive, said: "Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices."

The Intel case goes back to 2000, when rival Advanced Micro Devices filed a complaint that it was being driven out of the market by unfair marketing practices by  Intel.

Page 85 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel was accused of offering illegal rebates to computer manufacturers if they shut AMD out of the market.

Intel was formally charged after a series of raids in 2007. Last year, the case was broadened, with the European Commission accusing Intel of using rebates to persuade a leading European retailer to sell only Intel-based personal computers.

The case centres on the market for x86 computer processing units. In its initial statement of objections, the commission identified a series of what it sad were illegal practices at  Intel, ranging from conditional rebates for original equipment manufacturers that required them to obtain all or most of their microprocessor needs from Intel, to below-cost pricing in bids against AMD-based products for strategic customers.

Intel has consistently denied behaving illegally. "Our business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and good for consumers," it said.
Most lawyers had expected  Intel to appeal. "Timing and costs will be an issue for any company
launching an appeal but can be worth the wait if there is an important legal principle at stake," says John
Pheasant, at Hogan & Hartson.

The group could also seek a suspension of the commission's decision if it can show that this would cause irreparable harm.

Intel has also faced similar cases elsewhere. Japan's fair trade commission ruled in 2005 that  Intel had abused its monopoly power. the company heeded a cease-and-desist order, but did not accept guilt or pay a fine.

Last June, South Korea's fair trade commission  fined Intel Won26bn ($21m) for abusing its dominant market position there and offering discounts to two Korean manufacturing to drive AMD out of the market. This decision is under appeal.

Intel had $10.3bn in cash and securities at the end of the first quarter.

HD       Intel's fine

The wheels of justice turn slowly indeed. Almost a full decade after Advanced Micro Devices first complained about its larger competitor,  Intel, the European Commission on Wednesday handed down its largest ever  fine for abuse of a dominant market position, ordering Intel to pay €1bn ($1.45bn). The decision follows a 2005 ruling in Japan, and another in Korea last year, that found  abuse by Intel. But do the opinions of bureaucrats matter?

TD
Shareholders don't think so. The share price of  Intel, which had sales last year of $38bn, not to mention a market capitalisation of $85bn and $10bn of cash, barely moved on the news. The company disputes the finding and will appeal, further lengthening the process. European attempts at intervention with Microsoft, including then-record fines, trundle along, with little effect on the company's behaviour. Investors are far more interested in Intel's attempts to cut costs, improve margins and control inventories, the main subject of its analyst day on Tuesday.

The ruling may give some help to AMD, whose shares added 5 per cent on Wednesday. Favourable precedent could help the company's civil suit against  Intel set for trial in Delaware next March. Separate investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney-general's office are ongoing, and any form of settlement would help to relieve AMD's debt load.

In terms of the market for microprocessors, however, little will change. The practice in question is allegedly restrictive conditions attached to volume rebates, not the principle of rebates themselves. With about 70 per cent of the market for microprocessors - the central engine of every computer -  Intel benefits from a self-reinforcing scale advantage that allows it to outspend AMD on research and development by more than four to one. In technology, trends in market share are rarely reversed. Plodding regulators can do little to change that fact.

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, has been  fined a record €1.06bn ($1.44bn) by Europe's competition authorities for abusing its dominant market position and using illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its micro-processor chips.

The fine, which follows a decade-long investigation by the  European Commission, is the largest single penalty to be imposed on a company for  antitrust breaches in Europe.

TD
The commission also ordered  Intel to "cease illegal practices immediately". It is to monitor future conduct.

But Intel pledged to appeal against the decision, denying its practices had violated European law. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace," said Paul Otellini,  Intel's chief executive.

Lawyers said the scale of the penalty, coupled with the more aggressive stance on  antitrust issues outlined by the new Obama administration in the US, was bound to increase anxieties at other companies. "There are no doubt some nervous large technology companies out there at the moment -
and that won't be helped by recent pronouncements [by] the new head of the US  antitrust watchdog that suggest the US will be joining the EU's crusade," said Mark Tricker at Norton Rose.

The commission said the illegal practices, between 2002 and 2007, involved conditional rebates to computer makers such as Acer and Dell and had the effect of pushing out competitors.
They included illegal payments to German retailer MediaMarkt on condition it exclusively sold
Intel-based personal computers.
The fine's size reflects the scale of  Intel's sales in Europe during that period, and the length of time the
abuse continued.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: "The commission finds that  Intel did not compete fairly . . . Given that Intel has harmed millions of consumers . . . the size of the  fine should come as no surprise"
The case, centred on the market for x86 computer processing units - worth about €7bn a year in Europe
- began in 2000, after a complaint filed by rival Advanced Micro Devices.

AMD said on Wednesday the decision was important to establish a truly competitive market. "The message to computer manufacturers is that they are now free to differentiate product lines," said Tom McCoy, AMD's vice-president for legal affairs.

The giant chipmaker  Intel has been ordered to pay a €1bn  fine for anticompetitive practices involving its rival AMD and payments offered to PC makers for using its chips

The giant chipmaker  Intel has been ordered to pay a €1.06bn (£950m)  fine to the EU commission for anticompetitive practices involving its rival AMD and payments offered to PC makers for using its chips.

TD
Under the EC rules, the maximum  fine is 10% of global turnover – which for  Intel could have meant up to $3.7bn (£2.4bn)
The European Commission says the company gave price discounts to computer manufacturers
Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for buying all or almost all their chips from  Intel.

Although  Intel last year made a profit of $5.3bn, the swingeing  fine will still hurt it at a time when it has announced job cuts and falling revenues this year.

The EC previously  finedMicrosoft €497m in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position, and ordered it to offer PC makers versions of Windows that did not include the Windows Media Player software – although Microsoft protested (correctly, as it turned out) that hardly anyone would want it.

The EC took aim at  Intel last July, with three specific charges: that  Intel "offered discounts to a major European personal computer distributor to favour its products, paid a PC maker to delay marketing a model line using [rival] AMD chips, and also paid it to use  Intel's own microprocessors in preference".

Intel responded that the action "suggests that the commission supports AMD's position that  Intel should be prevented from competing fairly and offering price discounts which have resulted in lower prices for consumers".

Duncan Gillespie, a  competition partner at the law firm DLA Piper, said: "The ruling is an important milestone as it is one of the first major cases under the  European Commission's new guidelines on exclusionary abuses under Article 82 of the EC Treaty."

But, he added,  Intel will have up to two months to lodge an appeal: "This case is likely to have a several more years to run."

American computer chip giant  Intel slammed the European Commission today after being served with a record €1.06bn  fine for breaching EU rules on fair competition.
The fine is by far the biggest ever imposed by the EU’s  competition authority.

TD
It comes after an inquiry in which the Commission found  Intel guilty of deliberately keeping rivals out of the global market for computer chips.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU’s anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated." However, Intel chief executive Paul Otellini denied the charge.
"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices," he said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal."

The Commission says Intel gave major computer companies "wholly or partially hidden" rebates on condition that they bought almost all of their x86 central processing units – computer chips – from Intel.

According to the Commission,  Intel also gave one major computer retailer direct payments on condition that the retailer stocked only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs.

The European Consumers’ Organisation, BEUC, welcomed the Commission decision, and called for an EU legislative plan to launch a "Group Action" to seek compensation for  Intel’s consumer victims.

BEUC said  Intel’s policy left consumers with a lack of choice and innovation, claiming: "They (consumers) paid too much, as the chips represented between 15% to 30% of the final price of the computer."

Monique Goyens, BEUC director-general added: "Consumer choice is the heartbeat of a competitive economy. Intel have been shown to have denied effective consumer choice and as a result kept prices artificially high and slowed the pace of innovation.

"Such a large  fine should deter companies that might think they will get away with such anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices.
"Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices. Consumers have been
paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated. This will only be possible with
a Group Action procedure.

Page 92 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We therefore urge the  European Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal establishing a collective court action for victims of anti-competitive practices.

"It is not acceptable that such a number of consumers suffer damages and have no way to obtain justice."
The Commission said Intel’s anti-competitive behaviour was mainly aimed at its smaller rival AMD. Between them the two companies make almost all the central processing chips which run the world’s
personal computers.
But the  Intel chief insisted: "We do not believe our practices violated European law.

"The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not.

"The Directorate General for  Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision.

"We believe this evidence shows that when companies perform well the market rewards them; when they don’t perform, the market acts accordingly."

He added: "Intel never sells products below cost. We have however, consistently invested in innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology.

"The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers everywhere the efficiencies of being the world’s leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors."
Today’s massive fine is the result of a Commission investigation triggered by complaints from AMD
in 2000, 2003 and 2006.
A Commission statement insisted: "Intel’s rights of defence have been fully respected in this case."

May 13--Intel officials said Wednesday a decision by the European Union to  fine the company $1.45 billion for allegedly anti-competitive practices will not slow the company's massive Ocotillo plant upgrade in Chandler.
EU fines Intel record $1.45B for sales tactics

TD
In February the company announced it would spend $3 billion over the next two years to combine two clean-room factories at the Ocotillo campus and refurbish them with the latest tools to make the next generation microprocessors for personal computers.
"Intel will continue to invest in the products and technologies that provide the world the industry's
best-performing processors at lower prices," said  Intel spokeswoman Dawn Jones in a written statement.
The Ocotillo project is on schedule, and old tools are in the process of being removed, she said.

Jones also said Intel will not make any job reductions in Chandler beyond the several hundred positions that were targeted for elimination in January because of the slow economy. Currently the company employs about 9,900 in Chandler and will reduce by another couple of hundred by mid-year, she said. The exact number has not yet been determined.

Intel also will continue its Arizona charitable programs, which provided more than $600,000 to local non-profit organizations last year, she said.
The fine, announced Wednesday at European Union headquarters in Brussels, was a record for the EU. The commission said Intel has limited competition in the European microprocessor market through
illegal sales tactics that shut out rival AMD.
The company disagreed and said it will appeal the  European Commission's decision to EU courts.

Intel's sales practices also are being investigated in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission.

BRUSSELS, May 13 -- The  European Commission on Wednesday finedIntel Corp. a record 1.06 billion euros for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the computer chip market in violation of European Union  competition rules.

The U.S. company, which controls more than 70 percent of the global market for central processing units, offered rebates to computer makers and retailers to prevent rivals from eating into its share between October 2002 and December 2007, according to the EU's administrative arm.

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, ''Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.''
The commissioner added that such a serious and sustained violation of the European Union's
antitrust rules ''cannot be tolerated.''

The previous record fine for abuse of dominant power in the European Union was 899 million euros, slapped on U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. in February last year.

Intel President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini said in a statement that the decision is
''wrong'' and there had been ''absolutely zero harm to consumers.''
Otellini said the company will appeal the decision.

* CEO says Intel will remain competitive
(Adds CEO's, analysts', HP's and Dell's comment) By Foo Yun Chee and David Lawsky
BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO, (Reuters) - EU regulators Wednesday slapped a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion) fine on Intel Corp for antitrust violations and ordered it to halt illegal efforts to squeeze out arch-foe AMD .

Analysts say the move, which  Intel CEO Paul Otellini vigorously contested, may help AMD recoup some of the market share lost to its bigger and nimbler rival over past years, but is not expected to radically transform Intel's operation.

The decision may also force U.S. regulators to act, analysts say, with South Korea and Japan already accusing the company of  antitrust violations.

Shares in Intel, which had slid 6 percent since Reuters broke news of the impending sanction on May 7, closed at $15.13, down 8 cents or 0.53 percent, while the Nasdaq fell 3 percent. AMD finished trade on the New York Stock Exchange up 3 cents, or 0.69 percent, at $4.38. It had been up as much as 1.2 percent earlier.

The European Commission said the world's No.1 chipmaker paid computer makers to postpone or scrap plans to launch products using AMD chips, paid illegal rebates to encourage them to use  Intel products and paid a retailer to stock only computers with  Intel chips.

Intel argued the decision was based on weak evidence that must be reviewed on appeal to an EU court.

"We do not have those kinds of conditions in our contracts. Our contracts are straightforward, consistent worldwide and they are volume-based: the more you buy, the less you pay," Chief Executive Paul Otellini said on a conference call.
"There is a significant amount of evidence that was either ignored or disregarded, or both."

The antitrust fine, imposed after an eight-year investigation , is the biggest the EU's executive Commission has imposed on a company. It surpassed the 896 million euro  fine last year on glass maker Saint-Gobain for price fixing, and a 2004, 497 million euro penalty on Microsoft for  abuse of dominance.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," European Union  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.
WHITHER  INTEL?

Page 99 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Intel has invested more than 5 billion euros in Europe and employs more than 6,000 people there, mostly in Ireland, its fourth largest global manufacturing site. Otellini saw no change to its investment there.

Analysts said U.S.-based  Intel would be able to maintain its market dominance, but the EU's decision could help AMD boost its market share.

"Intel's competitive advantage is not that they cheated or anything like that. It's that they are much larger than their smaller rival AMD. As far as long-term competitive advantage (goes),  Intel still has it," said Andy Ng, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar.

Others saw a historic decision that underscored the EU's determination to ensure dominant companies do not shut rivals out of the market.
"The ruling is hugely important. AMD has been out there for the last five or six years screaming that  Intel
has been keeping them from getting free access to markets," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood.

Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw Wu said the EU ruling could potentially impact Dell because of its heavy reliance on Intel chips for corporate customers, but not better-diversified HP.

A spokesman for Dell Inc said that the company has sold both  Intel and AMD-based products for several years and that it cooperated fully with the EU investigation. Hewlett-Packard declined comment.

"When you look at HP, they've been the more balanced player, they use a fair amount of AMD maybe because of their consumer focus," Wu said. "But with Dell it's a little different, they've been very loyal to Intel."

The Commission ordered  Intel to cease all illegal practices immediately. Otellini said in a statement it would appeal at the Court of First Instance, the EU's second-highest court.

Kroes said the EU  antitrust sanctions would be carried out immediately. In a previous  antitrust case against software giant Microsoft, the Commission froze its remedies during part of an appeal filed by that company.

Intel's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, told reporters he was "somewhat mystified" and unsure what the company needed to change. He said  Intel had not yet begun talks with the Commission on how to comply with its ruling.

"This is really just a matter of  competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious," Otellini added.

The Commission said Intel must pay the  fine, which represents 4.15 percent of the company's 2008 turnover, within three months of being notified of the decision.

May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined chipmaker Intel a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday and ordered it to stop giving computer firms illegal rebates to squeeze rival AMD out of the market. [ID:nLD471703]

The fine is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the European Union's executive arm for  abuse of market dominance, surpassing the 497 million euro penalty levied on Microsoft in March 2004.

KEY POINTS:
* EU fines Intel record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion)
* Orders immediate halt to illegal practices
* Says Intel practices hurt "millions of European consumers"
* Fine is 4.15 percent of  Intel's 2008 sales
* Intel has three months to pay  fine
* EU says Intel paid computer makers to halt or delay products with rival chips
* EU says Intel paid major retailer to exclude computers with chips made by rival
COMMENTARY:
ROBERT JAKOBSEN, JYSKE BANK
"It means nothing strategically. It is only a financial  fine, not changing the way  Intel is operating today." GIULIANO MERONI, PRESIDENT OF AMD EMEA
"Today's decision of the  European Commission is historic, and it is a game changer for the global IT
industry."
PRANAB SARMAH, ANALYST, DAIWA INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH

"Intel will either have to take a profit margin cut or raise prices, which will hurt either themselves or the customer if they do raise prices. They've got a big share of the market right now, and it's difficult for me to see how anyone can break that."

"Some say AMD may increase their market share as a result, but I'm not so sure about that. AMD doesn't have suitable technology for a range of notebook PCs, and it might be difficult for them to pick up any slack that Intel is leaving."
DAVID ANDERSON, LAWYER, BERWIN LEIGHTON PAISNER:



Page 102 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Despite its strong defence,  Intel is facing a wall of regulatory resistance to its business practices around the world with  antitrust infringement decisions against it now in Japan, Korea, the EU, and the U.S. authorities are investigating  Intel as well."

"It is a major decision that shows the Commission is serious about curtailing abusive behaviour of dominant companies, especially in the high-tech sector."

"The Commission is trying to ensure that dominant companies don't foreclose the market to competitors, lock in customers and shut down innovation. They are not seeking to favour any one technology or platform, but they want to keep the markets open to  competition and innovation, which will ultimately benefit consumers."
NATHAN BROOKWOOD, ANALYST, INSIGHT 64:
"The ruling is hugely important. AMD has been out there for the last five or six years screaming that  Intel
has been keeping them from getting free access to markets."

"If  Intel's marketing practices are precluded in Europe that could have some impact on the competitive dynamics for AMD in Europe and it might have some spillover in terms of what happens in the U.S."

"It certainly could lead to AMD gaining more market share than it has been able to gain to date. On the other hand Intel right now has a very strong product line and it could be that even if Intel didn't engage in these practices, AMD still might face hurdles in gaining market share because of Intel product advantages. On the other hand, AMD has recently come out with some exciting new products, and they could claim that hey, you know, we've got great products and the only thing standing between us and more market share is Intel's heavy hand."
ANDY NG, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:

"Intel's competitive advantage is not that they cheated or anything like that. It's that they are much larger than their smaller rival AMD. As far as long-term competitive advantage,  Intel still has it."
"Over the long run,  Intel still has the upper hand in the industry." Double click on the newslinks below for the following topics:

(Updates market share data to Q1)

May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission imposed a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion)  fine on chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday and ordered it halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) .

TD
For a Timeline on the Commission's case against  Intel, click on [ID:nLB111652]
Following are five facts on the rivalry between the two: MARKET SHARE
In the first quarter  Intel made 77.3 percent of the microprocessors that power computers, gaining share each quarter, helped by the success of its Atom chip in the emerging netbook sector and by the continued strength of its brands and products in the desktop, notebook and server segments.
AMD had 2.3 percent of the market, according to research firm IDC. RELATIVE SIZE

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, made revenues of $37.6 billion in 2008. It employed 83,900 staff at the end of 2008, more than half in the United States. Its market value is $85.4 billion and it is the world's biggest chip maker.

AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, made revenues of $5.8 billion in 2008. It employs about 11,000 people and has a market value of $2.6 billion.
CASE IN BRUSSELS

The EU executive said  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely  Intel chips, and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
It ordered  Intel "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing".  Intel
may continue to offer rebates, so long as they are legal, the Commission said.
It said Intel must pay the  fine within three months of the date of the notification of the decision. The U.S. tech group has denied the charges that it was abusing its market dominance, arguing its
conduct had been lawful and beneficial to clients and consumers.
CASES ELSEWHERE

In December 2008 Intel filed a formal complaint to overturn an earlier South Korean  antitrust ruling that it had abused its dominant market position. [ID:nSEO42148]

Intel said in a statement its filing to the Seoul High Court asserted that the Korea Fair Trade
Commission (KFTC) made substantial factual and legal errors in formulating its final opinion.

Page 104 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The KFTC said in June 2008 that  Intel offered rebates to South Korean personal computer makers in return for their not buying microprocessors from AMD.  Intel was also fined.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into  Intel after South Korean authorities  fined it for offering rebates in return for not buying AMD products.

The group faces more legal woes as a U.S. lawsuit brought by AMD is set to go to court in 2010.  Intel also faces dozens of separate class actions, filed in various U.S. courts, modelled on the AMD complaint.
U.S. LICENCE BATTLE

In March 2009 Intel accused AMD of breaching the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two, a charge that AMD denied. [ID:nN16422958]

Intel alleged its rival ran foul of a 2001 patent agreement when it created the Globalfoundries joint venture, the $4.3 billion semiconductor manufacturer spun off from AMD. (Compiled by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Timothy Heritage, Sharon Lindores)

Here are the key events in  Intel's antitrust battle with the Brussels-based Commission.

2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that  Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors.

July 2007 - The Commission accuses  Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws.
January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections". February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at  Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive.
July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to  Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only  Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers.

October 2008 -  Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission that it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defence.
January 2009 - The court rejects  Intel's appeal.
February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks  Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details.
May 13, 2009 - The  European Commission fines Intel 1.06 billion euros and orders it to halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out AMD. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Will Waterman and Timothy Heritage)

In a previous antitrust case against software giant Microsoft , the  European Commission had put its remedies on ice during part of an appeal filed by that company. That will not be the case for  Intel, Kroes said in an interview with Reuters Television.

HD       ANALYSIS-AMD faces tough road to benefit from EU aid

SAN FRANCISCO/HELSINKI, May 13 (Reuters) - The record  European Commission fine against Intel can at best help keep  competition alive in the computer microprocessor market, but rival AMD will not benefit unless it solves its own internal problems.

The Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its dominant market position by trying to exclude others from the microprocessor market, and ordered the U.S. firm to change its practices. [ID:nLD471703]

TD
"It might be slightly positive for AMD, but I really don't expect it to have a material change in the landscape or their opportunity," said Doug Freedman, analyst at Broadpoint AmTech.

"AMD's success is going to be predicated on their own ability to execute their roadmap and continue to bring innovative technology to the market," Freedman said.

In 2004, when the EU decided on the similar Microsoft case, it tried unsuccessfully to create competition where it did not exist. Microsoft holds a 95-percent share of personal computer operating systems now, as it did in 2004.

On Wednesday, the EU had the more modest goal of preserving  competition because while Intel has never held that kind of quasi-monopoly, it faces  competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its scale is still staggering -- it controls roughly 80 percent of the microprocessor market.
(to see graphic click:  http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/059/EQ_PCMKT0509.jpg )
"Consumers benefit from having AMD around because it keeps  Intel's prices under control," said David
Kanter, analyst at Real World Technologies.

PC demand has shown some resilience compared with the previous downturn, and last month  Intel CEO Paul Otellini said the worst was over for the battered tech sector. [ID:nN14455703]

Intel's orders and billing patterns so far in the second quarter have been slightly better than expected, Otellini said this week. [ID:nN12342726]
FOCUS ON PRODUCTS, FINANCES

Sales of PCs fell 7 percent in January-March, with consumers' move to low-cost laptops -- including netbooks -- keeping shipments from slipping further. Research firm IDC has forecast netbook shipments to double in 2009.

Intel's market share is benefitting from the netbook boom as its Atom chip has a dominant position there
-- while AMD has had to shy away from this market due to its limited resources. Its Neo chip offers more
but is more costly and lifts PC prices.

"The two companies tend to leapfrog each other ... I think it's down to AMD's execution over the next few quarters. Netbook is precisely one of the areas where AMD needs a different approach," said Chris Ingle, research director at IDC.

Page 110 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last week AMD merged its microprocessor and graphics chip businesses to adjust its structure and claw back market share lost to  Intel in the wake of its bungled introduction of the Barcelona chip in 2007. [ID:nN06289886]

The Barcelona chip was delayed for months due to a technical bug, causing AMD to give back hard-won market share to  Intel and resulting in massive losses.

Analysts say several new or upcoming AMD chips offer good opportunities for the company to gain share again, but loss-making AMD needs more capital to support major innovations.

To free resources, AMD earlier this year spun off its manufacturing operations to a new company, a joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi state-owned venture capital firm. [ID:nN02433513]

"AMD has recently come out with some exciting new products, and they could claim that hey, you know, we've got great products and the only thing standing between us and more market share is  Intel's heavy hand," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood.

INTEL TO CHANGE INSIDE?

The EU executive said  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely  Intel chips, and also paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
It ordered  Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing."

Intel may continue to offer rebates, so long as they are legal, the Commission said.

Analysts said if  Intel's business practices were still deemed to be against the ruling, the firm was likely to have to change its business practices.

"We've seen them in the past basically admit to not doing any wrong, but also at the same time stop the specific practice that is found unacceptable," said Broadpoint AmTech analyst Doug Freedman.

May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission imposed a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion)  fine on chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday and ordered it to halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out rival AMD. [IDnLD471703]
Here are the main details of the 542-page decision:

TD
EU FINDINGS:

* Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs processors from  Intel.

* It also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stocked only computers with its x86 CPUs. This effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products.

* Intel paid computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86
CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products.

* Computer manufacturers affected includes Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain.
CONDITIONAL REBATES AND PAYMENTS

The Commission said Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates if they bought all or almost all of their supplies, at least in certain defined segments, from Intel:

* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer A from December 2002 to December 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing exclusively  Intel CPUs.

* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer B from November 2002 to May 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 95 percent of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel (the remaining 5 percent that computer manufacturer B could purchase from rival chip maker AMD was then subject to further restrictive conditions).

Page 113 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer C from October 2002 to November 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 80 percent of its CPU needs for its desktop and notebook computers from Intel.

* Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer D in 2007 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing its CPU needs for its notebook computers exclusively from  Intel.

PAYMENTS TO PREVENT SALES OF SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS

The Commission said it found the following specific cases:

* For the 5 percent of computer manufacturer B's business that was not subject to the conditional rebate, Intel made further payments to computer manufacturer B provided that this manufacturer:

- sold AMD-based business desktops only to small and medium enterprises.

- sold AMD-based business desktops only via direct distribution channels (as opposed to through distributors)

- postponed the launch of its first AMD-based business desktop in Europe by 6 months.

* Intel made payments to computer manufacturer E provided that this manufacturer postponed the launch of an AMD-based notebook from September 2003 to January 2004.

* Before the conditional rebate to computer manufacturer D,  Intel made payments to this manufacturer provided that it postponed the launch of AMD-based notebooks from September 2006 to the end of 2006.

By Diane Bartz

WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - Now that European, South Korean and Japanese authorities have moved against chip giant  Intel Corp for breaking antitrust laws, the question is: Are U.S. officials feeling pressure to take action, too?

The European Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance.

"The size of the  fine shows that there's been substantial harm to consumers," said David Balto, a former antitrust policy director for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. "That's going to compel the FTC to act."

Intel is under investigation by both the FTC, which made its probe formal in June 2008, and the New
York attorney general's office.

The EU said  Intel had paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used Advanced Micro Devices chips; provided illegal rebates so computer manufacturers would use mostly or entirely Intel chips; and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips. [ID:nLD471703]

The moves against Intel in Japan, South Korea and Europe, combined with President Barack Obama's more aggressive antitrust stance, means that  Intel should expect "much more scrutiny," said Ed
Black, head of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

The FTC has largely reserved its power to levy  fines to consumer protection cases, but has ordered companies to end anti-competitive practices.

"The U.S. can impose  fines. It's not that they can't do it. They have tended not to use  fines as a principal tool, call it habit, call it tradition," Black said. "I wouldn't rule it out. I just wouldn't say it's necessarily to be predicted or expected."

Speaking before the ruling was released but after elements of it were reported, John Briggs, an antitrust expert with law firm Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider, LLP, said he expected more legal trouble for Intel.

"This kind of a ruling is going to motivate a lot of bees to go after a lot of pollen and honey," Briggs said. "There are a lot of people who will be wanting a piece of  Intel."

The commission might pursue Intel under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which forbids unfair methods of competition, rather than under antitrust law proper, said Michael Salinger, former director of the agency's Bureau of Economics.


Page 118 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"A number of current commissioners are interested in expanding the scope of Section 5," Salinger said. "What's likely to occur with the FTC, is that they will use the  Intel case to explore the reach of the FTC Act."

Intel reached a settlement in 1999 in a previous FTC investigation, in which the agency accused  Intel of refusing to deal with three customers in order to coerce them into surrendering certain intellectual property rights.
The FTC declined to comment for this story.
BIG CHANGES FOR A TOUGH COMPETITOR?

Smaller rival AMD has long accused  Intel of abusing its dominance of the $280 billion chip market and filed its own lawsuit in 2005. A series of other private suits against  Intel were consolidated and will be heard with AMD's suit when trial opens in March 2010.
Europe's decision will have no legal effect on these cases, said Michael Hausfeld of law firm Hausfeld
LLP.
"It clearly is a psychological boost," added Hausfeld. "It's tremendous."

Japan's trade commission concluded in 2005 that  Intel violated the country's anti-monopoly act. And in June 2008, South Korea  fined Intel some $26 million, finding it offered rebates to PC makers in return for not buying AMD microprocessors.

Intel, whose microprocessors power more than 80 percent of the world's PCs, denied any wrongdoing on Wednesday and said it planned to appeal at Europe's Court of First Instance.
But antitrust expert Briggs said there were big changes ahead for  Intel.

"It's going to be a rough day for  Intel and its shareholders," he said. "They're going to have to pay a fine and will have to change their conduct in Europe." (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Andre Grenon, Lisa Von Ahn, Tim Dobbyn)

HD      Intel fined €1.06bn for anti-competitive practices

Chip maker Intel has been fined €1.06bn for breaking European anti-competitive rules. The company was accused illegally trying to damage rival processor manufacturer AMD's business. The European Commission said that  Intel, which has around an 80% share of the CPU market, broke competition
rules by giving rebates to computer manufacturers Dell, Acer and Lenovo, NEC and HP in return for them buying most of the processors they require from  Intel.

The ruling said Intel also paid manufacturers to delay PC launches using AMD processors or stop using its bitter rival all together.

TD
However, Intel has hit back at the ruling, saying it is wrong and 'ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace'.

Paul Otellini,  Intel President and CEO, said the company never sells its products below cost: 'We do not believe our practices violated European law. The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not.'

This is the biggest  fine handed out by the  European Commission for anti-competitive measures, surpassing Microsoft's €497m  fine in 2004, which was increased by €899m for failing to comply with the order.

THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES ("MHP-BHDNPX") -  Intel Corp. European Commission Antitrust     Fine Against - Intel Corp. Will Not Affect Ratings Or Outlook Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said that the decision by the European Commission (EC) to fineIntel  Corp. (A+/Stable/A-1+) €1.06 billion (about
$1.45 billion) for violating EC antitrust rules on the abuse of its dominant market position will not currently affect its ratings or outlook on the company. The EC stated that  Intel had engaged in illegal
anticompetitive practices through the use of rebates conditioned on computer manufacturers' purchases of Intel microprocessor chips to the exclusion of products from its only competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD, CCC+/Negative/--). The EC also ordered  Intel to stop offering such rebates to computer makers, which may have contributed to  Intel's maintaining its over-70% global market share.  Intel contends that it did nothing wrong, and intends to appeal the decision.

TD
Under the order,  Intel must change its business practices immediately pending its appeal, although it can ask for an injunction. The company must pay the  fine into escrow until the appeal process is exhausted. In June 2008, the U. S. Federal Trade Commission opened a formal  antitrust investigation into  Intel, while AMD has sued Intel in federal court.

Intel's strong financial profile, with cash of $10.6 billion at March 31, 2009, and free cash flows of $5.7 billion in 2008, provide a significant degree of support for the current ratings, and the ability to pay the EC fine without impairing credit quality.

LONDON (MarketWatch) - U.S. stock futures dropped on Wednesday as a surprise decline in retail sales twinned with oil-price worries to encourage traders to lock in profits made since March.

S&P 500 futures fell 15.3 points to 891.50 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 21.5 points to 1,363.50. Dow industrial futures dropped 124 points.

TD
Those futures took a turn for a worse as data showed import prices rose more quickly than forecast, and retail sales slipped 0.4% in April. The retail sales fall was the eighth decline in ten months.

The import price rise came on petroleum price rises, as oil becomes a greater focus for the market. After touching $60 a barrel on Tuesday, crude edged 20 cents lower to $58.65 a barrel ahead of the release of weekly energy inventories.

"So much for green shoots," said TJ Marta, a fixed-income strategist for Marta on the Markets LLC. "First of all, they're not as green as hoped, and second, they're highly vulnerable to the inflation threat."
The euro dropped to session lows and Treasury bond prices rose after the economic data.

Meanwhile, Credit Suisse's global equity strategists said they're becoming more defensive, saying the price-to-book of cyclical companies relative to defensive firms is now nearly one standard deviation above its normal range, and the price-to-earnings ratio relative to the market is even more extreme.

Also of note,  Intel (INTC, US) climbed 1.8% as the CEO Paul Otellini told analysts that the business was a little better than expected during the second quarter, and Intel separately was fined 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) by the  European Commission over alleged antitrust violations.

Ford Motor Co. (F, US) dropped 4.6% to $4.77 as the automaker gave details of its secondary offering. It is selling 300 million shares for $4.75 each.
Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS, US) climbed 8% after increasing 2009 earnings guidance.

In Asia, the Shanghai Composite rose 1.7% to close at a nine-month high, and the Nikkei 225 tacked on 0.5% in Tokyo.
The pan-Europe Dow Jones Stoxx 600 fell 2.4%.

U.S. stocks finished mostly lower on Tuesday on a drop for banks and growing concerns over a General Motors bankruptcy. The S&P 500 ended nearly a point lower and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outlier, rising 50 points on gains for defensive health-care concerns Pfizer and Merck as well as oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil as oil prices briefly hit $60 a barrel.

LONDON (MarketWatch) -- On Wednesday the European Commission finedIntel Corp. 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion), for anti-competitive behavior.

The Commission charged that  Intel (INTC, US) made illegal payments to manufacturers and retailers to gain preferential treatment for computers using its chips. (RELATED ARTICLE:  Intel fined a record
$1.45 bln by E.U. regulator) See related story.

TD
Excerpts from the  European Commission's statement Wednesday regarding its  fine of Intel for anti-competitive behavior follows:

The European Commission has imposed a fine of €1 060 000 000 on  Intel Corporation for violating EC Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position (Article 82) by engaging in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units (CPUs).

The Commission has also ordered  Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing.

Throughout the period October 2002-December 2007,  Intel had a dominant position in the worldwide x86 CPU market (at least 70% market share). The Commission found that  Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice.

First,  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from Intel. Intel also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs. Such rebates and payments effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products.

Second,  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products. The Commission found that these practices constituted abuses of  Intel's dominant position on the x86
CPU market that harmed consumers throughout the EEA. By undermining its competitors' ability to compete on the merits of their products,  Intel's actions undermined  competition and innovation. The Commission will actively monitor  Intel's compliance with this decision. The world market for x86 CPUs is currently worth approximately €22 billion ($30 billion) per year, with Europe accounting for approximately 30% of that.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated".

The computer manufacturers concerned by  Intel's conduct in the Commission's decision are: Acer, Dell (DELL, US), HP (HPQ, US), Lenovo (LNVG.Y, US) and NEC (NELT.Y, US). The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain.

Page 125 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Conditional rebates and payments

Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies, at least in certain defined segments, from  Intel:

Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer A from December 2002 to December 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing exclusively  Intel CPUs

Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer B from November 2002 to May 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel (the remaining 5% that computer manufacturer B could purchase from rival chip maker AMD was then subject to further restrictive conditions set out below)

Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer C from October 2002 to November 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 80% of its CPU needs for its desktop and notebook computers from  Intel

Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer D in 2007 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing its
CPU needs for its notebook computers exclusively from  Intel.

Furthermore,  Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.

Certain rebates can lead to lower prices for consumers. However, where a company is in a dominant position on a market, rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival's products, or not buying them at all, are abusive according to settled case-law of the Community Courts unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify their application in the individual case.

In its decision, the Commission does not object to rebates in themselves but to the conditions  Intel attached to those rebates. Because computer manufacturers are dependent on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies, only a limited part of a computer manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements is open to competition at any given time.

Intel structured its pricing policy to ensure that a computer manufacturer which opted to buy AMD CPUs for that part of its needs that was open to  competition would consequently lose the rebate (or a large part of it) that  Intel provided for the much greater part of its needs for which the computer manufacturer had no choice but to buy from  Intel. The computer manufacturer would therefore have to pay  Intel a higher price for each of the units supplied for which the computer manufacturer had no alternative but to buy from Intel. In other words, should a computer manufacturer fail to purchase virtually all its x86 CPU requirements from Intel, it would forego the possibility of obtaining a significant rebate on any of its very high volumes of Intel purchases.

Moreover, in order to be able to compete with the  Intel rebates, for the part of the computer manufacturers' supplies that was up for grabs, a competitor that was just as efficient as  Intel would
have had to offer a price for its CPUs lower than its costs of producing those CPUs, even if the average price of its CPUs was lower than that of  Intel.

For example, rival chip manufacturer AMD (AMD, US) offered one million free CPUs to one particular computer manufacturer. If the computer manufacturer had accepted all of these, it would have lost Intel's rebate on its many millions of remaining CPU purchases, and would have been worse off overall
simply for having accepted this highly competitive offer. In the end, the computer manufacturer took only
160,000 CPUs for free.

As a result of  Intel's rebates, the ability of rival manufacturers to compete and innovate was impaired, and this led to reduced choice for consumers.
Rebates such as those applied by  Intel are recognised in many jurisdictions around the world as
anti-competitive and unlawful because the effect in practice is to deny consumers a choice of products.
Payments to prevent sales of specific rival products

Intel also interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD.

Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products and/or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD-based products.


Page 126 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market.

The Commission obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in  Intel's contracts. Such proof is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence such as e-mails obtained inter alia from unannounced
on-site inspections, in responses to formal requests for information and in a number of formal statements made to the Commission by the other companies concerned. In addition, there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.

x86 CPUs are the main hardware component of a computer. The decision contains a broad range of contemporaneous evidence that shows that AMD, essentially  Intel's only competitor in the market, was generally perceived, by computer manufacturers and by  Intel itself, to have improved its product range, to be a viable competitor, and to be a growing competitive threat.

The decision finds that  Intel's practices did not constitute  competition on the merits of the respective Intel and AMD products, but rather were part of a strategy designed to exploit  Intel's existing entrenched position in the market.

Intel's worldwide turnover in 2007 was 27.92 billion euros. The  fine in this case takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement.

In accordance with the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on  Fines (see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256) the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of  Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area (EEA). The duration of the infringement established in the decision is five years and three months.

LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Evil Intel effectively bribed computer makers and retailers to boost its market share, according to the European Commission.
On Wednesday the Commission  fined the chip maker $1.45 billion for actions between 2002 and
2007 that prevented European consumers from having a broader choice of computer products using
x86 chips. (RELATED ARTICLE:  Intel fined a record $1.45 bln by E.U. regulator) See related story.

TD
The vehicle for  Intel's (INTC, US) actions was its aggressive use of "rebates" to ensure favorable treatment, and to block competitive efforts by smaller rival AMD (AMD, US).

"Such a serious and sustained violation of the E.U.'s  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, in a statement. (RELATED ARTICLE: Text of  European Commission statement on  Intel) See the complete statement.
Naturally, the company has vowed to fight the  fine.

Given enough time and lawyering, it will probably whittle it down to something more manageable. The case will settle, eventually, and all the parties can move on to the next round of the game. After all, Intel has doubtless perfected newer high-pressure tactics for the current generation of chips in its perennial battle against AMD.
And in another decade or so the future Commission can hold another press conference.

However laudable from the consumer's point of view, this type of enforcement action never seems to change anything on the ground.
Remember when Microsoft faced the  antitrust gauntlet? How much has really changed since then?
- Tom Bemis, assistant managing editor

SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: European regulators throw the book at  Intel, saying the giant chip maker doesn`t play fair when it comes to rival AMD.  Intel`s CEO Paul Otellini denies that, telling us his firm will appeal the record $1.5 billion  fine.

JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Some call it socialism; others say it`s about protecting the U.S. economy from future meltdowns. We get Wall Street`s take on Federal plans to clamp down on executive pay at big financial firms.

TD
GHARIB: From Wrigley field to the great plains, we look at how the state of Illinois is navigating the recession. Coming up, our conversation with Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.

YASTINE: And tonight`s "Street Critique" guest says the current rally`s legs are getting weak in the knees. He`s Todd Harrison, chief executive and founder of minyanville.com.
GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.
YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for
Wednesday, May 13.

GHARIB: Good evening everyone.  Intel has something in common with Microsoft tonight. Now it`s the target of European regulators. The EU`s  European Commission slapped Intel with a $1.5 billion fine today for blocking competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. The penalty is the largest antitrust fine in the EU`s history and more than double what regulators  finedMicrosoft back in 2004. But as Stephanie Dhue reports, Intel denies the claims and plans to appeal.

STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: European regulators say  Intel gave rebates to computer makers like Acer, Dell and HP and in exchange the companies bought all or most of their chips from  Intel. The EC also says  Intel paid computer makers to stop or delay the launch of products based on rival AMD`s chips.  Intel CEO Paul Otellini says that`s not the case.

PAUL OTELLINI, PRESIDENT & CEO,  INTEL: We strongly disagree with the decision. We think that the case team ignored and didn`t use a significant amount of evidence that we think would have led them to a different conclusion and we will appeal and upon that appeal we`ll bring that evidence in and I think we`ll be exonerated.

DHUE: AMD has for years been pressing the case that  Intel uses its market muscle to bully computer makers into exclusive deals. Regulators in Japan, South Korea and now Europe have agreed. AMD has a private lawsuit against  Intel in a Delaware court. AMD`s legal affairs Vice President Tom McCoy calls today`s decision encouraging.

TOM MCCOY, EXEC. VP, LEGAL AFFAIRS, AMD: When people look at the evidence, everybody comes to the same conclusion, that  Intel is running an illegal monopoly, so I think the signal here is that the prospects for the litigation for AMD are quite good, based on the evidence that exists.

DHUE: President Obama`s top  antitrust regulator, Christine Varney, on Monday put big companies on notice her agency will take aggressive action against dominant firms, despite the recession. While she didn`t name names, observers read that to include  Intel. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo are actively investigating  Intel`s conduct in the U.S.

OTELLINI: We are cooperating with both authorities, providing documents and depositions and those kinds of things. We`ve been investigated by the FTC before, some decade ago on a similar kind of complaint. We were found to be free of any wrongdoing and I`m quite comfortable that the FTC under comparable circumstances and a full review of the evidence will find us free this time.
DHUE: Is  Intel going to change the way it does business as a result of this decision?

OTELLINI: I think we`ve broken no law, so it`s just pretty hard to say that we need to change. In terms of specific processes we`ll be asked to follow, I can`t answer that question until we see the document.
DHUE: AMD`s McCoy says  Intel`s stance is disappointing.

MCCOY: It is a little disconcerting to see after three adverse rulings, based on evidence acquired from  Intel and from Intel`s own customer interactions that  Intel isn`t stepping up and say OK, we`re going to stop the boycotts of AMD technology and we`re going to compete on the merits. DHUE: Otellini says  Intel never asked customers to boycott its rival.

OTELLINI: Most customers we have buy product from both suppliers. Customers chose who they want to buy from and when they want to buy it and it`s absurd to consider that a company like  Intel can influence a company to not take actions. In no cases were our discounts tied to any conditional exclusivity, or those kinds of things. Our discounts are tied to volume.

DHUE: An appeal of the  European Commission`s decision is likely a years-long process. With an 80 percent share of the chip market, analysts expect  Intel to be under heightened scrutiny globally for years to come. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.

GHARIB: Lavish executive pay packages at the nation`s banks have been the talk of Wall Street, Main Street and Washington for months now. Today the Federal Reserve told NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT it plans to make sure compensation plans do not encourage risky behavior by executives at big financial firms. But as Scott Gurvey reports, the idea the Fed would get permanently involved in Wall Street salaries set off alarm bells throughout the financial sector.

SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: You would expect to see storm troopers marching down Wall Street judging from the reactions of some to news the government will try to change compensation practices in the financial industry. Gustavo Dolfino of the Whiterock Group says if the government sets compensation rates, it will be the beginning of the end for American democracy.

GUSTAVO DOLFINO, PRESIDENT, THE WHITEROCK GROUP: What you have then is the United States of socialist America where people end up leaving and going to other countries the way people are leaving Sweden and Holland and places like that to go to places where they`re actually going to get paid. It goes against everything that America stands for.

GURVEY: Congress has already set compensation caps for executives at banks taking taxpayer bailout money, a move generally popular with the public. Bank analyst Jason Ren of Morningstar says he thinks the government is not likely to extend those strict rules to institutions not taking taxpayer support.

JASON REN, BANK ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: I think the government is more looking towards guidelines on how to reward employees and near term compensation makes up so much of a Wall Street banker`s pay that they have a right to be concerned.

GURVEY: In fact, government officials have been talking for some time about getting banks to control compensation levels so they do not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair have all raised these issues publicly in recent weeks. They have argued that they have the authority to prevent short-term compensation plans from encouraging bankers to take on too much risk. Their critics on Wall Street are having none of it.

DOLFINO: There is no room for government to try and regulate what we can and cannot do in the private sector because that`s using public service mentality. If the private sector wanted public service mentality, they would have gone into public service. So what you`re seeing right now is foreign banks, Calais, Deutsche, Nomura, hiring American talent to beat America at their own game, because for the first time in history, we are precluded from paying our own people what they deserve to get paid.

GURVEY: We hope to know more about these compensation issues soon. A Fed spokesman told NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT today they expect to issue proposals on compensation in the next few months. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.

YASTINE: Wall Street continued its downward ways today as retail sales showed consumers are still struggling. The Dow fell more than 160 points in the opening minutes after the c Commerce Department said retail sales tumbled more than expected last month, down 0.4 of a percent. Foreclosures rose to another record high in a separate realty industry report. The plunge bottomed out around midday, but there was no rebound. The Dow went on to close down 184.22 to 8284.89. The NASDAQ shedding 51.73 to
1664.19. The S&P 500 falling 24.43 to 883.92. The bond market, the 10-year note rising 18/32 to 100 4/32, the yield at 3.11 percent.

GHARIB: $9 billion: that`s how much stimulus money the state of Illinois has been promised by the Obama administration. The prairie state needs that money. It has a record deficit, $11.5 billion and unemployment is over 9 percent, higher than the national average. As we continue our series, "Reviving the Economy: Government Responds," we focus tonight on Illinois. Joining me now, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. Governor, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.
GOV. PAT QUINN, (D) ILLINOIS: It`s an honor. Good to talk to you, Susie.

GHARIB: Governor, let me first begin by asking you, have you received any stimulus checks from Washington? And I ask you that because there were reports today that some states have yet to receive any money from Washington.

QUINN: We`re just beginning to get the money. As far as commitments for the Federal transportation stimulus, our state is the number one in the nation. I think we have over $646 million in commitments on our highway and bridge projects, 242 projects. We were ready right at the opening bell. We want to be completely transparent. We`re off to a good start and we`re very grateful to President Obama for getting this going for Illinois and the whole country.
GHARIB: So you mentioned transportation projects. Where else are you going to spend this $9 billion? QUINN: We have to deal with health and education. We want to make sure that we have adequate money
to invest in elementary and secondary education. Jobs follow brain power. That`s very important to
maintain that in America today. We also have to deal with our health care needs. I believe in decent health
care for everyone. Our Medicaid rolls have grown with the unemployment. We have to deal with that. I have
been governor for 100 days. I took over from my disgraced predecessor and we`re ready to take on any
challenge in Illinois, especially the economic challenge, and one thing we`re very interested in working with
the president on is high- speed rail. We want to connect Chicago to St. Louis and other Midwestern cities
like Milwaukee and Minneapolis and Detroit and Cleveland and we can do this within a short period of time
and we`re going to invest very much into high-speed rail.

GHARIB: From the money that you are going to be investing, is this going to create jobs or are you just saving jobs, saving people from getting laid-off?

QUINN: Well, I don`t want to lay off teachers. I don`t think anybody wants that. We are out for (ph) preserving jobs, but we have a robust public works program in Illinois. I think it`s desperately needed. Our private economy is sort of sputtering. Consumers are hesitant. This is a time for government to prime the pump and invest in public works that will help us create jobs today and lay down a solid economic future for our state and the whole country. We believe in high-speed Internet. Everybody in, nobody left out. We have a very strong agricultural economy in Illinois. We want to make sure our rural areas are connected with
high- speed Internet and broadband deployment.

GHARIB: How is the economy of Illinois doing? I mentioned some of the numbers at the beginning of this interview, but are you seeing any signs of improvement in the economy?

QUINN: I am. I think this will be a good year for housing. We have -- obviously, some setbacks in the past year or so. We have to get our housing back on track. We`re going to be pumping in some of our public works spending into affordable housing, multifamily housing. We want to make sure our carpenters are working, our pipefitters are working. We have a lot of projects on water, conservation and sewer and clean water issues. This could be the issue of the 21st century -- clean water -- and we want to make sure that Illinois, with Lake Michigan, the Mississippi River, the Illinois River that connects both of them that we`re really taking care of our water. A long time ago Mark Twain said whiskey`s for drinking and water is worth fighting for.
GHARIB: What about the auto industry?

QUINN: We`re concerned. Chrysler Belvedere right now is on shutdown. We want to get Chrysler back on its feet. We hope they can put something together with Fiat and have very good projects. We have Mitsubishi located in Bloomington, Illinois. I would like to see Mitsubishi bring an electric car product line to Illinois. We would like to try that out. We also have Ford on the south side of Chicago. We have a great

Page 136 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
auto supplier network all across Illinois. We don`t want to lose that. It`s very important to our economy and we want to work with our manufacturers to do the right thing.

GHARIB: Governor, you mentioned it`s 100 days now that you are in office in the aftermath of that scandal surrounding the former governor of Illinois. To what extent is politics, though, hindering what you can accomplish for the economy of Illinois?

QUINN: Well, I think the people of Illinois breathed a great sigh of relief that my predecessor has left the building and was impeached and recalled and removed from office. We have a positive attitude. We have people working together for the first time in a long time. We`ve passed already a jump-start capital bill of
$3.4 billion. We`re going to try and do a capital bill, a jobs recovery bill of $30 billion.
GHARIB: Are you saying politics is not going to get in the way of you doing good things economically? QUINN: I don`t think so. I want to try to get everybody singing out of the same hymn book. That`s my job.
We have a Herculean challenge, I understand that, but we`re going to pass tough ethics laws. We`re going
to balance our budget. We`re going to invest in jobs and economic recovery and make the will of the
people the law of the land.
GHARIB: We`re going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much, sir, for coming on our program. QUINN: Thank you. GHARIB: My guest tonight, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.
YASTINE: And now, let`s take a look at our stocks in the news tonight. Ford Motor Co (F) topping our list, down $0.05. They raised $1.4 billion from last night`s offering. The CEO says it`s critical to bolstering pension fund levels and ultimately the auto maker`s turnaround plan.

Citigroup (C) dropping $0.25. Bloomberg had a story that Citi was shopping its Primerica sales unit to interested private equity buyers. No public comment from Citi yet.
Bank of America (BAC) finishing down $1.25. Wells Fargo (WFC) off $1.50.
BB&T Corp (BBT) slipped $1, raising $1.5 billion from its sale of 75 million new shares priced at $20 each. Then American International Group (AIG) slipping a fraction.
General Electric (GE) settling $0.77 lower. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) off $1.31.
Pfizer (PFE) gaining $0.34, part of that defensive rotation today. US Bancorp (USB) losing $0.49.
And there`s Merck (MRK) which rose $0.69, the Dow`s big gainer behind GM again part of that defensive rotation.
Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stung for a loss of $0.87. That`s a reaction to that surprise 0.4 of a percent drop in
April retail sales. Also fiscal first quarter results are due out for Wal-Mart tomorrow.

Verizon Communications (VZ) had a similar drop. They`re selling nearly five million land line accounts to Frontier Communications. It`s a spin off worth $9 billion. Once completed, Verizon will have the controlling stake in Frontier.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) sank $1.61. The casino group will reportedly cut 4,000 jobs in its Macao operations. That comes in addition to a previous job cut of roughly 2,500 people also in Macao.

Investors bailing out of MGM Mirage (MGM), shares tumbling almost $4. The casino group will tap the junk bond market for $1.5 billion and sell another $1 billion in new stock shares.

Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) nosediving nearly $6. The iron ore company will cut its dividend and sell 12 million new shares of stocks. BMO (ph) downgraded the shares.
And another issue under pressure from a diluted stock offering, Protective Life (PL) down nearly $3.

BMC Software (BMC) slid $2.63. Executives blaming the recession for customers holding off on business software purchases in the fourth quarter.

Page 137 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And Novartis Ag (NVS) rising $1.20, one of the few gainers on the New York exchange. The Swiss drug giant hiring a new CFO, Jonathan Simons. He helped Astra Zeneca in a similar capacity and he`s currently an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.

On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) falling nearly $5. Apple says Steve Jobs will not be making the keynote speech at the worldwide developers` conference in June. Many thought Jobs might make his first public appearance there since going on medical leave.

Intel (INTC) dipping a fraction. As the heard, the EU hitting them with a big  antitrust fine.
Google (GOOG) falling nearly $10. Research in Motion (RIMM) dropped $2.62. Microsoft (MSFT) down a fraction.
CME Group (CME) though jumping nearly $16. Cisco Systems (CSCO) off $0.67.
Qualcomm (QCOM) falling $1. Amazon.com (AMZN) dropping $3.74.
And First Solar (FSLR) off more than $11.

And finally, the Medicines Company (MDCO) sank more than $4. It`s stopping late stage trials of its heart drug, Cangrelor, saying there`s not enough evidence the drug would help patients.

Tonight`s "Street Critique" guest says investors need to have patience, discipline and some caution at this point in the markets. He`s Todd Harrison, founder and CEO of Minyanville.com. Todd, welcome tonight to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.
TODD HARRISON, FOUNDER & CEO, MINYANVILLE.COM: It`s good to be here.

YASTINE: You have been writing a lot about a presumed or possible "W" shape in the markets and that we`re sitting on the widow`s peak. What do you mean by that?

HARRISON: I think when we look back at 2009, it could well look like a "W." Coming into this year, we have this finance-based, derivative-laced economy and there was really a lot of pressure in the marketplace. We got to a point in the spring where it really felt like we were going to fall off the side of the cliff and it was really, there was a lot of towels being tossed in the market. We`ve now since, rallied. The market broke out through S&P 875. I think we need to see that technical affirmation to pull in some folks from the sidelines
but I think we`re going to traverse back down back into that "W" into the fall and potentially setting up for the second 20 percent rally of 2009 towards year end.

YASTINE: Todd, what about investors, everyday investors, the non- pros? What should they be doing in this kind of market environment if you`re not somebody who trades?

HARRISON: I think there are three things. Really there is capital preservation. There is debt reduction and there is financial intelligence. I mean this is no longer a financial crisis or an economic crisis. This is really a social crisis and social mood and risk appetite shape financial markets and you know, I think that there is going to be tremendous opportunities as we get through this. I look at the great depression actually as a construct of optimism. There were some great companies that were formed through that period, but it`s going to take some time. It took a long time to build. It`s going to take some time to unwind. I think you
need to be patient. You need to think your time horizon and your risk profile.

YASTINE: We see a lot of words and activity coming out of Washington. We will revive and save the banking system of the United States and therefore the markets. You`re rather cautious about that attitude.

HARRISON: I think there is unintended consequences with what`s going on and if you look back to the original bailout bill as we wrote on minyanville, the government attempted to buy the cancer and sell the car crash and to save the system really. So they`ve effectively done that but that comes at a cost and I think ultimately what you need to see for there to be a cure for this disease rather than masking the symptoms, the cure for this disease needs to be debt destruction. You need to let markets do what markets do if we`re going to remain in a free-market capital construct, so I think that that`s -- we`re swimming backwards in that regard and I think that ultimately, we`re going to have to edge back towards letting a meritocracy take hold
in the marketplace.

Page 138 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
YASTINE: In about 20 seconds, do you think that the worst is over, at least as how we measure it in the stock market?

HARRISON: I think it`s going to -- that`s a pretty loaded question. I think this is going to take some time. I think you have to watch the dollar. If the dollar starts to debase, I think equities -- that measuring stick could rally but again I`ll say, there is going to be great opportunities down the road. Capital preservation and financial staying power cannot be reiterated enough. You`ve got to be in position to put capital to work
when the time comes and it`s going to take some time to get here.
YASTINE: All right. Patience is the word, Todd, thanks for joining us.
HARRISON: Thank you. YASTINE: Our guest, Todd Harrison, CEO of minyanville.com.

GHARIB: Tomorrow, it`s D-day for up to 1,000 Chrysler dealerships, as their parent company tells them if its the end of the line.

Legislation capping interest rates on credit cards died in the U.S. Senate today despite complaints that banks and credit card companies gouge customers. That measure would have held rates at 15 percent unless a firm could show the Federal Reserve that limiting rates would threaten the soundness of the company. Senators are not giving up on credit card reform. They hope to offer up a new bill as early as tomorrow evening.

YASTINE: Countrywide Financial co-founder Angelo Mozilo may face civil fraud charges. The "Wall Street Journal" reports regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission want to file insider trading and other charges against him but the paper said Mozilo`s attorney may be able to persuade the SEC commissioners not to bring a case. Mozilo`s lawyer says his client has not broken the law.

GHARIB: Thirty days and counting: the transition to digital television is almost here. On June 12, all full-power TV stations in the United States will begin broadcasting only in digital. The Federal Communications Commission says about 3.5 million U.S. households are still not ready. The transition was originally set for February, but was postponed by Congress. The FCC`s acting Chairman Michael Copps says while the extra time helped, he still expects some disruptions.

MICHAEL COPPS, ACTING CHAIRMAN, FCC: We have done everything we can in three months to get ready. Realize, though, that the preceding three months or three years when I think we did not put the emphasis on really having the kind of closely coordinated, interagency, public sector-private sector partnerships. So what we`re trying to do is run real hard to do in three months what we should have done in three years. Some things do fall through the cracks.

GHARIB: The commission will test the transition next Thursday, interrupting analog signals so viewers will know if their TV requires a special box. Jeff.

YASTINE That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, May 13. I`m Jeff Yastine. Good night, everyone. Good night to you, Susie.
GHARIB: Good night to you, Jeff. I`m Susie Gharib. Hope to see all of you back here tomorrow night. END

Health Care: Medicare Expected To Go Bankrupt In Eight Years

"Medicare trustees announced Tuesday that the program's biggest fund for serving the elderly would run out of money in just eight years," the Los Angeles Times reports. "But the announcement, the latest in a succession of dire predictions about Medicare's fiscal condition, also pointed up the chasm separating Democrats and Republicans as the Obama administration and its congressional allies prepare for another major attempt to reshape the U.S. healthcare system."

TD
"The fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition likely holds the key to enacting a universal health care plan this year, but so far the Democratic bloc feels like it's being cast aside," Roll Call (subscription) reports. "Forty-five Blue Dogs, led by Rep. Mike Ross (Ark.), on Monday warned that they need to be part of the writing of health care legislation in a sharply worded letter" to the House Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor chairmen.
"Providing health insurance to the roughly 50 million people without it will cost something like $120 billion
a year," the New York Times reports. "President Obama has proposed $60 billion or so in new revenue for
this purpose -- a 'down payment,' his advisers say. But Congress seems set to reject about half of the
down payment (a plan to limit high-income families' tax deductions for charitable giving and other such
things). That makes for the $90 billion health care hole. And no one is quite sure how to fill it."
Congress: Pentagon Spending Reform Expected To Pass

"The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass legislation" today "aimed at reforming massive waste in the Pentagon's biggest weapons programs, a bill that got a ringing endorsement from the White House on Tuesday," Reuters reports. "Congressional aides said... passage was likely given widespread concern over chronic cost overruns and schedule delays in major weapons programs."

"The Supreme Court on Thursday is scheduled to consider whether it will revisit constitutional Speech or Debate Clause protections under an appeal from ex-Rep. William Jefferson (D-La.)," Roll Call (subscription) reports. "Should the Supreme Court decide to take up the case, it would all but certainly have an impact on Speech or Debate protections and could affect future indictments against Members of Congress, or even establish new precedents for submitting evidence to grand juries."

"The online gambling industry is waging a campaign in Congress to legalize Internet betting, arguing that it is here to stay and can be regulated and taxed," the Los Angeles Times reports. "But opponents are
raising moral objections."
White House: Obama Exploring Limits On Executive Pay

"The Obama administration has begun serious talks about how it can change compensation practices across the financial-services industry, including at companies that did not receive federal bailout money, according to people familiar with the matter," the Wall Street Journal (subscription) reports.

Obama "plans deep new cuts in the U.S. nuclear arsenal at a time when the government faces a 15-year backlog of warheads already waiting to be dismantled and a need for billions of dollars in new facilities to store and dispose of the weapons' plutonium," USA Today reports. "Much of the infrastructure needed to dispose of those weapons don't exist yet, according to federal audits and other records."
Economy: Increasing Home Sales Seen As Trend

Page 141 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Sales of existing homes picked up in 17 states in the first quarter compared with the previous one, pointing to more signs of life for the home market," USA Today reports. "Economists predict more states will show sales gains throughout the year, given still-falling prices in many markets, low mortgage rates and some signs of improvement in the overall economy."

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on Tuesday "told the nation's Realtors that his agency plans to unveil in a few days new rules that would allow first-time home buyers to use an
$8,000 federal tax credit to make a down payment on homes," CongressDailyAM (subscription) reports.

"Several large U.S. banks undertook big capital-raising efforts on Tuesday, hoping to satisfy regulators who want bigger cushions against a deep recession, or proof that they have enough of a buffer already," Reuters reports. "Bank of America Corp, which regulators last week ordered to find $33.9 billion of capital, sold $7.3 billion of China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) shares to a group of investors, according to a person directly involved in the sale who was not authorized to discuss it."
Politics: Gay Marriage Legislation Advances In New York

"The State Assembly approved legislation on Tuesday night that would make New York the sixth state to allow same-sex marriage -- a pivotal vote that shifts the debate to the State Senate, where gay rights advocates and conservative groups alike are redoubling their efforts," the New York Times reports. "In a sign of how opinion in Albany has shifted on the issue, several members of the Assembly who voted against the measure in 2007 voted in favor of it on Tuesday."

"Gov. Sarah Palin has signed a book deal with HarperCollins Publishers for what is described as her memoir," the Anchorage Daily News reports. "Palin and HarperCollins would not say how much she was being paid. Asked why, the governor and former Republican nominee for vice president said she didn't want to distract from the substance of the book."

"In a move cheered by conservatives, the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that ministers and pastors do not risk losing their tax-exempt status for engaging in political acts on behalf of issues such as traditional-values advocacy," the Washington Times reports. "The IRS said in a letter to the Niemoller Foundation that the Houston-based nonprofit organization did not violate its tax-exempt status when it brought together pastors and politicians to champion moral issues during Republican Gov. Rick Perry's
2006 re-election campaign."
National Security: McChrystal Made His Name As A Manhunter

"Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the former Special Operations chief who is President Obama's new choice to lead the war in Afghanistan, rose to military prominence because of his single-minded success in a narrow but critical mission: manhunting," the Washington Post reports.

"Disguised in Afghan Army uniforms and a burqa, Taliban fighters carried out coordinated attacks in eastern Afghanistan Tuesday, leaving at least nine people dead after a daylong hostage siege and a gun battle with American forces, government officials said," the New York Times reports. "The assault, which included a bombing outside the governor's office in Khost Province, was one of a number of increasingly audacious attacks that seemed intended to underscore the vulnerability of the government."

"Despite heavy pressure from colleagues, Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye," D-Hawaii, "said Tuesday he will not propose buying more C-17 transport aircraft when his committee marks up the FY09 supplemental spending bill Thursday," CongressDailyAM (subscription) reports. "Inouye said he would prefer to add funding to the FY10 Defense appropriations bill for the Boeing Co.-built planes, which the Obama administration did not request in its supplemental or annual budget requests."
World: Pope Calls For Palestinian State

"Pope Benedict visited the Israeli-occupied West Bank" today "to hammer home his calls for an independent Palestinian state and the lifting of Israel's embargo on Gaza," Reuters reports. "Cheers of
'Long Live the Pope, Long Live Palestine' rose up as Benedict rode through the narrow ancient streets of
Bethlehem to start his first visit as pontiff to Jesus's birthplace."

"The European Commission imposed a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion)  fine on chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday and ordered it to halt illegal rebates and other practices to squeeze out rival AMD," Reuters reports. "The EU  antitrust fine is the biggest imposed on an individual company, exceeding an
896-million euro penalty last year against glass maker Saint-Gobain for price fixing, and a 497-million euro
fine in 2004 on Microsoft for  abuse of dominance."

"Voting is drawing to a close" today "in India's largest election ever, and a slowing economy, terrorism and the rural poor have been front and center in the campaign," the Wall Street Journal (subscription) reports.

"But of growing concern are the country's teeming new megacities, which are swelling rapidly even as jobs dry up and funding for infrastructure disappears."

"The nation's top military, intelligence and homeland security officials are recommending that" Obama "establish a new White House cyber czar under the National Security Council with broad policy-setting authority for protecting both public- and private-sector computer networks, according to sources familiar with the discussions," the Washington Post reports.

"The Homeland Security Department plans to deploy a new departmentwide enterprise records management system to improve its ability to store, retrieve and archive electronic documents, DHS' top management official said" Tuesday, Federal Computer Week reports. "Elaine Duke, DHS' undersecretary for management, said the new system officials hope to start under a pilot program in fiscal 2010 would allow the department to manage its records more efficiently and improve searchability."

"Google, the Internet goliath, is on a collision course with President Obama even though its employees and executives have lavished money and support on America's new chief executive," The Hill reports. "The administration's signal this week that it will take a more aggressive stance toward monopolies has huge implications for Google, according to several  antitrust lawyers."
Transportation: Committee Won't Add Earmark Transparency

"An extra layer of earmark transparency established by the House Appropriations Committee will not be adopted by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the massive transportation authorization bill the panel plans to take up later this year -- the sequel to the bill that created the infamous
'Bridge to Nowhere,'" Roll Call (subscription) reports.

"A highway bill to revamp the nation's transportation infrastructure should be coming from Congress 'pretty soon,'" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Tuesday, CongressDailyAM (subscription) reports. "In
a luncheon speech to members of the National Retail Federation... LaHood said he expected House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman James Oberstar," D-Minn., "to draft 'probably a five-year bill' that will be very workable in reforming the country's surface transportation network, including high-speed and light rail systems as well as rebuilding roads, bridges and highways."

"Nearly three months after" Obama "approved a $787 billion economic stimulus package, intended to create or save jobs, the federal government has paid out less than 6 percent of the money, largely in the form of social service payments to states," the New York Times reports.
Lobbying: Drug Lobby To Ramp Up Spending

"The drug industry, already the biggest-spending lobby in Washington, is placing an even bigger bet on the influence game," the Wall Street Journal reports. "Potential windfalls and pitfalls in the expected overhaul of the health-care system have energized drug companies, which spent $47.4 million on lobbying in the first three months of 2009. That is up 36% from the first quarter of 2008, according to company disclosure reports filed with Congress and analyzed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics."

"A breakaway group of homebuilders is mounting its own lobbying campaign -- and working around the powerful National Association of Home Builders -- to secure passage of a tax provision that would help its members write off billions of dollars in losses," Roll Call (subscription) reports "The new entity, the Homes for America Alliance, includes about 75 big and small builders."
Energy & Environment: House Dems Strike Deal On Cap-And-Trade

"Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have reached a deal on the most contentious aspects of cap-and-trade legislation for carbon emissions and plan to unveil the bill on Thursday, Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said Tuesday night," Roll Call (subscription) reports.

Jimmy Carter, who presided "over the oil crisis of 1979, told Congress Tuesday that America's energy challenges are deeper and more urgent today than when he was president, but the solutions are the same," The Hill reports. "In testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee, Carter called on Congress to make energy independence a top national priority and urged a comprehensive approach that could blunt the influence of lobbyists."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., "is helping to organize a congressional trip to China around the
Memorial Day recess, with global warming as the focus," CongressDailyAM (subscription) reports. "Word
of the trip came as Congress continued to grapple this week with the climate change issue specifically and
energy legislation in general."

HEIDI COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: We've got a lot to cover in the NEWSROOM this morning.
CNN's Cal Perry is live in Baghdad with the very latest on the sergeant accused in the shooting death at
Camp Liberty. We are also learning more about his victims this morning.

TD
And also, we are learning more about the Taliban and the way that they are upping the stakes with their battle in Pakistan. Our Ivan Watson is reporting on threats being made against politician's family members.

And also, why did this commuter plane crash near Buffalo? This hour a panel focuses on crew fatigue and training.

Let's get started with the story that's shaken many members of the military and their families. The killings on a base near Baghdad. Cal Perry is in the Iraqi capital now with the very latest.
So, Cal, what do we know about Sergeant John Russell?

CAL PERRY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know he's 44 years old. He's previously served three tours with the U.S. military. This was his third tour. He deployed here roughly about a year ago. He would have three months left on what would have been a 15-month tour.

He's serving with the 54th Engineering Battalion based out of Germany. And we also know from speaking with his family down in Texas, Sherman Texas, his hometown, they say the Army meant the world to him. The Army was his life and it meant everything to him.

We also know that his commander had him pegged as a potential problem and took his service weapon away from him just a week prior to that very deadly shooting incident -- Heidi.

COLLINS: Well, if his commander knew Russell had a problem and, of course, took his weapon, as we have reported, how did all of this escalate into -- into where we are now?

PERRY: Well, that's -- that's the big question. We know that he managed to wrangle a weapon from a fellow soldier and in some kind of scuffle before returning to that clinic. But this is why the military is launching not just one investigation but two investigations.

The first, of course, is a straightforward criminal investigation into the shooting. They'll be going through that shooting scene, going through forensic evidence. All this sort of normal things you would see in an event like this.

The second investigation is really an internal look inside the military so they can decide for themselves how this incident could have been prevented and, more importantly, of course, how to prevent further incidents like this from happening in the future - Heidi.
COLLINS: All right, CNN's Cal Perry for us live in Baghdad this morning. Cal, thank you.

We are learning about another side of the army shooting suspect, Sergeant John Russell. CNN's Ed
Lavandera talked with his father and son.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It started with a fight inside this combat stress clinic in Camp Liberty, Baghdad between Sergeant John Russell and other army officers. Russell was being escorted back to his barracks when he snapped.
His father talked about it for the first time.

WILBURN RUSSELL, SOLDIER'S FATHER: As soon as they got a little ways from the facility, he beat the crap out of guy. Took the gun away from him.

LAVANDERA: Military officials say Sergeant Russell then drove back to the clinic and killed five U.S. soldiers. But Russell's father says it wasn't combat stress that made him kill but fellow soldiers who pushed him over the edge.

W. RUSSELL: His wife told me that he overheard (ph) and said, he had the worst two days of his life because some of the officers are threatening (ph) him.

LAVANDERA: John Russell's father and son spoke extensively with us about the Army sergeant's experience in Iraq.

W. RUSSELL: They stressed him. They broke him, you know? They ruined his life. They told him, You're an idiot. You don't belong in here. We're going to break you. We're going to get you out of here.

LAVANDERA: Russell was on his third tour of Iraq. His family says the 21-year-old Army veteran never showed signs of post-traumatic stress and even if he did he wouldn't have talked about it.
W. RUSSELL: He wouldn't have asked for help if he had to. LAVANDERA (on camera): He would have?
W. RUSSELL: No, would not have. No. LAVANDERA: You think that's maybe why they... (CROSSTALK)
W. RUSSELL: He takes to John Wayne, you know? A man's man. You know he's -- he's laid back. He's real quiet.

JOHN RUSSELL, SOLDIER'S SON: Something in his mind just -- just went off and he just had no control over it is what I think.
LAVANDERA: You said earlier he's not -- he's not a violent guy. J. RUSSELL: No, not at all. Not at all.
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Military officials in Baghdad say Sergeant Russell was ordered to undergo counseling last week because of unspecified words and actions.

MAJ. GEN. DAVID PERKINS, U.S. ARMY: Just know that his chain of command had concerns about him. He had been undergoing counseling within the command. Again they had already taken the immediate measure of our removing his weapon.

LAVANDERA: Wilburn Russell says his son feared some army officers were trying to run him out of the military with a dishonorable discharge five years before he could retire.

(on camera): Sergeant Russell's son says he last heard from his father on April 25th in an e-mail wishing him a happy birthday and saying that he was looking forward to the end of his deployment when he was supposed to come home here for a short visit in less than two months.
Ed Lavandera, CNN, Sherman, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)
COLLINS: We are starting to get reaction from members of the victim's families as well. A cousin of Navy
Commander Charles Springle had this to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

Page 146 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ALTON DUDLEY, COMMANDER CHARLES SPRINGLE'S COUSIN: It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking to see it, to see how needlessly his life was taken. Basically, when it was by a fellow soldier.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

COLLINS: Private First Class Michael Edward Yates, Jr. was also a victim. His mother said this . "I think Sergeant Russell just had a lot on his mind and had a hard time adjusting to civilian life. I do have some sympathy and I do know that I can forgive him. I kind of blame the Army for not protecting my son. Someone should have helped this sergeant way before he got this bad."

And we are expecting to hear more from the Yates family in a news conference that's coming up next hour. We will bring that to you live.

Health care, the Supreme Court and college. All in the president's agenda today. In about 25 minutes, the president meets with top House Democrat and health care reform is among the topics they're expected to discuss. The president is going to make comments after that meeting.
And later this morning, President Obama welcome top senators from both parties to talk about the next
Supreme Court nominee. Top members of the Judiciary Committee will be there.
And tonight, the president will be in Arizona. He's giving the commencement address at Arizona State
University.

Now to Pakistan this morning. While fighting rages on between the Taliban and Pakistan's army in the Swat Valley, the militants are also engaging in psychological warfare. Now threatening members of Parliament and their families.
CNN's Ivan Watson is joining us now live from the capital of Islamabad. So, Ivan, what exactly are they threatening?
IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the spokesman for the Taliban, the face of the Taliban in the Swat Valley is a man named Muslim Kahn. And Heidi, you may be interested to know that he says he lived in the U.S. working as a painter for four years up until 2001 in and around Boston.

Now speaking on the phone with me today from the Swat Valley, he said that anybody who is a member of the national or provincial parliament who is from the district of Mingora in northwest Pakistan, anybody from those parliaments, must resign in three days. Otherwise their relatives who are still living in that area will be kidnapped and their properties will be destroyed -- Heidi.
COLLINS: Wow. You've got to wonder what kind of effects these threats are having on those people. WATSON: I've been speaking with some of the more than half million refugees that have poured out of
northwest Pakistan in the last 11 days, Heidi, and many of these people are terrified of the Taliban
because they've heard of the daily kidnappings of people whose throats have been slit at night, of schools
for girls that are systematically bombed and sabotaged by Taliban fighters.

On the flip side of that, however, there are many supporters of the Taliban among these refugees. People who say the Taliban are good people. They're honest. They're fighting for Islam.
COLLINS: Wow.

WATSON: One example that one boy told me, they've dropped the price of public transport in the village that they live in, just to give you a sense of how split the society is. COLLINS: Yes.
WATSON: Heidi?

COLLINS: I mean, that is quite dichotomy. All right, very good, Ivan Watson for us live from Islamabad this morning.
Thank you, Ivan.

We could get new reaction to the Taliban threat when Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hold a joint news conference about two hours from now. Our Paula Newton is covering their meeting and if we hear any news from there we, of course, will bring it to you.

At least seven people are dead this morning in a suicide bombing targeting a U.S. military base. It happened outside of the entrance of Camp Solerno. That's near the city of Khost. And the U.S. military says no international troops were among the casualties; four Afghan security guards are dead.

Page 147 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The attack at Camp Solerno comes one day after militant launches a series of suicide attacks on government buildings in the city of Khost.

Pope Benedict XVI is calling for peace and reconciliation in the Middle East. Palestinian authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, hosted the Pope as he spoke today in Bethlehem in the West Bank.

The pontiff urged Palestinians and Israelis to put aside their, quote, "grievances and divisions." He says he supports the right of Palestinians to a secure and sovereign homeland. The Catholic Church leaders is on
a weeklong visit to the holy land.
I want to get on over to Jacqui Jeras now standing by in the Weather Center with the very latest. (WEATHER REPORT)
COLLINS: Just before the crash, new details coming out about the pilot of the flight that crashed in Buffalo. Ice may not have been the only problem.

And a patent on an invention is common practice but what a about a patent on parts of the human body? It's more common than you might think. Now the legal fight is on.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COLLINS: A legal fight over human genes. The U.S. government is being sued for granting a company a patent on two genes linked to breast cancer. That's right, patents on human genes. It sounds kind of weird.
CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here to sort it all out. Hey there, Sanjay. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
COLLINS: Maybe we should first try to understand exactly what the plaintiffs are suing for?

GUPTA: Yes. What they're suing for, the ability to patent genetic materials as you mentioned. The idea of owning genetic material and the idea that, you know, other companies don't have some stake in this. Aren't able do something with this genetic material. Use it for discovery.

It's exactly as you say. These genes called the breast cancer 1, breast cancer 2 genes, BRCA-1, BRCA-2. People may have heard of it like that -- if you haven't increased your likelihood of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
So if you're a woman who's concerned about this because of a family history, you go to your doctor, you
get tested for and it comes back positive and you say, you know what, I want to get a second opinion or get
tested somewhere else, you can't, because there's one company that owns the patent on this -- on these
particular genes.

COLLINS: Well, OK, so back up just a second. If I understand you right, what this means is somebody who discovered something that they were maybe surprised to discover, like a gene, they then basically own it and they're the only people who can research it. Nobody else can go in this route?

GUPTA: Well, yes, I mean, you know, they will make the argument that it's not quite that simple, they didn't sort of simply stumble upon about this. They were doing -- you know they were doing research and they sort of found this particular code of genetic sequence here. But also they also define the techniques to be able to isolate that particular gene, to determine what it meant and to develop the testing for it as well.

And the idea, you know, sort of -- and this is not a new argument by any means, Heidi, is that if you allow patents like this to go forward, it inspires innovation. It inspires companies, incentivizes them to do work like this because they can patent it. Obviously that's the biotech sort of argument here.
COLLINS: Sure.

GUPTA: The flip side of the argument is, well, what about other companies who want to offer new tests? What about the idea of more progress and more innovation? Is that somehow stymied if a single company has a patent on this?
COLLINS: Yes. Exactly. And what if another company is better at it or smarter? GUPTA: That's right.
COLLINS: I mean how does this affect the future of genetic research?


Page 148 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GUPTA: Well, you know, what we're sort starting to hear is this idea that look, you can patent it but it may be not -- shouldn't be so broad-reaching so as to exclude possible progress and innovation.

I don't know exactly how they're going to do that, frankly, but it's a really interesting convergence between medical science, brand- new technology, and of course the legal aspect of it, driving up the middle but I think in the end, you know, they're suing on the basis, saying this is unconstitutional.

They're suing on the basis saying you can't -- you shouldn't be able to patent this sort of thing but this isn't new. I mean out of genetic material, the genes that exist, about 20 percent already patented.

The first patent was over 30 years ago when it came to genes so we're hearing about this sort of for the first time because of this lawsuit but this has been something that's been ongoing for a long time, Heidi.
COLLINS: Yes, I certainly think it will be a surprise to a lot of people. All right, our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
Nice to see you, Sanjay, thank you. GUPTA: Thanks, Heidi.
COLLINS: Not the way it was supposed to end. Passengers sent scrambling down emergency slides when their plane's tire catches on fire.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN, the most trusted name in news. Now back to the CNN NEWSROOM. COLLINS: Love that song. The shuttle Atlantis crew waking up to Jeff Johnson's "Upside Down" this
morning.

Now, it's on to the difficult and dangerous task at hand. Atlantis' in place alongside the Hubble space telescope. They'll grab it with a robotic arm in just a few flowers now but NASA is afraid the shuttle could
be hit by some of the large amount of space debris in the Hubble's orbit. The shuttle Endeavour is standing by if a rescue mission is needed.

Engineers back on Earth are taking a closer look at these pictures today. The white spots are dings on the heat shield. NASA doesn't know right now if they'll end up being a problem during re- entry.

Why did Continental connection flight 3407 go down near Buffalo earlier this year? That could be the accident that left 50 people dead and having many questions answered and asked, I should say. Could it have been prevented?

The National Transportation Safety Board hearing on the crash is going on right now in Washington. Today they are focusing on pilot fatigue and hiring and training practices. Meanwhile, we're getting new details about the moments before the crash.
Here now, our Allan Chernoff. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): "Jesus Christ, we're down," exclaimed pilot Marvin Renslow. Then First Officer Rebecca Shaw screamed as Flight 3407 crashed into a private home near Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

Those are the final 20 seconds of the cockpit voice recorder. Only minutes before, Shaw told Renslow of her fear of crashing in icy conditions. That was a violation of cockpit rules requiring all discussion to focus on landing the aircraft.
Why couldn't Captain Renslow save the plane?

The National Transportation Safety Board is examining Renslow's training at Colgan Air, the regional carrier that operated Flight 3407. Renslow never received hands-on experience with the safety system in the Bombardier Q400 aircraft. Called a stick pusher that activated to prevent the plane from stalling.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you know of any stick training or stick push or training that was done in the actual Q400 prior to the accident?

PAUL PRYOR, COLGAN AIR: In the simulator, no. In grounds proportion it is covered so it's information that's not practical experience with handling anything.
Page 149 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.
CHERNOFF (voice-over): The airline doesn't have to provide that training according to the FAA.

TINA SINISCALCO, SISTER OF CRASH VICTIM: This should not have happened, no. 50 people should be enjoying their lives right now.

CHERNOFF: Captain Renslow was fully FAA certified. But he had failed five pilot tests. Three of which occurred before he joined the airline. Colgan Air says Renslow revealed only one of those failures to the airline. Those facts led the safety board to ask an official from the aircraft's manufacturer if a more experienced pilot could have saved the plane.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you believe this was a recoverable stall? WALLY WARNER, BOMBARDIER: My opinion is yes.
CHERNOFF (on camera): Pilot fatigue is another issue the NTSB is examining. Captain Renslow had 22 hours off before reporting to work at Newark Airport where the flight began but he was seen sleeping in the crew room there. And the first officer, Rebecca Shaw, she commuted through the night to get to work at Newark.
Allen Chernoff, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)
COLLINS: A scary landing for some Southwest Airline passengers. It happened in Houston. You can see one of the rear tires there on fire. The plane blew the tire when it landed.

When it finally stopped the passengers were evacuated on those inflatable emergency slides. Nobody was seriously hurt. The plane was reportedly ready to fly again after a tire change.

The big topic on our blog right now, how hard it is for the members of the class of 2009 to find a job? We asked you to tell us what you think. It turns out there's some good news sprinkled in with the bad.

Our first comment is from Michael in North Carolina. He writes, "I just graduated with my master's degree in accounting and I do have a job lined up. The majority of my graduating class secured jobs before this past Christmas."

But Clarissa from Kansas writes this, "I will graduate this Sunday with a degree in political science and international studies. I spent all summer interning with the State Department and spent nearly two years working on campaign. But these experiences have not been enough to help me find a job. Graduation will not be quite the celebration for most of us this year."

Then from Stephanie, "I'll be attending Clemson University to get my PhD. Grad school definitely seems like the better bet at this point."

And from Sam in West Virginia, "I will be graduating Saturday with a degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering. Fortunately, I've spent the past two summers as an intern with an oil company and was offered a job upon graduating."

Lots of stories out there. We want to hear them. We want to hear about all of this from you and our other stories as well on our blog. Make sure you check it out, CNN.com/newsroom.
If you thought foreclosures were bad in March and they were, just wait until you see April's numbers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ANNOUNCER: Live in the CNN NEWSROOM, Heidi Collins.

COLLINS: On Wall Street, investors get an update on the health of the U.S. consumer. There have been a number of signs, recently, that the economy is stabilizing. But is that enough to get Americans shopping again?

Susan Lisovicz at the New York Stock Exchange now with the very latest on that and how it will affect the trading day today.
Hey there, Susan.
SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Heidi.

Page 150 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Well, buyers weren't shopping and investors aren't going to be buying. At least at the open. We learned an hour ago, Heidi, retail sales fell by nearly half a percent last month. That was worse than Wall Street was expecting.

To make matters worse, the March numbers were revised lower. Signs that the economy may not be recovering as quickly as many of us had hoped. You know it's just not going to be a smooth process getting out of here and sometimes I think the hopes are a little unrealistic.

There's the opening bell. No applause perhaps for Macy's. But drop in retail sales pushed the largest department store operator in the U.S. to an $88 million first quarter loss. That's more red ink than it reported in the same period a year ago. Macy's shares right now are down 3 percent.

No coincidence, retail sales down, foreclosures are up. Realty Tracks says the number of homes facing foreclosure jumped 32 percent last month compared to a year ago. Christine will have more on that in just a minute.

European regulators, meanwhile, slapping Intel with a record fine of nearly $1.5 billion. The  European      Commission said the chipmaker violated antitrust laws by paying computer makers to delay or even cancel products that contained ships made by AMD,  Intel's biggest rival. It was unsportsmanlike behavior, according to the  European Commission.

Verizon, meanwhile, selling its traditional phone line business in 14 states to Frontier Communications. The price? More than $5 billion in stocks. The deal narrows Verizon's focus to its more profitable wireless broadband and Internet services.

And one minute into the trading day. Yes, we're seeing some consistence here in three major averages. They're all down by about one percent.
Didn't like the retail sales, Heidi? COLLINS: Yes, I don't think so.
All right, Susan, we'll check back later on. LISOVICZ: Yes. I'll be back.
COLLINS: Thank you. More people lost their homes last month than possibly any other month before. April's foreclosure numbers reached a shocking record high.
Joining us now live to talk about that, Christine Romans in New York. Hi, there, Christine.
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Heidi.

It was pretty shocking. Three hundred and forty-two thousand homes got foreclosure filings just in the month. I mean, you think of that, that's like every day 2,100 homes. The padlocks going on the front door and the bank repossessing them by the time you get down to the bank repossession.

So everything from the default notice, all the way down to lock in the front door, a shocking number according to RealtyTrac. That's their word. We knew that March was an explosion of these things. And then in April, it just continued. And frankly, a lot of people think these numbers are going to continue to be bad.
COLLINS: Yes.

ROMANS: Because the banks are now -- they've now stopped their moratorium on foreclosures. And they have to go through the process of finding people who just can't pay these bills, just can't afford these homes. Those are the hardest hit states you're seeing there. Florida, Nevada, Arizona, California, Illinois. A lot of these states have seen these numbers mounting. And, frankly, just getting worse.

One in 374 homes got notices in the mail in April. Everything from just being told, you're late to being -- you're in the middle of the process to here's your court date. Some parts in Florida, for example, there are courts, Heidi, where they're doing a rocket docket of just, you know, 12, 16 hours of just, boom, foreclosure filings. You've got 30 days to get up-to-date, or you're going to be out. Boom, you've lost your house, you know. There are really a lot of activities on this front.

My sources are telling me they think that the government's program, the making home affordable programs won't take root for a few more months.

Page 151 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
COLLINS: Right.

ROMANS: In the meantime, the banks have started going through the process again of trying to  fine the people who they think they can save with refinancing modifications, but there are some people who they can't. And those people are losing their houses.

COLLINS: Yes. Boy, and there's going to be a lot more of them it sounds like, too, especially if you don't have a job. I mean, you're really not going to be able to afford that house payment. ROMANS: And that's -- it started with bad mortgages. Now this is with loss of jobs. So, you're right. As home prices declines, it just feeds on itself, Heidi.
COLLINS: Yes, no question.
What about "Romans' Numeral" today? Anything uplifting there?
ROMANS: Actually yes. And it's uplifting out of the wreckage of the housing number. COLLINS: OK.
ROMANS: I'm going to give you a number, Heidi. I want to see if you can maybe venture me a guess. COLLINS: OK.
ROMANS: One hundred and sixty-nine thousand dollars. What do you think that number represents in the housing market? Any guesses from you?
COLLINS: Average price of homes -- I don't know. I'm looking at your face on the monitor here. ROMANS: You're right. It is the median price of a home in this country, $169,000.
If you're one of the high-cost, you know, coastal city -- you're like, wow, that's a great number. But that number has been falling, falling, falling. And here's the hope. When you look at an $8,000 first-time home buyer credit, when you look at mortgage rates that have been around five percent, in some cases less, you are seeing about half of the homes purchased by first-time home buyers. As that price of a home falls, it hurts the value of our biggest asset, oh, boy. And it hurts other people as your neighborhood value
declines.

But it is providing some opportunity for the first-time home buyers, who got priced out of that runaway real estate market of the late 1990s and 2000s. And some economists are telling me if you can get stability, just people getting in there and starting to buy homes, it might help stem the declines and be the first kernels of stability in the housing markets. So that's -- that's the hope. There are people who are finding some opportunities in the wreckage of this foreclosure crisis.
COLLINS: Oh, sure. Sure. Definitely.
All right. Well, we're always looking for that good news. Thank you, Christine. Appreciate it.
ROMANS: Yes.
COLLINS: AIG took billions of your tax money to stay afloat. And today, the company's top executive has
to lay out a plan to pay it all back. CEO Ed Liddy is going before a House Committee at the top of the hour.
The government gave AIG a $182 billion bailout saying it was too big to fail. AIG nearly went under
because of risky derivatives trading.

It's been tough trying to get the nation's big banks to pick up their lending. So today Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is turning to the little guy. He's speaking at a convention for independent community bankers this hour. Smaller banks have less of those toxic assets than the big banks, but they're also getting demands for tougher lending rules.

The father of the soldier accused of killing five other troops in Iraq hopes his son is found temporarily insane. Sergeant John Russell is charged with five counts of murder. According to his dad, Russell snapped when he thought officers were trying to drive him out of military. Russell's commander ordered him into counseling last week, but it is not clear why.
We can expect Defense Secretary Robert Gates to be asked about the incident during his hearing on
Capitol Hill today.

CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr joining us now live.
So, Barbara, how is the Pentagon handling this case? I mean, where does it go from here?

BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Heidi, I think still days later around the Pentagon, around the U.S. military, just extreme shock at this very tragic incident. Really unprecedented what occurred here.

Sergeant John Russell now charged with five counts of murder. So the military justice system will now proceed with those charges against him, and we will see how all of that turns out. What case his defense makes. What case the prosecution makes. And, of course, five families of those who died in this incident who were killed, mourning their loved ones and the Russell family, obviously, in a good deal of shock.

There are two investigations under way, however. The criminal investigation into what exactly happened in that mental health facility where the shooting took place. Precisely, what happened and how it happened.

But separately, a fact-finding investigation under way, if you will, looking at, what was behind all of this? What were the procedures people followed? How could it possibly ever be kept from happening again?

That's something when these very serious incidents happen, the military always does. They go step by step, who knew what, when, how did things transpire? How can they possibly ever keep something this awful from ever happening again? And, of course, the issue of mental health, post-traumatic stress.

COLLINS: Sure. STARR: This continues to be a major issue in the U.S. military. I think it's a safe bet. Secretary Gates may reference it on the Hill later today. Constantly looking at that issue. How longer these tours of duty? How many tours of duty in the combat zone before it's one too many? - Heidi.
COLLINS: Right. And that all-important downtown in between tours, obviously, something to talk about. Barbara, you may not know the answer to this, but something we are talking about here in these cases.
You know, maybe something that they'll learn from this is whether or not a soldier who is determined to be
disturbed or stressed, at what point would he or she need to be taken out of theater?

STARR: Well, that's right. That's exactly right. At what point? You know, they talk a lot about the buddy system. If you see a buddy out there who's in trouble, we'll take them off the line for a while. But at what point should someone actually be taken out of the combat zone and be sent back home? And is that enough?

I think one of the things we're beginning to hear now from top commanders is the notion of cumulative tours of duty. Year after year after year. At some point, no matter how much time you spend back at home with your family, at some point, is it just one tour too many? - Heidi.
COLLINS: We will be watching for answers on all of that, certainly. CNN's Barbara Starr, our Pentagon correspondent.
Barbara, thank you. STARR: Sure.
COLLINS: And more on who knew what, when, about alleged torture during the Bush administration? A source close to Nancy Pelosi tells CNN the House speaker was briefed in February 2003, that waterboarding was used on CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah. Pelosi has said she was never told that actually happened, only that it was being considered. Some Republicans are calling for Pelosi to testify before Congress.
Next hour, a former FBI agent who interrogated Abu Zubaydah will be testifying.

Recently, the Grand Old Party has been trying to portray a grand new image. Some, though, see only grandstanding and a lot of infighting.
Our senior political correspondent Candy Crowley now with a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is the latest in what some party officials see as an unsettling, unhelpful string of Republican-on-Republican assaults: GOP chairman Michael Steele on why Mitt Romney did not win the Republican presidential primary.


Page 153 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MICHAEL STEELE, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: It was the base that rejected Mitt because of his switch on pro-life, from pro-choice to pro-life. It was the base that rejected Mitt because it had issues with Mormonism.

CROWLEY: Suggesting the most reliable Republican voters are intolerant is called being off-message. Suggesting the most reliable Republican voters are intolerant of a man likely to run again is called a double oops.
John McCain does damage control.

SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I think the fact that Mitt Romney succeeded as much as he did and remains an important and central figure in our Republican Party -- and I wouldn't be surprised to see him run again -- is a testimony, I think, to the inclusiveness of the Republican Party.

CROWLEY: Circular firing squads are a Democratic specialty. It's new for Republicans, who are rudderless and leaderless and fighting over how to win elections. Some think the party can win with ideological purity. Others argue, you can't make the party purer; you have to make it bigger.

ED GILLESPIE, FORMER REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: In a country of 300 million people, for one party to have a majority of the voters, you have to be, inherently, a coalition. You have got to assemble a lot of different groups of people. And not all of those groups of people will agree on every plank in the platform.

CROWLEY: And that split explains why the more moderate Mitt Romney sniffed when told that the more purely conservative Sarah Palin made "TIME" magazine's 100 most-influential people list.

MITT ROMNEY (R), FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR: Was that the issue on the most beautiful people or the most influential people?
(LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: I'm not sure.
CROWLEY: Party purity versus the big tent also explains Colin Powell's observation that Rush Limbaugh hurts Republicans, Rush Limbaugh's suggestion that Colin Powell leave the party, and Dick Cheney's statement that he thought Colin Powell had already left the party.

Not to be left out, '08 wannabe Mike Huckabee -- he launched a rocket at a new Republican group set up as a kind of mini-think tank to push the party forward. The group includes Romney, Jeb Bush, John McCain, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, all big-tenters. Steamed that they seem want to downplay social issues, like abortion, Huckabee denigrated the group's plan to go on a listening tour, writing that it
was "hard to keep from laughing out loud." He called it sad that Jeb Bush thinks the party needs to get past
Ronald Reagan.
The hits just keep on coming. Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)
COLLINS: Another U.S. state moves a step closer to legalizing same-sex marriage. The New York State Assembly last night approved a bill to legalize gay marriage. The vote was 89-52, with five Republicans backing it.

One GOP assemblywoman told "The New York Times," a lesbian couple who lives on her street helped changed her vote to, yes. The measure now moves to the New York State Senate. If it becomes law, New York will be the sixth state to allow same-sex marriage.

Parts of the Great Lakes region and Midwest could see some nasty weather today. Our Jacqui Jeras will tell us when it may hit just ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COLLINS: Jacqui Jeras standing by now over in our severe weather center to talk about -- boy, I'm looking behind you at all of those graphics, and it certainly does not look good.
(WEATHER REPORT)

HARRIS: Meanwhile, it's usually a case of hurry up and wait, but that could change today. Chasing the path of a storm chaser.

CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano on the roads of north Texas somewhere chasing the chasers of the next big storm.
So, yes, it looks like you might have some action today here, Rob.

ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, we saw some action yesterday actually. It didn't look all that good, but we traveled a couple of miles across the Texas panhandle and caught up with a couple of storms with these guys with their -- all their instruments and fancy radar manage to sample some data. So it wasn't a complete bust after starting out with crystal blue skies. Here's a look at a little adventure.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARCIANO: Shortly after 10:00 local time. Just had the weather briefing and the decision has been made to travel, a couple to - three hours, actually.
So, activities ramped up here and everybody is on the move. We've got one more live broadcast in about
20 minutes. So we'll be behind the eight ball, but we hope to catch up. And if conditions ripen, see our first
storm.

Well, it's a whole other ball game over here. Couple hours west of Texas now. Shed a couple of layers. Sunny, severe, clear. Temperatures into the mid-80s. We've pretty much moved the staging area into this truck stop parking lot. Kind of see those clouds out there in the distance. I assume that's what they're scanning.

There's DOW7. You see the radars whipping around there, probably scanning those clouds off there in a distance. Let's go see what they're looking at.

ERIK RASMUSSEN, VORTEX2 TEAM LEADER: There's some convection or showers trying to form out there where it's a lot drier. If that happens, there could be some cold air and spreads out on the ground and initiate some more storms. If those storms can move off to the area behind me, where it's more humid, potentially it may become a super cell.
MARCIANO: What kind of odds are you giving for this to continued to grow, (INAUDIBLE) and develop? RASMUSSEN: I think probably better than even we'll be chasing it later today.
MARCIANO: I'll take those odds.

Those puffy white cumulus clouds earlier have grown somewhat. Now blocking out the sun. We've kind of moved our position, moved the entire armada actually to this other town just to the east. And now we're waiting for this thing just to grow a little bigger and we'll probably get those dopplers working again, scanning the storm.

Visually, this is a pretty cool storm. We're following (INAUDIBLE) into this area that has some rain, actually verga (ph) and some downdrafts just coming down and just kicking up this dust. That may be as close as we get to a tornado. This dust from the downdraft.

Well, no tornadoes. But, got a couple of cool storms and beautifully back lit by a setting sun. So maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MARCIANO: They were gorgeous, though, Heidi.

No tornadoes. Didn't intercept any severe thunderstorms. But the storms across that part of Texas, the way the landscape is laid out and the way the skies were clear was certainly gorgeous.

Today, moderate risk as Jacqui Jeras probably has told you. So it looks to be an increasing likelihood to see at least some hail, possibly some tornadoes.

It's important to note, Heidi, that for these guys, you know, it's just as important for them to sample data from that thunderstorm that doesn't produce a tornado as for one that does.
COLLINS: OK.
MARCIANO: Because they're trying to figure out the difference.

Page 155 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
COLLINS: Right.

MARCIANO: They want to able to predict in the future more accurately, which ones will drop a tornado and therefore be able the warn people more accurately - Heidi.
COLLINS: OK. Got it. All right.
Well, good luck with the chase. Of course, stay safe.
And we should always remind everybody, these are professionals out there doing this work. Rob Marciano, we'll keep up with the chase. Check in with you later on.
Thank you.

Location, location. Not for buying a house, though, but for picking an affordable college. We'll tell you where to find the cheapest colleges.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COLLINS: Our National Transportation Safety Board hearing into that commuter plane crash near Buffalo that killed 50 people continues today in Washington. The focus will be on the pilot's training, and whether or not the crew was suffering from fatigue.

New details emerging on the crash finds the pilot may have lacked the proper flight simulation training he needed to handle the situation.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expected to be the keynote speaker at NYU's commencement ceremony scheduled for 11:00 this morning. It's being held this year at New York's new Yankee Stadium. More than
6,000 graduates and about 20,000 guests are expected to be there. Secretary Clinton will also get a doctor of law honors degree at the ceremony.

And supermarkets across the country thinking food safety. The industry announced today it plans to improve the quality of the food they sell. They hope to improve food safety by implementing a better warning system. Finding better, sure ways to detect problems and impose tougher processing standards.

And we want to get back to our 2009 segment that we have been talking about. Graduates this year. It is that time of year, in fact, high school students in the class of 2009 are getting ready to head off to college. And parents know it's going to cost.
Ever wonder, in fact, which states have the cheapest and which have the most expensive colleges? Well, personal finance editor, Gerri Willis, is just the gal with all the answers.
So, Gerri, let's go ahead and get the bad news out of the way. Where do people pay the most for their state school?
GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: All right. Well, good morning, there, Heidi.

Yes. We got these from the National Center for Public Policy of Higher Education. Here are the expensive states. Pennsylvania, where it takes 41 percent of an average family's income to pay for one year of tuition fees, room, and board at a local public four-year college. Ohio wasn't far behind with 39 percent. And in Delaware, it takes 37 percent of a family's income for one year of college. Now, these figures exclude financial aid.
And Heidi, you may be wondering, why these states? That makes no sense to me.

Remember, these packages, these tuitions are highly correlated with how well these states are doing in the recession. Are their budgets tight? Are they not tight? So that's -- that's how these two ideas connect.
COLLINS: OK. Got you. So what about the cheapest states for the college now?

WILLIS: Tennessee, where it only takes 13 percent of a family's income for tuition fees, room and board. Louisiana is next. And finally, Georgia, your own state of Georgia, 15 percent of an income there goes to college tuition.
So if you're looking for a bargain, a deal, Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia. Those are the places to go. COLLINS: All right. Interesting.

Page 156 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So this is the time really when parents are getting their financial aid award letters, right?
So what's the best way to compare these offers?

WILLIS: We may think it's easy, but it's not easy to compare since colleges have their figures and costs in different formats. You'll want to look at what's called expected family contribution. That's the bottom line. The amount of money your family will be expected to contribute.

You'll make the judgment about whether you can afford this amount. But some colleges will include loans in your total aid, financial aid package to get down to the true cost to you of the school, subtract out these loans for the financial aid packages. And remember, these loans, obviously, have to be repaid. Consider not just the cost of tuition and fees, but also out of pocket expenses like books and room and board. And that, of course, can differ depending on where you live - Heidi.
COLLINS: Yes, of course.
All right. Well, Gerri, some very interesting information. Thank you so much.
WILLIS: My pleasure. Thanks.

COLLINS: As always, a lot going on this morning. We want to check in with some of our correspondents now to see what they're working on.
First to you, Barbara, at the Pentagon.

STARR: Good morning, Heidi. More details on the latest tragic murder of five U.S. troops in Iraq. We'll have more at the top of the hour.

DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dana Bash on Capitol Hill, where Senate Democrats are preparing for their first hearing on harsh interrogation methods since Bush era memos were released. We are going to hear from a former FBI interrogator who simply says waterboarding doesn't work. I'll have that story at the top of the hour.

LISOVICZ: I'm Susan Lisovicz at the New York Stock Exchange, where stock prices are declining and the fury over executive pay is growing. Well, the chairman of Citigroup said it would be a mistake to curb compensation on Wall Street.
Heidi, we'll hear Dick Parson explain why in an exclusive interview in the next hour. COLLINS: Yes. We know who that is.
All right. Susan Lisovicz, thanks so much, and everyone else as well.
Also, a cereal young children adore and adults are encouraged to eat under fire now from the Food and
Drug Administration. We'll tell you.

HD           COMPUTER GIANT SLAMS RECORD £953m FINE
BY           By Geoff Meade, Press Association Europe Editor, in Brussels

LP
American computer chip giant  Intel slammed the European Commission today after being served with a record £953 million  fine for breaching EU rules on fair competition.
The fine - more than one billion euros - is by far the biggest ever imposed by the EU's  competition
authority.

TD
It comes after an inquiry in which the Commission found  Intel guilty of deliberately keeping rivals out of the global market for computer chips.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated." But Intel chief executive Paul Otellini denied the charge.
"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices," he said.
"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal."

The Commission says Intel gave major computer companies "wholly or partially hidden" rebates on condition that they bought almost all of their x86 central processing units - computer chips - from  Intel.

According to the Commission,  Intel also gave one major computer retailer direct payments on condition that the retailer stocked only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs.

The European Consumers' Organisation, BEUC, welcomed the Commission decision, and called for an EU legislative plan to launch a "Group Action" to seek compensation for  Intel's consumer victims.

BEUC said  Intel's policy left consumers with a lack of choice and innovation, claiming: "They (consumers) paid too much, as the chips represented between 15% to 30% of the final price of the computer."

Monique Goyens, BEUC director-general added: "Consumer choice is the heartbeat of a competitive economy. Intel have been shown to have denied effective consumer choice and as a result kept prices artificially high and slowed the pace of innovation.

"Such a large  fine should deter companies that might think they will get away with such anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices.

"Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices. Consumers have been paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated. This will only be possible with a Group Action procedure.

Page 159 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We therefore urge the  European Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal establishing a collective court action for victims of anti-competitive practices.

"It is not acceptable that such a number of consumers suffer damages and have no way to obtain justice."
The Commission said Intel's anti-competitive behaviour was mainly aimed at its smaller rival AMD. Between them the two companies make almost all the central processing chips which run the world's
personal computers.
But the  Intel chief insisted: "We do not believe our practices violated European law.

"The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales, the other does not.

"The Directorate General for  Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision.

"We believe this evidence shows that when companies perform well the market rewards them; when they don't perform, the market acts accordingly."

He added: "Intel never sells products below cost. We have however, consistently invested in innovation, in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology.

"The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace, passing along to consumers everywhere the efficiencies of being the world's leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors."
Today's massive  fine is the result of a Commission investigation triggered by complaints from AMD in
2000, 2003 and 2006.
A Commission statement insisted: "Intel's rights of defence have been fully respected in this case." end

HD      Statement by Grant Aldonas,  Senior Advisor at the Center for Strategic  and International Studies (CSIS) and Former Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, on the European             Commission's Ruling on Intel Today

ARLINGTON, Va., May 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The following is a statement from Grant
Aldonas:

"This is a potentially costly ruling for both the United States and Europe. It could lead to higher computer prices, which will hinder investment in information technology, making both economic recovery and improvements in our long-term competitiveness more difficult. Given the implications for R&D that drives Intel's investment in both Europe and the United States, it makes little sense to divert these funds to the European Union's coffers instead. If the United States wants to remain competitive, it is vital that it not follow this European model of punishing companies for the simple reason that they are more successful than their competitors.

TD
There is, however, an important lesson here for the new Administration. President Obama's efforts to get the economy back on track can easily be derailed by making the wrong choices in other areas of economic policy. Following the European Commission's approach, which amounts to insulating  Intel's competitors from vigorous competition, would erode, rather than encourage, rising U.S. productivity and competitiveness.

Given the broader trend toward protectionism we see globally in the face of the current economic crisis, I can't help but wonder whether the EU's singling out of an American company for this sort of  fine isn't protectionism by another name, with the  fine replacing the more conventional means of protection, like tariffs, that the WTO now enjoins."

HD      European Ruling on Intel Business Practices  Represents  Excessive  Market Intervention, According to Legal Expert Geoffrey A. Manne

LP
LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., May 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Geoffrey A. Manne, Lecturer in Law, Lewis
& Clark Law School and Director, Global Public Policy, LeCG, LLC, put out the following statement today
on the European Commission's decision on Intel:
"Continuing a tradition dating back at least as far as the famous disputes over the
Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas and GE-Honeywell mergers, but having its fullest modern expression in its
ongoing battle with Microsoft, the  European Commission's announcement of a decision and $1.45
billion fine against Intel represents the culmination of both bad  antitrust and excessive market
intervention.

TD
"The former problem stems from Europe's enforcement of its  competition laws on evidence of harm to competitors rather than  competition. While harm to competitors can be evidence of (or a prelude to) harm to competition, the theories supporting this are weak, controversial, and unsupported with evidence. At the same time,  Intel's behavior undeniably results in significant, immediate gains to its customers, who have seen remarkable increases in computing power coupled with equally remarkable decreases in cost over the course of the last 10 years or so. The latter problem, excessive market intervention, actually arises out of the first.  Competition policy that is concerned with the fortunes of particular firms will almost inevitably find justification for market intervention in markets where economies of scale and network effects create market winners and losers.

"Although the EU has claimed to be moving away from an antitrust that manipulates markets to mirror a bureaucratic conception of 'perfect  competition,' and toward an antitrust concerned with actual competitive effects, EU law and enforcement policy make 'effects-based' antitrust, particularly when the industry leader is a strong foreign competitor, an unlikely outcome."

BOSTON, May 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Keith N. Hylton, the Honorable Paul J. Liacos Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law, issued the following statement in reaction to the  European    Commission's ruling on the investigation of  Intel's business practices.

TD
"The EC decision to impose the largest  fine in its history on  Intel, largely for its price cutting, sends a worrisome signal to dominant firms in the U.S.  Antitrust law in the U.S. has largely abandoned the idea that consumers can be made better off by punishing firms that cut prices aggressively," said Professor Hylton. "Punishing large firms for cutting prices provides a strong incentive for those firms to avoid price competition, and this hurts consumers in the long run. Recognizing this, U.S.  antitrust law has in effect provided a safe harbor from antitrust liability for large firms that cut prices when selling to U.S. consumers. The EC decision on Intel effectively destroys that safe harbor once the firms start selling their goods on the global market."

WASHINGTON, May 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The following is a statement of Ronald A. Cass, Chairman, Center for the Rule of Law, on  Intel Anti-Trust Decision:

The European Commission's record-setting  fine on chip-maker Intel Corporation pushes Europe further along the path of substituting regulation for  competition. The EC's use of huge  fines against market-leading firms -  fines calculated from a firm's world-wide sales, not from harm to European consumers - discourages aggressive competition that benefits consumers. Consumer harm should be the concern for competition law, and here instead consumers saw sharp declines in cost and increases in product quality - even Intel's complaining rival, AMD, enjoyed historic success during the period it claims Intel's actions foreclosed  competition.

TD
Extreme penalties can unfairly pressure companies to capitulate, and prosecutors often use the threat of a big punishment to avoid real testing of the underlying case. New York's Eliot Spitzer, for example, raised his own political profile while bankrupting firms later found innocent. Similar risks to the rule of law follow from the EC's  Competition Directorate acting as prosecutor, investigator, and judge, with no real
separation of functions and no impartial decision-maker until a Commission decision is appealed to court.

This case, like several other EC decisions in recent years, shows why American firms go "forum shopping" in Europe, taking complaints about American competitors where they're most likely to get a favorable decision. With America's new  antitrust regime shifting to a more European approach to dominance cases, Europe may lose its position as a preferred forum for complaints. But unlike market competition, competition to see which regulators can be toughest on dominant firms doesn't lower prices or improve products for consumers.

Statement by Jonathan Zuck, President of the Association for Competitive Technology

BRUSSELS, Belgium, May 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The European Commission today ruled that Intel abused its dominance in the x86 microprocessor market and imposed a fine of 1.06 billion euros. Association for Competitive Technology (ACT) president Jonathan Zuck offered the following comments in response: "The  European Commission's efforts to manipulate  competition in the technology industry without identifying actual consumer harm are worrying. Innovation and  competition are thriving throughout the industry, and even the most successful firms must continue innovating and competing on price or risk being toppled."

TD
"The microprocessor industry is not an exception. The software industry depends on continued competition and innovation on the x86 platform, and we are worried about regulators distorting this market and potentially slowing innovation. For the past 20 years, the microprocessor industry has delivered more innovation, more speed, more functionality, and lower prices. Over the past ten years, the average price of Intel's PC microprocessors has dropped by 60%. When the only one complaining about the competitive situation is AMD, it raises serious concerns about the efficacy of this action."

Zuck added: "Despite the announcement of a more aggressive stance by the US Department of Justice, AMD will still have a tough time in the US. The US  competition agencies will demand proof of actual consumer harm. Proof that we have not yet seen, and proof that seems to fly in the face of all available public data."

The Association for Competitive Technology (ACT) is an international education and advocacy group for the technology industry. Focusing on the interests of small and mid-size entrepreneurial technology companies, ACT advocates for a "Healthy Tech Environment" that promotes innovation,  competition and investment. ACT has been active on issues such as intellectual property, international trade,
e-commerce, privacy, internet policy and  antitrust. ACT represents more than 3,000 software developers, systems integrators, IT consulting and training firms, and e- businesses from around the world.

HD      European Commission slaps fine of 1.06 bn euros on Intel

LP
Brussels/New Delhi, May 13 (PTI) The  European Commission has slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros (about USD 1.4 billion) on the world's largest computer chip-maker  Intel for breaching the region's anti-trust laws.

Intel has been fined for using illegal anti-competitive practices to keep away its "only competitor" - Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - and also reduce the consumer choice in the global market for 'x86 chips'.

TD
The penalty amount exceeds the 497 million euros  fine imposed on Microsoft for breaching anti-trust laws in 2004.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated," European Commissioner for  Competition Policy Neelie Kroes said in a statement today.
'x86' Central Processing Units (CPUs) are the main hardware component of a computer.

According to the Commission, the world's largest computer chip maker "used illegal anti-competitive practices to exclude essentially its only competitor, and thus reduce consumer choice, in the worldwide market for x86 chips".

"These illegal actions were designed to preserve  Intel's market share at a time when their only significant rival - AMD - was a growing threat to  Intel's position," it said.

Regarding the European Commission's move, Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini said the company believes the decision is wrong. "Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace ...  Intel will appeal," he said.
Meanwhile, investigation into the matter began after AMD complained in 2000, 2003 and 2006.

The European Commission pointed out that  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of products using its rivals' chips, and also to limit their distribution once available.
"The computer manufacturers involved are Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer involved is
Media Saturn Holdings, the parent company of Media Markt," it added.
The European Commission says the violation continued for over five years, from late 2002 till the end of
2007. During that period, Intel had at least a 70 per cent share of the world market for these chips.
Moreover, the  fine represents 4.15 per cent of  Intel's turnover in 2008.

The world market for x86 CPUs is currently estimated to be about 22 billion euros per year and Europe accounts for nearly 30 per cent of it.

BRUSSELS - The European Union finedIntel Corp. a record $1.45 billion on Wednesday and ordered the world's biggest maker of computer chips to stop illegal sales tactics that shut out Silicon Valley rival AMD.

The fine, which exceeded a $1.3 billion  monopoly abuse penalty imposed on Microsoft Corp. last year, was denounced by Intel, which plans to appeal to an EU court within 60 days.

TD
AMD's stock jumped in midday trading Wednesday, while  Intel shares were up slightly.

"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for over five years, the size of the  fine should come as no surprise," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Intel did not compete fairly, frustrating innovation and reducing consumer welfare in the process," she said.

The European Commission also told Intel to immediately cease some sales practices in Europe, though it refused to say what those were. Intel said it was "mystified" about what it was supposed to change but would comply with the "extremely ambiguous" EU order.

"This is really just a matter of competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious," said Intel's CEO, Paul Otellini.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, has about 80 percent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market and faces just one real rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has its headquarters just three miles from Intel in Sunnyvale.

The two companies have been fighting for years over what AMD claims is  Intel's intimidation of computer makers into striking exclusive deals for the chips they use in their new machines.

AMD claims the rebates and financial incentives that  Intel offers to those companies for buying more  Intel chips are designed to prevent AMD from gaining market share. AMD argues that  Intel's volume discounts are sometimes so steep that AMD can't cut its own prices enough to compete without losing money on the sales.
In siding with AMD to wrap up an eight-year probe, the  European Commission said Intel broke EU
competition law by exploiting its dominant position, thereby limiting customer choice.

The EU said  Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturers Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp. for buying all or most of their chips from  Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

The commission said price discounts were linked to promises from computer manufacturers to restrict AMD purchases. It said such discounts were left off  Intel's official contracts because the company "went to great lengths to cover up many of its anti-competitive actions."

Officials said they learned of them through e-mails and statements from businesses, some seized during surprise raids.

Page 171 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel, said the case was based on weak evidence and unfair inferences from a small number of documents.

But AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer said the decision was "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market."

"AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader, and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Meyer said in a statement.

The decision does not affect  Intel's pricing strategy outside Europe but could have an important effect in the United States and Asia.

This week, one of the top U.S.  antitrust officials, Christine Varney, signaled a return to trustbusting as the Obama administration dropped a strict interpretation of  antitrust rules that saw regulators shun major action against alleged monopolies during the Bush years.

(Updates market share data to Q1)

May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission imposed a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion)  fine on chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday and ordered it halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) .

TD
For a Timeline on the Commission's case against  Intel, click on [ID:nLB111652]
Following are five facts on the rivalry between the two: MARKET SHARE
In the first quarter  Intel made 77.3 percent of the microprocessors that power computers, gaining share each quarter, helped by the success of its Atom chip in the emerging netbook sector and by the continued strength of its brands and products in the desktop, notebook and server segments.
AMD had 2.3 percent of the market, according to research firm IDC. RELATIVE SIZE

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, made revenues of $37.6 billion in 2008. It employed 83,900 staff at the end of 2008, more than half in the United States. Its market value is $85.4 billion and it is the world's biggest chip maker.

AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, made revenues of $5.8 billion in 2008. It employs about 11,000 people and has a market value of $2.6 billion.
CASE IN BRUSSELS

The EU executive said  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely  Intel chips, and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
It ordered  Intel "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing".  Intel
may continue to offer rebates, so long as they are legal, the Commission said.
It said Intel must pay the  fine within three months of the date of the notification of the decision. The U.S. tech group has denied the charges that it was abusing its market dominance, arguing its
conduct had been lawful and beneficial to clients and consumers.
CASES ELSEWHERE

In December 2008 Intel filed a formal complaint to overturn an earlier South Korean  antitrust ruling that it had abused its dominant market position. [ID:nSEO42148]

Intel said in a statement its filing to the Seoul High Court asserted that the Korea Fair Trade
Commission (KFTC) made substantial factual and legal errors in formulating its final opinion.

Page 173 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The KFTC said in June 2008 that  Intel offered rebates to South Korean personal computer makers in return for their not buying microprocessors from AMD.  Intel was also fined.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into  Intel after South Korean authorities  fined it for offering rebates in return for not buying AMD products.

The group faces more legal woes as a U.S. lawsuit brought by AMD is set to go to court in 2010.  Intel also faces dozens of separate class actions, filed in various U.S. courts, modelled on the AMD complaint.
U.S. LICENCE BATTLE

In March 2009 Intel accused AMD of breaching the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two, a charge that AMD denied. [ID:nN16422958]

Intel alleged its rival ran foul of a 2001 patent agreement when it created the Globalfoundries joint venture, the $4.3 billion semiconductor manufacturer spun off from AMD. (Compiled by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Timothy Heritage, Sharon Lindores)

2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that  Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors.

July 2007 - The Commission accuses  Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws.
January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections". February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at  Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive.
July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers.

October 2008 -  Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission that it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defence.
January 2009 - The court rejects  Intel's appeal.
February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks  Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details.
May 13, 2009 - The  European Commission fines Intel 1.06 billion euros and orders it to halt illegal rebates and other practices intended to squeeze out AMD.

HD        ANALYSIS-AMD faces tough road to benefit from EU aid

SAN FRANCISCO/HELSINKI, May 13 (Reuters) - The record  European Commission fine against Intel can at best help keep  competition alive in the computer microprocessor market, but rival AMD will not benefit unless it solves its own internal problems.

The Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its dominant market position by trying to exclude others from the microprocessor market, and ordered the U.S. firm to change its practices. [ID:nLD471703]

TD
"It might be slightly positive for AMD, but I really don't expect it to have a material change in the landscape or their opportunity," said Doug Freedman, analyst at Broadpoint AmTech.

"AMD's success is going to be predicated on their own ability to execute their roadmap and continue to bring innovative technology to the market," Freedman said.

In 2004, when the EU decided on the similar Microsoft case, it tried unsuccessfully to create competition where it did not exist. Microsoft holds a 95-percent share of personal computer operating systems now, as it did in 2004.

On Wednesday, the EU had the more modest goal of preserving  competition because while Intel has never held that kind of quasi-monopoly, it faces  competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its scale is still staggering -- it controls roughly 80 percent of the microprocessor market.
(to see graphic click:  http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/059/EQ_PCMKT0509.jpg)
"Consumers benefit from having AMD around because it keeps  Intel's prices under control," said David
Kanter, analyst at Real World Technologies.
PC demand has shown some resilience compared with the previous downturn, and last month  Intel
CEO Paul Otellini said the worst was over for the battered tech sector. [ID:nN14455703]

Intel's orders and billing patterns so far in the second quarter have been slightly better than expected, Otellini said this week. [ID:nN12342726]
FOCUS ON PRODUCTS, FINANCES

Sales of PCs fell 7 percent in January-March, with consumers' move to low-cost laptops -- including netbooks -- keeping shipments from slipping further. Research firm IDC has forecast netbook shipments to double in 2009.

Intel's market share is benefitting from the netbook boom as its Atom chip has a dominant position there
-- while AMD has had to shy away from this market due to its limited resources. Its Neo chip offers more
but is more costly and lifts PC prices.

"The two companies tend to leapfrog each other ... I think it's down to AMD's execution over the next few quarters. Netbook is precisely one of the areas where AMD needs a different approach," said Chris
Ingle, research director at IDC.

Page 179 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last week AMD merged its microprocessor and graphics chip businesses to adjust its structure and claw back market share lost to  Intel in the wake of its bungled introduction of the Barcelona chip in 2007. [ID:nN06289886]

The Barcelona chip was delayed for months due to a technical bug, causing AMD to give back hard-won market share to  Intel and resulting in massive losses.

Analysts say several new or upcoming AMD chips offer good opportunities for the company to gain share again, but loss-making AMD needs more capital to support major innovations.

To free resources, AMD earlier this year spun off its manufacturing operations to a new company, a joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi state-owned venture capital firm. [ID:nN02433513]

"AMD has recently come out with some exciting new products, and they could claim that hey, you know, we've got great products and the only thing standing between us and more market share is  Intel's heavy hand," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood.

INTEL TO CHANGE INSIDE?

The EU executive said  Intel paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used AMD chips, paid illegal, secret rebates so computer makers would use mostly or entirely  Intel chips, and also paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips.
It ordered  Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing."

Intel may continue to offer rebates, so long as they are legal, the Commission said.

Analysts said if  Intel's business practices were still deemed to be against the ruling, the firm was likely to have to change its business practices.

"We've seen them in the past basically admit to not doing any wrong, but also at the same time stop the specific practice that is found unacceptable," said Broadpoint AmTech analyst Doug Freedman.

HD    Intel Corporation Conference  Call Regarding  European Commission Decision  - Final

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the  Intel conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chuck Mulloy. Please go ahead.

TD
CHUCK MULLOY, MEDIA RELATIONS, INTEL CORPORATION: Joining me this morning is Paul Otellini, President and Chief Executive Officer for Intel. By now most of you have probably seen the press release from the European Commission and the press release with Paul's statement in reaction to that. For purposes of this meeting this morning, Paul will make just a few brief remarks, and then we'll turn it back over to the operator for questions. Paul, welcome and go ahead.

PAUL OTELLINI, PRESIDENT, CEO,  INTEL CORPORATION: Thanks, Chuck. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. I just wanted to make a couple of brief comments and then throw it open.

You probably have all seen that  Intel received notice of a decision made in Brussels early our time this morning. We have not seen the document yet; we've seen a three-page summary of the document. The document, we're told, is over 500 pages, so it will take us a while to internalize it and really understand everything that's in there.

But at the highest level, they appear to have made a decision that involves a  fine of EUR1.06 billion, a  fine that is to be paid or negotiated in terms of a bond within 90 days, and we're working on what the terms are around that as we speak.

The allegations essentially come down to  Intel granting conditional rebates where the conditions weren't just volume-based, but also alleged to [be] based around exclusive dealings or significant large shares of customers' volume or, in one case, exclusivity on retail shelves.

Let me just say first of all that  Intel strongly disagrees with this decision. We do not have those kinds of conditions in our contracts. Our contracts are straightforward. They're consistent worldwide, and they are volume-based. The more you buy, the less you pay.
We intend to appeal this decision to the Court of First Instance, which is the first place in this process
where there is a third party that will actually review all the evidence. We believe that a significant amount of
evidence was either ignored or disregarded or both by the case team, that would refute allegations that
they made in their own claims.

I think I'll hold it there -- one last statement. We intend to abide by whatever is written in the decision, once we finish reading it, while we go through the appeal process.
CHUCK MULLOY: Thank you, Paul.
Operator, we will update up for questions now.
OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) [Ali Bantz], The New York Times.

ASHLEE VANCE, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Hey guys, this Ashlee. Paul, can you talk a little bit more about what this evidence is that you guys showed them? It seems to be a real point of contention.

Page 181 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
PAUL OTELLINI: Well, there was -- without getting into all the specifics, Ashlee, there were a number of documents from the OEMs or between  Intel and the OEMs involved in the allegations that refute what was claimed here. And, in some cases, the OEMs made statements saying that in fact they were not exclusive deals and they were not under conditional terms. And those documents were not allowed either into the case file or used properly by the case team in making their determination.

Many of these documents became available through the discovery process as a result of the US trial that's going to happen in Delaware, some of which are not just from  Intel or the OEM, but also from AMD itself.

ASHLEE VANCE: Any comment at all? It just seems like, obviously, this process has been pretty contentious and the EU had some rather -- almost kind of flippant remarks today. Any comment there?

PAUL OTELLINI: I saw her remarks, and I don't think it's a joking matter. And I think she was making a joke. I'll just leave it at that.

I think the process is long; it's gone on for nine years. It is the process originating from a single complainant, AMD. None of the customers complained, as part of it, or joined the complaint. At the end of Commissioner Croze's press conference, she spoke about harm to consumers. It's hard to imagine how consumers were harmed in an industry which has lowered cost of computing out by a factor of 100 during the term of this case. And at the same time that happened, AMD claims that it's more vibrant than ever.
So I don't see either evidence of consumer harm or competitor harm happening here. OPERATOR: Ian King, Bloomberg.
IAN KING, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, BLOOMBERG: Obviously, you don't agree with the decision and the basis of the decision. But assuming that the EU's decision is upheld despite your appeal, what kind of sort of trouble may, trying to adhere to their desired remedies cause you in terms of the way you do business, please?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, Ian, that's the part I really can't answer yet because that would all be buried somewhere in the 500-page document. We haven't seen that, so the summary that they released it to us, the 2.5-page summary, does not include what the specific remedies they are asking for are. If it is about don't do conditional rebates, based upon exclusivity or exclusive terms, that one's easy. We don't do that to begin with, so there's no change there.
But beyond that, there may be other things in there that we just haven't seen yet. OPERATOR: Jim Puzzanghera, Los Angeles Times.
JIM PUZZANGHERA, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, THE LOS ANGELES TIMES: You are probably aware of the speech that Christine Varney, the new head of the  Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, made on Monday here in Washington. I know that the FTC is handling the investigation here in the US, but I'm wondering if you are concerned, in light of the European decision, of what may be coming down the
pike from federal regulators under the Obama administration.

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, there is an investigation, as you've pointed out, at the FTC. There's also one in the United States by the New York attorney general's office.  Intel is fully cooperating with both of those, Jim. We are producing evidence. We've produced testimony and depositions and so forth. The FTC has had a position on antitrust which is very much comparable, I think, to the EU's. So we're actually being looked at under the same lens today by both parties.

I think the DOJ, Assistant Attorney General Varney's statement, simply makes a statement of how the DOJ is going to view these in their investigations in the future, which to me looks much more like the FTC's current interpretation.

JIM PUZZANGHERA: Does the European decision make it any more likely that the FTC is going to take a similar action?
PAUL OTELLINI: I think you need to ask the FTC that, in terms of the views. But the FTC will look at, I
hope, the preponderance of the evidence and perhaps draw a different conclusion.
OPERATOR: Steve Johnson, San Jose Mercury News.

STEVE JOHNSON, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS: Basically, you have to put a large amount of money into a bond or some other negotiated financial instrument, I guess, within the next three months. But beyond that -- and that's a significant chunk of money, obviously. Beyond that, I'm just trying to get a sense, to follow up a little bit more, on what the business implications could be, both for you and for AMD.
Page 182 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Do you fear that some of the customers out there may just, in fact, want to go to AMD's products to avoid any problem, or that you could be inhibited in some way from doing business, which would increase AMD's share of the market?

PAUL OTELLINI: It's hard to imagine that the dynamics of  competition would change. Most customers buy from both suppliers today. Most customers buy more or less from each supplier, depending on the quality
of the products, the competitiveness of the products and the pricing. That dynamic hasn't changed in my career at Intel, which is 35 years, and I don't expect it to change. I don't think a customer is going to put him or herself at a disadvantage by buying inferior or more costly products just to try to walk lines that may be artificial.
Again, it's very premature to speculate on what's going to be inside that 500 pages, though.

STEVE JOHNSON: At what point -- obviously, there are huge legal costs associated with this which you have been incurring for a great period of time, you and AMD. But at what point does this become a major burden, and has it already become a major burden? Is it becoming a greater financial burden to the Company?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, it's expensive. I haven't found a low-priced lawyer yet that's any good. You want to have the best, and they cost quite a bit. And the whole process, beyond the cost, is time-consuming. Rather than management of the Company and our senior managers spending their time working on new products and out trying to win business, you're spending an awful lot of time in depositions and potentially in courtrooms. And to me, that's counterproductive to the interest of our shareholders.
OPERATOR: Dean Takahashi, VentureBeat.

DEAN TAKAHASHI, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, VENTUREBEAT: Paul, can you explain why the  fine is the size it is? Do you have any insight into that at all? Japan came to some similar conclusions but didn't impose any fine.
PAUL OTELLINI: Well, and Korea imposed a  fine of $23 million, and Korea is not 1/1000th the size of
Europe.

No, I don't know. There seems to be no correlation between the number and the process. You'll have to ask the EU how they came up with that, and it's one of the questions we'll ask them when we have a chance to chat.
OPERATOR: Tom Abate, San Francisco Chronicle.

TOM ABATE, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE: At this point you have regulators in Japan, Korea and the European Union having found fault with  Intel, and some jurisdictions in the United States looking at the company. And yet, you say that you've done nothing wrong. Are all of these people way off base, or is there something that the company has yet to understand or admit about how it does business?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, let's go through each of those. In Japan there was no admission of wrong and there was no fine, and what they asked us to do was something that we were already doing in terms of the way we write our contracts. So there was essentially no change to our business practice in Japan. We've gone through three years of subsequent audits in Japan with no violations or no additional comments, number one.

In Korea, that was a similar process to what we saw in the European Union. As you know, we have appealed the Korean ruling. We have very good confidence that on appeal, when you get to a court of law where you've got the rules of evidence and so forth, that that will reverse itself.

Similarly, in Europe, at this point in time the Commission has made its decision, and no third party has reviewed it. We believe that when third parties do, in the light of all the evidence that -- they will find that our behavior was within the law.

And as to the US thing, it's just an investigation at this point in time. We've been investigated before and came out just  fine.
OPERATOR: Brooke Crothers, CNet.

BROOKE CROTHERS, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, CNET: Could you give us some insight into how the rebates -- excuse me, not the rebates -- but you talked about the more you buy, the less you pay. How
does the bundling work, exactly? NVIDIA has been making assertions also about Ion, and they are trying to


Page 183 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
get Ion into systems. But they claim that  Intel is running interference. Can you just give me some comments about that?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, they're two different things. One is the way we price our microprocessors, and then the other is that, on occasion, we'll sell a combination of microprocessors and other chips at a price which is more favorable than if the people bought the products independently. They have a right to buy the
products independently. They have the right to mix and match products. But we believe that, relative to our
CPU chipset pricing, that there's no harm nor foul there.

On the rebates, it's a simple volume discount kind of environment. We bid for business under a number of conditions, some of which are trying to meet  competition. Our customers put business up for bid. We bid on it, AMD bids on it. And when you have a market which is principally supplied by two players, when one company wins, the other, by definition, will lose the business.

And so I think this is really just a matter of  competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious.
OPERATOR: Wolfgang Gruener, TG Daily.

WOLFGANG GRUENER, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, TG DAILY: Quick question -- could you give us an idea of how Intel currently sees its investment in manufacturing and R&D in Europe and how the ruling, if it is upheld, may affect this investment at all?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well,  Intel has something north of EUR5 billion invested in Europe. That's principally -- we have 6000 employees there. The majority of those employees are in Ireland. Ireland is our fourth largest manufacturing site in the world and the largest outside of United States. So it's a significant investment, and it makes -- that site produces some of our most advanced products. And we really see no change to that, nor to that investment.

We have research and development efforts spread throughout Europe, principally a number of labs and engineering sites. And again, no change to that.

The sales and marketing team may be impacted by whatever is buried in that 500 pages in terms of the procedures they have to follow and so forth, but that's to be determined.
OPERATOR: Kirk Ladendorf, Austin American-Statesman.

KIRK LADENDORF, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN: Hi, Paul. I just wanted to clarify, because there's some speculation by analysts. Are you saying that  Intel has not engaged in these anti-competitive practices ever, or just since you have been CEO?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, the period of time that the decision referred to was 2000 to 2007. So I was CEO for two of those years and Craig was CEO for the others. And my comment was speaking for the Company spanning the entire period.
OPERATOR: Mark Spoonauer, LAPTOP Magazine.

MARK SPOONAUER, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, LAPTOP MAGAZINE: I just wanted to follow up on a couple things that you've raised so far. The first was that you said that your customers haven't complained. I'm not sure if you mean end users or notebook manufacturers themselves. But I guess my point would be, why would customers complain because they would probably fear losing your business if they did?

My second point or question is, could you just clarify what you said about charging more for, let's say, the processor by itself, the Atom processor, versus the Atom processor plus the chipset? Are you saying that you do charge more for Atom by itself?

PAUL OTELLINI: The first part was, I was commenting that, to my knowledge, none of the OEMs, the computer manufacturers, joined the complaint. They were not complainants in the European action, and I believe that's true, although we haven't read the document. But up to yesterday that was true, and I didn't see anything new today that would change that.

As to our customers' fear, it's absurd to think that we would not sell product to someone who happened to not like a particular comment or term or whatever it is. This is a very competitive business. Our customers are in most cases larger than  Intel. Our customers have incredible buying power and are excellent negotiators.
So on the face of it, your scenario is absurd.

As to Atom -- yes, we have historically offered better pricing to people that buy more product, nothing new there.
OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Damon Poeter, CRN.

DAMON POETER, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, CRN CHANNEL: You mentioned earlier that there was Intel and OEM evidence that you said wasn't allowed into the EU process. In light of that, in the Delaware case, why not relinquish the request from  Intel that the evidence there be sealed so everyone can see it and we can see that?

PAUL OTELLINI: I think it's because our customers don't want it released. But I'm not up to speed on all the legal stuff. But my understanding is that we'd be okay on that, and the customers have said no, the OEMs.

CHUCK MULLOY: That's why there was a protective order in Delaware. And just one other note -- this is Chuck Mulloy -- don't misunderstand. That protective order was negotiated by all the parties, including AMD, Intel and the customers. It's not just  Intel's.
OPERATOR: Michael Copeland, Fortune Magazine.

MICHAEL COPELAND, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: There's a line in the statement from the  European Commission, and it says, in addition, there's evidence that  Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments. I know you guys haven't seen the 500-page document, and you've touched on some of this. I just wanted a response to that sort of language.

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, I saw it. That's a summary statement, and I saw it as well, [Tom]. I don't know what to make of that. The way I interpret that is that the EU alleged that we had exclusive deals. They further alleged that they couldn't find any evidence of those exclusive deals, and that therefore, they must be either oral or unwritten or hidden from them.

I view it as being -- they affirm the fact that in fact there were no terms and conditions associated with exclusivity here and there were no conditions that were not documented. My God, these people picked up tens of millions of documents. They got everything they wanted to. It's hard to imagine that we would have terms that they wouldn't have found that exist.

So I really am baffled by that statement and I think it's actually helpful to us as we look through this thing that in fact there are no documents that show what they are alleging.
OPERATOR: Cade Metz, The Register.

CADE METZ, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, THE REGISTER: Just to get back to the end user/customer issue, do you anticipate perhaps civil suits following this announcement? And what sort of additional
burden is that? And at what point down the road does the end-user see prices increase because of this sort of thing?

PAUL OTELLINI: Well, in the civil suits, I don't know. We haven't seen any in Europe yet. There have been a number of what we would call follow-on class action suits following and mimicking the AMD allegations in Delaware. And those have all been consolidated as part of the Delaware case. Those are -- I think they are all United States actions at this point in time.

So it remains to be seen in Europe. As I recall, there was one consumer group, it was an activist consumer group in Europe, but I don't believe they filed any kind of case against us.
What was the second part of the question, please? (multiple speakers) about prices; right?

CADE METZ: Prices. So I'm just curious, as these legal problems mount, at what point is the end-user affected? Will they see a difference in the price of PCs at a certain point?

PAUL OTELLINI: I think they will absolutely see a difference in the price of PCs. Certainly, the quality; the prices continue to go down. Quality goes up, performance goes up. There's nothing in this ruling that reverses Moore's Law.
CADE METZ: Right. But as your costs increase, will that be such a burden that it might trickle down? PAUL OTELLINI: Our costs don't increase. Yes, there's a cash charge here, which is the  fine. But our
product costs and the way run our business and our investment pattern has not changed.

RICK MERRITT, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, EE TIMES: The EC documents put out today provide a lot of very specific charges, and they name companies and dates and practices. And although they say this wasn't in the  Intel contracts, they claim they have a lot of other pieces of evidence that support these
details in e-mails and presumably oral testimony.
Is there anything that you can say, without naming your customers, to give any evidence to the contrary? PAUL OTELLINI: Well, whatever we say will be in court. There is, as I said, a preponderance of evidence
that we think is exculpatory, including statements from our customers saying that what was alleged is not
true. I can't reveal those at this point in time, but they will come out in the course of both the Delaware trial
and the appeals process in Europe.

RICK MERRITT: As a follow-up, what do your legal advisers tell you about the likelihood of being able to win on appeal and the time frame of an appeal?

PAUL OTELLINI: We haven't seen the document, so it's just pretty hard to do that. My sense is, an appeal would be a couple of years away, probably, two to three years out. But it really depends on what's inside that 500 pages.
OPERATOR: Maureen O'Gara, Client/Server News.

MAUREEN O'GARA, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, CLIENT/SERVER NEWS: Is it your understanding, Paul, that the remedies are just for Europe, or are they supposed to be for worldwide?

PAUL OTELLINI: I think that's to be determined. We don't know yet what -- how they are construed or constrained. In the past the European Union has claimed global influence over actions that affect European consumers, so that a chip sold in China might have an effect on them. But that is to be determined, I think, as we read the document.
MAUREEN O'GARA: Thanks.

CHUCK MULLOY: Alright, everyone, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today.

TD
Brussels, 13/05/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 13 May, as part of its procedures into abuse of dominant position, the European Commission imposed a record fine of €1 060 000 000 on Intel Corporation. Addressing the press, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated". The abusive practices targeted by the Commission's decision took place throughout the period October 2002-December 2007 and involved the worldwide x86 CPU market worth almost €22bn (30% of which is in Europe). With a strategy that aimed to benefit from its solid market implantation, where it contained at least 70% market share,  Intel, concluded the Commission, undermined  competition to the detriment of innovation and consumers. The two specific forms of illegal practice detected were: - the conditions created by granting rebates to computer manufacturers (Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC) as well as those imposed on a big distributor (Media Saturn Holding, the Media Market parent company); - payments aimed at preventing the sale of rival products from Advanced Micro Device (AMD), which lodged a complaint in 2000.

Abusive conditional rebates and payments. Two elements were challenged.  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from Intel. These conditions changed and were imposed during different periods (between 2002 and the end of 2007). They were based on an obligation of excessive loyalty to  Intel. Some manufacturers had to buy their x86 CPUs exclusively from  Intel for their computers, while others had to purchase no less than
95% of their CPU needs for business desktop computers from Intel, which therefore left barely any room for their needs to be provided by products open to competition. The Commission explained that
according to a settled case-law of the Community Courts, where a company is in a dominant position on a market, rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival's products, or not buying them at all, are abusive.

Intel's structured pricing policy was restrictive and dissuasive. It prevented AMD from competing on a level of intrinsic quality of its products and it reduced consumer choice. If a business decided to purchase
certain AMD products open to competition, it would lose a large part of its rebate on much bigger purchases that it had to make at Intel, in keeping with past agreements. Furthermore,  Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.

Payments to halt or delay launch of rival products.  Intel also awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from  Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products and/or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD-based products. The Commission found that  Intel's behaviour was
anti-competitive and consisted of postponing the launch of computers that were equipped with AMD processors by several months, or limited the sale of certain computers to SMEs. The Commission also pointed out the US firm had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.
Record fine. The fine is colossal and the biggest  fine ever imposed for abuse of dominant position
(Microsoft was fined, after appealing, €899 million last year) but it might be raised. Anti-trust rules allow
Page 188 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the Commission to impose a  fine that is equivalent to 10% of the firm's global turnover. It represents
4.15% of Intel's 2008 turnover. This  fine will have to be paid in the three months after notification of the
decision. If Intel appeals at the European Court of Justice, which the company has confirmed that it will
do, the fine will have to be paid into an account that is blocked until the final verdict. If the sanction is
confirmed, the  fine will be paid into the EU budget and help reduce member state contributions by the
same amount. In a press release, Paul Otellini,  Intel Corp's CEO declared: “We believe the decision is
wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by
constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been absolutely zero
harm to consumers”. (A.B./transl.rh)

HD      Intel hit with $1.45 billion fine in Europe; chipmaker accused of strong-arming its rival, AMD BY     By JORDAN ROBERTSON

LP
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -  Intel Corp. was fined a record $1.45 billion by the European Union on Wednesday for using strong-arm sales tactics in the computer chip market -- a penalty that could turn up the pressure on U.S. regulators to go after the company, too.

The fine against the world's biggest chip maker represents a huge victory for  Intel's Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, the No. 2 supplier of microprocessors to PC makers.

TD
AMD has sued Intel and lobbied regulators around the world for the past five years, complaining that  Intel
was penalizing PC makers in the U.S. and abroad for doing business with AMD.

Although the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also investigating, AMD seems to have found its most sympathetic ear in Europe.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by
"deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market."

"Intel did not compete fairly, frustrating innovation and reducing consumer welfare in the process," she said.

The commission told Intel to immediately stop some sales practices in Europe, though it wouldn't say what those were. Intel said it was "mystified" about what it was supposed to change but would comply while it appeals the fine.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company also defended its sales practices -- which include rebates to big  Intel
customers -- as legitimate.

"This is really just a matter of  competition at work, which is something I think we all want to see, versus something nefarious,"  Intel CEO Paul Otellini said in a conference call with reporters.

AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer said the decision was "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market."

"We are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers," Meyer said in a statement.

The biggest previous  fine levied by the European Union for anticompetitive behavior was $1.3 billion, brought against Microsoft Corp. last year.

Whether  Intel could face punishment in the U.S. remains to be seen. But the EU's  fine against Intel could push the issue to the forefront for the Obama administration.

"If there was ever a time not to appear to be a large firm behaving badly, this would be it, as the financial collapse has the U.S. and EU competing for which government is the most proactively protecting
consumer rights," warned Rob Enderle, a technology industry analyst. "This judgment makes  Intel the ball in what is likely an international game of one-upmanship."

The Obama administration signaled this week that  antitrust enforcement would be pursued more vigorously than in the Bush administration, whose Justice Department filed only three anti-monopoly cases, all involving mergers. Yet the Justice Department has been silent on whether it is investigating Intel.
The Federal Trade Commission investigation of  Intel could result in the agency asking a court to order
Intel to alter its practices. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment.

Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer specializing on European  antitrust law, cautioned that Europe is known for its aggressive antitrust enforcement and that a case brought against  Intel in the U.S. or elsewhere might be milder.

The EU fine is "hugely significant because it's  Intel, and the amounts at stake are enormous," he said. But "it is known that the commission takes a very hard line on this type of behavior."

The Intel-vs.-AMD fight exposes an ugly part of the business for microprocessors, which essentially are the brains of personal computers.

Unlike other parts of the PC industry that have lots of competitors, microprocessors come from only two sources. Intel has about 80 percent of the market, and AMD -- headquartered a few miles away in Sunnyvale -- has the rest. That means a victory for one is a defeat for the other.

The process of getting a chip into a computer and onto the shelves has two main steps, and AMD has cried foul about  Intel's behavior at both stages.

First, a computer maker has to agree to buy the chips. In that stage, AMD has alleged,  Intel has illegally used its dominant position by offering huge rebates to PC makers that promise to buy lots of  Intel's chips. AMD argues that the discounts can effectively make some chip orders free, and that it would have to lose money on sales in order to keep up.

The case before the  European Commission alleges that  Intel illegally undermined AMD with computer makers Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC.

In AMD's U.S. lawsuit against  Intel, set to go to trial next year in Delaware, executives from Gateway complained that  Intel's threats of retaliation for working with AMD beat them "into guacamole." The lawsuit also quotes Toshiba officials saying  Intel's financial incentives amounted to "cocaine."

Second, chip makers help persuade stores to carry PCs with their processors inside, and pay the retailers to help promote the machines. In the case before the EU, regulators said  Intel paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer to stock only  Intel-based computers at its MediaMarkt superstores -- even in Dresden, where many AMD chips are made.

Kinsella, the specialist on European  antitrust law, said "loyalty rebate" programs are common, but become a problem when dominant companies use them. In a similar European case, tire maker Michelin was fined in 2001 over its rebate program in France.

Kinsella said the accusation that  Intel paid companies specifically not to use AMD's products would set this case apart from others.
"If that's true," he said, "that would be pretty far out there in terms of examples of  abuse."

Investors were expecting the  Intel fine and seemed unfazed.  Intel stock lost 8 cents to close at $15.13. AMD was up 3 cents at $4.38.

HD          Intel slapped with EU fine --- Regulators levy $1.45 billion penalty, largest ever for monopoly     
abuse

LP
European Union regulators hit Intel Corp. with a 1.06 billion euro ($1.45 billion)  fine -- the largest ever assessed for monopoly abuse -- and called for changes in the way the U.S. company sells the microprocessors at the heart of most of the world's personal computers.

Intel said it would appeal the  fine, but Wednesday's decision confirmed the EU's role as jurisdiction of choice for U.S. tech companies seeking redress from larger competitors, even as the new U.S. administration says it plans to get tougher in pursuing  monopoly practices.

TD
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said  Intel broke EU rules by using the threat of withdrawing rebates it offered to large computer manufacturers, its customers, to pressure them to buy all or most of their chips from  Intel rather than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Intel also paid manufacturers to delay the launch of AMD-based computers and paid a retailer, Media
Saturn Holding, to sell only  Intel-based machines, the EU said.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said Neelie Kroes, the EU's top  antitrust regulator. "If we smell that there is something rotten in the state, we act."

Besides the  fine, which amounts to about 14% of the $10.6 billion in cash and investments on the company's balance sheet,  Intel was ordered not to offer the conditional rebates that the commission deemed problematic. But the regulator left vague how it would police that order. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had revenue of $37.6 billion in 2008.

The decision is a blow to the image of the world's largest chip maker.  Intel has strongly defended its business practices while blaming scrutiny of its actions on complaints by AMD.

But now three regulatory bodies that have examined evidence from computer makers -- in Europe, Japan and South Korea -- have dismissed Intel's arguments that it has merely offered discounts and rebates that are a common facet of competition.

In addition to seeking to overturn rulings outside the U.S.,  Intel must also prepare for possible action against the company by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and private  antitrust litigation by AMD and class-action plaintiffs that goes to trial next year.

Proving the plaintiffs' cases under U.S. law is likely to be tougher, legal experts say, but a victory could lead to even bigger  fines than the EU imposed, and possibly additional restrictions on the company's sales practices.

The Intel decision in Europe comes as U.S. regulators jettison Bush-era legal guidance that led to narrow scrutiny of monopolists. In a speech Monday, Department of Justice  antitrust chief Christine Varney said regulators "cannot sit on the sidelines any longer." That could mean greater convergence with European regulators, who have been more willing to bring antimonopoly actions, including a marathon case against Microsoft Corp. Ms. Varney knows the field well: She represented
browser-maker Netscape in the U.S.  antitrust prosecution of Microsoft in the 1990s.

Ms. Kroes said the Justice Department's stance gave her a "huge positive feeling. The more
competition authorities joining us in our  competition philosophy, the better it is."

At its heart, the EU's case against  Intel is a classic monopoly prosecution:  Intel, the EU alleges, used its muscle -- particularly with rebates -- to push smaller rival AMD to the margins of the market.

In one case, the EU said,  Intel for 2 1/2 years made rebates to one manufacturer conditional on that manufacturer "purchasing no less than 95% of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel." The EU said  Intel gave conditioned rebates to computer manufacturers including Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Lenovo Group and NEC Corp.

Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement that the company takes "strong exception to this decision," which he called "wrong." He also stressed a point that  Intel has made regularly: that prices over the years have fallen for computers and chips. There has been "absolutely zero harm to consumers," he said.

Mr. Otellini didn't directly address rebates, but said thanks to investments in manufacturing facilities, "we can discount our products." He denied that  Intel sells below cost.

Intel said it would challenge the decision at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which hears appeals of the actions of the EU  antitrust regulator and other branches of EU's executive arm. The court process is likely to take years.

"Intel is one of our suppliers and we don't comment on a supplier," said Sven Jacobsen, a spokesman for Media Saturn Holding.

Getting this far hasn't been easy. Nearly nine years in the making, the case required even more gestation than the EU's seminal 2004 decision condemning Microsoft for  monopoly violations. Some career regulators inside the tech-industry unit of the EU's  competition directorate have spent a decade on the two cases. Microsoft's  fine of 497 million euros in 2004 was a record at the time for a  monopoly case; last year the EU added 899 million euros to Microsoft's tab for not complying with the 2004 decision.

Intel's run-in with the EU began with a complaint from AMD in 2000, four years before Ms. Kroes took up her post. The case nearly outlasted her; Ms. Kroes's term is scheduled to end this year.

Intel won't have to shell out cash for the  fine immediately; it can provide a bank guarantee for the amount, an  Intel spokesman said.

Monopoly-abuse cases are relatively rare in the EU system, and the appeal sets up the Court of First Instance for a significant ruling on the scope of  antitrust jurisprudence in Europe. In a series of cases earlier this decade, the court sharply rebuked the EU's merger-control procedures; the result has been a years-long dearth of challenges to mergers by the bloc.

But the court has given the EU regulator a far wider berth in  monopoly cases -- in a critical 2007 ruling, it backed the EU's 2004 Microsoft decision. In that judgment, the court was disinclined to second-guess the EU's findings of law or fact, and endorsed a view that the regulator has broad authority to bring monopoly cases so long as its reasoning is careful and thorough.
The legal issues in  Intel's appeal will be different, but the specter of Microsoft's loss will loom large.

Intel is likely to press its appeal on at least two fronts: One focus is likely to be the EU's economic analysis of the market. In closed-door proceedings,  Intel has laid out an alternate analysis that gets to a higher cost for its chips -- an attempt to undermine the EU's argument that  Intel has effectively dumped low-cost chips on the market to thwart AMD.

Intel has also argued that the market functions well -- when the company has technological advances, it gains share; when AMD surges ahead technologically, as it did with a move to so-called 64-bit chips, AMD reaps better sales.

Another focus will be the nature of any arrangements between  Intel and its customers. An  Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, says  Intel will argue that deals weren't exclusive. Documents and other evidence not cited in the EU's decision, he says, cast the deals in a different light. In October,  Intel went to the Luxembourg court to seek to compel the EU to include these and other documents in its ruling. The court declined to do so.

In 2005, regulators in Japan ruled that  Intel made illegal payments to manufacturers to induce them to limit purchases of AMD chips. Last year, South Korean regulators found that  Intel gave unfair discounts to manufacturers; Korea  fined Intel $25 million.

TECHNOLOGY

American computer chip giant  Intel has slammed the European Commission after being served with a record £953 million fine for breaching EU rules on fair competition.

TD
The fine of more than one billion euros is by far the biggest ever imposed by the EU's  competition
authority.

It comes after an inquiry in which the Commission found  Intel guilty of deliberately keeping rivals out of the global market for computer chips.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes declared: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.

"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated." But  Intel chief executive Paul Otellini denied the charge.

"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices," he said.

"There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal." The Commission says  Intel gave major computer companies "wholly or partially hidden" rebates on condition that they bought almost all of their x86 central processing units - computer chips - from  Intel.

According to the Commission,  Intel also gave one major computer retailer direct payments on condition that the retailer stocked only computers with  Intel x86 CPUs.
The European Consumers' Organisation, BEUC, welcomed the Commission decision, and called for an
EU legislative plan to launch a "Group Action" to seek compensation for  Intel's consumer victims.

BEUC said  Intel's policy left consumers with a lack of choice and innovation, claiming: "They (consumers) paid too much, as the chips represented between 15 per cent to 30 per cent of the final price of the computer." BEUC director-general Monique Goyens said: "Intel have been shown to have denied effective consumer choice and as a result kept prices artificially high and slowed the pace of innovation.

"Such a large  fine should deter companies that might think they will get away with such anti-competitive and anticonsumer practices.

"Intel should be liable to compensate the victims of its illegal practices. Consumers have been paying too much for their computers and they should be compensated. This will only be possible with a Group Action procedure.

"We therefore urge the  European Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal establishing a collective court action for victims of anti-competitive practices."

Microchips - European Union regulators levied a record 1.06-billion-euro ($1.45-billion US)  fine against Intel Corp., the world's biggest computer-chip maker, and ordered the company to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors.

Following an eight-year investigation, the  European Commission found that  Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers that buy all or almost all of their chips from  Intel. The penalty is the biggest  antitrust fine in the 27-nation EU's history, more than double the
497-million-euro ($674-million US) penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004.

TD
Intel competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which originally filed the  antitrust complaint in the EU
case, gained market share in the first quarter, researcher IDC said.

US technology giant  Intel has been hit with a record £950m EU  fine for abusing its dominant position in the computer chip market.
The sanction dwarfs the £810m penalty slapped on software behemoth Microsoft by the  European
Commission - until yesterday the largest in its history.

TD
The size of the  fine could unsettle BA boss Willie Walsh. The EU is investigating allegations that the British flag carrier operated a cartel on trans-Atlantic routes with partners Iberia and American Airlines.

The Brussels  competition regulator found that  Intel had abused its position as the world's largest maker of microchips for personal computers.

Between 2002 and 2007  Intel paid PC manufacturers to cancel orders that they had placed with arch rival Advanced Micro Devices, the Commission found.

Intel, which will appeal the decision, was also found guilty of offering retailers inducements to favour computers using its technology.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market.' By Simon Duke

The European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR 1.06 billion on  Intel for abuse of its dominant position on the market for computer chips. Intel is accused of engaging in illegal, anti-competitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for x86 central processing units (CPUs). In the period October 2002 to December 2007,  Intel had at least a 70 percent share of the worldwide x86 CPU market. The commission found that  Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice. First,  Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from Intel. Intel also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs. Such rebates and payments effectively prevented customers from choosing alternative products.

TD
Second,  Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products. The commission ordered the company to immediately desist from the practices and said it will actively
monitor Intel's compliance with the decision. The computer manufacturers concerned by  Intel's conduct in the commission's decision are Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarkt chain. The commission's investigation followed complaints from AMD in
2000, 2003 and 2006.  Intel said in a statement that it finds the EC's decision wrong and lacking understanding of the "highly competitive" microprocessor market. The company denied any violations of European law and said it plans to appeal.

INTEL, the world's biggest microchip maker, was yesterday handed a record-breaking euro1.06bn (
pounds 950m) fine for anti-competitive behaviour by the  European Commission.

Neelie Kroes, the European  Competition Commissioner, said Intel had abused its dominance of the microchip market to bully its customers into only buying its chips in the hope of squeezing rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) out of the market.

TD
Mrs Kroes said: "Intel has harmed millions of European customers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated.''

The fine is the largest single  fine ever handed down by Brussels, topping an euro899m  fine levied against Microsoft last year for failing to comply with a previous ruling, in which Microsoft was  fined euro497m.

Although the  fine is record-breaking, it falls short of the maximum penalty the authorities could have levied. Under European legislation Mrs Kroes could have  fined Intel up to 10pc of its total annual revenue which, based on sales of $37.6bn ( pounds 24.5bn) last year, could have resulted in a maximum fine of almost $4bn.

"Given that  Intel has harmed millions of consumers . . . the size of the  fine should come as no surprise,'' Mrs Kroes said.

She also ordered that  Intel must "cease the illegal practices'' which resulted in consumers paying far higher prices for computers than they might otherwise have done in an open market.
Paul Otellini,  Intel chief executive, hit out against the ruling and said the company would appeal.
"Intel takes strong exception to this decision. We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality
of a highly competitive microprocessor market place - characterised by constant innovation, improved
performance and lower prices,'' he said.

Legal experts said the case, which began in 2000, will continue to rumble on for at least two more years as Intel battles its way through European courts of appeal.

AMD, which accused  Intel of resorting to "old-fashioned threats, intimidation and kneecapping'', welcomed the verdict. Dirk Meyer, AMD president and chief executive, said: "The ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market.''

Intel could also face a similar lawsuit in America as the US department of Justice this week embarked on a more interventionist approach to  antitrust issues. Intel has also previously been charged with similar anti-competition offences in Japan and South Korea. It is also appealing against these rulings.

HD     AMD Comments  on European Commission Ruling that Intel Violated EU Law and Harmed

SUNNYVALE, Calif. - The  European Commission today found Intel guilty of abusing its dominant position in the global x86 microprocessor market, saying that ‘Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.

TD
Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU’s  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated.’ The Commission also stated that ‘there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments.’ The EC decision requires Intel to change its business practices immediately and  fines Intel a record EUR 1.06 billion (US $1.45 billion).

‘Today’s ruling is an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market,’ said Dirk Meyer, AMD president and CEO. ‘AMD has consistently been a technology innovation leader and we are looking forward to the move from a world in which  Intel ruled, to one which is ruled by customers.’

‘After an exhaustive investigation, the EU came to one conclusion -  Intel broke the law and consumers were hurt,’ said Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president for legal affairs. ‘With this ruling, the industry will benefit from an end to  Intel’s monopoly-inflated pricing and European consumers will enjoy greater choice, value and innovation.’
The EC decision stated specifically that:

‘Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all, or almost all, their x86 CPUs from  Intel’.

‘Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold  Intel-based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active.’

Intel ‘interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD. Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD-based products.’

Intel has so far failed to convince any  antitrust enforcement agency that its business practices are lawful and pro-consumer.

In 2008, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) issued a 26 billion won  fine (approximately $25.4 million USD) saying that  Intel’s abuse of its dominant position included coercing and paying customers millions of dollars on the condition that they use only  Intel chips, delay launches of AMD products, and/or not develop any new products with AMD chips. The KFTC also found that, ‘South Korean consumers had to buy PCs at higher prices as domestic PC makers were forced to buy  Intel’s pricier CPU.’ In addition to a fine, the KFTC ordered  Intel to stop the practice of offering payments to PC makers conditioned upon them not doing business with AMD.  Intel is in the process of appealing the ruling.
In 2005, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) ruled that  Intel had violated the country’s
anti-monopoly laws by illegally forcing full or partial exclusivity with five Japanese PC makers.  Intel did
not appeal the ruling.

In the United States, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and New York Attorney General’s office are investigating  Intel for abuse of its monopoly position. In 2005, AMD filed private litigation in the US District Court of Delaware, which is scheduled for trial in spring 2010.

HD      ANTI-TRUST POLICY : INTEL CALLS RECORD EU FINE "WRONG DECISION" WC     922 words

Reacting to the arguments put forward by EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes for imposing a record fine on Intel - the company "harmed millions of European consumers" - the American microchip giant immediately hit back, saying "there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers". It will appeal against what it considers to be "a wrong decision".
The European Commission decided, on 13 May, in line with the EU's anti-trust rules, to impose a  fine of
€1.06 billion on Intel Corporation for  abuse of its dominant position (Article 82) and illegal
anti-competitive behaviour, during the period from October 2002 to December 2007, aiming to exclude
competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units' (CPUs). The
Commission also ordered Intel to immediately put an end to its illegal practices in so far as they still exist.
It also intends to "actively" monitor that its decision is respected by  Intel.

TD
Neelie Kroes stressed that "such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated". This explains why the  fine is the highest ever that the EU has imposed on a company. The fine is not a goal in itself, she added, but rather a warning to the market that the Commission intends "to remain very vigilant with regards to the  competition rules and consumer protection". In this regard, she
welcomed "the interest and support" of BEUC and UFC Que Choisir (the European and French consumer associations), which intervened on the Commission's side in this case.
APPEAL

Intel said it would appeal the Commission's decision. "Intel takes strong exception to this decision," Paul Otellini, president and CEO of the Californian company, said in a statement. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace - characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices." "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers.  Intel will appeal," he added.

Intel has already been convicted in Japan and South Korea, and investigations are underway in the
United States.
SATISFACTION

"The EU decision will shift the power from an abusive monopolist to computer makers, retailers and above all PC consumers," said Giuliano Meroni, regional head of AMD, the company that first filed the complaint against  Intel.

The BEUC "welcomed today's record decision of the  European Commission" and recalled in a statement that it had "intervened in the proceedings as an interested third party as consumers have been paying too much for their computers because of  Intel's anti-competitive practices". Monique Goyens, BEUC director-general, stressed that "consumer choice is the heartbeat of a competitive economy.  Intel have been shown to have denied effective consumer choice and as a result kept prices artificially high
and slowed the pace of innovation. Such a large  fine should deter companies that might think they will get away with such anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices".

In BEUC's opinion,  Intel should be forced to repay the victims of its anti-competitive behaviour. This would only be possible via a group action and BEUC is urging the  European Commission to propose

Page 210 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
legislation as quickly as possible that would allow a collective legal action for the victims of anti-competitive practices. Kroes confirmed that the Commission was working on it.
ARGUMENTS

According to the Commission,  Intel had a dominant position in the global market for x86 CPUs, an essential component of computer equipment, with at least a 70% share of the market. The Commission considered Intel to be carrying out two specific types of illegal behaviour:

- Awarding partly or entirely hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all or almost all of the x86 CPUs they needed from  Intel and direct payments to major retailers on condition that they only sell computers fitted with x86 CPUs. The rebates and payments effectively prevented clients - and, ultimately, consumers - from choosing alternative products.

- Direct payments to computer manufacturers with the aim of stopping or delaying the launch of specific products containing competitors' x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels used for these products. By reducing competitors' ability to compete on the merits of their products,  Intel's actions hindered competition and innovation.

The computer manufacturers affected by  Intel's actions referred to in the Commission's decision are: Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC. The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding, owner of the MediaMarket chain.

The Commission said that it obtained proof of the existence of several of the conditions found to be illegal in the decision with regards to agreements, even if they were not spelt out explicitly in the  Intel contracts. It is based on a whole range of evidence, such as e-mails obtained during on-site inspections, replies to requests for information and official statements made by the companies affected.

The Commission's investigation followed complaints filed by AMD in 2000, 2003 and 2006. A statement of objections was sent in July 2007 and then in July 2008.
Background

Intel's global sales in 2007 totalled 27.972 billion euro (US$38.834 billion). In this case, the Commission added, the  fine (4.15% of its annual sales, EU rules allowing it to go up to 10%) takes into account the duration and seriousness of the infringement and was calculated based on the value of x86 CPU sales by Intel in Europe. The duration of the infringement in the decision is five years and three months.

ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Coming up this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, developing story: Chrysler giving the ax to at least 800 dealerships today. One dealer expecting to be cut tells us how he and others plan to fight it.

And breaking news this morning: eight months after entering Chapter 11, Lehman Brothers now working to spin off some remaining assets, details just ahead.

TD
And we are turning into regulation nation? The outrage over President Obama's financial compensation plan continues. Is the administration crossing the line? We'll debate this.
MONEY FOR BREAKFAST starts right now.
Good morning and welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.

Coming up, we'll get the very latest on the Chrysler dealership closings coming down today as we talk to the lawyer representing hundreds of dealers.

And bad news on spending and foreclosure sends the markets down for another day. Yes, is the rally over? We're going to discuss that. Was this a bear market rally? A great roundtable discussion coming up about that.

And in hopes of filling a $600 million deficit, Delaware's governor is signing a bill today. He's going to allow sports gambling to be legalized, but is it the right way to raise funds. And what does the NFL think about it?

We're also going to discuss some key economic data. Congressman Brian Bilbray of California is going to join us in the next hour. He'll discuss jobs, health care and the economic woes going on particularly in their state.

All right, first let's take a look at the futures this morning as we're as usual pretty busy and it's been in the red by the way all the way from Asia to Europe to the United States. The DOW down 34 points; S&P down three; NASDAQ down just over a point as we speak.

All right, let's get a look at the markets right now. Ashley Webster is in London. Connell McShane is here in our New York studio. Let's get started with Connell.
CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis good morning.

Yes, you're right that the markets have been trending if anything to the down side today. Asia certainly started us off that way.
Here in the United States, kind of flat and now starting to trend our way a little bit lower.

Now, as we get going in the day we're waiting for retail earnings. Wal- Mart will be the big one of course, when Wal-Mart reports. We'll bring you that number as soon as it comes out. We're expecting 77 cents a share to come out of Wal-Mart; that's the expectation on $96 billion plus in revenue.
So that will be the big number. The stock is not trading yet ahead of its numbers.

Page 212 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Some other retailers that we're waiting for and including Kohl's for example which looks like it's reporting now. We're expecting a 43 cents a share out of the retailer Kohl's. And that number just starting to cross,
45 cents a share, I believe is the number at least that's the one that I see.
So retail is the focus, Ashley, and the markets are trending lower here in the United States. How about the
European markets this morning?

ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, the same story, Connell. Good morning to you. Good morning, everybody.

You saw a big sell-off in Asia overnight. And here in Europe we are seeing markets move lower, nothing dramatically so.

Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you. Here in London on the FTSE 100, stocks trending down now by about a tenth of a percent. We've been flat pretty much all morning. Meantime, across on the continent on the CAC-40 in Paris, down half a percent. And also the DAX 30 index in Frankfurt, also down about half a percent at this hour.

The latest car sales numbers are out in Europe and show that they are still basically stuck in reverse. New car registrations in the Euro Zone, down 12 percent on the year in April.

Let's take a look at some of the individual numbers. GM's Opel division saw sales fall 13 percent on the year. BMW seeing its sales in April plunge 31 percent. But check out Fiat the Italian carmaker reporting new car registrations were actually up 4.7 percent on the year in April. Not bad at all.

In other news, lots of earnings to get through today: BT the U.K.'s largest phone company dialing the wrong numbers saying it will cut another 15,000 jobs, 10 percent of its workforce and lower its dividend after posting a net loss of nearly $1.5 billion.
So there you go. Somewhat down and some of these company earnings today really not that stellar. Let's go back to New York.
GLICK: All right Ashley...

MCSHANE: Ashley, we have the Wal-Mart figures just breaking right now as you were speaking. So let me get to that, 77 cents a share I should say is the number coming out of Wal-Mart which is exactly what Wall Street had been expecting in the first quarter, up a little bit from last year.
Sales also up a little bit from last year by about four and a half percent. So the sales number came in at
$98 billion plus. That too, is a little bit better than expected from Wal-Mart. We were looking for $96.2 billion
and instead got $98 billion.

So the earnings are right in line with expectations. And the sales are a little bit ahead of expectations. The stock a $50 stock these days is -- has been falling here of late. It's down by 10 percent so far this year but still up over that one year time frame by 12 percent. You see it there in three months kind of flat.

So Wal-Mart the darling of retail, the largest retailer of them all, but the trade-down effect has certainly been helping this company comes in exactly as it was expected to, 77 cents a share on revenue of $98.3 billion.
Stock not yet trading in the pre-market, Alexis, but we'll keep on top of that and then we'll have more on the
Wal-Mart outlook for the future as we continue on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST this morning.
But right now back to you.
GLICK: All right Connell, thank so much.

Well, Chrysler dealers across the nation will learn later today whether they've been cut from the team when the automaker releases a list of which of its 3,200 dealerships will keep their doors open.

Dealers aren't waiting idly by to be cut as they meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C. to try to keep their businesses open.

With us now is Stephen Lerner, he's a partner at Squire Sanders & Dempsey Bankruptcy and Restructuring Practice. He is representing a committee for terminated Chrysler dealers. And Wade Walker is the Director of the National Automobile Dealers Association; it organized the dealer meeting in Washington, D.C. He's also the President of Walker Motors.


Page 213 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being here.

STEPHEN LERNER, SQUIRE SANDERS & DEMPSEY PARTNER: Good morning, Alexis. Thank you for having me.
WADE WALKER, WALKER MOTORS INC. PRESIDENT: Good morning.

GLICK: All right so Stephen, first of all, bring us up-to-date what is the very latest that you know of at this point in terms of when Chrysler might announce which dealers are not going to survive and what their potential case is not only with the auto task force but with the bankruptcy attorneys?

LERNER: Alexis, we will learn today in a filing that Chrysler must make before the end of the business day that identifies those dealers that Chrysler believes preliminarily will be on a list to be assumed and assigned to the new Chrysler. That's the entity that will be controlled by Fiat and the UAW. Dealers who
are not on that list are at risk for termination of their franchises.

Now, we cannot overstate the devastating impact that these dealers will suffer if their franchises are terminated which is Chrysler's intention. We don't know exactly how many Chrysler will select for termination.

But we're not sitting idly by. We're working together our committee of which Wade Walker is a member. We're supported by hundreds and hundreds of other dealers who are participating in this effort. And it's our job to work collaboratively with Chrysler, with the auto task force set up by the Obama administration and others to ensure that these dealers do not suffer disproportionately in their treatment in this case.
GLICK: All right, Wade, let me talk to you. I understand that you have a combined dealership between
Jeep, a Chrysler vehicle and a Ford dealership in Vermont.
You believe that you will be one of the dealers terminated. Tell me why.

WALKER: I think Chrysler's going to take the dealers that are not with -- don't have their three brands, and they're going to look at those first to carry forward.

Then they're going to look at the dealers that are paired with another manufacturer and look at those to get rid of them. That's why I feel I will be. I'm in a small market. Vermont is not that big. And I'm in a small market. And I believe they will take my franchise today.

GLICK: Wade, if you do find out that they took your franchise, I know you're a member of the National Automobile Dealers Association, do you know at this time what kind of recovery efforts or repayments you could get through this Chrysler bankruptcy, or do you believe that what you've got on your lot, you're stuck with?

WALKER: Well, at this point they've given us no indication. So we are taking the stand that we are stuck with what we have. We're worried about our employees. We're worried about our community. We're
worried about everything, but we're thinking that they are going to leave us with what product we have with no remedy to get rid of it.
GLICK: So Wade... LERNER: Alexis if I may...
GLICK: Yes, yes, go ahead Stephen, I mean, what -- what is a guy like Wade supposed to do? You're left sort of holding the bag.

LERNER: Well, that's exactly the point I was going to make. What's critical to understand here, and it's what we're going to be discussing next week in a meeting we expect to have with the auto task force, is that there are state law rights that dealers have under every state.

It's a statutory scheme which is designed to protect dealers. Dealers are a protected class. They are different from other creditors in the Chrysler case. Our concern is that Chrysler is seeking to use the bankruptcy laws to avoid compliance with these state laws.

We are confident that the auto task force that Chrysler understands the devastating impact on dealers. And we're hopeful and confident that they'll work with us to fashion some form of relief.

But if we do not get an acceptable deal for the benefit of our participating dealers, then we're prepared to go into court as early as next week and make clear that these dealers have rights under state law which the bankruptcy laws can't run over. We're fully prepared to proceed.

Page 214 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: So Wade, I understand members of your organization are going to meet with the auto task force. What do you want them to know? What net result do you think can come of this if in fact they've already announced that they are going to let go of as many as 800 dealers?

WALKER: Well, it's still in the control of the car committee, and it's still in control of the bankruptcy judge. The best hope we could ever have, the panacea would be that they don't cut the dealers, they actually let the dealer -- the free market system decide which dealers stay.

If not, we have to back up and try to make the best for the dealers and not just let the dealers be abandoned totally by Chrysler as of 30 days from the announcement.

GLICK: So but Wade, the only thing that confuses me a little bit about it, and I understand this is an incredibly difficult time, is how could the free market determine which dealerships survive and do not survive?

As you know, this is a quasi-prepackaged bankruptcy. They want to get out of it as quickly as possible. But how does the free market do that?

WALKER: Well, you have to understand that dealers do not cost manufacturers money. We actually are revenue for them because a manufacturer never sells an automobile unless a dealer buys the automobile. The customer buys the automobile for the consumer.

So with that being said, now what happens is that they let all the dealers go, the consumers will go and buy where they want to buy, and they'll be an orderly fashion of how the dealers go away if there's a need for those dealers to go away.

Otherwise, there's going to be this mass exodus of 800 dealers which is going to create a huge across the country job loss which nobody's paid attention to. We've all paid attention to the UAW. But we haven't paid attention to the auto dealers which in the state of Vermont could mean upwards of 200 jobs just in 30 days.

GLICK: Yes, a very important issue. I know we have been talking about this. Jeff Flock has been saying an average dealer in some cases has as many as 53 employees. That could be thousands of people across the country.

Stephen and Wade, gentlemen, thank you very much for talking about this. I hope you guys will join me again. And let me know how the meeting goes today.
WALKER: We will be happy to. Thank you. LERNER: Thank you.
GLICK: All right, well, let's look at the news now from the financial sector. Federal officials outline their plans to require derivatives be traded on regulated markets and electronic trading platforms. Officials say it would be easier to see prices and make the markets more transparent. Firms trading derivatives would have new reporting requirements as well; any changes would need to be approved by Congress.

And new documents show former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson played hard ball with the banks when it came to the TARP funds. They show Paulson told bank CEOs in an October meeting that opting out of the TARP would leave them vulnerable and exposed. Paulson also told the CEOs they had no choice but to take the bailout. The documents were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch.

And breaking news this morning, Lehman Brothers is looking to spin off the remnants of its defunct brokerage firm. The "Wall Street Journal" says Lehman initially thought the assets could command about
$45 billion but realized that with the market rebound those assets could be worth nearly ten times as much. Lehman owes creditors roughly $200 billion. It collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last September 15th.

For more on Lehman's possible spin-offs we're joined by Dennis Berman. He's the "Wall Street Journal's" deputy bureau chief for money and investing. Good to see you Dennis.
DENNIS BERMAN, DEPUTY BUREAU CHIEF, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good morning to you Alexis. GLICK: Let's explain to people. A lot of people are going to think the Lehman brokerage arm that was sold
off to Barclays. This is something completely different. Let's clarify what it is.

BERMAN: This is the big hunk of assets that Lehman accumulated all over those years; the brokerage business that you described, the investment bankers, some of the traders those went to Barclays the British-based bank. But the assets that Lehman accumulated were left in the bankruptcy estate. That's

Page 215 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
what they are trying to sort of put together, wrap a little bow on it and spin off and eventually sell the public shareholders over time.
GLICK: This was Dick Fuld's whole good bank-bad bank scenario. BERMAN: In a way yes.
GLICK: The good bank went to Barclays. The bad bank held together many of those commercial real estate properties that everybody felt were some of those toxic assets. But asset values are changing and the prices by which people are interested are looking at them are getting better so now they are thinking let's do something with it.

BERMAN: Keep in mind that the asset values have dropped about 50 percent since the bankruptcy. So the number right now is $45 billion which sounds like a big number. But it was 90 billion dollars before. But, you know, the cycle...
GLICK: The demand for those assets is becoming a little bit more interesting.

BERMAN: The cycle of life, you know, what goes on and assets, real estate in particular might appreciate over time. What the estate is doing, this is people who run the bankruptcy, they are saying we're going to ready this company.

There's going to be commercial real estate. There's going to be interest in private equity firms. We are going to put that all together. We're going to make it a separate company and we hope, we pray, we're going to say, you know, do a little rain dance and hope that those values increase over time.
GLICK: Ok. So this is not a tomorrow thing. This is a perhaps early 2010 type issue?

BERMAN: Well, the hope is to create a separate company, perhaps spin that out by early next year 2010 and then maybe one to two years after -- it is very unclear at this point -- but at some point thereafter release those shares to the public so if you Alexis want to buy that great vintage of Lehman real estate portfolio you will have the opportunity maybe 2012.

GLICK: Ok, now as I understand it, when Barclays purchased the investment bank arm of Lehman, they also purchased the Lehman Brothers name. So would this actually come out as Lehman Brothers, or would it be called something else?

BERMAN: I'd love to think of it as Lehman Brothers 2.0 or 2.1 maybe but they would not have access to the Lehman name. If you have any suggestions, perhaps we could...
GLICK: What was it? You guys wrote it in the -- they call it the LAMCO?
BERMAN: They call it LAMCO, Legacy Asset Management Co. Or you can call it JunCo (ph) or GoldCo
(ph), depending on your view of how much those assets are worth.

GLICK: Dennis, while you are here one of the most controversial issues we're going to talk about that's coming up in a little while is this whole executive compensation discussion that's going on in the Hill right now. Expect to hear some rules and guidelines in the next couple of weeks.
This has a lot of people really outraged. What are you hearing and what's your take on this?

BERMAN: I wonder about the constitutionality of it. What is the exact legal mechanism that the government has to regulate the pay? If you are regulated by the SEC or registered with the SEC, I think they probably have a means in to do something.

But if you look at the constitutionality of interstate commerce -- this was an issue that came up during FDR's time, during the 1930s. They imposed a lot of rules about price controls, about business practices some of which were struck down by the Supreme Court.

So what I see, and again this is just one view, we don't really know what the rules may be, but what I see is again maybe around the time that Lehman Brothers is spinning out this company 2012 there's a Supreme Court case that rules on the constitutionality of those.
GLICK: That's probably why they keep saying guidelines because the likelihood this thing gets passed in
Congress without the hugest fight humanly possible I would say it's slim (ph) but that's just my take.
BERMAN: Yes.
GLICK: All right. Dennis, thank you very much.

Page 216 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BERMAN: A pleasure as always.
GLICK: All right guys.
Coming up Nasdaq drops 3 percent what is behind the fall?

And President Obama, well, he wants to increase government regulation. He wants to control the pay in the financial industry. Is he going too far?
We're going to debate that with some very, very animated folks.
You are watching MONEY FOR BREAKFAST live here from New York City. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WEBSTER: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST everybody. I'm Ashley Webster in London with a look at this morning's top news stories.

President Obama has reversed his decision to release photos of U.S. troops abusing prisoners. The president says these are not as sensational as the Abu Ghraib photos and the release won't add to public understanding. He says the photos might in fact inflame anti-American opinion and put U.S. troops in greater danger. The ACLU says this makes a mockery of Mr. Obama's promise of transparency. The White House has until June 9th to either reargue the case or petition the U.S. Supreme Court.

Tens of thousands of people have turned out in the town of Jesus's boyhood today when Pope Benedict celebrated mass in Nazareth. The Pontiff urging Christians and Muslim residents there to overcome recent conflict. He will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later today in Nazareth. The Pope completes his trip tomorrow by visiting the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified.

Back in the United States a tornado has left three people dead and several others hurt in northeastern Missouri. The powerful winds and heavy rain left a trail of destruction in several counties in the state. Dozens of homes were destroyed. Thousands are without power. Authorities say several people were trapped in their basements after the storm had come through.
All right, you are now up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.

Coming up, has the U.S. become a regulation nation? We'll debate the Obama administration's push for more say in executive pay. Going too far?
More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST is on the way. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: The Obama administration's call to control pay practices of the nation's financial companies put a cone of silence on Wall Street yesterday. Few companies that would be affected by a federal crackdown on compensation had little interest in appearing on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST this morning to discuss the options being considered by the administration which include matching pay with performance. Also some executives do not want to be publicly seen challenging the president on an issue that has become a
symbol of outrage for a country in the midst of a deep recession.

With us now are two men who are not shy on the subject. Patrick Byrne is CEO of overstock.com. And Jonathan Hoenig is a managing member of Capitalist Pig Asset Management. Gentlemen, I couldn't think of two better guys to go at it on this issue with.
Patrick, let me start with you. Why is the administration doing this, and is it necessary?

PATRICK BYRNE, CEO, OVERSTOCK.COM: Well, there is extraordinary public outrage on pay packages, especially what we're hearing about in financial companies that have been wrecked, and just a divorce between what people's pay is and the performance they have delivered. That's why the president is doing
it. There is this public outrage which I sympathize with. That's what's driving him to do this.
GLICK: Jonathan, I assume this makes you want to pull your hair out?

JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALIST PIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's very frightening, Alexis. It is unbelievably frightening. We are still a capitalist country and the basic issue here is property rights. Decisions about, you know, who to hire, who to fire, what business strategies to pursue, what to pay CEOs, those are decisions that are to be left up to companies, boards of directors, shareholders. If a shareholder
-- you say there's public outrage, if shareholders are unhappy with the CEO's compensation, you know what? They can sell the stock and have no connection to the company whatsoever.

Page 217 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Of course, most companies think long-term about what to pay their CEOs. They make rational decisions that produce wealth and produce productivity over time. Where Obama believes he has any constitutional authority to set pay to a private company I just don't understand.
GLICK: Patrick, go ahead.

BYRNE: I would jump in there. Correct it is a shareholder's decision. I do think Obama is treating the symptom and not the underlying disease, but I don't think the answer is, "Gee, if you don't like it, sell the company's stock."

I think that there is a regulatory approach that could be taken that's within the constitution and that is to do what they've -- to say shareholders have to approve the pay package just like shareholders in
Sarbanes-Oxley, they have to pick the auditors. They have to approve a couple things that's in the proxy statement. I think that they could say that all the executive pay...

GLICK: But Patrick, here's the thing, one can understand there was a great deal of public outrage specifically about some real exogenous situations, some of those AIG bonuses. Some of the financial institutions who invested in these CDOs or credit default swaps.

But to make a blanket assumption that all financial companies across the board will now face executive compensation guidelines is just the opposite of what the free capital market is all about. Aren't you worried that if we start to do this with financial institutions, all of a sudden we'll be discussing this in multiple industries?

BYRNE: Well, listen, nobody is more pro market than I am, but there are failures in the market system. And in this case, the failure is as Warren Buffett likes to say, boards of directors are elected to be Doberman pinschers in the interest of the shareholders. All too often they have turned into Chihuahuas.
CLICK: Yes, true. (CROSS TALK)
GLICK: Go ahead Jonathan go ahead.

HOENIG: We haven't let them fail. That's the problem. We haven't let them fail. Alexis, AIG never cost me a dime until Paulson and Geithner put $600 for every man, woman, and child living in this country today into that company.

I have to tell you, I think it takes a lot of chutzpah for the president who to my knowledge has never worked in corporate America to suggest that he knows the right way to compensate CEOs. He knows the right pay structure. Those decisions are not the president's to make.
GLICK: Jonathan, two things.

Number one I had on a bankruptcy SEC expert who joined me the other day and he said Alexis look there are going to be some changes according to the SEC in the next couple of weeks whereby normally when the proxies are sent out and most people don't actually do anything with their proxy, normally those votes are collected by the brokers and therefore those boards of directors will maintain their positions because it goes as a "yea" vote as opposed to a "nay" vote. That rule is going to change in the next couple of weeks.

Would it be about making some -- greater moves toward more accountability in terms of the role board of director that could help some of these issues as opposed to the government getting involved?

HOENIG: The decisions, you know, Alexis should be made on the corporate level. Individuals, shareholders, boards of directors CEOs, that's who runs the private economy. All of a sudden, in the last fourteen (ph) months we have gotten to this situation where the governor is picking boards of directors, picking CEOs, favoring creditors and bankruptcies, determining business strategy. I mean, I guess it is great, but it is not capitalism.

It is not the foundation on which this country's wealth and productivity was built. That's I think what should be very worrisome for everyone in this country regardless that you work in the financial industry or not. We're fully headed down the road to serfdom. And Patrick who is, of course, the big free market maven seems to support it.
GLICK: Patrick?

BYRNE: He's mixed up a whole bunch of different issues. One, companies that have gone with a cup in their hand to the government -- the government is now a capital provider so they have every right to -- the government's just like any capital provider should get a say.
Page 218 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HOENIG: But that's the problem, though.
BYRNE: I agree there shouldn't be -- no, I totally agree that we have gotten bailout crazy. I also agree that
President Obama shouldn't be trying to do this with regulation that you start with 100 pages today, it will be
10,000 pages in 20 years. But after Enron and WorldCom, we did get regulation that said the shareholders
have to by shareholder vote, not the board of directors, the shareholders have to approve the auditor.

What's wrong with saying the shareholders have to approve the pay packages of the executives? That could be done constitutionally.
GLICK: As opposed to the compensation committee? BYRNE: Exactly, Alexis.
GLICK: Jonathan, go ahead. Last word.

HOENIG: Sure, there's no political freedom without economic freedom. And Patrick, honestly you are so gung-ho for this now, wait until the Obama administration shows up at your company's offices and tells you what type of products you have to sell on your Web site, what type of -- manner in which you have to hire your CEOs, your executives, that's the...

BYRNE: I don't take a salary, Jonathan. Listen, there's nothing inappropriate with a regulation that would say shareholders and not the compensation committee approve the pay packages. That would be entirely healthy for corporate America.

GLICK: All right. Gentlemen, that is a perfect note to leave it on, guys. Love having the two of you with us. Patrick and Jonathan, thank you guys so much. A heated debate. We will continue to discuss it with you that's for sure.

We also want the response from you guys to this debate. This is a very heated issue. Should the administration be allowed to control executive pay? Is it fair? Should President Obama be allowed to regulate Wall Street? And if executive compensation guidelines are created in the financial industry, where else are we going to see executive compensation guidelines grow?

E-mail us at moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com. We will read some of your responses later. We will continue to get into this heated debate.
Coming up, IBM looking to pick up the tech sector after it takes a hard hit.

And Delaware's governor signing a bill today allowing sports gambling. Is it the right way to raise state funds? We're going to debate that.

And Congressman Brian Bilbray of California joins us next hour. He will talk everything from jobs to retail to healthcare coming up at 8:30. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm
Alexis Glick.

Coming up, you won't believe what happened at yesterday's White House press briefing. I watched it live. We're going to show you.

And Delaware's governor signing a bill today allowing sports gambling, but is it really a good way to raise money? We're going to talk to one state senator about why he said no to the plan.

And Congressman Brian Bilbray of California is going to join us next hour to talk about the massive budget deficit in his home state. We'll also get his reaction to some econ numbers.

First of all, take a look, though, at the futures. We've been in red across the board starting in Asia continuing in Europe. And here we are, we're down 45 on the Dow. S&P down 4. NASDAQ down a couple points. We're at the lows of the morning down about 1/2 percent.

Let's get to the markets right away. Ashley Webster is in London. Connell McShane is in our studio. Let's get started with Connell.

CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis. Trending, as you say, if anything, to the downside this morning. We've had a couple of earnings report worth noting both out of the retail sector


Page 219 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
here in the last half an hour beginning, of course, with Wal-Mart which reported profit of 77 cents a share in the most recent quarter.
The profit number was right in line with what analysts had been expecting out of Wal-Mart. The revenue
was a little bit better than expected but the stock to the down side here in premarket trading, 49.50 a share.
Not a huge move by any means but Wal-Mart closed at above $50.

It has been trending lower here over the last month or so. And we'll see where Wal-Mart goes, you know, from here on out. Of course, the darling of retail over the last couple of years, says "People", are trading down. But the earnings right in line with expectations.

Kohl's a little bit better than expected, 45 cents a share. Expectation was 43 for Kohl's, says the second quarter is going to be 56 to 64. Estimate is 61. Kohl's saying it remains conservative in its sales projections given the economic climate.
All right. Those are the earnings that have come out here in the United States so far. Let's check on the
European markets now. Over to Ashley in London.

ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: All right, Connell. Thank you. Good morning to you. Good morning, everybody.

As Alexis mentioned, markets down across Asia. Down across Europe. Nothing too dramatic but certainly the sentiment on the somewhat sour side.

Let's take a look at the latest numbers. Well, nothing dramatic down there, about 8 points or so here in London on the FTSE. That's about a tenth of a percent. Meanwhile, gaining some downward momentum on the continent. The DAX 40 index in Paris down now more than 20 points. Mean the DAX 30 index in Germany also off about 3/4 of a percent.

Many countries around the world are struggling with growing budget deficits. But you know, the French prime minister, Francois Fillon, is rejecting tax increases to cope with his country's shortfall. Fillon telling a national newspaper that any tax increase would be, quote, "disastrous for the French economy."

Meantime, European Central Bank member Axel Weber says that Eurozone consumer prices may enter negative territory in May and stay there throughout the summer. But Weber says this is due to the comparison with high energy prices last year rather than true deflation although there is some concern.

The latest numbers are due out tomorrow and are expected to show the consumer prices in the EU rose .4 percent on the month and .6 percent on the year. So we'll keep an eye out on that for information
tomorrow.
Alexis, back to you in New York.
GLICK: All right, Ashley, thank you very much.

Well, now it's time for some tech bites updates. There's a lot going on on NASDAQ. Down 3 percent yesterday.
Shibani has some details for us on what's happening. What we can expect today. Good morning, Shibani.
SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis. It was a rough and tumble day for the markets and unfortunately the tech sector was not immune to yesterday's overall sell-off in the markets.

Now, as you mentioned we saw the NASDAQ down 3 percent. And a factor in the sell-off was that news that chipmaker Intel is being directed by the  European commission to pay a $1.4 billion  fine for monopoly abuse.

CEO Paul Otellini however saying that the company plans to appeal. He was on our network yesterday saying exactly that.

Now other large cap tech stocks down on the day include Apple, Dell, Google and Yahoo. As a matter of fact, Google is down, if you can believe this, more than $200 since its 52-week high, just shy of 600 bucks a pop. So certainly been a rough year for Google, but down 2.3 percent yesterday.

Now looking ahead to this morning's trading, keep an eye on IBM, big blue, the stock is actually trading down in after-hours trading yesterday. We need to watch what it's going to do in today's trading session.


Page 220 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company offered a positive outlook saying it expects to earn $9.20 a share this year in terms of earnings. Now despite yesterday's performance, the NASDAQ is up nine straight weeks in a row from when it hit a six-year low on March 9th. Since then the index has experienced a run-up, an astonishing run-up at that, of 31 percent.

And what tends to lure investors to the tech sector, as a whole as many of these companies tend to be very rich in cash, very low on debt, and there's a lot of prospect for M&A activity, so it's bringing a lot of people
to the sector, but because we've seen such a heavy run-up, Alexis, you can expect a little bit of a sell-off. And that's exactly what's happening.
GLICK: And bring us up-to-date on the very latest on Apple and some of the conference dates.

JOSHI: Yes, the conference dates coming up for its annual developers conference coming out in June. Now yesterday we heard there's been a lot of talk that Steve Jobs is going to be there. What sort of products is going to be unveiled?

From what we're hearing from Piper Jaffray is the company sent out a big memo yesterday and everyone picked up on it. Steve Jobs is not going to be in attendance. Bill Phil Schiller is going to deliver the keynote address. And we are not expecting to get notice of an iPhone Nano.

And that's what everybody was expecting to get unveiled. Now the developer's conference is going to focus on the Mac operating software because, you know, Windows 7 is coming out so Mac trying to get -- you know, kind of get a one up, leg up on the Windows operating software with potentially the iPhone Nano coming out in some other meeting so.
GLICK: He's been doing a great job so far so let's knock, knock. JOSHI: Yes, exactly.
GLICK: All right, Shibani, thank you very much.

Well, here's news now for the world of mobile communications, speaking of technology. Forget about Wi-Fi. Sprint is getting into the Mi-Fi marketplace. Mi-Fi is a little credit card size device that turns any location into a mobile hot spot.

Beginning the first week of June, Sprint customers will also be able to pick up the device online and in stores for $99 with a two-year contract. Verizon is also readying a similar device.

Well, Sony's Walkman is about to make a comeback and it will be a high-tech one at that. Come June, Sony will unveil its first wireless enabled Walkman. Clearly looking for a bigger piece of music video player market currently dominated by Apple which we were just talking about.

The new Walkman will sell for $299 and $399. It includes software to block in the noise which Sony tells us is the first time such noise canceling technology has been added to a video MP3 player.

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs enforced some cell phone etiquette rules at his daily briefing yesterday. One reporter's cell phone went off twice. Then Gibbs had enough. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Those determinations are indeed made by this president and are being made. Just put it on vibrate, man. We did this before. That's all right. That's all right. Not seeking an exception for law enforcement.
Give me the phone. (LAUGHTER)
All right? This is the spirit. Let me see it. (LAUGHTER)
I'll be right back. You too? Do you want to do this too? Here, come on. Yes, there you go. (CROSSTALK)
GIBBS: I assume it's your banker with a suit like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

Page 221 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: It was a priceless moment. I actually watched it yesterday. And Charles is going to give us
"Charles's Choice," but Charles, it was so funny because the first time with the first guy who actually.
CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.

GLICK: It rang, he walked out also on the cell phone in the beginning of the press conference. He came back in and it rang again. And then in the first row, I mean.

PAYNE: It's amazing. It kind of took me back, though, to school, you know? When the teacher was, like, OK, give me the gum, you know, and then -- but really amazing. I think that was one of Robert Gibbs' best moments, though.

GLICK: He has been -- and I believe that was Bill Plant from CBS. He has been -- I watch his daily briefings because sometimes it is absolutely hysterical. I mean some of the things that he has said, and he's sort of mixed some levity into the mix.
(CROSSTALK)
PAYNE: And I think he has to do that, too. GLICK: Serious issues.
PAYNE: Because he's made some big gaffes right out of the gate and I know between him and Vice President Biden they must keep the president up at night, like what are they going to say tomorrow? That was one of his better moments.

GLICK: Yes. It's so interesting, too, for people who don't know. I mean, a lot of this live press conference, briefing, yesterday had to do, and this is a daily briefing that occurs every single day. It's usually run on our sister network, on FOX News, but part of it is yesterday they were talking about all the questions about whether or not they should release the photos of what happened overseas while we were detaining, you know, different -- what could have been suspected terrorists.

And it's been such a controversial issue for this administration as to whether or not they were going to release the photos or not. They decided they're not. So it's sort of interesting to see the levity of this.
PAYNE: Right.
GLICK: . given the extremity of what a serious conversation.
PAYNE: Absolutely. I think sometimes you need those ice breaks, if you will. Yes. GLICK: Yes, I think he was looking for one.
PAYNE: Absolutely. That was fun.
GLICK: All right, Charles. Give me your choices.

PAYNE: OK, let me give you my choices. Start off with Massey Energy. It's a coal play. I love these coal stocks. Actually it took a good hit yesterday. So this might be a real good time to really get into the stock.

Listen, it's taken a big hit, obviously, we know. But let's look at the chart more recently. It's been turning up really nicely. And it's actually making a nice breakout here. I think the next move through $20 on this stock would be fantastic.

I mean, it's not going to get back up there. That's $55 a share, but if this stock can move from 22 to 30, that would be a huge percentage gain. And that's exactly what I'm looking for.

Also this one is going to be a little nervous put on your seat belt, DryShips. Now if you remember the last time I mentioned it, it was around 5.5, the stock promptly went to 4. I say please stay in there. We got out around 9.5, it went to 11, and here we are back.

You can't see all these craziness on this chart. But at least one thing you can't see is that the stock is range bound. Now fortunately that's a wide range. But to -- now we have a chance to buy this on weakness.

Two things I like. I like the China-India story, particularly China, in a sense that perhaps there'll be another stimulus package there. The top of the channel is 12 bucks.

And finally taking a look at silver. A lot of people looking for a place to hide out. Worried about inflation. We always talk about gold. How about silver? This is an ETF to watch silver shares. And look at this. You don't really see this too often. The stock has been moving straight up. Here we have serious resistance through
Page 222 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
14, though. Not a lot of resistance until this stock gets back up to right around there which would be $18,
$20.

Pretty nice play also. You want some hard assets as far as -- as the inflation, sorry, starts to pick up some ground.

GLICK: It's interesting. We actually interviewed the CEO of iShares a couple of weeks ago and that product has been on fire.

PAYNE: On fire. Yes. A lot of regular folks, regular folks out there are worried about inflation and their money. They don't want inflation to eat it up. They don't want gasoline taxes. You know they're worried about their currency. No one wants to be in the dollar.

You know we talk about China getting out of the dollar. Americans don't want to be in the dollar. So gold always gets some hype but silver, I think, has a lot of room to the upside as well.
GLICK: All right. Terrific. Charles Payne. PAYNE: Allrighty (ph).
GLICK: Thank you very much. PAYNE: Thanks.
GLICK: All right, guys. Coming up, our debate on how much the government should control when it comes to pay. We'll continue.

We're also going to talk about Delaware lawmakers. They want to legalize sports gambling to fill a large, I think, last number projected $755 million shortfall in next year's fiscal budget. Why is the NFL looking to tackle that plan?

And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network. E-mail your pitches now at yourmoney@FOXBusiness.com. A few lucky ones will get to sell their idea live on air during "YOUR MONEY, YOUR QUESTIONS" which airs Saturday from
10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
All right, guys. Stay with us. We'll be right back right after these messages. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WEBSTER: And welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, everybody. I'm Ashley Webster in London with a look at this morning's top news stories.

A U.S. guided missile cruiser has helped to prevent a piracy attack in the Gulf of Aden. More than a dozen suspected pirates aboard an alleged mothership have been arrested. The USS Gettysburg responded to a distressed call from the Egyptian flag Motor Vessel Amira.

The Gettysburg and a Republic of Korea destroyer immediately launched a helicopter to the MV Amira's location. All 17 suspects were brought on board the Gettysburg for questioning.

Meantime, the Obama administration will announce expansions to its housing plans this morning. It is to include ways to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. One option is a short sale in which the house is sold for less than the amount owed on the mortgage and the lender accepts that as payment.

This helps the borrowers because it doesn't hurt their credit rating. A recent report showing 342,000 homes got at least one foreclosure notice in April.

The hiring and training of pilots now the focus of a deadly plane crash outside of Buffalo, New York. At a hearing, the government says the lack of experience, fatigue, and low pay created, quote, "a recipe for an accident."

The government grilled Colgan Airline officials about whether the pilot and first officer should even have been in the cockpit. Forty-nine people aboard the plane and one on the ground were killed in the February crash.

All right. You are now up-to-date on the FOX Business Network. Let's go back over to Alexis who is playing the game.
GLICK: Aren't I always? Ashley, thanks so much.

As states across the country face millions of dollars in budget shortfalls, some are betting on gambling to solve their financial woes. Delaware governor Jack Markell will sign a law this morning allowing fans to bet on pro and college sports starting September 10th.

Coincidental timing? Well, it's all in an effort to shore up a state deficit anywhere between $6 and $700 million. The NFL is asking the Delaware Supreme Court to sack the plan and other sports are protesting to prevent Delaware from becoming the fourth state in the union to allow sports betting.

Republican state senator Colin Bonini voted against the bill, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware as we speak, and Dan Kaplan, the NFL editor for "Sport Business's Journal" is here with me as well.
Good morning, gentlemen. Good to see you, guys.

All right. Senator, let me start with you. The governor supports this, very much supports it. Senator Daluca has supported it as well in your state. It could help a growing budget deficit for you guys. Why are you opposed to it?

SENIOR SEN. COLIN BONINI (R), DELAWARE: Well, I think for the main reason that it could help our problem in Delaware and I think in a lot of states and -- not as bad as Washington, but in a lot of states is we have spent our way into significant budget problems.

And I happen to think that sports betting is going to be tremendously successful and it's going to be a cash cow, and will lead to even greater irresponsibility in the future.

GLICK: OK. Greater irresponsibility. So it's a cash cow, which means it could generate a tremendous amount of revenue for you guys. I think the figures I saw were $50 million annually in sports betting activity. But you think this could have negative consequences? Explain those negative consequences.

BONINI: Well, there's several negative consequences. First of all, I think the $50 million number is quite low.
GLICK: I agree.

BONINI: I think we're going to tap an underground economy that nobody has any idea what that underground economy is. I certainly don't know any bookies personally but I'm sure a lot of your viewers do.
(LAUGHTER)
I think it's a tremendous -- not to go after your viewers. GLICK: Oh my goodness.
BONINI: But a huge underground economy. I think it's going to be several hundred million dollars, and quite frankly we're going to be the only sports betting east of the Mississippi River.

I think it is going to be tremendously successful and I'm not sure that's a good thing. Delaware's budget has doubled in 12 years. We have, as you said, a several hundred million dollars budget deficit problem that we're looking at, similar to other states and similar to other states, we spent our way into this problem.
And I think, you know, we're politicians. GLICK: OK.
BONINI: If you give us the money, we are going to spend it. GLICK: OK. So, Dan.
BONINI: So.
GLICK: I think you were talking about you knowing the sports bookies, not our viewers. No, I'm just kidding. (LAUGHTER)
GLICK: All right, so, Dan.
BONINI: Yes. Thank you.



Page 224 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: Yes. Yes. OK. Anyhow, Dan, explain though, the NFL is not happy about this. And that happens to be partly because of where Delaware happens to be located between two key franchises. Explain why they are not happy.

DAN KAPLAN, SPORTS BUSINESS JOURNAL: Well, the NFL has always taken a hard-line against sports gambling. When the city of Las Vegas wanted to advertise during the Super Bowl, the NFL told the network you can't do that. Any chance of a team in Las Vegas, even though demographically it might be a home
run, the NFL has said no.

All sports leagues, it's a big taboo is sports gambling whether it's Pete Rose, the Black Sox, the referee in the NBA gambling scandal, you can't have an association between pro sports and gambling.
GLICK: And part of the issue here is, it's right smack dab between the Eagles and the Ravens. KAPLAN: Sure. Sure.
GLICK: And the fear is that -- you know, that there would be an NBA type story with the referee that you have some sort of exogenous event that can ruin the reputation of the rest of the NFL, I assume.
KAPLAN: Of course, and ironically, this comes on the heels of both Baltimore and Philadelphia being in
their championship games and a lot being made out of Delaware having no home team and rooting for both
of those teams. So it is bad news for the NFL to have sports gambling right smack between those two
cities.

GLICK: OK. Let's look at some of the sports gambling stats. I want to bring these numbers up for you guys to take a look. You know when you look at the dollars and cents, $380 billion a year business. You look specifically.
Right. Absolutely.

GLICK: . at Nevada, I mean, just Las Vegas, $2.5 billion in wagers. Now that doesn't even include sort of the underground market of what's going on as well.

So, Senator, you know, you said before that you're worried about the negative consequences here, and you agree that it could make a tremendous amount of money.
BONINI: Right.

GLICK: I mean, look, the negative consequences could also be a reputational issue, I assume, for the state of Delaware. I understand you're.
BONINI: Absolutely. GLICK: Right.
BONINI: Yes, I mean, I think -- you know, I hate to say welcome to the first state. Here are the spreads on today's USC Notre Dame game. You know, I think I'm not sure, quite frankly, ethically and morally we should be funding state government through gambling revenues and encouraging people to be betting on sporting events to fund our government.
I think, quite frankly, it's morally wrong. GLICK: So.
BONINI: And I think a lot of people agree with that. I'm also concerned real quickly not just on professional sports. We're talking about college sports. And in fact, there's significant consequences for the college sports teams in Delaware if we go through with this. They will not be allowed to host NCAA functions.
GLICK: Right. Good point.
BONINI: And we're punishing the college athletes. Yes. And I. GLICK: So Dan.
BONINI: I think it's wrong on a lot of levels.

GLICK: Dan, let me just your last 20 seconds here. What is the next step for the NFL? We understand this legislation could be signed in at 11 a.m. this morning. What will the NFL do next?


Page 225 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KAPLAN: Well, they're at the Delaware Supreme Court. They filed a legal brief. They will probably file a lawsuit. I'm not a lawyer so I can't talk about their claims. I will say there is a bit of hypocrisy going on the NFL, obviously, looks the other way when ads are printed in the newspapers and they also, next week, will likely allow lottery sponsorships for their individual teams and league-wide.
GLICK: Lottery sponsorships.

KAPLAN: Yes. The owners are most likely to vote that in next week at their spring meeting in Ft. Lauderdale.
GLICK: That is definitely.
KAPLAN: It's on the agenda right now. It's been on the agenda yesterday.
GLICK: Controversial. We're going to have to talk about that during the meeting next week.

Dan Kaplan, we'll have to have you back. Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.
BONINI: Alexis, thanks so much for having me.

GLICK: All right. Coming up should the administration be talking about curbing pay of any kind? We're going to debate that. And we're also going to talk about the market. Was it a bear market rally? Is it the beginning of a bull market? Will we pull back, go back to March lows?
We'll talk about that on this morning's roundtable. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: The outrage continues this morning after learning the Obama administration, well, they want to change the way financial companies pay employees and executives.
So we ask you if it really is fair and we've been getting a flood of the e- mails.
Joe in Florida says, quote, "Once this practice is allowed, it will spread like a cancer to all industries." Joe, I'm just as concerned.
Allen Schneider says, "CEO pay should be restricted. These executives are the people who dropped the ball. They should not be receiving bonuses. Their pay should be cut."

Controversial. All right, well, Allen, we will continue to debate that issue. Allen and Joe, and anybody else who's e-mailing us at moneyforbreakfast@FOXBusiness.com.

Stay with us. At the top of the hour, we're going to have a roundtable on the future of the equity markets. Was it a bear market rally? What do they think about all this executive  competition talk? We'll talk about all that coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: Good morning and welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.

Coming up, we're going to look at where rally went. It's come off a little bit over the past couple of days, but was it a bear market rally or the beginning of a bull market? We're going to get into a debate about that.

And Wal-Mart did meet expectations. We're going to talk more about the retailer and what their stock says about the overall economy.

And the chief investment officer of alleged Ponzi scheme leader R. Allen Stanford's former firm is back in court after being indicted this week. We're live with Houston with the very latest on that conversation.

And at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, we get the weekly jobless claims. Also April's Producer Price Index numbers. The PPI numbers. Those coming out. We'll see whether or not inflation concerns are rising.

Finally, Congressman Brian Bilbray of California is going to join us to break down some of the details of those numbers and talk a little bit about what's happening in the state of California.

Now let's take a look of the futures just briefly. We've been in the red all morning long. And we've made some ground. We're actually doing a little bit better than we were earlier. The Dow down 15. S&P, unchanged. The Nasdaq, actually, in the green.
Page 226 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
All right. Let's get right to the markets. Ashley's in London. Connell's here in the New York studio. Let's get started with Connell.

CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right. We'll kick it off here with the Wal-Mart numbers, Alexis, which came in just as they were expected to this morning, $0.77 a share for the world's largest retailer in the most recent quarter. Revenue of $90 billion. It was $2 billion better than expected. And the stock is actually trading a little bit lower on the news.

The Wal-Mart CEO talking about how the company's achieving their earnings. So in large part they're cutting their costs, as many companies are, but also, interestingly enough, pointing out that customers of his now and of the companies are now proud to say that they shop at Wal-Mart. That was actually one of the comments out from the CEO this morning.

Now, first quarter results also achieved, they say, in a very challenging global environment. And again, the stock traded at just a tad lower after reporting those profit numbers this morning.
So Wal-Mart will definitely be one of the major stocks that we're watching, Ashley. How about the
European markets and how things are shaping up over there?

ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it' all been rather choppy. We said the same thing yesterday, Connell. We're going to say the same thing today. After a very down session in Asia overnight on this Thursday, we're just kind of mosey along, I guess, in a rather choppy fashion. All of these words throwing out there. Basically what it means, flat to slightly down is what I'm trying to say.

The FTSE 100 in London down slightly now. The CAC 40 in Paris off about 0.5 percent. We've been in the same trading range since we opened many hours ago. The DAX 30 index also down 0.5 percent.

A lot of company reports today. Some big French banks reporting their earnings as well. Natixis say it's one (ph) to a deeper than expected net loss of nearly $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The bank also announcing that its two main shareholders will inject some 3.5 billion euros of fresh capital to try and boost the bank's capital ratios. But Natixis shares really under performing in Paris this morning, down 14 percent.

Meantime, another French bank, Credit Agricole, is reiterating that it has no need to tap into the second phase of government support for the banking sector. This despite the fact that it's reporting a 77 percent drop on first quarter net profit on high risk related costs and lower capital gains. The numbers actually missing estimates, but Credit Agricole just down slightly in Paris by 1.5 percent.
A tough day for banks today, actually. Some not too stellar reports, Alexis. Back to you in New York. GLICK: All right, Ashley, thank you very much.
Well, consumer spending, falling foreclosures jumping 30 percent and news from S&P that the banking crisis may not be over until 2013. It all adds up to another down day of the street. So is the bullish rally over? Was this a bear market rally?

Here is my take. Number one, it was a bear market rally. Number two, we still have tremendous headwinds that I'm clearly concerned about, most of which are the financial industry concerns. And, number three, I don't believe the financial industry can lead us out of the bear market. At least market history suggests that usually another industry takes the lead. That is, at least, what we've seen historically speaking. I know one of our guests disagrees.

Let's get specially to everyone's take on this. But I also want you to send in your notes about whether or not you believe this is a beginning of a substantial bull market rally or whether or not it was a bear market rally. E-mail us at moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com.
Joining me now for their insights, Richard Suttmeier, the chief market strategist for valuengine.com, Doreen
Mogavero, the president of the brokerage firm Mogavero Lee and Company, and Dan Shaffer, the
president of Shaffer Asset Management.
Good morning, guys. Good to see you.
DOREEN MOGAVERO, MOGAVERO LEE & COMPANY PRESIDENT: Good morning. DAN SHAFFER, SHAFFER ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Good morning. MOGAVERO: Good morning.
GLICK: All right, Richard, you're on remote. You tell me. You're down there. Do you believe this has been a bear market rally or is this the beginning of a recovery?
Page 227 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUENGINE.COM CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, we've had a
wonderful nine week bear market rally that ended on Friday after a gain of nearly 40 percent. And you stole
my thunder with all the reasons why right at the opening because you and I agree on this. And I think the
way we get out of this is getting leadership. Right now it's possibly going to be health care or public utilities,
believe it or not. Very defensive.

GLICK: OK. You know it's interesting, Doreen, you're on the New York Stock Exchange. You see the order flow. And Richard mentioned health care and utilities. What concerns me in what could be the next leg up
is that technology has really lead the way and a lot of people, in addition to the financial institutions, a lot of people suggest that technology is going to be the thing to lead us out of it. Utilities, safe investment. Always do pretty well tied to the 10-year Treasury note. But are you seeing that leadership? Are you seeing the beginnings of what looks like the percolation of a new investment strategy?

MOGAVERO: Well, one of the problems that I have been seeing is the volume on everything and across the board. I think the volumes are much lighter than I would like to see them be if I thought there was any real confirmation to this. I'm also in the camp that this was a bear market rally. So I think that we're all in agreement there. Not much diversity of opinion.

I think if you look at it, it's fairly classic. I mean the bear market rally happens very quickly, which this has. It begins to sort of roll over around 20 to 30 percent higher. I think we're a little (INAUDIBLE) to that. We're right around in that range. So I think that this is kind of a classic, classic move. I think if the volumes were heavier and we saw some real leadership, then I would say that there was a chance that I was wrong. But I think that being we're not seeing that, I don't think -- I think it is a bear market rally.

GLICK: Dan, you've looked back -- you're a technician and you look a lot at what we've seen. We talk a lot about what happened in The Depression where we saw two substantial bear market rallies. You also buy into the fact that it's a bear market rally. But technically, what are you looking at, what are you most concerned about?

SHAFFER: Well, in this rally, it's a typical rally. But something strange happened during the last seven or eight weeks. And, Doreen, you probably can concur on this. There was a power underneath the market that kept holding it up and trading the futures -- I watch the futures every day, every tick. And tremendous amount of volume came in at several points during the last few weeks when the market was just about ready to break and shot right up again. And I'll . . .
GLICK: Usually toward the end of the day. SHAFFER: Usually toward the end of the day. MOGAVERO: Yes, that right.
SHAFFER: A week ago Friday, at seven minutes to 4:00, almost 100,000 S&P futures contracts were traded. And then in the last five minutes up to 4:00, another 100,000 contracts were traded . . .
GLICK: Put that in context.

SHAFFER: And lifted the Dow from being down 18 to up over, I guess, 44 or 50 points in seven minutes. That contest is probably $10 billion to $20 billion to be able to move the market in such a way. Who has that kind of money to move this market?

On top of that, the market has rallied up during the stress test uncertainty and then the move the bank stocks up and the bank stocks issued secondaries. They issued stock. They raised capital into the rally. I mean it was a perfect textbook set up of controlling the market's. Now that the stock has been issued.
SUTTMEIER: Can I get in here with a little bit on the fundamental side of things? GLICK: Yes. Yes. So, go ahead, Richard.
SUTTMEIER: We've had -- yes. SHAFFER: Hi, Richard.
SUTTMEIER: We have sector evaluations at valuengine.com. And back on March the 6th, we had every 11 sectors between 32 percent undervalued and 44 percent undervalued. I have never seen the market that undervalued and at the same time so technically oversold. Now we have the opposite. We're alleviating
and over bought technical condition on the daily (ph) chart, but we had, at last Friday's highs, we had six out of 11 sectors now overvalued. And if you looked at banking, after the stress test, they were 18 percent overvalued after the stress test results. So clearly the banking industry has to lead us out of it. And it can't. But the banking industry can lead us back down, which I believe it will, Alexis.
Page 228 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: OK. So, Doreen, you know, one of the points I made, and I knew Richard would -- we agree to disagree on some of this. We -- both of us agree that the financial institutions still have a great more pressure to deal with over the coming year, year and a half now. And the IMF is says it could be upwards of 2012. But what we have seen historically is it's not necessarily industry that caused the collapse of the market to be the industry that will lead the rally going forward. And so I wonder, are we setting ourselves up, at least here, purely because valuations were so cheap and that's how we saw things rally? I mean how do we play this forward? What is going to work going forward if, in fact, the market does pulled back and perhaps we retest those marked lows?

MOGAVERO: Well, I think, from a traders perspective, obviously, our site is a little bit shorter term than the views we're getting here. I think that most of the people on the -- the traders that I speak to, the problems have been just exactly as we've been talking about. You know, just when you think the market's going to rolls over, all of a sudden something comes in and they start taking for no real apparent reason, which is also fairly classic for a bear market rally. A lot of euphoria surrounded by really no basis in fact. Fundamentally we're still having a lot of problems.

So I think what we do, and what I think has been -- the people have been mostly involved in this market, have been traders sort of in and out. I mean I don't think you can take a long term, long view here. I think if you make some money, you know, in a short period of time, maybe you out to just take it off the table and try again. You can always do that.

GLICK: Dan, you believe August will be the beginning of a more substantial pullback in the markets. And you actually believe we will go back below the March lows. Tell me why.

SHAFFER: Yes. Every year since 1900 that ends with a nine has had some type of a sell-off after August. Now we all remember 1929. But it seems to be a cycle the keeps reoccurring and it looks like the same pattern again based on how last year was trading. So we're looking for also a longer term, 40-year cycle pattern. And that is due somewhere around 2010 to make the historic lows.

So what we see here is a pullback from this rally, which was tremendous. Maybe a retracement of 50 percent. A lot of people feel they missed this rally are going to try to get in. Could push it up into August
and that August, at that point, that's where people are going to wake up and realize that we have this huge deficit, we've put our future and mortgage, the country credit rating could be affected at that point, there's -- the consumer has pulled back and has now realized that this economy has got some problems, so they're not going to help it.

That's why you see the lower retailers doing very well right now. The upper retailers are not doing well. The industries that are involved in housing are tremendously hurt. But people still, I mean, as people talk about these green shoots, which I can't stand, they keep telling you to water these green shoots. There's no
green shoots out there. Everything is still not good.

Now, believe me, I don't want it like this. I certainly don't want to see the economy like this. It affects everybody. But the cycles are here.

GLICK: So we're break below the March lows toward the back end of '09. And how long does it take to recover?

SHAFFER: No, no. We -- no, I don't believe we're going to break through -- oh, yes, we'll break through, possibly, the end of 2009, going into the middle of 2010.
GLICK: So it's ugly.

All right, Richard, let me go back to you and let's talk a little bit about the financial institutions, which has really been the focus of these markets right now. You have been watching these companies. You've been watching them throughout the stress test. You've been very concerned about the community banks. And then Treasury Secretary Geithner steps up yesterday and says, we're going to open the window for these guys with assets of $500 million or less. I see you're smiling. What does this tell you about where we're headed in the banking sector? I'm sure there's still going to be some winners, some success stories, but the overall health and well-being of the financial community.

SUTTMEIER: It's going to be very hard to identify which of these community banks are deserving of taxpayer money because so far, in the first round of giving away this TARP sinkhole money, which I call it, you have over 500 banks and about 250 of them are over exposed to construction and development loans, which I believe will be the Achilles' heel of the next leg down for the banking industry. So I'm more in favor of consolidation of these banks.
Now the FDIC is concerned as well. They're opening up a satellite office in Jacksonville, Florida, in
September -- not until September -- to cover expected bank failures all over the east coast, from North
Page 229 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Carolina down to Miami Beach. And there will be plenty more bank failures coming along. So it's going to be very difficult to decide who gets TARP money and who doesn't.

GLICK: Richard, you say the bear market rally ended last Friday. So where are we headed? And what do you think that this economy, or this market, will start to officially rebound? Are we going to go back to the March lows?

SUTTMEIER: We're going through the March lows. And I think we're not going to see a bottom until 2011 or 2012. And I don't think we're going to see a bottom to the economy to within that same time frame when we finally get a lot of these bad assets. And there's going to be more of them naturally mature and get off the books because we don't know what to do with them right now.
MOGAVERO: That's -- I mean if you look at the foreclosure numbers, foreclosures are up 32 percent. So I
think, you know, where are they going with these bad assets?
GLICK: And mortgage applications are declining.

SHAFFER: Right. But also going with Richard's point, the commercial real estate market has not even been talked about and has hit the banks yet. And there -- yesterday a lot of the reit's broke through a trend line. They came right down with tremendous force. So I think there's going to be more bankruptcies and more vacant property in the commercial property area that we haven't even seen yet.

GLICK: Well, all right. Well, on that very cheery note, from all three of you guys, Richard, I'm going to come visit you in the sun next time when we talk about this.
All right, Doreen, Dan and Richard, guys, thank you so much. MOGAVERO: Thank you.
SUTTMEIER: Thank you.

GLICK: All right. Coming up, today is the end of the road at at least 800 Chrysler dealers as the automaker continues to restructure. We'll give you those details ahead.

R. Allen Stanford's CIO back in court this morning after being charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy. We're live in Houston with the very latest.

And later today, the CEO of Craigslist, Jim Buckmaster, is going to be talking to Fox Business. That's today in the noon Eastern Time hour. Make sure you tune in. Stay with us.
We've got some important PPI numbers coming out. Weekly jobless claims in 14 minutes. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: In auto news now, breaking this morning, General Motors will pay some direct material suppliers ahead of schedule. GM says the move was made due to economic uncertainty in the industry and to support the suppliers. A GM spokesman says this does not mean GM will file for bankruptcy later this month.

And Chrysler dealers across the country will learn today if they're being cut from the team when the automaker announces which of its 3,200 dealerships will remain open. It's part of the automakers bankruptcy proceedings. Chrysler will also renegotiate its franchise agreements with the rest of its dealers.

And according to a new survey by the automotive consultancy Auto Pacific, the most recommended brand of car, it's the Porsche. The sports car king had the highest owner recommendation rating with a 91 percent, this after Porsche. The next brands were Infinity, Lexus and Cadillac. The firm says the vehicle with the highest overall satisfaction is the Infinity G37, which is recommended by 95 percent of its owners. All right. There you have it.

All right. Let's see what's happening overseas in the European markets. With us now is Sky News business reporter Anna Jones.
Good afternoon, Anna.
ANNA JONES, SKY NEWS: Hello to you.

Let's take a look at the markets, shall we. Really flat on this side of the pond. Not in the least because of those rather disappointing U.S. retail sales figures out yesterday. The Frankfurt DAX has managed a loss so far of 36 points. Let's take a look at the CAC quarant in Paris. That's also been lower for most of the day

Page 230 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
so far. It's now down 26. And here in London, the FTSE's been really flat. It managed a little bit of a rise, then a dip, and it's now up just 4 points.

Now bank shares are pulling up the market as much as they can here in London. They're having a better day after a couple of days of quite severe losses. Energy stocks, though, pulling in mood in the other direction. And, really, there's a feeling on this side of the Atlantic that the market's are at a bit of a crossroads. They cannot decide whether this is a bear market rally and that they should take a few profits now because these rises won't sustained because they just aren't justified, or whether the investors should pile in now because the market's going to carry on rising. And it seems that investors are caught between those two moves.

GLICK: So, Anna, you know, I understand people are sort of caught between those two issues right now. But one of the things we started to see here, particularly in the United States, is we've seen this tremendous rally with some conviction at least coming in because we're starting to see those economic numbers. They're starting to scare people. We're going to get some in the next nine minutes. How much are people there focusing on fundamentals or purely the economic data?

JONES: Well, you know what, yesterday we had word from Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, giving his outlook for the economy. And people really did focus on what he was saying because his view of what was going to happen was so different from the government. He said that we were going to have a fall in growth this year of 4.5 percent. Now that's a lot more than the 3.5 percent predicted by the government.

And the pound didn't like it at all because he was talking about inflation. He said the interest rates would stay at the same level. So the pound has fallen. So you are going to get reaction when you get any kind of forecast as far as the economy goes. But I still think there are investors out there who see the market going up, they seem to think maybe we're out of the worst and we don't want to miss out on those profits if we are through the worst.
GLICK: All right. Excellent points. That's part of the issue they're addressing here as well. Anna, thank you so much. We appreciate seeing you. Thanks.
All right. Coming up, we're going to check the very latest headlines and R. Allen Stanford's CIO is back in court this morning after being charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy. We're heading live to Houston in just a moment.

And in eight minutes, we're going to give you the weekly jobless claims and the Price Producer Index numbers. Those are coming up. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GLICK: In court now, the Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing civil fraud charges against former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo. Mozilo could be charged with insider trading and withholding information from shareholders. Mozilo sold $130 million of stock in the beginning of 2007 right when the mortgage market began to collapse. And Mozilo's lawyer says there is no basis for the claim.

We'll get an update today on the Madoff liquidation proceedings. The president of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the court- appointed trustee for the liquidation of Bernie Madoff Securities are going to hold a conference call at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

And former Stanford Financial Group chief investment officer Laura Pendergest-Holt is due back in Houston court today. She could go to jail or get bail at the hearing. Pendergest-Holt was indicted Tuesday by a grand jury on obstruction of justice charges. Prosecutors continue to build their case against her former boss, R. Allen Stanford, who allegedly ran and $8 billion Ponzi scheme abroad.
All right. For more on what we can expect in a Houston federal courthouse today, we are joined by Adam
Shapiro, who is live this morning in Houston.
Good morning, Adam.
ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis.

GLICK: So walk us through. What do we expect to have happened, at least in court today, as it relates to this chief investment officer, particularly coming off of the heels of the indictments just a couple days ago?

SHAPIRO: Well, Laura Pendergest-Holt's attorneys are going to mount a very aggressive defense. We expect that they're going to actually present a motion for a speedy trial. A trial within 75 days. Essentially telling the government to put up or shut up. The case against Laura Pendergest- Holt boils down to one key
Page 231 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
quote that you can find in the indictment against her, because, remember, it's two counts of obstruction of justice. And here's the quote that really sums up what the government's case really is.

"Holt and others would send communications and hold meetings in which they would discuss ways to conceal from the SEC the true operations and financial conditions of Stanford International Bank and to forestall the SEC investigation."

What she is not charged with is any financial crime. And when you look at that documents, the case the government is building really in the financial crime sector is against Allen Stanford and James Davis, the CFO. They haven't even been charged.

So today in federal court we expect that Laura Pendergest-Holt's team will ask for a speedy trial. We expect that they will ask her to be allowed to remain on bail. And we expect that the government will try to fight some of that. There's going to be a statement after all of the proceedings, by her attorneys, about the status of this case.

Now as far as others being indicted, because when you read these indictments, there are several others who were named. The executives from Stanford Financial Group, lawyers for Stanford Financial Group, all of them allegedly complicate in this conspiracy to obstruct justice, and yet Laura Pendergest-Holt is the only one who's charged. And the government hasn't explained why that might be.

Other indictments are expected, when you speak to lawyers close to this case, any time now. Some are expecting those indictments here in Houston. Possibly indictments in Miami as well. But with Laura Pendergest-Holt, she's expected to leave this courtroom today with perhaps a trial schedule for 75 days from now.
Back to you.

GLICK: All right, Adam Shapiro, what an update. Such an intriguing case. All right. We'll continue to follow it. Thanks so much.
Let's head over to Ashley Webster in London for a look at some of the other top headlines this morning. Ashley.
WEBSTER: Yes, good morning, Alexis. Good morning, everyone.

The White House is stepping up the search for a Supreme Court nominee. Now the president has met privately with four key senators to  fine-tune his decision. White House officials say the list of potential nominees has grown longer than the six names previously reported. The majority of the potential candidates are women and Hispanics. A White House officials say a pick isn't likely before Memorial Day. Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced that he was -- or Souter, I should say, announced that he was retiring from the high court in April.

The overhaul of the Hubble Telescope begins today. Quite an operation. It includes two separate teams doing space walks. They will literally walking into two broken science instruments and try to fix the electronics. This is the first time astronauts have tried anything like this. The 43.5 foot long telescope was grabbed by the shuttle Atlantis' robotic arm as the two space crafts soared 350 miles above Australia. This is the fifth and final flight to the Hubble, costing NASA just over $1 billion.

And a warning now to consumers. More than 76,000 Eddie Bauer Soothe & Sway play yards are being recalled because of suffocation hazards. The company and the Consumer Products Safety Commission have received 10 reports of infants rolling to one side. This includes six reports of infants who've had their faces pressed against the side or bottom of the basinet. No injuries have been reported. The recall involves all units of the model numbers 05046 and the units of the model number 05044. All of these made before December 1, 2008.

All right. You are now up-to-date on the Fox Business Network. Let's go back to Alexis as we wait for the big report.
Alexis.
GLICK: All right, Ashley, thank you very much.

We have two reports coming out. Let's take a look at the futures as we head into them. We're going to get the weekly jobless claims number. Also the April PPI number.



Page 232 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now in terms of jobless claims, the expectation is that there will be 620,000 claims. Continuing claims, 6.4 million. In terms of the Producer Price Index, expectations are for an increase of 0.3 percent. On the core, a decline of 0.1 percent.

As you can see, the markets are pretty much missed across the board. We've seen a pullback this week in most of the major markets. As we talked about earlier, some suspect bear market rally. Some say it's something greater than that. There have been a tremendous amount of stock repurchase beginning
activity. A lot of secondary issuance over the past couple of weeks suggesting perhaps that there's an underlying bid in the market. But as we saw yesterday, with some of the econ data, some of it is not living up to those green shoots that everybody keeps talking about.

So we're going to see whether or not specifically these continuing claims numbers continue to get progressively worse. At one point I believe dating back into February, and Connell's going to break the number for us that there were five people unemployed for every job opening in February. Let's see whether or not that improves.
Connell, let's get to the numbers.

MCSHANE: Well, certainly not a pretty picture, Alexis, and the numbers coming across here for initial jobless claims rising to 637,000. 637,000 is the number for last week that just came in. So that is above the consensus. The most recent number that's been put together by Thomson with 610,000 as a consensus.
So you're well above it there at 637 and up from 605,000 the week before.

Now, as for -- the four-week average rising now to 630,500. Continuing claims, which Alexis mentioned would be key, rising to a new record high of 6.56 million -- 6.56 million the consensus, as Alexis mentioned, just a little below that of 6.4 million. So you're above consensus on that. And there we have it. So the
jobless claims coming in above expectations.

Now, let's get to inflation here on the wholesale level as measured by the Producer Price Index for April, up by .3 percent. Again, above consensus number. The estimate here coming in from economists was that we would see a one-tenth of one percent rise. And instead, we're seeing a three-tenths of one percent rise.

The so-called core rate, which takes out food and energy prices, thought to be volatile,, up by .1 percent. That is exactly in line with what we were expecting there in the month of April, .1 percent gain in the core rate.

Year over year, PPI down by 3.7 percent, the largest drop since January of 1950 in the year-over-year PPI. Back then it was down 3.9 percent. This time, down by 3.7 percent in the headline PPI year over year.
So those are your economic numbers as they come out.

Now, the numbers on the markets are right behind me. I think Alexis showed you right before we went to the number that we were down by 30 points on Dow futures. Now we're down 20 more than that, down by
50 points.

We were down 3.5 points on S&P futures. We've doubled that decline down by six points now. And the Nasdaq futures, which were higher by two points, are now down by 2.5 points. So the market taking a turn to the downside as the economic numbers come out.

Record high on continuing claims more than 6.5 million. Jobless claims going up, and up above the consensus that was expected here in the week -- 637,000 is the number. PPI also above consensus.
Alexis, back down to you.
GLICK: All right Connell. Thanks so much.
Christian Menegatti is head of economic research at the financial analysis Web site RGEMonitor.com. Good to see you.
CHRISTIAN MENEGATTI, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, RGEMONITOR.COM: Good to see you, Alexis.

GLICK: Both of us looked at each other when we saw those continuing claims numbers, 6.56 million. Not good.
MENEGATTI: Not good. There are still some yellow weeds among these green shoots, I'm afraid.


Page 233 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GLICK: Yes, I'm convinced that all the green shoots are actually weeds in my back yard. But this continuing claims number and the fact that these weekly numbers are not subsiding -- in fact, getting they're getting progressively worse -- is an indication that the job market is only getting more challenging.

MENEGATTI: It is getting more challenging. Things are still tough out there. I don't think things are going to get worse, much worse than where they were in the first quarter of 2009. I think that the second derivative of economic activity is turning positive. Slowly, we're going to back (INAUDIBLE), but it's still far away, probably three to six months away.

GLICK: The producer price numbers, now, I actually had an estimate that it was expected to come in three-tenths. I know Connell said that some of the estimates on the Street had moved lower.

What does this say about those inflation fears right now, that the year- over-year number is the lowest level, lowest level increase since 1950?

MENEGATTI: I think we are still it a disinflationary environment. I wouldn't call it a deflationary environment. That would be maybe too strong. But we are still in a disinflationary environment.

Commodity prices are still challenged (ph). Our return to (INAUDIBLE) has brought commodity prices slightly up in the last few weeks. However, in this environment I think they're still slack in labor markets and commodity markets and good markets. And that's for a disinflationary environment. When the recovery comes about, that's when the Federal Reserve has to get the timing of the recovery right and remove monetary accommodation in order not to inflate the economy.

GLICK: You know, of the things we talked about yesterday when we saw the retail sales numbers -- we talked about this with Craig Johnson -- is that it's going to feel like a tax on consumers. These gasoline prices are rising pretty precipitously. We've seen oil rise to $60 a barrel, at a six-month high.

I assume all of that is going to factor into profits, it's going to impact earnings. It's going to impact some of these PPI and CPI numbers as well.
Probably all not good things.

MENEGATTI: It is going to make the environment more challenging. It's going to impact all the variables that you spoke about.

However, that means also that it's going to challenge consumption and production, which implies, again, that we are still not growing, we are still contracting, we are still in deflationary environment. So I wouldn't worry about inflation at this point.

I think that the consumer had some positive shocks from lower interest rates, lower mortgage payments, tax refunds, tax rebates. Now those are fading away and we are going back into harder times.
GLICK: Yes, back and huddling in the living room and having some TV dinners. Christian Menegatti, thank you very much.
MENEGATTI: Thank you.
GLICK: Good seeing you. Appreciate it. MENEGATTI: Good seeing you.
GLICK: All right.

Coming up, Representative Bilbray of California is going to join us. He'll break down his analysis on the numbers. We'll also get his thoughts on the state of California.
That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: The weekly job figures out this morning are higher than expectations, signaling an increasingly tough job market.

For more on that and other news coming out of our nation's capital, Republican Congressman Brian Bilbray of California joins me right now.
Congressman, good to see you.

Page 234 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
REP. BRIAN BILBRAY (R), CALIFORNIA: Nice to see you, Alexis.

GLICK: All right. First, your reaction. These continuing claims numbers hitting new highs once again. It definitely means we've got some issues in the job market.
What's your reaction?

BILBRAY: Very bleak. And, you know, we've got to remember that this is not only a major hit there, but you've got to consider that the federal government just hired 72,000 employees. So you've got -- you know, that is an artificial bump-down. So you actually have to add those in if you really want to look at private sector foundation.

And so it's a real crisis, especially for those of us who are looking at the budget, because, remember, the new administration has projected in their budget an eight percent unemployment rate. Well, that doesn't wash anymore, and that has to revise all of our projections of what is really practical when we talk about revenues and the next couple years.
GLICK: Yes. I mean, look, Congressmen, your state has been hit exceptionally hard, as has been the Rust
Belt area. Some projecting 10 percent at a minimum.

What do we do now thought to create those new jobs? Because this administration initially was saying they could create or save 3, 3.5 million jobs. I don't see where the job growth is coming from, and I don't know if this fiscal stimulus at 1.5 million jobs, they say, by the end of the year is going to do it.

BILBRAY: Alexis, the problem is, is that we've got to recognize it's an institutional problem with the fact that Washington has not addressed a major concern, and that is, you can't operate a modern economy with energy costing more than labor. And we haven't had an energy policy, a real energy policy, for over 30 years.

And while we're all talking about the challenges of the economy and climate, but we're not willing to be brave enough to talk about stuff like, what is the federal government doing about doubling nuclear power within the next decade, which is very cost-effective, very clean? And those who are really looking at it are saying we've just got to look at finding reasons to get things done rather than always blocking things like the development of new technologies that the government is standing in the way of.

And I think that's one of the ugly little secrets out there, is that I don't care if it is a fuel-efficient cars, if it's developing new fuel mixes, the government is really a major barrier on that. And we've got to understand that we all talk about a Manhattan Project for the economy, or for energy, when, in fact, the Manhattan Project wouldn't be legal under federal law right now. We've got to go sort of change the way Washington thinks about a relationship with the private sector if we really want to see ourselves get out of this, rather than always pointing fingers that the private sector isn't doing enough.

GLICK: Let's speak specifically about private sector jobs, because one of the issues that has frustrated me most about this current recovery package coming out of the administration is that very little of it speaks directly to the small business owners, who create 70 percent of the jobs in this country. And you've got 27 million small business owners who would like to be able to keep people on their payroll, but when you see
611,000 private sector jobs lost last Friday, it's an indciation of how tightly they're being squeezed.
Are we doing enough to address the people who are creating the jobs? BILBRAY: No. In fact, just the opposite.
You're hearing the rhetoric that, you know, first of all, you have independent businesspeople that are taxed twice on Social Security, they're taxed -- they're punished for not being part of big labor or big business. You know, we just sort of double-whammy them because they don't have lobbyist in Washington to have things custom fitted for them.

But we've also got to recognize that this is the energy -- or the economic stimulus is going to come from the small business. But when you hear the administration or anybody else talk about, let's sock it to the rich
guy and let's tax those that are at $500,000, they fail to tell you that the overwhelming majority of those that are going to be hit are going to be small business. And then they'll go, oops, we didn't mean to do that. Because you don't have the small business represented before the Ways and Means Committee when these things come down, it's the little business guy who gets shafted on this.

And I just wish those that are so upset at big business would understand that the real enemy of big business is not big government. That's an ally of big business. The real enemy of big business is little business that's allowed to compete and bring big business under reign and keep it within the proper parameters.

Page 235 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the federal government and government overall tends two punish people for being little and entrepreneurial while they subsidize the big guy. Remember their big line, "Too big to fail." How many times have you heard that in the last couple of months?

GLICK: You know, you mentioned labor at the very beginning. There's a specific labor issue going on in your state. The SEIU basically lobbied to the administration about these health care cuts that were being worked on with Governor Schwarzenegger, and health care workers in the state who were going to take some cuts because the state is facing a real fiscal budget deficit.

It could result in the administration not giving $6.8 billion of the fiscal stimulus package to you guys. What's the backstory here, and why the tit- for-tat?

BILBRAY: I'll tell you, this is outrageous. And as a former mayor and chairman of San Diego County, to have the administration basically try to extort a renegotiation of a contract with a labor union just because we're trying to balance the budget back in California, something I wish that Washington was more serious about -- but this was really an issue of probably -- you know, follow the money. Was it $30 million that this union gave to the administration?

And I think there people in Washington who think that they owe the union everything and don't owe the people of California anything. And I think that this is one of those frustrations you have that this so-called stimulus package is not necessarily about helping, as much as control, and I think this is a good example. If the administration really wants to help the state of California, it will help and not obstruct the balancing of
the budget.

GLICK: I mean, look, there are two things I want to point out. Number one, the president, on Monday, said no decision had been made on whether or not they were going to rescind the funds. Then you also had the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because I understand Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary, was notified about this, who also said no final determination.

But what is the root of this? Is this about union labor contracts, or is this about getting out of the fiscal straits that we are in, dire straits, in many cases, particularly in the state of California? I mean, I don't understand this.

BILBRAY: Alexis, you remember the words, "Let no crisis go unexploited." I think what you're starting to see is that the financial crisis that California is in, and many states, now is being looked at us an
opportunity to pay back for political contributions and support that happened in the last election. And this is the kind of cynical politics, that people wanted to see a change.

This is not what the American people voted for. They wanted to see these kinds of tactics left in the past and moving forward to a fresh, new approach, so where everyone is treated fairly and Washington does try to coerce and extort policies out of the local community.

Governor Schwarzenegger was elected to represent the people of California just as much as Obama was elected to be president of the United States. And for the executive branch and Washington to try to dictate to the people of California when and how we can balance our budget, I think is not only unfair, I think it totally violates the entire concept of separation of powers under our Constitution.

They've got to go back and read that section and understand that they shouldn't be doing this. And I think it's going to hurt the credibility of the new ministration to start off with this kind of Chicago hardball politics.

GLICK: Yes. I mean, I have to say, reading about it this morning, I was incredibly shocked about it. And I hope it's not the case in other states, but, you know, when they said fair and open disclosure about contracts, particularly as it related to R&D or, specifically, infrastructure here, you know, they said it was going to be an open bidding process. You start to wonder when you hear things like this.

All right. Well, Congressmen Brian Bilbray, wonderful having you on. I know we can continue the conversation, but I'm going to get the hook.
BILBRAY: Thank you, Alexis. GLICK: Great seeing you.
BILBRAY: Appreciate it. And if they do this to the governor, imagine what they'll do --if they can get away with this with the governor, what they do with other governors.
GLICK: Oh, my goodness. All right. Thanks so much. BILBRAY: Thank you.

GLICK: Coming up, we're going to go live to the New York Stock Exchange for a preview of today's trading.

And Wal-Mart, it meets expectations with its first quarter earnings report. We're going to take a look at how the nation's largest retailer is weathering the economic crisis. We're going to take a look in our Fox 50.
We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PAYNE: Good morning, and welcome back.
Well, our index, the Fox 50, fell yesterday on news that consumer spending was down.

For Fox 50 stocks and headlines today, I'm joined by Matt McCormick. He is portfolio manager with Bahl & Gaynor.
Matt, Wal-Mart out. They beat on the top and bottom line. But the stock was a little weak. What's your initial thoughts?
MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BAHL & GAYNOR: I think there's concern about that consumers are trying to focus on needs, not wants. And sometimes...
PAYNE: But doesn't that benefit Wal-Mart?

MCCORMICK: It does, but when you look at where Wal-Mart makes their money, it's on margins. And certainly commodity prices have increased, and that has affected some of their operations, in my opinion.

PAYNE: What I find interesting is that there are a lot of subplots. We're talking about one of the largest corporations in the world. One was the strong dollar. It hurt their bottom line by four cents. There's a lot of talk about whether the dollar should be strong or not.
Where do you stand on that?

MCCORMICK: We do not own Wal-Mart, and our concern here is that in some cases, when you look at the difference in the stores, the ones that -- the ones that have oil and gas attached to it, do less. The ones that are straight up are doing OK.

I find it, though, for the long term, there is no shame in shopping at Wal- Mart anymore. And I think that's something -- it's going to be an OK stock, but not a great stock.
PAYNE: That's ironic, because the CEO made that same point.

And to your point, prices of fuel going up here really a lot recently. Sam's Club, stores without fuel, same stores, up 4.2 percent. With fuel, down a half a percent.

What is this telling us about the potential impact as crude oil starts are going up not just on retail, but the economy in general?

MCCORMICK: The consumer really benefits from a lower oil price. It acts as essentially an efficient tax cut, gives it more money to spend. And with oil prices increasing, certainly crimps their bottom line, and you're seeing those results here today.
PAYNE: And one thing with Wal-Mart that's interesting -- and we talked a little bit in the green room about it
-- you think also the stock may be impacted by card check. Explain that a little bit.
MCCORMICK: This is squarely number one candidate for implementation of union card check, which
Wal-Mart is not unionized. It could be something that investors are concerned about the impact. Again, on
the bottom line, it would affect the amount of costs they have to pay labor, which would also be difficult in
this environment when everybody is trying to do more with less.

PAYNE: So, once again, investors are sticking their finger -- well, now the stock, we see, it's a little bit unchanged, but still, considering the numbers, maybe it should have been up. But you think investors continue to look at Washington for their investment cues and not necessarily Wall Street or the companies they follow?
MCCORMICK: Washington is driving this economy and this market, not Wall Street or consumers. PAYNE: Yes.

Page 237 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Well, Alexis, we keep hearing that over and over again. It's all about Washington these days.
GLICK: It is. I actually was interviewed yesterday by somebody, and I said the whole story is not Wall
Street anymore. The entire story is Washington, D.C.
PAYNE: Yes.
GLICK: It's going to dominate the headlines for years to come. (NEWSBREAK)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GLICK: Welcome back. It's time for "The One Thing You Should Know."

We have had a great response to the questions all day. Connell and I have been checking them out. We asked if the government should control compensation.
And check out some of the e-mails.

Anthony says, "No. I believe the president should not ever set or control compensation for the private sector. That is the reason we call it the private sector."
Great point.

Well, Wade disagreed with that. Jonathan Hoenig said earlier on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST that capping executive pay has nothing to do with constitutional issues. "I take it for what it is," he says. "The government is tipping its hand in that it will control the financial system."
Good point, Wade.
I don't know, Connell. What do you think? It's a contentious issue.

MCSHANE: Well, there's a couple -- I mean, there's -- oh, it's a very contentious issue. There's a difference between capping pay and whether or not the administration actually goes down that road. And that's a road that very few people, certainly in the business community, wanted them to see down, versus how it's controlled with -- and you talked about this earlier -- compensation committee versus boards of directors, and the shareholders actually having a say in how executives are paid.
Those two are separate, so we'll see how this goes.

GLICK: What I would like to see is, I would like to see some of the executives out of the financial community actually step up and say something about it. They are so afraid to come out publicly and talk about it right now because they are so concerned about the consequences, as our executives in other industries. But, you know, if you can't speak about something like this, then where are the free capital markets? Are they afraid of the Hill?
MCSHANE: They -- well, they seem like they're -- well, or the administration. We'll see. We'll see. GLICK: Yes. Not good.
All right, guys. "THE OPENING BELL" is next. Connell will be with me. Teeka Tiwari's in our corner this week. We've got a lot going on.
Stay with us.

HD      Intel hit with record fine

BRUSSELS -- The European Union finedIntel Corp. a record $1.44 billion today over sales tactics it said the world's biggest computer chip maker used to block smaller rival AMD.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has about 80 percent of the world's personal computer microprocessor market -- and faces just one real rival, Advanced Micro Devices.

TD
The European Commission says Intel broke EU competition law by exploiting its dominant position with a deliberate strategy to keep AMD out of the market.

It says the company gave rebates to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC for buying all or almost all their x86 computer processing units, or CPUs, from  Intel and paid them to stop or delay the launch of computers based on AMD chips.

Regulators said Intel also paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer, Media Saturn Holding -- which owns the MediaMarkt superstores -- from 2002 to 2007 to only stock  Intel-based computers.

This meant workers at AMD's biggest European plant in Dresden, Germany, could not buy AMD-based personal computers at their city's main PC store.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years," said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's  antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."

EU regulators said they calculated  Intel's fine on the value of its European chip sales over the five years and three months that it broke the law. Europeans buy some 30 percent of the $30 billion in computer chips sold every year.

They could have gone even higher as EU  antitrust rules allow them to levy a  fine of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global turnover for each year of bad behavior.  Intel's worldwide turnover was $38.8 billion in 2007.

The European Commission also ordered Intel "to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing" and warned that it would check that the company was complying.

Giant chipmaker  Intel has been ordered to pay a €1bn  fine for anticompetitive practices

When did these anticompetitive activities happen?Beginning in October 2002 and continuing to December 2005 in the case of the computer manufacturers Dell, Hewlett Packard, Acer, Lenovo and NEC; from October 2002 to December 2007 in the case of Media Saturn Holdings, owner of the German retail chain Media Markt.

TD
What did  Intel do?It offered rebates to the computer makers if they purchased between 80% and 100% (it varied between manufacturer) of the central processing units (CPUs) that are the "brains" of the machine from Intel. For the retailer, it paid it to sell only  Intel-based computers.

What's wrong with that?The specific exclusion of AMD,  Intel's principal rival in the market for CPUs. Intel says that it was a straightforward business deal where it was offering a discount for bulk-buying. The commission ruled that  Intel's existing dominance meant that, in effect, the bulk discount actually meant "the computer manufacturer had no choice but to buy from  Intel" – because so few would not have been anyway.

Would I have noticed the effects?Almost certainly not, unless you had some specific reason to want a computer with an AMD processor. The effect of  Intel's tactics was that AMD products became hard to find. But because their processor ranges work almost identically, it simply grew  Intel's share of the market.
That however could have a longer-term effect if AMD went out of business, which would leave  Intel
able to raise prices – or limit supplies – as it wanted.

Intel is appealing against the ruling. Does it have to pay the  fine yet?Yes. The money is paid into a "blocked account" which is held by the commission. If  Intel wins the final ruling, the money will be paid back – with interest.

If Intel eventually loses, who gets the money – AMD, us or the commission?The commission. The  fine is in effect the amount judged to have been unfairly extracted from European taxpayers (because without the anticompetitive moves, we should have benefited from more  competition and hence lower prices).

Even though not all taxpayers lost out – a truly equitable settlement would see all those who bought an Intel-based PC from the four makers involved, or the retailer, get some redress – the money goes to help defray the costs of running the commission, which we all fund. AMD said that it does not want any of the fine to be paid to it.

Isn't this all too late to help, if the market has been distorted?Possibly. But the commission points out that it needed to gather the data to have a watertight case, and that takes time.

How big could the  fine have been?Even bigger: in theory, up to 10% of global annual revenue, which would have been €2.8bn (£2.5bn). The Commission says "The  fine in this case takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement": the  fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Intel's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area (EEA), which are judged to have lasted five years and three months.

HD           Intel fine may not change a thing

Despite the  European commission fine, it will be business as usual for the world's biggest chipmaker

While the  European commission may be successful in fining  Intel, it's unlikely to make any real difference to the computer market, or to consumers, or to the company that prompted the case: AMD. It could even result in consumers paying higher prices.

TD
The problem is that  Intel, which invented the microprocessor, has roughly 80% of the PC market, leaving AMD with about 20%.
In the computer industry, higher volumes generally lead to lower production costs, and  Intel's
long-term investment in multi-billion-dollar chip factories across several continents – our local fab is in
Ireland – gives it an overwhelming advantage.

The fact is that AMD is simply incapable of supplying the market, so any changes in the competitive landscape will have only marginal effects. As the commission recognises in its statement: "Because computer manufacturers are dependent on  Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies, only a limited part of a computer manufacturer's x86 CPU requirements is open to  competition at any given time."

And when the cost of that competitive CPU is bundled in with the hard drive, memory and graphics chips, operating system, case, monitor, keyboard and other essential parts, it may not make any difference to consumers anyway.

Looking forward, insofar as the ruling discourages  Intel from offering special deals to large PC manufacturers, it could mean consumers pay higher prices. This would probably benefit AMD, by enabling it to increase its own unprofitable prices.
Last year, AMD lost $3.1bn (£2bn) on revenues of $5.8bn, and in 2007, it lost $3.4bn on revenues of
$5.9bn. It would be a triumph for the company to break even. This suggests it has deeper problems
than the commission can address with  fines.

However, this doesn't mean AMD is powerless, and it has had a significant impact over the past decade – thanks partly to Microsoft. For example, AMD took a lead on moving the PC industry from
32-bit to 64-bit computing, by extending  Intel's x86 architecture.

Intel had hoped to move the industry to a new architecture for the 21st century, using Itanium chips developed in conjunction with PC and printer manufacturer, Hewlett-Packard. This strategy failed partly because the market's acceptance of AMD's extensions to x86 – sometimes called AMD64 – and Microsoft's support for them, forced  Intel to follow suit.

The Brussels ruling claims that  Intel's marketing deals restricted "innovation". The bigger and much more important story is that AMD and the PC market rejected  Intel's more innovative approach in favour of conserving the past.

In the end, both  Intel and AMD are limited in what they can do by the tens of millions of programs written for the x86 architecture. It's good if these can be run more efficiently, but the future is somewhere else.

HD      Intel remains committed to R&D in Europe in spite of antitrust ruling

LP
The European Commission has fined computer chip giant  Intel €1.06 billion after finding it guilty of anti-competitive behaviour in the market for personal computer microprocessors.

The record fine was announced the day after the official opening of the company's latest European R&D laboratory, the Visual Computing Institute at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany.  Intel is to invest $12 million over 5 years in the institute, its largest European university collaboration to date.

TD
The new institute is part of  Intel Labs Europe, launched in January to boost the company's involvement in European R&D. It is investments such as these that enable Intel to discount its chip prices, argued CEO Paul Otellini in a statement denying wrongdoing and saying Intel will contest the Commission's ruling.

The reason Intel is able to discount is because of its, "Consistent investment in innovation, manufacturing and developing leadership technology," said Otellini.
There are fears in the academic world that a humiliating defeat at the hands of the European  antitrust
authorities might put the American company off spending millions on research here.

But according to senior vice president Bruce Sewell that will not happen. "We remain committed to a long presence here, partly through our  Intel Labs Europe initiative," Sewell said. He praised Europe's education infrastructure and promised that the company will continue to work with it.
"Our dispute isn't with Europe, it is with one group within the  European Commission," he said.

Part of the Visual Computing Institute's mission will be to actively solicit other academic and industry partners to join its research. The number of researchers it employs is expected to grow by more than five times over the next 5 years and include collaborators from across Europe.
Harming consumers
Announcing the  fine, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "Intel has harmed millions of EU
consumers," adding that the large fine should, "therefore come as no surprise."

But Otellini said, "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers," claiming that the decision, "Ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace, characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices."

The main abuses involved paying rebates to computer manufacturers and to Europe's largest PC retailer, Media Markt, in order to shut out  Intel's closest rival, AMD. Although the rebates resulted in a reduction in retail prices, Kroes said that the harm to consumers stems from them not getting the choice of PCs that they would have if AMD wasn't suppressed.

Otellini said that  Intel, "never sells products below cost," claiming the reality of a marketplace that is controlled by two suppliers is that one of them will always lose any piece of business.

Intel dominates the personal-computer chip market with a share estimated at 81.9 per cent at the end of
2008, while AMD held 17.7 per cent, according to market analysts IDC.

Unlike the Microsoft case, where it appointed a monitoring trustee, the Commission itself will monitor Intel's compliance with the ruling. While  Intel plans to appeal, it said it will comply with the monitoring process.

The €1.06 billion  fine is the largest  antitrust penalty the Commission has ever levied against a single company. The size of the  fine was calculated by taking into consideration the duration of the  abuse, the severity of the actions, and any mitigating circumstances the company could offer.  Antitrust officials said that there were no mitigating circumstances in this case.

The fine dwarfs that against Microsoft, which was fined €497 million for abusing its dominant position in the software market, though the company was also fined an additional €1.2 billion for failing to respect the antitrust ruling.

The Commission ruling focused on the charges that  Intel illegally gave rebates to computer manufacturers in return for buying the bulk of their x86 microprocessors from  Intel.

The company was also found guilty of paying computer makers to cancel or delay the launch of machines using chips made by rival, AMD.

Last year the Commission added fresh charges, accusing the chip giant of paying generous rebates to Media Markt, Europe's biggest chain of IT stores, in return for it de-listing all computers containing AMD chips. These charges also featured in the Commission's ruling.

Europe isn't the only place where Intel has run into trouble with antitrust authorities. In 2005 the company settled with Japan's competition office. Last year it was fined nearly $20 million by South Korea's Fair Trade Commission. At home, the company is under investigation in the US by the Federal Trade Commission.
Life-like graphics

Meanwhile, a key mission of the Visual Computing Institute is to contribute to the  Intel's tera-scale research programme, which is exploring how multiple computing cores can be used to produce higher-performance computing and more life-like graphics.

"Intel has collaborated with the world-class researchers at Saarland University in visual computing for a number of years," said Justin Rattner,  Intel senior fellow and chief technology officer. "Given the growing importance of visual computing technology, it made perfect sense to expand our relationship and form this new institute. We are confident that it will become an internationally recognised centre and a driver for European leadership in the visual computing field."

The lab will conduct both basic and applied research in realistic, interactive computer graphics and natural user interfaces. By the end of 2009 the institute will employ about a dozen researchers from  Intel, Saarland University, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems and the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

HD     Calls for ACCC to investigate computer-chip market Calls for ACCC to investigate computer chip market

PETER CAVE: The  competition watchdog in Europe says that consumers have been paying inflated prices for computers because the chip maker  Intel has been abusing its dominant market position. The European Commission has fined Intel about $2-billion for paying illegal rebates to computer builders and sellers, if they favour its products.

Intel denies doing anything illegal, but analysts say the Australian  competition regulator should be checking the company's sales techniques here.

TD
Ashley Hall reports.

ASHLEY HALL: Europe's  competition regulator accuses the computer-chip maker  Intel of using illegal sales tactics to shut its smaller rival, AMD out of the market.
It says Intel gave rebates to big computer manufacturers to ensure they used only, or mostly,  Intel chips
in their products. And it says  Intel paid a major electronics retailer to stock computers containing its chips.
The EU's  competition commissioner is Neelie Kroes.

NEELIE KROES: And it that is the case, then we are blocking the position in the market for the customer to make up his mind, what the consumer wants.
ASHLEY HALL: The commissioner has ordered  Intel to stop the sales tactics and to pay a  fine of about
$2-billion. That's nearly twice the  fine given to Microsoft last year for failing to cooperate in its own
anti-trust battle with the commission.
But Intel doesn't plan to pay. The company denies the charges, and says it will appeal.

Intel's spokeswoman is Claudine Mangano.

CLAUDINE MANGANO: We do not believe our practices have violated European law, we disagree with the decision, and we believe the allegations are not true.
ASHLEY HALL: Does  Intel use rebates to reward customers within Australia?

CLAUDINE MANGANO:  Intel's rebates are associated with volume, and they are not associated on the condition that customers either purchase from  Intel or do not purchase from a competitor.

ASHLEY HALL: It's difficult to get a straight answer to that question. The World Today spoke with three of Australia's biggest computer manufacturers, but none was prepared to discuss their arrangements with Intel.

So what about the retailers, Gerry Harvey is the chairman of Harvey Norman, the biggest seller of computers to personal consumers in the country.
Are you aware of any deals with  Intel that involve a rebate for stocking or supplying  Intel products? GERRY HARVEY: No.

Page 249 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ASHLEY HALL: Harvey Norman doesn't get anything from  Intel for?

GERRY HARVEY: Well I can't a hundred per cent guarantee that because I'd have to go and check with my blokes to see if there's anything that I've never, I didn't know we did, if we did.
ASHLEY HALL: He sees nothing wrong with what  Intel's accused of doing.
GERRY HARVEY:  Intel must have been cheaper or why would people like Acer, Dell and HP etc buy off
Intel?
ASHLEY HALL: Well the regulator says that they get a rebate.
GERRY HARVEY: Yeah but AMD could give a rebate too if they wanted to couldn't they?

ASHLEY HALL: Brian Haverty is the editorial director at CBS Interactive, which publishes the technology websites CNET and ZDNet.
To your knowledge, is that practice going on here in Australia?
BRIAN HAVERTY: Not to my knowledge, you hear rumours, and there is that grey area for people who
buy in bulk, when they get discounts. But with regard to using  Intel products over AMD I really don't know.
ASHLEY HALL: Christopher Zinn is a spokesman for the consumers association Choice. CHRISTOPHER ZINN: In any area, be it supermarkets or computer chips, where there is great market
dominance, that's not always in consumers' interest.
ASHLEY HALL: And that's what the European regulator is most worried about, that a lack of  competition
in the computer-chip sector has been keeping prices of computers artificially high.
Brian Haverty says he's seen some evidence of that.

BRIAN HAVERTY: If you've seen memory prices come down, they've drastically dropped over the past couple of years, whereas CPU's might have been a bit more gradual.

ASHLEY HALL: Do you think that Australian  competition regulators should be looking at what's going on here?

BRIAN HAVERTY: I think they have to follow this up, to not do anything would probably be viewed as slightly irresponsible.
ASHLEY HALL: But Christopher Zinn says that's probably not necessary.

CHRISTOPHER ZINN: If  Intel doesn't get the message from the European Union, I don't know if they're going to get it from the ACCC.

ASHLEY HALL: The Australian Consumer and  Competition Commission won't confirm whether it's looking into the computer-chip market.

HD          Computer  giant Intel left to process  GBP 953m fine for illegal tactics

LP
THE US computer chip giant  Intel has been fined a record GBP 953 million for breaching EU rules on fair competition.

An inquiry by the  European Commission found that  Intel used illegal sales tactics to shut out its smaller rival AMD, including offering heavy discounts to manufacturers if they agreed not to use rival chips.

TD
The inquiry also found  Intel had paid a major German electronics retailer to stock only computers using its chips, while paying manufacturers to delay the release of AMD products so they missed the
lucrative Christmas market.

Yesterday a spokesman for Consumer Focus Scotland said: "We welcome that this will bring an unfair practice to an end."

He added: "While consumers may not have known which chip was being used, the fact that this was not a free market means there can be no guarantee that they have been getting the best deal over the past five years."

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has about 80 per cent of the world's PC microprocessor market. Yesterday it vowed to appeal against the 1.06 billion  fine, which dwarfs the previous record - set when Microsoft was  fined GBP 680m in 2007 for anti-competitive behaviour.

The commission says Intel gave major computer companies "wholly or partially hidden" rebates on condition that they bought almost all of their x86 central processing units (CPUs) from  Intel. It says
Intel also gave one major retailer direct payments on condition that it stocked only computers with  Intel
x86 CPUs.
The European consumer organisation BEUC called for a European Union legislative plan to launch a
"group action" to seek compensation for  Intel's consumer victims.

BEUC said  Intel's policy left consumers with a lack of choice and innovation, claiming: "They [consumers] paid too much, as the chips represented between 15 per cent to 30 per cent of the final price of the computer."

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes yesterday said: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years. Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated."

Intel chief executive Paul Otellini denied the charge, saying: "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive marketplace, characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices."

WASHINGTON - European regulators on Wednesday levied a record  antitrust fine of $1.45 billion against Intel Corp. for abusing its position as the world's dominant computer chip maker. And some industry analysts say the U.S. may follow suit.

TD
The fine comes after nearly two years of investigation by the  European Commission into allegations that the Santa Clara, Calif., company offered improper rebates and other discounts to discourage companies from buying microprocessors from its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Complaints from AMD triggered the case, and the company's chief executive, Dirk Meyer, hailed the ruling, calling it "an important step toward establishing a truly competitive market."
But Intel CEO Paul Otellini denied any wrongdoing and said the company would appeal the  fine. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor
marketplace, characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices,"
Otellini said in a written statement. "There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers."

European regulators sharply disagreed, handing out a  fine that topped the $1.23 billion one it levied against Microsoft Corp. last year for abusing its dominant position in computer software.

"The Commission finds that  Intel did not compete fairly, frustrating innovation and reducing consumer welfare in the process," Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for  Competition Policy, said at a Brussels news conference announcing the  fine. "Given that  Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for over five years, the size of the fine should come as no surprise."

The violations took place between 2002 and 2007, when  Intel controlled at least 70 percent of the world market for microprocessors, Kroes said.

"Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies, at least in certain defined segments, from  Intel," the commission concluded. Among the computer makers offered those rebates were Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo.  Intel was ordered to immediately stop the practices.

The European ruling, which had been expected in recent days, comes as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues its own  Intel antitrust investigation, which was opened in June 2008. AMD also has sued Intel in federal court.

The Europeans began their investigation in July 2007, and their findings should help U.S. regulators, said David Balto, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former  antitrust official at

Page 253 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the FTC and the Department of Justice. He noted that  Intel also has been found in violation of
antitrust laws by Japan and Korea.

"The relief that the Europeans imposed I think will provide an excellent guide to U.S. enforcers as they try to determine what to do about  Intel's exclusionary conduct," Balto said Wednesday.

On Monday, Christine Varney, the new head of the Justice Department's  antitrust division, announced that the administration of President Barack Obama would be more aggressive in cracking down on companies that  abuse their market power.
The FTC is handling this case, but it has a new Democratic chairman after Obama took office, and
Balto expected the commission to take action. Other analysts agree.

"If there was ever a time not to appear to be a large firm behaving badly, this would be it, as the financial collapse has the U.S. and EU competing for which government is the most proactively protecting consumer rights," warned Rob Enderle, a technology industry analyst. "This judgment makes Intel the ball in what is likely an international game of one-upmanship."

Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer specializing on European  antitrust law, pointed out, however, that Europe is known for its aggressive  antitrust enforcement and that a case brought against  Intel in the U.S. or elsewhere might be milder.

Google said it will reshoot all photos in Japan for its Street View service after residents complained the
360-degree panoramic images provided a view over the fences around their homes. The service has
triggered privacy complaints around the world, including in Greece, where it was banned Tuesday.
Google Japan said it would lower cameras after the complaints.

Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor maker, was  fined a record $1.45 billion by  antitrust regulators in Europe for illegally using its dominant position to edge out its only rival, Advanced Micro Devices. The  European Commission said Intel gave hidden discounts to computermakers to use only the company's chips and paid the companies not to use chips made by AMD. It also paid a major retailer to stock only computers outfitted with

Intel chips, the commission said.

Among 2.7 million employees eligible for 401(k) investment plans, the median rate of return last year was -28.3 percent. From 2007 to the end of 2008, the average 401(k) balance studied by Hewitt Associates fell from $79,600 to $57,200. According to a report released Wednesday, 44 percent of employees who invested in 401(k)s lost 30 percent of more of their savings last year. A fortunate 11 percent were able to break even or record a portfolio gain.

HD          Intel fined € 1bn for illegally trying  to crush its only serious  chipmaker rival

Intel was fined a record ¤1.06 billion (£950 million) yesterday for illegally seeking to crush its only serious rival, as the  European Commission staged its most spectacular assault yet on alleged anti-competitive business practices.

The penalty exceeded the ¤899 million  fine imposed on Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position last year. As with the software company,  Intel signalled a long legal battle by announcing an appeal.

TD
Intel was found to have set up a system of generous rebates for the computer makers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC, which bought all, or nearly all, of their x86 chips from the company.

Intel also made direct payments to Media Saturn Holding, owner of the vast MediaMarkt chain of stores, on condition that it stocked only computers made with  Intel components.

"The conclusion is quite clear — the European Commission investigation has uncovered serious wrong-doing," Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said.
"The x86 chips are the engine of the car, so to speak, your computer will not work without these chips.
Intel held at least 70 per cent of the worldwide market in them.

"Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for years.Such a serious and sustained violation of the European Union's antitrust rules cannot be tolerated."

Paul Otellini,  Intel's president and chief executive, insisted that consumers had not suffered in its battle against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), its rival, which first brought a complaint to Brussels' attention
in 2000.

"Intel takes strong exception to this decision," he said. "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices.There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers. Intel will appeal."

With American regulators yet to take punitive action against either  Intel or Microsoft, yesterday's announcement reinforced the impression of a transatlantic corporate culture clash.

However, Bruce Sewell,  Intel's general counsel, refused to follow the suggestions of some, including Microsoft, that Brussels is picking on American companies. "I do not have any reason to believe that there is an inherent anti-US bias in the EU's enforcement preferences," he said.

"In the computer sector, most of the large companies are American and therefore it is not unreasonable that if there are investigations in that sector, those investigations would involve American companies."


Page 257 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, he added that  Intel believed the evidence that it used rebates to tie manufacturers to its products was weak, with unfair inferences drawn from a small number of documents. "Regulations should not prevent one company, no matter how large that company is, from offering discounts or providing incentives. There is a line of thought developing primarily out of the European  antitrust authorities, but also perhaps being picked up by the Japanese and Koreans, that suggest that rebates can be anti-competitive."

Dirk Meyer, president and chief executive of AMD, described the ruling as "an important step towards establishing a truly competitive market".

The fine for Intel comes as Christine Varney, one of America's top  antitrust officials, signalled a return to tougher enforcement as the Obama Administration dropped a strict interpretation of  antitrust rules that saw regulators shun major action. Mrs Kroes said that this gave her hope that close cooperation with the Federal Trade Commission "could go in a very positive way".

UK prospects: The Bank of England said that the recession would be deeper than it had predicted previously. Its quarterly Inflation Report forecasts showed that it expects GDP to fall this year by up to 4.5 per cent, compared with the 3 per cent drop it predicted in February. Page 38 Interest rates: The Bank's forecasts also pointed to inflation remaining below its 2 per cent target on the consumer prices index until
2011, even with interest rates held at their record low of 0.5 per cent.

TD
Eurozone industrial production: Official figures showed that eurozone industrial production fell by a record margin in March, indicating that the economy could have shrunk by more than expected in the first
quarter. Industrial production in the 16 countries using the euro fell by 2 per cent during the month and by
20.2 per cent year-on-year.
US retail sales: The Commerce Department said that US retail sales fell by 0.4 per cent in April, after a
1.3 per cent drop in March Many economists had expected sales to remain unchanged. Retail sales rose
during in January and February after falling for six consecutive months.
Banking & finance

MasterCard: The credit card company expects the decline in credit card transactions in the United States to slow and is forecasting mixed economic conditions in Europe. It reiterated a forecast that 2009 revenue growth will fall short of its 12 to 15 per cent target as Americans use their credit cards less and a stronger dollar reduces the value of sales abroad.

ING: The Dutch banking and insurance group reported a firstquarter net loss of ¤793 million (£711.6 million), compared with net profits of ¤540 million a year ago and against a ¤3.1 billion loss in the fourth quarter. It said that it had suffered a total of ¤1.7 billion worth of "negative impacts stemming from the market turmoil".

Morgan Stanley: Matthew Sebastian Piper, a former derivatives trader at the US investment bank, has been banned from working in the Ciy and  fined £105,000 by the Financial Services Authority after he was judged to have deliberately concealed up to $120 million (£79.2 million) of losses last year. Morgan Stanley has been  fined £1.4 million.
Construction & property

Land Securities: The commercial property group has reported a full-year pre-tax loss of £4.77 billion and said that tenants representing 5.6 per cent of retail rental income had gone into administration during the year. Page 43 Barratt: The housebuilder said that its reservations so far in 2009 were up 4.4 per cent year-on-year and added that there were signs of stability appearing in the property market. Page 43
Marshalls: The paving stone company said it planned to raise £34 million in a fully underwritten
two-for-five rights issue at a deeply discounted 65p per share to reduce debt and strengthen its balance
sheet in the "uncertain economic environment".

Association for Consultancy and Engineering: The industry body said that almost £400 million was owed to British consultants and engineers in unpaid fees from work undertaken in the United Arab Emirates. Page 45
Consumer goods

L'Oréal: Legal confusion mounted as the French cosmetics group failed in its bid to sue eBay, the online auction site, for selling counterfeit perfumes and face creams in France. Last summer another French judge upheld a claim against eBay by LVMH, the luxury goods group. Similar claims by L'Oréal are pending against eBay in the UK and in Spain.
Following the judgment, L'Oréal and eBay have agreed to accept judicial mediation in an attempt to
co-operate in the fight against fake goods. 6 Bulgari: Shares in the Italian luxury jewellery maker fell after
it reported a first-quarter loss of ¤29.3 million (£26.3 million), compared with a net profit of ¤22.8 million a
year ago, as the global economic slowdown hurt demand. It said that sales of its jewellery were down by
22 per cent, its watches were down by 37 per cent and accessories by 44 per cent..
Engineering

Honda: The Japanese carmaker said that it was looking at ways to raise production levels in preparation for a likely increase in demand. The Japanese parliament is expected to pass legislation next month to encourage consumers with a 250,000 yen (£1,700) incentive to ditch cars that are more than 13 years old in favour of fuelefficient models. 6 Schaeffler: The German car parts maker said that it could cut up to
4,500 jobs in the country in an effort to save ¤250 million (£224.3 million) in annual costs as the global economic crisis has cut deeply into car sales. The company said in a statement that it would do whatever it could to avoid forced dismissals as it reduces the number of staff jobs.
Health

Novartis: The Swiss pharmaceuticals group said that Jonathan Symonds would succeed Raymund Breu as chief financial officer, in a move welcomed by the market. Mr Symonds, who spent eight years as chief executive of AstraZeneca, the company's rival, will join Novartis on September 1 from Goldman Sachs, where he is managing director of investment banking.
Industrials

ThyssenKrupp: The German steelmaker reported a secondquarter net loss of ¤362 million (£324.8 million), compared with a net profit of ¤502 million a year ago, because of a dramatic drop in demand amid the global recession. It predicted an operating loss for the full year while saying that it would slow the work on a new plant in the United States.
Leisure

NH Hoteles: The Spanish hotel operator is expected to raise at least ¤200 million (£179.5 million) through a share issue and sell ¤300 million of assets as it seeks to bolster its battered balance sheet.
The group also reported a doubling of first-quarter net losses to ¤47.5 million.

Travelzest: The specialist travel group, which last month suspended its chief executive over "a potential misappropriation of company funds", said that Colin McKinlay, its finance director, had agreed to step down.

Pubs: The bosses of Britain's biggest pub companies have criticised a parliamentary report into the "tied" pub business model, dismissing its conclusions of "systematic and widespread  abuse" of tenants. Page
46 Licensed premises: The Culture, Media and Sport Committee has concluded that the Licensing Act
2003 had "broadly speaking" been a success, although it added that it was too bureaucratic and required
some reform. Changes recommended included a relaxation on restrictions on live music and a reduction
in the fees charged to sporting and not-forprofit clubs.

MGM Mirage: The American casino and hotel group said that it was planning to raise $2.5 billion (£1.65 billion) through stock and bond offerings to pay down a portion of its more than $14 billion debt. It added that it was modifying an existing loan agreement to strengthen its balance sheet and meet liquidity needs.
Media

Lagardère: The French publishing group told investors that it could not give a clear outlook for a battered advertising market that had cut the sales of its press and broadcasting business by 18 per cent in the first quarter. It added that it would eventually sell its 20 per cent stake in Canal Plus France, the pay-TV

group, and would focus on keeping its cash rather than on making acquisitions amid the global economic downturn. Johnston Press: The owner of The Scotsman and the Yorkshire

Post has abandoned plans to sell its Irish newspapers, meaning that the indebted publisher would breach its lending covenants in the summer. Page 46
Natural resources

Opec: The oil producers' cartel said that global demand for oil was continuing to slide as the economy contracts. The organisation, which pumps about a third of the world's crude oil, said it expected consumption to fall by 1.57 million barrels a day this year to about 84.03 million barrels. Page 47
Retailing
Greggs: An Easter boost helped sales to rise at the bakery chain as customers snapped up more than
2.3 million hot cross buns. Greggs, which has more than 1,400 shops across the UK, said sales of the
traditional Easter food had soared by 10 per cent compared with last year.

Macy's: The US department store group reported a wider loss for the first quarter of $88 million (£58.8 million), compared with a loss of $59 million a year ago, as its results were hurt by restructuring charges of $138 million.

J Sainsbury: Justin King has crowned a five-year turnaround of Britain's third-largest supermarket chain with a £4 million bonus and a promise that he will stay on as chief executive. Page 36
Support services

VT: The outsourcing group confirmed that it was competing for an Army contract to recruit new soldiers. The deal is expected to be worth about £500 million over ten years. Page 42 Technology Intel: The American computer chip maker has been  fined a record ¤1.06 billion (£950 million) by the European Commission for illegally seeking to crush Advanced Micro Devices, its only serious rival. Page 47
Seagate
Technology:

The American computer group said that it planned to cut about 1,100 jobs to reduce costs by about $125 million (£82.4 million) a year.

Google: The US internet group said that it would reshoot all the photographs it has taken in Japan for its Street View service after residents complained that the images provided a view over the fences around their homes. The service has triggered privacy complaints around the world, including most recently in Greece, where it was banned this week.
Telecoms

O2: The country's biggest mobile phone operator revealed that consumers were rationing what they spent on text messaging. The trend, revealed in the first quarter results of Telefónica, the group's Spanish parent, contributed to a near-4 per cent drop in O2's key "average revenue per user" figure in the period. Page 46 6 Verizon: The US telecoms group announced that it had agreed to sell its landline service in 14
US states to Frontier Communications in an all-stock deal valued at $8.6 billion (£5.7 billion)..
Transport
FirstGroup: The transport company said that full-year profits at its rail division had fallen by 21 per cent to
£94.2 million, compared with £120 million a year ago, because of the impact of the recession on its
franchises serving London. The group said the UK's economic woes meant that rail revenue growth had
slowed to 9.5 per cent in the year. Page 45 Gatwick: Lysander Gatwick Investment Group, a bidder for
the airport, confirmed that it had been dropped from the battle to buy it after its bid was deemed to be too
low. Page 45 Iberia: The Spanish carrier and other airlines serving the country, such as British Airways
and Lufthansa, would have their airport charges waived in return for boosting pasenger numbers, under a
government proposal of ¤240 million (£215.4 million) a year in airline support. It is one of a number of
initiatives to combat the country's worst recession in 60 years.

London and Continental Railways: Britain has won European Union permission to spend £5.2 billion cancelling the debt of the rail operator, which owns the UK division of Eurostar and the highspeed rail line between London and the Channel Tunnel. The  European Commission said that it could allow the state subsidy because it was "an important project of common European interest; that would help to open up the rail market to  competition by 2010".

Ryanair: The budget airline said that check-in for all its flights booked after May 20 would be by website only and passengers must pay £5 to do so. This follows the carrier's decision announced in March to scrap airport check-in desks. Page 46
Utilities

E.ON: The German energy company reported an 18 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits to ¤2.5 billion (£2.24 billion), compared with ¤2.1 billion a year ago, boosted by the contribution of new markets to revenues.

HD         JOB FEARS AS INTEL IS FINED € 1BN; Chips are down for PC giant

INTEL workers feared for their jobs last night after the tech giant was  fined a record '1.06BILLION for anti-competitive practices.

Some 5,500 people are employed at the US computer chip maker's plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, where voluntary redundancies have already been sought.

TD
And news of the monster penalty made nervy staff even more concerned for the future of the company
— and their employment.
One worker, who asked not to be named, revealed: "We had the announcement of between 200 and
300 job losses last month.
Hit

"That came as no surprise, we had been expecting some losses and more jobs were lost with the company around the world.

"But obviously with the news that the company has been hit with this huge  fine we are wondering where they will save the money.
"And we have no union to protect us here — unions are not company policy."

The European Commission hammered Intel over claims it had paid manufacturers and a retailer to choose its chips over competitors' ones.
Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC were given hidden rebates if they only used  Intel chips, the EC said. It also found Media Saturn, which owns Europe's biggest consumer electronics retailer Media Markt,
had been given money so it would only sell computers containing  Intel parts.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years.
"Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU's anti-trust rules cannot be tolerated."
But Intel announced yesterday it would appeal the landmark penalty which dwarfs the '497million  fine
levied on Microsoft in 2004.

President and CEO Paul Otellini said: "We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive marketplace characterised by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices. There has been zero harm to consumers."

A spokeswoman for  Intel told the Irish Sun yesterday she was unaware of any plans to make further redundancies in Ireland.
Page 264 of 265 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
