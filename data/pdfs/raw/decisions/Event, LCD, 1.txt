(Adds LG.Philips price  fixing;  Philips, analyst comment; updates shares) By Gilbert Kreijger
AMSTERDAM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Philips named a healthcare executive with extensive Asian and restructuring experience as its new chief financial officer in a surprise move that gives Philips a new top duo to revamp its consumer unit.
Ron Wirahadiraksa, 50, a Dutch-Indonesian who spent several years working at a Philips' business in
South Korea, has been CFO at Philips' healthcare unit since 2008.

During that time, healthcare and other Philips' divisions cut several thousand jobs in response to the global economic downturn in 2008-2009, and analysts expect further restructuring, including the sale of television and other consumer businesses.

Wirahadiraksa's appointment marks the second senior management change in the company in recent months and highlights the growing emphasis on the healthcare division at Philips, which is the world's third-largest hospital equipment maker after U.S.-listed General Electric and Germany's Siemens. Restructuring expert Frans van Houten will take over as chief executive at Philips on April 1.
Wirahadiraksa, a Dutch citizen with Indonesian roots, will take on the job as group CFO from March 31. South Korea's LG.Philips  LCD, now LG Display and where Wirahadiraksa was CFO from 1999-2008
plead guilty two years ago to a global price fixing  scheme between 2001 and 2006 in a U.S. Justice
Department case and paid $400 million in fines.
The European Commission also started an investigation in 2006 into suspected price-fixing  on LCD
panels.

"This case involves LG.Philips  LCD and not Philips. The appointment of Mr. Wirahadiraksa as CFO is clearly a signal of the company's confidence in him," a Philips spokesman said.

Philips shares ended down 3.9 percent at 21.175 euros by 1616 GMT, lagging an Amsterdam blue chip index which was down 2 percent.
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

The Dutch company has been struggling with sluggish sales at its consumer electronics unit, which
sells toasters, shavers and TVs, and there has been talk it may have to abandon its three-pillar strategy
-- of healthcare, consumer electronics and lighting -- given the limited synergies.

"The shortfall in revenue growth that Philips had to report in the second half of this year is an eye opener, as it shows that consumer electronics is still a problem area," SNS Securities analyst Victor Bareno said in a note ahead of Philips' investor day on consumer products on Dec. 1. "We expect this will trigger Philips to accelerate the exit strategy for these activities," Bareno said.

ING analyst Sjoerd Ummels said he expected Philips, which has already been outsourcing some TV production operations, to focus its consumer products on healthcare and personal care but did not think Philips would be breaking up soon.

"There is investor pressure for operational improvement and growth. This is what new management will have to realise. If this does not materialise in two years' time, shareholder pressure will rise," Ummels said.

Wirahadiraksa, who started at Philips in 1987, could help Philips grow in Asia thanks to his experience in the region and his Indonesian background, Ummels said.
Wirahadiraksa helped lead the initial public offering of LG.Philips  LCD on the Korean and New York
Stock exchanges in 2004, Philips said in a statement.

Philips said the resignation of current CFO, Pierre-Jean Sivignon, whose term was until 2013, was for personal reasons and he would pursue his career outside the firm.
The news surprised outsiders.

"As a company you don't want your CEO and CFO to leave at the same time. That is bad planning," Jos Versteeg, analyst at Theodoor Gilissen, said. (Reporting by Gilbert Kreijger; Editing by Matthew Jones and Karen Foster)

BRUSSELS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Five companies, including LG Display and Taiwanese group AU Optronics are set to be  fined by EU antitrust regulators next week for  fixing  prices of display panels used in consumer devices, four sources said on Tuesday.

The European Commission, which handles EU regulatory affairs, charged the companies in July last year with breaching EU laws on restrictive business practices. Several other regulators around the world also investigated the sector.
The Commission was expected to unveil the  fines on Dec. 8, one of the sources said.

The EU watchdog did not identify the companies at the time, but LG Display, the world No. 2  LCD maker, global No. 3 AU, and Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp, Taiwan's second-largest  LCD firm, confirmed the charges.
A Commission document obtained by Reuters showed the companies on the charge sheet included
Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Taiwan's third-largest LCD maker, and HannStar Display Corp. World No.1
LCD maker Samsung Electronics will not be fined, as it alerted the Commission to the  cartel, another
source said.

Dutch company Philips received a copy of the charge sheet as a former shareholder of LG Display, but said it was not directly involved. It sold the rest of its shares in the joint venture with LG Electronics in March 2009.

In a similar investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, eight companies including LG Display, Chi Mei, Chunghwa, Japanese company Sharp Corp and Hitachi Displays, paid more than $890 million in criminal fines for price-fixing.

The Commission's case had centred on thin-film liquid crystal display panels used in computers, mobile phones, televisions, digital watches, pocket calculators and MP3 players. (Editing by Rex Merrifield and Dan Lalor)

LP
Following an investigation opened last July on the basis of a number of complaints for price-fixing arrangements on LCD flat screens, the  European Commission is expected to issue a verdict soon against five companies. A source close to the inquiry notes that the measure against the  cartel will be announced on 8 December.

The cartel concerns liquid crystal display (LCD) screens used in television sets, as computer screens and in mobile phone, MP3 players and video cameras.

TD
Although the EU executive has not published the participants' names, the world's second and third largest manufacturers, LG Display and AU Optronics Corp, respectively, plus Chi Mei Optoelectronics, number two in Taiwan, have acknowledged that they are among the suspected firms.

World leader Samsung Electronics, which blew the whistle and recognised its participation in illegal practices with fellow manufacturers, could be given total immunity.

LG, under investigation in Japan and South Korea, was already  fined US$400 million in 2009 in the United States for concerted practices on these same products. An anti-trust case was also opened last August against a number of firms, including Hitachi, LG, Toshiba, Samsung, Sharp, AU Optronics and Chi Mei, suspected of  fixing  prices for their screens and rates charged to computer manufacturers. High compensation could be ordered to make up for the "hundreds of millions of dollars" that counties, schools and cities in the State of New York have spent on overpriced  LCD screens.

(Adds details, background) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - EU regulators are set to  fine LG Display , Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp and three other firms up to 700 million euros ($928 million) in total for  fixing  prices of display panels used in consumer devices, a source close to the case said on Monday.

The European Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, charged the companies in July last year with breaching EU laws on restrictive business practices, while other regulators around the world have also investigated the sector.
"The total  fine will be between 600 and 700 million euros," the source told Reuters.

The EU executive will levy the biggest  fine on Taiwan's Chi Mei, the source said, declining to provide details of the individual  fines.

Chi Mei paid $220 million in  fines last year after pleading guilty to U.S. charges of price-fixing.  The company later merged to form Chi Mei Innolux , a combination which now comprises Taiwan's largest maker of LCD panels.

The Commission is expected to announce its decision on Wednesday, sources told Reuters previously. [ID:nLDE6AS238]
The Commission can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for infringing EU
laws.

The watchdog did not identify the companies at the time, but LG Display, 3 AU Optronics and Chi Mei confirmed the charges.

Taiwanese firms Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp were also named in a Commission document obtained by Reuters. World No.1  LCD maker Samsung Electronics will not be fined as it alerted the Commission to the  cartel.

Dutch company Philips received a copy of the charge sheet as a former shareholder of LG Display, but said it was not directly involved. It sold the rest of its shares in the joint venture with LG Electronics in March 2009.

The EU Commission's case had centred on thin-film liquid crystal display panels used in computers, mobile phones, televisions, digital watches, pocket calculators and MP3 players.

In the U.S. Department of Justice investigation, eight companies, including LG Display, Chi Mei, Chunghwa, Japanese company Sharp Corp and Hitachi Displays, paid more than $890 million in criminal fines for price-fixing.

Japan's Fair Trade Commission slapped  fines on Sharp Corp and Hitachi Ltd in 2008 for price  fixing  in the market for  LCD panels. (Editing by Rex Merrifield and David Holmes) ($1=.7541 Euro)

The European Commission imposed on Wednesday 649 million euros (860 million dollars) in fines
against South Korean and Taiwanese makers of  LCD flat screens for running a price-fixing  cartel.
Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corporation, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display
Corporation were hit with  fines along with South Korean firm LG Display.

TD
South Korea's Samsung Electronics was also accused for being part of the  cartel but avoided a fine for being the first to provide information on the alleged scheme.

Europe's competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with the liquid crystal display component.

The companies held monthly meetings to agree on price ranges and minimum prices, and trade information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions, the commission said.

Company officials met 60 times, mainly in hotels in Taiwan, for what they dubbed "the Crystal meetings," the regulator said.

The investigation found that the companies knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their meetings.

The commission cited a document urging everybody "to take care of security/confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."

Chimei InnoLux was given the largest  fine, 300 million euros, followed by 215 million euros against LG Display.

AU Optronics was  fined 116.8 million euros, followed by nine million euros for Chunghwa Picture Tubes and 8.1 million euros for HannStar Display.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair," European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour," he said.

HD      EU slaps huge fine on South Korea, Taiwan LCD cartel

The European Commission imposed Wednesday 649 million euros in  fines on South Korean and Taiwanese electronics firms for secret backroom price-fixing  of LCD flat screens for Europe's TVs and computers.

The fines, worth 860 million dollars, were slapped on Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corporation, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation along with South Korean firm LG Display.

TD
The leader in the  LCD business, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, was also accused of being part of the cartel but escaped cash sanctions for coming forward first with information on the alleged scheme.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair," European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour," he said.

Europe's competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with liquid crystal displays.

The companies held monthly meetings to agree on price ranges and minimum prices, and traded information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions, the commission said.

Company officials met 60 times, mainly in hotels in Taiwan, for what they dubbed "the Crystal meetings," the regulator said.

"The fact that the  cartel meetings took place outside the EU is no excuse," Almunia told a news conference, saying the group was "very well organised."

The investigation found that the companies knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their meetings.

The commission cited a document urging everybody "to take care of security/confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."

Chimei InnoLux faces the largest  fine, 300 million euros, followed by 215 million euros against LG Display.

AU Optronics was  fined 116.8 million euros, followed by nine million euros for Chunghwa Picture Tubes and 8.1 million euros for HannStar Display.

The cartel's scheme had a direct impact on European consumers because "the vast majority" of televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks with  LCD panels that are sold in Europe come from Asia, the commission said.

The market was worth more than seven billion euros over the period that the  cartel existed.
Page 19 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Commission opened its investigation in late 2006 at the same time as other competition regulators in the United States and Asia.
In July 2009, Brussels sent a list of complaints to several companies, including Samsung and LG and
Japanese firms Sharp, Seiko Epson, Toshiba Matsushita and NEC.
The commission did not  fine any Japanese company on Wednesday.

Almunia said the  fines involved activities related to flat screens for TVs, computers and notebooks -- areas in which the Japanese firms were not involved.

LG and Chunghwa, along with Sharp, pleaded guilty in the United States and were  fined a total of 585 million dollars in November 2008. LG was hit with the harshest penalty, 400 million dollars.

The European Commission cracked down on seven cartels this year, imposing nearly three billion euros in total fines.

HD     EU fines LCD panel makers euro649 million ($857 million) for cartel, Samsung escapes fine

BRUSSELS (AP) - The EU competition watchdog  fined five Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies euro649 million ($857 million) Wednesday for  fixing  prices on LCD panels between 2001 and
2006.
A sixth company, Samsung Electronics Co., also participated in the price  fixing  but escaped a fine
because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the European Commission said.

TD
Chimei InnoLux Corp. received the biggest  fine, euro300 million ($396 million), LG Display Co. has to pay euro215 million ($284 million), while AU Optronics Corp. was  fined euro116.8 million ($154 million). Two smaller companies, Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp., received  fines of euro9 million ($11.9 million) and euro8.1 million ($10.7 million) respectively.

Monday's fines targeted price-fixing  for LCD panels used in flat screens for televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks. The European Union's initial investigation had also included smaller LCD screens like the ones built into mobile phones, digital cameras, or MP3 players, but the  fines did not target price-fixing  for those products.
"This was a very well organized  cartel," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Between Oct. 2001 and Feb. 2006, the companies met about 60 times, mostly in Taiwanese hotels, for what they called "the Crystal meetings," the Commission said. In addition to  fixing  prices, they also exchanged information on their future production plans and other business plans, it said.

The cartel affected LCD panel sales worth about euro7 billion ($9.24 billion) in the European market, Almunia said, and the cartel's impact on consumers was strong because most televisions and computers sold in the region come from Asia.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair," said Almunia. "The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behavior."
The European Commission launched the cartel investigation in 2006 in parallel with similar action by
U.S. regulators. These followed probes by South Korea and Japan.
None of the companies could be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.

A look at economic developments and activity in major stock markets around the world Wednesday:
--------

TD
DUBLIN -- A defiant Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen is vowing to push through Europe's toughest
slash-and-tax budget in the face of voter fury, then defy the odds to win re-election despite a debt disaster
that has shaken the entire eurozone.
Cowen's vigorous defense of his embattled leadership comes a day after lawmakers narrowly backed a
2011 budget containing euro6 billion ($8 billion) in cuts and tax hikes that will take an estimated euro3,000
($4,000) per year out of average Irish households. The unprecedented scale of the budget-tightening was
a key condition for Ireland's recent agreement of a euro67.5 billion ($90 billion) EU-IMF rescue fund to
help Ireland cover its European-leading deficit and revive its debt-struck banks.

Wednesday's yields on 10-year bonds were little changed for the eurozone members rated most at risk of an eventual default, particularly Greece, which in May became the first eurozone member to be saved from bankruptcy. The most significant mover was Germany, whose benchmark bonds suffered a
moderate selloff, driving their 10-year yields above 3 percent for the first time since May's Greek crisis.

Traders said the selling reflected investors' increased appetite for higher-risk bonds versus the Germans' top-rated and consequently low-yielding debt securities.
------

LONDON -- European stocks traded in narrow ranges as bond market investors fretted about Europe's debt crisis and over the scale of U.S. borrowing following President Barack Obama's agreement with the Republicans to extend tax cuts.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 13.92 points, or 0.2 percent, at
5,794.53 while Germany's DAX fell 26.04 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,975.87. The CAC-40 in France
ended 21.48 points, or 0.6 percent, higher at 3,831.98.

More dramatic developments are being seen in the dollar and in U.S. government bonds following Obama's tax cuts compromise. Bond investors are worried there is no credible plan to get a grip on the U.S.'s own problems.

By late afternoon London time, the euro was trading 0.4 percent lower at $1.3226, while the dollar was 0.8 percent firmer at 84.22 yen.

Investors are also keeping a close watch on developments in China, amid mounting market talk that the country's monetary authorities are planning to raise interest rates soon to rein in inflationary pressures and cool a property-related credit boom.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 1 percent to 2,848.55 while the Shenzhen Composite
Index for China's smaller, second market dropped 0.3 percent to 1,305.25. South Korea's Kospi slipped
0.4 percent to 1,955.72 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.4 percent to 23,092.52.

Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average bucked the trend, adding 91.23, or 0.9 percent, to 10,232.33 as the yen continued to weaken against the dollar to the relief of the country's exporters.
Oil prices slipped slightly to just above $88 a barrel after hitting a two-year high on Tuesday.
------

PRAGUE -- Thousands of angry state employees walk off the job across the Czech Republic to protest salary cuts, forcing the closure of hundreds of schools and government offices in what union leaders claimed was one of the largest protests in 20 years.

The strike, backed by the country's major umbrella union organization and the left-wing opposition, was aimed at a government plan to slash public sector pay by 10 percent as part of package of austerity measures. The union said that nearly 150,000 workers joined the protest in the country.

The government wants to eliminate the deficit by 2016, a plan that received positive reactions from rating agencies, but not from labor unions.
------

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia has requested a credit line worth 480 million euros over two years from the International Monetary Fund -- seeking a safety net in the midst of Europe's debt crisis and bond-market turmoil.

IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he will "rapidly" seek approval of the request from the fund's executive board.

Macedonia's conservative government says it will use the money to support the budget and capital investments. It expects the economy to grow 2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2011. The former Yugoslav republic dipped in recession in 2009 with unemployment hovering around a staggering 30 percent.

The arrangement does not require economic austerity -- contrasting with the IMF's bailout loans to neighbor Greece, which is receiving euro110 billion from the fund and European countries after over-borrowing brought it to the brink of default.
------

BRUSSELS -- The EU competition watchdog fined five Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies 649 million euros ($857 million) for fixing  prices on LCD panels between 2001 and 2006.

The companies include Chimei InnoLux Corp., LG Display Co., AU Optronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. Samsung Electronics Co., also participated in the price  fixing  but escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the European Commission said.

Monday's fines targeted price-fixing  for LCD panels used in flat screens for televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks. The European Union's initial investigation had also included smaller LCD screens like the ones built into mobile phones, digital cameras, or MP3 players, but the  fines did not target price-fixing  for those products.

Between Oct. 2001 and Feb. 2006, the companies met about 60 times, mostly in Taiwanese hotels, for what they called "the Crystal meetings," the Commission said. In addition to  fixing  prices, they also exchanged information on their future production plans and other business plans, it said.

BERLIN -- Industrial production in Germany rose sharply in October and exports remained strong despite a month-on-month dip, indicating that Europe's biggest economy is still in good health amid troubles elsewhere on the continent.

Production was up 2.9 percent on the month, the Economy Ministry said -- led by a 4.6 percent increase in output of so-called investment goods such as machinery, a mainstay of the German economy. The increase followed a 1 percent dip in September, revised down from an initial reading of 0.8 percent.

Exports, meanwhile, declined by 1.1 percent on the month in October, giving up some of the previous month's sharp 3 percent gain, the Federal Statistical Office said. Germany, the world's second-biggest exporter after China, exported goods and services worth euro86.8 billion ($115.7 billion).

LONDON -- Iceland's central bank has cut its key interest rate by 1 percentage point to 4.5 percent, continuing the bank's gradual lowering of the seven-day collateral lending rate as Iceland recovers from the global financial crisis.

The rate peaked at 18 percent in October 2008, when the country's banking system collapsed under the strain of the worldwide credit squeeze.
Sedlabanki also lowered its deposit and overnight lending rates.

The European Union (EU) regulator today  fined five Taiwanese and a South Korean electronics companies a total of 648.9 million ($858 million), for  fixing  prices of liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels.

LCD panels are the main component of thin, flat screens used in televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks.

TD
Brussels-based EU's competition watchdog The  European Commission (EC) finedSamsung Electronics and LG Display of South Korea and AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corp, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp of Taiwan.

The EC gave Samsung full immunity from  fines under its leniency programme, as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair. The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour.

The only understanding we will show is for those that come forward to denounce a  cartel and help prove its existence," said Joaquin Almunia, the vice president in charge of competition policy of EC.
The EC said that the six  LCD manufacturers operated as a  cartel between October 2001 and February
2006, during which, the companies agreed prices, including price ranges and minimum prices,
exchanged information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial
conditions.

The cartel members met more than 60 times mainly in hotels in Taiwan for what they called "the Crystal meetings," the EC said.

The EC said that these agreements had a direct impact on customers in the European Economic Area (EEA) because the vast majority of televisions, computer monitors and notebooks incorporating those LCD panels sold in the EEA came from Asia.

Chimei InnoLUx received the biggest  fine with 300 million, LG, the world's second-biggest  LCD maker has been fined 215 million, while AU Optronics $116.8 million, Chunghwa Picture Tubes 9 million and HannStar Display 8.1 million.

Following a December 2009 lawsuit by Nokia against eight LCD makers for forming a  cartel to fix price, (See: Nokia sues  LCD, CRT display makers for price-fixing
(http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_n/Nokia/20091202_price-fixing.html))  the US
regulator fined LG Display, Philips, Toshiba, Samsung, Chi Mei, Chunghwa, Sharp and Hitachi Displays
more than $890 million in criminal  fines.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined six Asian makers of liquid crystal display screens a total of EUR649 million for operating a price-fixing  cartel for almost five years.

Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) and LG Display (034220.SE) of Korea, and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics (2409.TW), Chimei InnoLux Corporation (3481.TW), Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475.TW) and HannStar Display Corporation (6116.TW) met monthly in Taiwanese hotels to agree on prices and share other commercially sensitive information, the commission said.
The cartel ran from 2001 to 2006.

The commission fined LG Display EUR215 million, AU Optronics EUR117 million, Chimei InnoLux EUR300 million, Chungwa EUR9 million and HannStar EUR8 million. Samsung Electronics was granted immunity from the  fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

The fines were based on European sales of more than EUR7 billion over the  cartel period, the commission said. The European Union has the power to  fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaking its antitrust rules.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, have the obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe," the EU's Competition chief Joaquin Almunia said. "The fact that the meetings took place outside of the EU is no excuse."

The companies knew their actions were illegal and took steps to conceal their gatherings, which they called "the Crystal meetings," the commissioner said. He added a  cartel document requested all the participants "to take care of confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."
There were around 60 meetings in all, Almunia said.

The cartel had a direct impact on European consumers as  LCD screens are used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops. Most of those products sold in the EU come from Asia, he added.

In setting the fines, the commission took into account the level of sales the company has in the EU and the duration of the cartel. It also reduced the  fines of some of the companies to reward their cooperation with the cartel investigation.
LG Display's price-fixing  penalty follows a $400 million  fine after a price-fixing  investigation in the
U.S. two years ago.
Chunghwa Picture Tubes had also pleaded guilty to price  fixing  in the same investigation.

No-one was immediately available at the companies to comment on the  fines.

With panel shipments increasing across the board last month, AU Optronics Corp (AUO, ) yesterday said that preliminary consolidated revenue last month reached NT$36.87 billion (US$1.2 billion), up 4.95 percent from October, but down 4.03 percent from a year earlier because falling prices, a company statement showed.

The Hsinchu-based company posted consolidated revenues of NT$35.13 billion in October, the lowest since Februarys NT$32.67 billion, and NT$38.42 billion in November last year.

TD
The company, the nations No. 2 flat-panel maker by revenue after Chimei Innolux Corp, said that shipments of large-sized panels last month rose 6.3 percent from the previous month to about 9.72
-million units, while those of small and medium-sized panels edged up 1.5 percent to 18.04 million units.

Large-sized panels refer to models that are 10 inches or more and that are mainly used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and  LCD TVs, while small to medium-sized panels refer to those under 10 inches that are used in smartphones and netbooks.

Consolidated revenue in the first 11 months of the year totaled NT$436.55 billion, up 35.37 percent from NT$322.5 billion in the same period last year, the firm said.

On Oct. 27, the company said that shipments of large-sized panels would likely grow by 3 to 5 percent quarter-on-quarter from the 28.7 million units shipped in the third quarter, but that the average selling price would likely fall further this quarter.

Prices of flat panels have been undergoing a prolonged downward spiral in recent months due to excessive inventories. In the first half of this month, IT panel prices remained flat from the last two weeks of last month, while TV panel prices continued to display a slower decline, market researcher DisplaySearchs data showed.

Citigroup analyst Jonathan Rhee said he expected IT panel prices to rebound in the fourth quarter, while TV panel prices will drop at a slower rate.

We expect IT panel customers to start restocking given limited room for further price drops. However, we expect TV panel prices to continue to decline albeit more mildly, given
less-than-strong Chinese demand after the Chinese Golden Week and still relatively weak North
American demand, he said in a report on Sunday.
EU FINES

Meanwhile, LG Display Co, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp and three other companies may be  fined up to 700 million euros (US$930 million) by the EU for  fixing  the price of  LCD panels, Reuters reported.

Samsung Electronics Co may escape  fines, to be levied today, because it was the first in the  cartel
to inform the  European Commission, Reuters said on Monday.

LCD panels are used in mobile phones, televisions and computers.

Chi Mei, which merged with Innolux Display Corp in March to form Chimei Innolux Corp, pleaded guilty to US antitrust charges last year and agreed to pay US$220 million in  fines.

LG Display and Samsung Electronics said in 2006 they were being probed by regulators around the world over alleged price fixing.
AU Optronics said it received a formal complaint from the  European Commission in May last year. Lee Bang-soo, a spokesman for LG Display, didnt immediately respond to a call or e-mail outside
normal office hours. Likewise, a call to Samsung Electronics in Seoul and calls and e-mails to Chi
Mei representatives Eddie Chen and Loreta Chen went unanswered outside business hours.

€300 million, Chungwa €9 million and HannStar €8 million. Samsung Electronics got full immunity from
the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

The fines took into account each company's share of the more than €7 billion in  LCD sales in Europe over the cartel period, the commission said. But it reduced the  fines of some of the companies to reward their cooperation with the  cartel investigation. The EU has the power to  fine companies as much as 10% of their global revenue for breaking its antitrust rules.

The EU's action comes two years after LG Display paid a $400 million  fine and pleaded guilty to criminal price-fixing  charges in the U.S. Chunghwa Picture Tubes pleaded guilty in the same U.S. investigation.
Representatives of the companies weren't available to comment Wednesday .

The LCD makers fined by the EU knew their actions were illegal and took steps to conceal their gatherings, which they called "the crystal meetings," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. There were around 60 such meetings in all, the commissioner said.

He added that a  cartel document asked all the participants "to take care of confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."

"Foreign companies, like European ones, have the obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe," Mr. Almunia said.

LCD screens are used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops.

HD       Taiwan panel maker to appeal EU price-fixing fine

Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA) AU Optronics Corp. of Taiwan said Wednesday night that it will appeal a  European
Commission decision to slap heavy fines on it and three other Taiwanese flat panel makers and a
South Korean manufacturer for allegedly fixing  prices on the EU market.

AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. were fined a total of 433.92 million euro (some NT$17.3 billion) for violating EU's competition rules and trying to hide their "law-breaking behavior."

TD
An AUO spokesman said it has cooperated with EU authorities over the past four years in their investigation into industry practices regarding the production and marketing of TFT-LCD products.

The company, which was  fined 116.8 million euro, has decided to file an appeal with the General Court in Luxemburg and vigorously defend its business practices, the spokesman said.

Chi Mei and Chunghwa said they are taking a closer look at the EU decision before taking their next steps. A Chi Mei executive said the  fine on his company, 300 million euro, is "really too harsh." Chunghua was fined 9.02 million euro.
HannStar Display Corp., which got a  fine of 8.1 million euro, would not comment on the EC action. Market analysts said the Taiwanese manufacturers are not making big profits and the  fines are "simply
too heavy."

The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the government would provide all necessary assistance to the manufacturers.

Duh Tyzz-jiun, director general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau, told the Central News Agency that as long as the accused companies need assistance when facing disciplinary action, the government would try its best to help them.

Duh and other economics officials admitted the heavy  fines will have impacts on Taiwan's flat panel industry.
LG Display of South Korea was also on the hitting list, being given a 215 million euro  fine. Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged since it
alerted the  European Commission to the price-fixing  practices.

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (CIA) - The European Commission has fined six LCD panel producers a total of EUR 649 mln for operating a cartel which harmed European buyers of television sets, computers and other products that use the key Liquid Crystal Display component, Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said in a press conference on Wednesday, December 8.
According to his words, the  cartel applied to six Asian companies, which agreed on prices, according to server ct24.cz.

The cartel agreement was reported by South Korean Samsung Electronics, which thus avoided the  fine. It will be the eighth highest  fine from the fines imposed by the European Commission on groups of firms due to the violation of business competition rules.

HD        Display panel cartel fined €649m

Five Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies in a  cartel with Samsung have been  fined a total of €648.9m ($858m) by Europe's antitrust watchdog. The companies ran their operation in the market for display panels that are used in consumer gadgets.

The five companies are LG Display of South Korea and Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei Innolux, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display.

TD
Samsung blew the whistle on the  cartel and so escaped penalty.

EU officials said on Wednesday that the companies met more than 60 times over about four years to agree prices, production schedules and other commercial conditions.

The assignations, called "the crystal meetings", took place mainly in Taiwanese hotels, but had a big knock-on effect in Europe, where large volumes of televisions, computer monitors and notebooks using the panels were sold.

The biggest single penalty will be paid by Chimei, at €300m. LG Display faces a €215m  fine, but this came after significant reductions because the company co-operated and was the first to produce evidence that the  cartel continued beyond 2005. It received partial immunity.

Of the other three companies, AU Optronics is  fined €116.8m, after getting a 20 per cent reduction for co-operation; Chunghwa pays €9.025m after a 5 per cent reduction for co-operation; and HannStar is fined €8.1m.

Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said the case showed that "foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair". "The companies concerned knew that they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour."

He added that two of the companies, who remain unidentified, had asked for reductions in  fines on grounds of financial hardship and "inability to pay," but that these arguments did not succeed.
In similar probes into the  LCD market in the US and Japan, Japanese companies were also penalised. Mr Almunia said that there had been no proof that their products were involved in the particular markets
that were examined by the  European Commission, which included thin-film  LCD panels used in
computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital watches, pocket calculators and MP3 players.

This is the seventh  cartel case dealt with by Brussels this year, and takes the total amount of  fines to in excess of €3bn. The record annual total was in 2007 when  fines topped €3.3bn on aggregate. Between
2006 and 2010 fines have exceeded €1.5bn a year.

BRUSSELS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - LG Display, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp and three other firms were fined a total of 649 million euros ($858 million) by EU regulators on Wednesday for  fixing  prices of display panels used in consumer devices.

The European Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, charged the companies in July last year with breaching EU laws on restrictive business practices, while other regulators around the world have
also investigated the sector.

Chi Mei, now part of Chi Mei Innolux, Taiwan's largest maker of  LCD panels, was hit with the biggest fine of 300 million euros. It paid $220 million in  fines last year after pleading guilty to U.S. charges of price fixing.

LG Display, the world's second-biggest  LCD maker, and AU Optronics were penalised 215 million euros and 116.8 million euros respectively.

A fine of 9 million euros was levied on Taiwanese firm Chunghwa Picture Tubes and of 8.1 million euros on HannStar Display Corp.World No.1  LCD maker Samsung Electronics was not  fined as it alerted the Commission to the  cartel.
"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in
Europe they must play fair," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
The Commission, which can penalise companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for
infringing EU laws, said the  cartel operated between October 2001 and February 2006 and met about
60 times in "crystal meetings".
Almunia said the investigation did not find any proof that Japanese  LCD makers were involved. In the U.S. Department of Justice investigation, eight companies, including LG Display, Chi Mei,
Chunghwa, Japanese company Sharp Corp and Hitachi Displays, paid more than $890 million in
criminal fines for price fixing.

Japan's Fair Trade Commission slapped  fines on Sharp Corp and Hitachi Ltd in 2008 for price  fixing
in the market for  LCD panels.

"LG Display acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past and respects the  European Commission's regulatory authority in this regard," the world's No.2  LCD flat screen maker said in a statement.

"However, LG Display may, after careful review and consideration, appeal today's decision to the EU General Court if it finds there were procedural or substantive due process issues with the investigation."

The European Commission on Wednesday imposed a 649-million-euro (860-million-dollar) antitrust  fine on a cartel of manufacturers of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens for computers and televisions, DPA reports. EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Samsung and LG of Korea, AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux, Chungwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation were found to have colluded from 2001 to 2006 to fix prices and exchange industrial information. Samsung was rewarded for blowing the whistle on the illegal arrangement with a total exemption from  fines, while LG was hit with a
215-million-euro bill. Chimei was ordered to pay 300 million euros, AU Optronics 116.8, Chunghwa 9 and HannStar 8.1, Almunia said. Two companies - unnamed to protect their commercial interests - asked for a discount claiming they were in financial dire straits, but EU officials "concluded that neither request was justified," Almunia said.

TD
The commissioner stressed that non-EU companies are subject to EU antitrust rules if they sell their products in the bloc, even if their cartel meetings take place outside of the EU's jurisdiction. Wednesday's decision was the seventh cartel fine the EU executive imposed in 2010, bringing the year's total to over 3 billion euros. EU rules prohibit price-fixing  and other market manipulation. The EU's executive arm, has a long record of breaking up cartels, issuing  fines worth billions of dollars in the process.

NEW YORK - The compromise backed by President Barack Obama and Republican leaders on extending tax cuts crushed bonds on Wednesday as traders expected the plan to lead to higher budget deficits and a pickup in economic growth. Stocks swung between modest gains and losses.

Treasury prices dropped sharply, sending their yields higher for a second day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.28 per cent, the highest level since June 15 and a huge jump from the 2.93 per cent it was trading at on Monday before the tax deal was announced.

Economists are raising their estimates for economic growth as a result of the tax-cut package. Goldman Sachs economists released a rough estimate Wednesday saying that the tax relief could wind up adding between 0.5 and one percentage point to economic growth next year.
Stock indices opened higher but turned mixed in early afternoon trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average was 6.7 points higher, by 0.06 per cent, to 11,365.86. The broader
Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.98 or 0.24 per cent, to 1,226.63. The Nasdaq composite index rose
7.98, or 0.31 per cent, to 2,606.47.
The higher rates in the Treasury market helped push the dollar up against other currencies including the
Japanese yen and the euro. The dollar rose 0.4 per cent against an index of six other major currencies.

LONDON - The European single currency dipped against the dollar on Wednesday, with the greenback still benefiting from the prospect of extended US tax cuts and stubborn worries over the eurozone debt crisis.
The euro weakened to 1.3226 dollars in late afternoon trading in London, from 1.3258 dollars late on
Tuesday in New York.
The dollar meanwhile gained against the Japanese unit, trading at 84.20 yen against 83.45 yen on
Tuesday.

European stocks were mixed, with the London FTSE 100 index of leading shares dropping 0.24 per cent at 5,794.53 points.

In Paris, the CAC 40 climbed 0.56 per cent to 3,831.98 points while in Frankfurt the DAX per cent slipped 0.37 per cent to 6,975.87 points.

Elsewhere, Madrid gained 1.55 per cent, Milan 1.40 per cent, Lisbon 0.89 per cent, Swiss shares 0.71 per cent, and Amsterdam 0.15 per cent. Brussels dropped 0.28 per cent.

TOKYO - Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.9 per cent on Wednesday after briefly hitting its highest level in almost seven months, as the dollar's rise against the yen encouraged buying after Tokyo stocks had fallen during the previous two sessions.

Foreign fund operators were keen on investing in lagging Tokyo equities but the Nikkei's advance was limited ahead of the settlement of futures and options prices on Friday, analysts said.

The Nikkei gained 91.23 points to 10,232.33, having touched an intraday high of 10,258.90, its highest level since May 18.
The broader Topix index rose 0.9 per cent to 887.39.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong shares fell 1.43 per cent and Shanghai lost 0.95 per cent on Wednesday as traders awaited a possible interest rate rise on the mainland aimed at damping down inflation.

Expectations of a rate rise have grown ahead of key economic data for November, which the mainland authorities said would be released this coming Saturday instead of the following Monday as scheduled earlier.
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index shed 335.63 points to end at 23,092.52. Turnover was
$HK77.71 billion ($A10.18 billion).
In Shanghai, the Composite Index, which covers both A and B shares, was down 27.31 points at
2,848.55 on turnover of 110.2 billion yuan ($A16.7 billion).
Gold miners led the decline as the price of the precious metal slipped from a record high on Tuesday. Asian stock markets mostly fell amid expectations of the possible Chinese interest rate rise.
In other markets, Seoul closed 0.35 per cent lower, Taipei was flat, Jakarta rose 1.28 per cent, Singapore rose 0.34 per cent, Kuala Lumpur rose 0.55 per cent, Bangkok fell 1.50 per cent, or 15.64 points, and Mumbai fell 1.19 per cent.

The benchmark NZX-50 index closed up 12.478 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 3,294.336, after closing on
Wednesday down 11.3 points.

Stuart Hardie at Craigs Investment Partners said strength in selective leaders pushed the index higher on a day there was little corporate news to trade on.

SYDNEY - The Australian market is receiving mixed leads from offshore trading overnight, with securities indices mixed, whilst precious metals and oil were lower. The US dollar rose.
On the ASX 24 at 0704 AEDT, the December share price index futures contract was 16 points higher at
4,716.

In economics news on Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases labour force data for November, and the Australian Office of Financial Management conducts a tender process to issue $600 million of Treasury Notes maturing on February 11, 2011, and $600 million of Treasury Notes maturing on April 29, 2011.
In equities news, Ten Network Holdings Ltd and Bank Of Queensland Ltd hold annual general meetings. Westfield Group holds a security holder meeting to approve the proposal to establish the Westfield Retail
Trust.

On Wednesday, financial stocks dragged the Australian share market lower from an almost one month high after the Federal Treasurer pledged to release banking competition measures within the next week.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index declined 26.9 points, or 0.57 per cent, to close at 4,699.9 on Wednesday, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 24.3 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 4,791.7. The All Ords closed at 4,816 on Tuesday, the highest since November 10.
ENERGY
World oil prices fell toward $US88 on Wednesday as many traders took profits and digested a mixed US
energy report, after the market had struck recent two-year peaks, analysts said.

In mid-afternoon trade, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for January, had retreated 27 cents at $US88.42 a barrel, one day after hitting 90.76, a level last seen on October 8, 2008.

Prior to Wednesday, the oil market was boosted by a cold snap in Europe and rising sentiment over the global economic outlook, but eurozone debt crisis worries were also weighing on crude markets, traders said.

Elsewhere, the US government's Department of Energy (DoE) announced on Wednesday that American crude oil reserves sank by 3.8 million barrels in the week ending December 3.

That compared with market expectations for a lighter drop of 1.2 million barrels, according to analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires.

The DoE added, however, that gasoline or petrol stockpiles advanced by 3.8 million barrels last week. Market expectations had been for a small gain of 100,000 barrels.
PRECIOUS METALS

Gold prices fell more than one per cent for a second day on Wednesday as an extended fall in US Treasury prices fuelled profit-taking from bullion's record run by investors seeking better yield returns.

Spot gold traded at $1,381.35 an ounce, down 1.4 per cent, at 12:39 pm EST (1739 GMT), having earlier fallen by as much as 2.1 per cent to a one-week low of $1,371.45. US gold futures for February delivery fell $26 to $1,383 an ounce.

Technical selling accelerated the decline in silver prices, which had jumped to a 30-year high above $30 an ounce, but investment interest remained high as the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund hit another record high.

Silver dropped one per cent to $28.37 an ounce, causing the gold/silver ratio to stabilise hear a near-four year low.

Gold has lost some safe-haven appeal as, for the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were placed on the back burner and investors focused on US economic fundamentals in a thinning market.


Page 52 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Gold hit an all-time high at $1,430.95 an ounce on Tuesday, but has now fallen by about 4 per cent after the rally ran out of steam.

The world's largest silver ETF, iShares Silver Trust, said its holdings hit another record at 10,941.34 tonnes by Wednesday.
Setting gold on the back foot early in the day was a rally in the dollar, after the proposed extension in US
tax cuts prompted a spike in bond yields on Tuesday, which in turn raised the cost of holding gold to
non-US investors.
Platinum dropped 0.9 per cent to $1,674 an ounce, while palladium slipped 0.5 per cent to $726.47. BASE METALS
Copper ended sharply higher on Wednesday, moving back up against record highs, as supply-side constraints continued to draw in strong investment demand flows, even as the dollar rose and rate hike concerns in top-consumer China mounted.

Copper's bullish momentum picked up late in the day, while surrounding markets like gold, silver and crude oil slipped, reinforcing the red metal's strong fundamental backdrop.

On the London Metal Exchange (LME), three-month copper closed up $245 at $9,015 a tonne, well within striking distance of Tuesday's record high of $9,044.

COMEX copper for March delivery climbed 5.10 cents, or nearly 1.3 per cent, to finish at $4.1005 per lb, near its own record at $4.1315 per lb.

Stocks of copper at LME warehouses have declined since February, indicating a pick-up in demand and against a backdrop of tight supply.

The latest data showed stocks fell 1,125 tonnes to 350,250 tonnes, on their way to the biggest annual decline in six years.

The prospects of an undersupplied market have helped boost the price of metal for nearby delivery to a premium against the benchmark contract since early November.
Among other metals, aluminum ended up $70 at $2,375 a tonne.
Some term premiums for primary aluminum shipments to Japan for January-March were agreed at
$112-$113 per tonne, a trader said, marking the lowest level in six quarters and the fourth straight
quarterly drop.
Tin was untraded at the close but last bid at $25,600 a tonne.

Top tin producer Indonesia forecast tin output will climb to 95,097 tonnes in 2011, from 54,646 tonnes this year.

(Gold is the February contract on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, silver and copper are the March contracts, and oil is January.)

NEW YORK - US stocks closed modestly higher on Wednesday as traders awaited developments on a controversial tax-cuts deal that is seen key to the economic recovery.

In a day lacking major market movers and economic indicators, the spotlight turned to the spectacular debut of two Chinese internet companies on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 13.32 points (0.12 per cent) to 11,372.48 when
markets settled, while the S&P 500 index, a broader measure of the market, gained 4.53 points (0.37 per
cent) to 1,228.28.


Page 56 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The tech-rich Nasdaq climbed 10.67 points (0.41 per cent) to 2,609.16.

The compromise between President Barack Obama and his Republican foes would see an extension of tax breaks to all income classes, including the wealthiest Americans, which Obama had vehemently opposed.

The deal was seen by many economists as key to the US economic recovery, with Goldman Sachs analysts estimating the package could roughly add 0.5 to 1.0 percentage point to gross domestic product growth in 2011.

The biggest winners of the day were two Chinese companies that made stellar initial public offerings (IPOs) on Wednesday, highlighting traders' thirst for stakes in firms based in the world's fastest growing economy.

Dangdang, China's largest online book retailer, boasting an impressive 50 per cent hold of the market, saw its shares trade at $US29.91, 87 per cent higher than their initial price tag.
And Youku.com, the Chinese equivalent of the hugely popular Youtube online video website, fetched
33.44 dollars, a whopping 161 per cent above its offering price.

LONDON - The European single currency dipped against the dollar on Wednesday, with the greenback still benefiting from the prospect of extended US tax cuts and stubborn worries over the eurozone debt crisis.
The euro weakened to 1.3226 dollars in late afternoon trading in London, from 1.3258 dollars late on
Tuesday in New York.
The dollar meanwhile gained against the Japanese unit, trading at 84.20 yen against 83.45 yen on
Tuesday.

European stocks were mixed, with the London FTSE 100 index of leading shares dropping 0.24 per cent at 5,794.53 points.

In Paris, the CAC 40 climbed 0.56 per cent to 3,831.98 points while in Frankfurt the DAX per cent slipped 0.37 per cent to 6,975.87 points.

Elsewhere, Madrid gained 1.55 per cent, Milan 1.40 per cent, Lisbon 0.89 per cent, Swiss shares 0.71 per cent, and Amsterdam 0.15 per cent. Brussels dropped 0.28 per cent.

2,848.55 on turnover of 110.2 billion yuan ($A16.7 billion).
Gold miners led the decline as the price of the precious metal slipped from a record high on Tuesday. Asian stock markets mostly fell amid expectations of the possible Chinese interest rate rise.

ENERGY

Oil prices fell toward $US88 a barrel as many traders took profits and digested a mixed US energy reserves report, after the market had struck recent two-year peaks.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for January, retreated 41 cents to settle at $US88.28 a barrel, a day after hitting $US90.76, a level last seen on October 8, 2008.

And in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in January shed 62 cents to close at $US90.77 per barrel, after hitting a 26-month high at $US92.86 on Tuesday.

Prior to Wednesday, the oil market was boosted by a cold snap in Europe and rising optimism about the global economic outlook.

However, worries about the eurozone sovereign debt crisis were also weighing on crude oil markets, traders said.

The US government's Department of Energy (DoE) reported Wednesday that American crude oil reserves sank by 3.8 million barrels in the week ending December 3.

That compared with market expectations for a much smaller drop of 1.2 million barrels, according to analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires.

The DoE added that gasoline stockpiles advanced by 3.8 million barrels last week, however, sharply higher than the expected gain of 100,000 barrels.

Spot gold traded at $1,381.35 an ounce, down 1.4 per cent, at 12:39 pm EST (1739 GMT), having earlier fallen by as much as 2.1 per cent to a one-week low of $1,371.45. US gold futures for February delivery fell $26 to $1,383 an ounce.

Technical selling accelerated the decline in silver prices, which had jumped to a 30-year high above $30 an ounce, but investment interest remained high as the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund hit another record high.

Silver dropped one per cent to $28.37 an ounce, causing the gold/silver ratio to stabilise hear a near-four year low.

Gold has lost some safe-haven appeal as, for the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were placed on the back burner and investors focused on US economic fundamentals in a thinning market.

Gold hit an all-time high at $1,430.95 an ounce on Tuesday, but has now fallen by about 4 per cent after the rally ran out of steam.

The world's largest silver ETF, iShares Silver Trust, said its holdings hit another record at 10,941.34 tonnes by Wednesday.
Setting gold on the back foot early in the day was a rally in the dollar, after the proposed extension in US
tax cuts prompted a spike in bond yields on Tuesday, which in turn raised the cost of holding gold to
non-US investors.
Platinum dropped 0.9 per cent to $1,674 an ounce, while palladium slipped 0.5 per cent to $726.47. BASE METALS
Copper ended sharply higher on Wednesday, moving back up against record highs, as supply-side constraints continued to draw in strong investment demand flows, even as the dollar rose and rate hike concerns in top-consumer China mounted.

Copper's bullish momentum picked up late in the day, while surrounding markets like gold, silver and crude oil slipped, reinforcing the red metal's strong fundamental backdrop.

On the London Metal Exchange (LME), three-month copper closed up $245 at $9,015 a tonne, well within striking distance of Tuesday's record high of $9,044.

COMEX copper for March delivery climbed 5.10 cents, or nearly 1.3 per cent, to finish at $4.1005 per lb, near its own record at $4.1315 per lb.

Stocks of copper at LME warehouses have declined since February, indicating a pick-up in demand and against a backdrop of tight supply.

The latest data showed stocks fell 1,125 tonnes to 350,250 tonnes, on their way to the biggest annual decline in six years.

The prospects of an undersupplied market have helped boost the price of metal for nearby delivery to a premium against the benchmark contract since early November.
Among other metals, aluminum ended up $70 at $2,375 a tonne.
Some term premiums for primary aluminum shipments to Japan for January-March were agreed at
$112-$113 per tonne, a trader said, marking the lowest level in six quarters and the fourth straight
quarterly drop.
Tin was untraded at the close but last bid at $25,600 a tonne.

Top tin producer Indonesia forecast tin output will climb to 95,097 tonnes in 2011, from 54,646 tonnes this year.

NEW YORK - US stocks closed modestly higher on Wednesday as traders awaited developments on a controversial tax-cuts deal that is seen key to the economic recovery.

In a day lacking major market movers and economic indicators, the spotlight turned to the spectacular debut of two Chinese internet companies on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 13.32 points (0.12 per cent) to 11,372.48 when
markets settled, while the S&P 500 index, a broader measure of the market, gained 4.53 points (0.37 per
cent) to 1,228.28.
The tech-rich Nasdaq climbed 10.67 points (0.41 per cent) to 2,609.16.

The compromise between President Barack Obama and his Republican foes would see an extension of tax breaks to all income classes, including the wealthiest Americans, which Obama had vehemently opposed.

The deal was seen by many economists as key to the US economic recovery, with Goldman Sachs analysts estimating the package could roughly add 0.5 to 1.0 percentage point to gross domestic product growth in 2011.

The biggest winners of the day were two Chinese companies that made stellar initial public offerings (IPOs) on Wednesday, highlighting traders' thirst for stakes in firms based in the world's fastest growing economy.

Dangdang, China's largest online book retailer, boasting an impressive 50 per cent hold of the market, saw its shares trade at $US29.91, 87 per cent higher than their initial price tag.
And Youku.com, the Chinese equivalent of the hugely popular Youtube online video website, fetched
33.44 dollars, a whopping 161 per cent above its offering price.

LONDON - The European single currency dipped against the dollar on Wednesday, with the greenback still benefiting from the prospect of extended US tax cuts and stubborn worries over the eurozone debt crisis.
The euro weakened to 1.3226 dollars in late afternoon trading in London, from 1.3258 dollars late on
Tuesday in New York.
The dollar meanwhile gained against the Japanese unit, trading at 84.20 yen against 83.45 yen on
Tuesday.

European stocks were mixed, with the London FTSE 100 index of leading shares dropping 0.24 per cent at 5,794.53 points.
In Paris, the CAC 40 climbed 0.56 per cent to 3,831.98 points while in Frankfurt the DAX per cent slipped
0.37 per cent to 6,975.87 points.

Elsewhere, Madrid gained 1.55 per cent, Milan 1.40 per cent, Lisbon 0.89 per cent, Swiss shares 0.71 per cent, and Amsterdam 0.15 per cent. Brussels dropped 0.28 per cent.

TOKYO - Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.9 per cent on Wednesday after briefly hitting its highest level in almost seven months, as the dollar's rise against the yen encouraged buying after Tokyo stocks had fallen during the previous two sessions.

Foreign fund operators were keen on investing in lagging Tokyo equities but the Nikkei's advance was limited ahead of the settlement of futures and options prices on Friday, analysts said.

The Nikkei gained 91.23 points to 10,232.33, having touched an intraday high of 10,258.90, its highest level since May 18.
The broader Topix index rose 0.9 per cent to 887.39.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong shares fell 1.43 per cent and Shanghai lost 0.95 per cent on Wednesday as traders awaited a possible interest rate rise on the mainland aimed at damping down inflation.

Expectations of a rate rise have grown ahead of key economic data for November, which the mainland authorities said would be released this coming Saturday instead of the following Monday as scheduled earlier.
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index shed 335.63 points to end at 23,092.52. Turnover was
$HK77.71 billion ($A10.18 billion).
In Shanghai, the Composite Index, which covers both A and B shares, was down 27.31 points at
2,848.55 on turnover of 110.2 billion yuan ($A16.7 billion).
Gold miners led the decline as the price of the precious metal slipped from a record high on Tuesday.

South Korea's LG Display Thursday admitted "wrongful acts" but said it may appeal against a huge  fine
levied by the European Commission for price-fixing.
The commission Wednesday fined the South Korean firm 215 million euros (285 million dollars) for  fixing
the prices of liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels along with five other companies between 2001 and 2006.

TD
The fine was part of penalties totalling 649 million euros levied on four Taiwanese companies and the
South Korean firm.

The leader in the  LCD business, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, was also accused of being part of the cartel. It escaped a  fine because it came forward first with information on the price-fixing.

Europe's competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel that set prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers.

LG Display, the world's second-largest supplier of LCD panels, said in a statement it "acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past" and respects the European Commission's regulatory authority.

"However, LG Display may, after careful review and consideration, appeal today's decision to the EU General Court if it finds there were procedural or substantive due process issues with the investigation."

The company said such an appeal usually lasts more than two years and the  fine could in certain circumstances be substantially reduced.

LG Display said it had taken comprehensive measures to avoid repetition of such "mistakes" and reaffirmed its commitment to highest ethical standards. It said its business would not suffer as a result of the fine.

Taiwan's AU Optronics (AUO) said Thursday it would appeal against a  fine imposed by the European   Commission for price-fixing  of LCD flat screens for Europe's TVs and computers.

AUO said it was planning to file an appeal against the  fine of 116.8 million euros (155 million dollars) in the General Court in Luxembourg in a statement posted on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

TD
It expected the legal process to take at least two years and added that the European decision was not expected to affect its operations.

The European Commission on Wednesday slapped  fines totalling 649 million euros (860 million dollars) on AUO, Taiwan's Chimei InnoLux Corporation, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, HannStar Display Corporation, and South Korea's LG Display.

The other Taiwanese firms said they were considering whether to appeal while the  fines were not expected to have any major impact on their operations.

Europe's competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with liquid crystal displays.

The companies held monthly meetings to agree on price ranges and minimum prices, and traded information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions, the commission said.

The leader in the  LCD business, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, was also accused of being part of the cartel but escaped cash sanctions for coming forward first with information on the alleged scheme.

The European Commission has imposed 649 million euros in  fines on South Korean and Taiwanese electronics firms for secretly fixing  prices of LCD flat screens for Europe's TVs and computers.
A number of the companies indicated that they might appeal.

TD
The fines, worth 860 million dollars, were slapped Wednesday on Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corporation, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation along with South Korean firm LG Display.

The leader in the  LCD business, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, was also accused of being part of the cartel but escaped cash sanctions for coming forward first with information on the alleged scheme.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair," European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour," he said.

Europe's competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with liquid crystal displays.

The companies held monthly meetings to agree on price ranges and minimum prices, and traded information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions, the commission said.

Company officials met 60 times, mainly in hotels in Taiwan, for what they dubbed "the Crystal meetings," the regulator said.

"The fact that the  cartel meetings took place outside the EU is no excuse," Almunia told a news conference, saying the group was "very well organised."

The investigation found that the companies knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their meetings.

The commission cited a document urging everybody "to take care of security/confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."

Chimei InnoLux faces the largest  fine, 300 million euros, followed by 215 million euros against LG Display.

AU Optronics was  fined 116.8 million euros, followed by nine million euros for Chunghwa Picture Tubes and 8.1 million euros for HannStar Display.

Reacting on Thursday, South Korea's LG Display said in a statement it "acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past" and respects the  European Commission's regulatory authority.

Taiwan's AU Optronics (AUO) said it would appeal in the General Court in Luxembourg in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

The other Taiwanese firms said they were considering whether to appeal, while the  fines were not expected to have a major impact on their operations.

The European Commission said Wednesday that the  cartel had a direct impact on European consumers because "the vast majority" of televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks with LCD panels that are sold in Europe come from Asia. The market was worth more than seven billion euros over the period that the  cartel existed.

At the same time that the  European Commission opened its investigation in late 2006 other competition regulators in the United States and Asia did the same.

LG and Chunghwa, along with Japanese firm Sharp, pleaded guilty in the United States and were  fined a total of 585 million dollars in November 2008. LG was hit with the harshest penalty, of 400 million dollars.

The European Commission cracked down on seven cartels this year, imposing nearly three billion euros in total fines.

Brussels, 08/12/2010 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 8 December, the  European Commission imposed a €648,925,000  fine on six liquid crystal display panel producers for having formed a price-fixing cartel counter to the interests of European consumers who buy television sets, computers and other products containing  LCD screens. The companies  fined are LG Display of Korea (€215 million  fine) and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics (€116.8 million), Chimei InnoLux Corporation (€300 million), Chunghwa Picture Tubes (€9.025 million) and HannStar Display Corporation (€8.1 million). The Korean company Samsung Electronics escaped a fine due to the Commission's clemency programme given that it was the first to provide information on the cartel, which lasted over 4 years (October 2001 to February 2006). Article 101 of the EU Treaty bans price-fixing  practice and all restrictive trading.

TD
Commenting on this decision, the Commission vice-president, Joaquín Almunia, responsible for competition policy pointed out that “foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if
they want to do business in Europe they must play fair”. He went on to add that “the companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour”.

HD     South Korea's LG Display may appeal EU fine over LCD cartel

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Korea's LG Display said Thursday it may appeal on procedural grounds a massive European Union  fine for price fixing  even as it acknowledged it had violated competition law over several years.

The EU competition watchdog fined LG Display and four Taiwanese manufacturers euro649 million ($863 million) on Wednesday for fixing  prices on LCD panels between 2001 and 2006. One of the Taiwanese companies has already said it will challenge the ruling.

TD
A sixth LCD maker, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., also participated in the price  fixing  but escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the European Commission said.

"LG Display acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past and respects the  European Commission's regulatory authority in this regard," the company said in a statement.
The company was fined euro215 million.

Seoul-based LG Display Co., the world's second-biggest maker of liquid crystal displays after Samsung, said it may appeal the decision "if it finds there were procedural or substantive due process issues with the investigation."
The fines targeted price-fixing  for LCD panels used in flat screens for televisions and computer monitors. Between October 2001 and February 2006, the companies met about 60 times, mostly in Taiwanese
hotels, for what they called "the Crystal meetings," the commission said. In addition to  fixing  prices, they
also exchanged information on their future production plans and other business plans, it said.

The cartel affected  LCD panel sales worth about euro7 billion in the European market, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said, and its impact on consumers was strong because most televisions and computers sold in the region come from Asia.

LG Display said the EU appeals process generally takes more than two years and that the final amount of the fine could change and even be "significantly reduced."

The company said it "has taken comprehensive measures to avoid repetition of such mistakes and reaffirms its commitment to highest ethical standards and transparency in the company's management."

In Taiwan, a spokeswoman for AU Optronics Corp. said the company would appeal the euro116.8 million fine levied against it. The three other Taiwanese companies cited in the EU judgment -- Chimei InnoLux Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Chimei received the biggest  fine, euro300 million, while Chunghwa and HannStar were  fined euro9 million and euro8.1 million, respectively.

LG Display and its LG Display America Inc. unit agreed in November 2008 to pay a $400 million  fine imposed by the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust investigation of the  LCD industry in the United States covering a price-fixing  conspiracy from 2001 to 2006. Chunghwa Picture Tubes agreed to pay $65 million for participating with LG Display and other companies.

HD      DJ MARKET TALK: Asian LCD Makers Mostly Down On EU Fine

LP
0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest  fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million  fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty.

HD      MARKET TALK: Asian LCD Makers Mostly Down On EU Fine

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest  fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million  fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

TD
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined six Asian makers of liquid crystal display screens a total of EUR649 million for operating a price-fixing  cartel for almost five years.

Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) and LG Display Co. (034220.SE) of South Korea, and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics Corp. (2409.TW), Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481.TW), Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475.TW) and HannStar Display Corp. (6116.TW) met monthly in Taiwanese hotels to agree on prices and share other commercially sensitive information, the commission said.
The cartel ran from 2001 to 2006.

The commission fined LG Display EUR215 million, AU Optronics EUR117 million, Chimei Innolux EUR300 million, Chunghwa EUR9 million and HannStar EUR8 million. Samsung received immunity from the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

The fines were based on European sales of more than EUR7 billion over the  cartel period, the commission said. The European Union has the power to  fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaking its antitrust rules.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, have the obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe," the EU's Competition chief Joaquin Almunia said. "The fact that the meetings took place outside of the EU is no excuse."

The companies knew their actions were illegal and took steps to conceal their gatherings, which they called "the Crystal meetings," the commissioner said. He added a  cartel document requested all the participants "to take care of confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."
There were around 60 meetings in all, Almunia said.

The cartel had a direct impact on European consumers as  LCD screens are used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops. Most of those products sold in the EU come from Asia, he added.

In setting the fines, the commission took into account the level of sales the company has in the EU and the duration of the cartel. It also reduced the  fines of some of the companies to reward their cooperation with the cartel investigation.

LG Display said in a statement Thursday it may appeal the  fine, but doesn't expect the decision to impact its business.

"LG Display acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past and respects the  European Commission's regulatory authority in this regard. However, LG Display may, after careful review and consideration,

Page 82 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
appeal today's decision to the EU General Court if it finds there were procedural or substantive due process issues with the investigation," it said in a statement.

LG Display's price-fixing  penalty follows a $400 million  fine after a price-fixing  investigation in the U.S. two years ago.

The four Taiwanese makers also said Thursday the  fines won't have a significant impact on their operations. Chunghwa said in a statement it had set aside funds for the  fines as expenses last year. The company added it hasn't decided if it will appeal the ruling. Chunghwa had also pleaded guilty to price fixing  in the same investigation.

Shares of most of the  LCD makers were down on the news. Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang said the charges are substantial, particularly for the Taiwan firms.

At 0232 GMT, Chimei Innolux was down 3.5% at NT$39.05; AU Optronics was 1.6% lower at NT$30.30; Chunghwa Picture Tubes was off 0.5% at NT$4.24; HannStar Display was 0.9% lower at NT$5.59; and LG Display was up 1% at KRW40,650.

"It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chimei will need to take an earnings bath in the fourth quarter," said Wang.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could rise to 19,760, according to charts.

TD
But Sensex has to move past major resistance at 19,850 to impart momentum to the short-term uptrend.

Until the index moves past 19,850, it would be vulnerable to a test of minor support 19,590. A fall below major support at 19,300 would indicate a reversal of the short-term bullish trend.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty may test resistance at 5,930.

A rise above major resistance at 5,945 would lend momentum to the short-term bullish trend. While minor is at 5,885, a drop below major support at 5,850 would lend momentum to the downtrend.




US STOCKS
U.S. shares ended higher Wednesday, as surging financial stocks more than offset a broad decline across the market.

The U.S. dollar continued its recent run higher, pushing down prices of some commodities and hitting the stocks of materials, energy and industrial companies.


Page 84 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Consumer-discretionary stocks also finished lower, weighed by a 2% decline in McDonald's. The fast-food chain led declines among Dow components after reporting same-store sales rose 4.8% in November, but fell short of analysts' estimates.

Pulling on the other side were financial stocks, fueled by gains at smaller regional banks. Lincoln National jumped 7.5%, Fifth Third Bancorp surged 6.5%, and Zions Bancorp added 5.5%. Regions Financial, Keycorp and PNC Financial Services all gained between 2.9% and 5.3%.

Morgan Stanley rose 3.2%, after the consortium of investors buying the investment bank's 34.3% stake in China International Capital all won their necessary approvals. Bank of America surged 3.7% to lead the Dow, while J.P. Morgan Chase added 2.6%.

But American International Group tumbled 3.9%, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. government is looking to sell at least $15 billion of its shares in the insurer in the first of several stock offerings to investors starting in early 2011.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Thursday, with shares in Sydney powering to a four-week high after a strong employment report while the Tokyo market continued to benefit from a lower yen.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi Composite were all
up while New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 52 points higher in
screen trade.

A positive finish for U.S. stocks Wednesday aided regional sentiment, with fianancial stocks rising on the back of gains in their peers on Wall Street.

Mitsubishi UFJ FG rose 2.0% and Sumitomo Mitsui FG advanced 1.9% in Tokyo, while in Sydney ANZ Bank added 1.0% and Westpac Bank climbed 1.7%, and KB Financial Group added 0.3% and Shinhan Financial Group tacked on 0.4% in Seoul.

In Sydney, the market received a boost from a strong employment report with the benchmark S&P/ASX Index tapping a four-week high of 4747.1
Apart from banking stocks, resources were also higher. BHP Billiton rose 0.9% and Fortescue was 1.2%
higher.
In Japan, Kyocera rose 1.5%, Sony added 1.0% and Honda Motor advanced 1.1%.

In Seoul, financial and tech plays underpinned early gains. LG Display added 0.3%, reversing earlier losses that were driven by news the  European Commission had imposed a EUR215 million  fine for price fixing  between 2001-2006.
Samsung Electronics rose 0.5% and Hynix Semiconductor added 0.6%.

The Bank of Korea's decision to hold rates steady at 2.50%, as expected, didn't have any notable impact on the market.


FOREX
The euro was fetching $1.3299, from $1.3261 late Wednesday in New York, and at Y111.37 against the yen, from Y111.44. The dollar was at Y83.80, from Y84.03.


METALS
Gold futures fell Wednesday, with investors cashing in on record prices as they mulled the longer-term inflation and interest rate implications of extended U.S. tax cuts.
Spot gold was at $1,385.20 per troy ounce, up $3.90 from its New York close Wednesday.

Base metals closed mostly higher on the London Metal Exchange Wednesday after improving demand prospects stemmed the impact of a firmer U.S. dollar.


OIL SUMMARY

Page 85 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Crude prices settled lower in U.S. trading Wednesday after the government reported U.S. stockpiles of fuel inventories rose by a larger-than-expected amount last week.
January Nymex crude oil futures, which tapped a fresh 26-month high Tuesday, were up 22 cents at
$88.92 per barrel on Globex.

TD
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission Wednesday fined six Asian makers of liquid crystal display screens a total of EUR649 million for operating a price-fixing  cartel for almost five years.

Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) and LG Display Co. (034220.SE) of South Korea, and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics Corp. (2409.TW), Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481.TW), Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475.TW) and HannStar Display Corp. (6116.TW) met monthly in Taiwanese hotels to agree on prices and share other commercially sensitive information, the commission said.
The cartel ran from 2001 to 2006.

The commission fined LG Display EUR215 million, AU Optronics EUR117 million, Chimei Innolux EUR300 million, Chunghwa EUR9 million and HannStar EUR8 million. Samsung received immunity from the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

The fines were based on European sales of more than EUR7 billion over the  cartel period, the commission said. The European Union has the power to  fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaking its antitrust rules.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, have the obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe," the EU's Competition chief Joaquin Almunia said. "The fact that the meetings took place outside of the EU is no excuse."

The companies knew their actions were illegal and took steps to conceal their gatherings, which they called "the Crystal meetings," the commissioner said. He added a  cartel document requested all the participants "to take care of confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."
There were around 60 meetings in all, Almunia said.

The cartel had a direct impact on European consumers as  LCD screens are used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops. Most of those products sold in the EU come from Asia, he added.

In setting the  fines, the commission took into account the level of sales the company has in the EU and the duration of the cartel. It also reduced the  fines of some of the companies to reward their cooperation with the cartel investigation.

LG Display said in a statement Thursday it may appeal the  fine, but doesn't expect the decision to impact its business.

"LG Display acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past and respects the  European Commission's regulatory authority in this regard. However, LG Display may, after careful review and consideration,

Page 105 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
appeal today's decision to the EU General Court if it finds there were procedural or substantive due process issues with the investigation," it said in a statement.
LG Display's price-fixing  penalty follows a $400 million  fine after a price-fixing  investigation in the
U.S. two years ago.

The four Taiwanese makers also said Thursday the  fines won't have a significant impact on their operations. Chunghwa said in a statement it had set aside funds for the  fines as expenses last year. The company added it hasn't decided if it will appeal the ruling. Chunghwa had also pleaded guilty to price fixing  in the same investigation.

Shares of most of the  LCD makers were down on the news. Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang said the charges are substantial, particularly for the Taiwan firms.

At 0232 GMT, Chimei Innolux was down 3.5% at NT$39.05; AU Optronics was 1.6% lower at NT$30.30; Chunghwa Picture Tubes was off 0.5% at NT$4.24; HannStar Display was 0.9% lower at NT$5.59; and LG Display was up 1% at KRW40,650.

"It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chimei will need to take an earnings bath in the fourth quarter," said Wang.

The European Commission yesterday imposed 649 million euros (US$860 million) in fines on four Taiwanese and one South Korean maker of  LCD flat screens for running a price-fixing  cartel.
Taiwans AU Optronics Corp, Chimei Innolux Corp, Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd and HannStar
Display Corp were hit with  fines along with South Korean firm LG Display Co.

TD
South Koreas Samsung Electronics Co was also accused of being a part of the  cartel, but avoided a fine for being the first to provide information on the alleged scheme.

Europes competition watchdog accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with the  LCD component.

The companies held monthly meetings to agree on price ranges and minimum prices and trade information on future production planning, capacity utilization, pricing and other commercial conditions, the commission said.

Company officials met 60 times, mainly in hotels in Taiwan, for what they dubbed the Crystal meetings, the regulator said.

The investigation found that the companies knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their meetings.

The commission cited a document urging everybody to take care of security [and] confidentiality matters and to limit written communication.

Chimei Innolux received the largest  fine, 300 million euros, followed by 215 million euros for LG Display.
AU Optronics was  fined 116.8 million euros, followed by 9 -million euros for Chunghwa Picture
Tubes and 8.1 million euros for HannStar Display.

Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair, European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour, he said.

Earlier yesterday in Taipei, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) expressed concerns over potential fines the European Commission could slap on several Taiwanese  LCD makers for alleged price fixing  and said the government would provide any assistance necessary.

Industrial Development Bureau Director-General Woody Duh said as long as the accused companies needed assistance when facing disciplinary action, the government would do its best to help them.
Page 109 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Duh said the ministry has contacted the four local companies and offered its help based on the decision laid down by the  European Commission.
The damage is higher than we thought, Chimei Innolux spokesman Eddie Chen told the Taipei
Times by telephone last night.

The company will book the payment in its fourth-quarter financial statement after receiving the formal ruling, Chen said.

Samsung and LG among those found guilty of price-fixing

Six major LCD panel producers have been fined a total of €648m (£542m) by the  European                   Commission (EC) for operating a price-fixing  cartel that affected the cost of televisions, computer screens and other technologies.

TD
An EC investigation found that Samsung, LG, AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corporation, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation agreed price ranges and minimum prices, and exchanged information on future production plans and capacity utilisation, over a period of four years.

The companies convened around 60 monthly gatherings in Taiwan in what they called "the crystal meetings".

The EC said that the manufacturers were fully aware that the discussions broke competition rules, and the investigation uncovered a document that requested the firms to "take care of security/confidentiality matters and to limit written communication".

Samsung avoided a  fine, however, as it received full immunity under the EC's 2002 Leniency Notice for bringing the cartel to the EC's attention and helping to prove the infringement.

LG received a 50 per cent reduction for its co-operation, but was still  fined €215m (€180m), while AU Optronics received a 20 per cent reduction, resulting in a  fine of €116m (£97m).

Chimei was the firm hardest hit by the EC's decision, being forced to pay €300m (£251m), and HannStar was fined €8.1m (£6.69m) and Chunghwa €9m (£7.5m).

Joaquín Almunia, EC vice president in charge of competition policy, hopes that the ruling will send a message to other companies about the tough stance taken against price-fixing.

"Foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that, if they want to do business in Europe, they must play fair. The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour," he said.

"The only understanding we will show is for those that come forward to denounce a  cartel and help prove its existence."

The European Commission yesterday slapped penalties on five South Korean and Taiwanese firms for fixing  the prices of liquid-crystal display panels. The five companies involved included Taiwan's Chimei Innolux, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, HannStar Display, and AU Optronics, as well as South Korea's LG Display. Chimei Innolux has been ordered to pay the largest  fine of US$400 million, while LG Display must pay the second largest sum of US$286 million. Samsung, the largest  LCD-maker in the world, dodged the penalty after reporting the  cartel to the regulatory authorities. Speaking in Brussels today, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Alumnia said that, "foreign companies, like European ones, have an obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe". The price-fixing  activity occurred between October 2001 and February 2006. The companies held monthly meetings to agree on pricing and production planning.

TD
Responding to the announcement in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, AU Optronics has said that it will appeal the ruling in the General Court in Luxembourg.Significance: The price-fixing cartel directly affected consumers in Europe, as the  LCD screens are the main components of flat monitors used in computers, notebooks, and televisions. The  European Commission has imposed fines totalling more than US$4 billion this year in similar cases, with this latest South Korea/Taiwan case being the seventh dealt with by Brussels in 2010.

SEOUL, Dec. 9 (Yonhap) -- LG Display Co., the world's second-largest supplier of liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels, said Thursday that it may lodge an appeal against the  European                     Commission's (EC) decision to  fine the company for price  fixing.

On Wednesday, the European Union's executive body  fined LG Display 215 million euros (US$285 million) for fixing LCD panel prices with five other companies between 2001 and 2006.

TD
"We admit our wrongful acts of the past and we respect the EC's regulatory authority in this regard," the South Korean company said in a statement.

"However, after a careful review, if we come to a conclusion that there are problems in the EC's investigation process or in the result, we may lodge an appeal to the EU General Court," it added.

LG Display added that the legal procedures in the EU General Court usually take more than 2 years, and that there is a possibility that the  fine gets slashed down.  LCD panels are used for flat-screen TVs, computer monitors and mobile phones.
The EU imposed a total 648.9 million euros of  fines on Asian LCD makers, including Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corp. and AU Optronics Corp.

Samsung Electronics Co., the world's largest LCD supplier, which was among the companies in the price-fixing cartel, was exempted from the fine because it informed the EU of the  cartel, according to media reports.

Dec. 9, 2010 (China Knowledge) - The  European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said yesterday that it  fined four Taiwanese companies a total of EUR 433.93 million for  fixing  prices on liquid crystal display panels between 2001 and 2006. Chimei Innolux Corp, which resulted from the merger of Taiwan-based display makers Chi Mei Optoelectronics Co, Innolux Display Co and TPO Displays Co, received the biggest  fine of EUR 300 million, while AU Optronics, the world's third-largest maker of  LCD panels, was fined EUR 116.8 million. Two smaller Taiwanese, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp, received  fines of EUR 9.02 million and EUR 8.1 million, respectively. All of the four Taiwanese firms have confirmed the fines, which are said not to have a significant impact on their operations. The commission also fined two South Korean firms, Samsung Electronics Co and LG Display Co.

TD
LG Display has to pay EUR 215 million of  fine, while Samsung Samsung was given full immunity from fines under the commission's leniency programme, as it was the first to provide information about the cartel.

HD        EU fines flat panel makers for price fixing

European Union regulators yesterday announced  fines for the South Korea-based LG Display,
Taiwan-based Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp and three other Taiwanese firms totaling 649 million euros
(US$858 million, NT$25.9 billion) for  fixing  prices of display panels used in consumer devices.
Samsung Electronics, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged since it alerted the
European Commission to the price-fixing  practices.

TD
Chi Mei, now part of Chi Mei Innolux, Taiwan's largest  LCD maker, was handed the biggest  fine of 300 million euros. The punishment came after the company paid US$220 million in  fines last year in the U.S. over charges of price-fixing.
LG Display, the world's No. 2 LCD maker, Taiwanese firms AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and
HannStar Display Corp were also fined.

The EU antitrust watchdog  European Commission charged the firms with breaching EU laws on restrictive business practices in July last year. Other regulators around the world have also investigated the sector.

In the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation, eight companies, including LG Display, Chi Mei, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Sharp and Hitachi Displays, have pleaded guilty and paid more than US$890 million (NT$2.81 billion) in criminal  fines for price-fixing.  AU Optronics Corp., its U.S. subsidiary and six of its executives were also named in the indictment but decided to contest the charge.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) earlier vowed to provide any assistance necessary to several
Taiwanese flat panel makers  fined by the European Commission over price fixing.

Duh Tyzz-jiun, director-general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau said that the government would do its best to assist the companies concerned if they require help when facing the EU's disciplinary action.

Duh said the MOEA has made contact with the four local companies to extend its offer of assistance that will be based on the decision laid down by the  European Commission.

The companies have told the ministry they will carefully study the EU's decision to gauge the impact on them, he said.

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea treasury bonds, bond futures may fall in early trade, tracking weaker U.S. Treasurys overnight, though any steep falls unlikely ahead of the BOK's rate decision due around 0100
GMT; all 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect the BOK to stand pat at
2.50% after its 25-bp hike last month. "The market may find some comfort, if the central bank actually
keep the rates on hold," amid hopes that the BOK governor will make dovish comments following the rate
decision, says a local bank trader. Adds, "but I think the BOK will likely touch on how it will have to
resume hiking rates next year," which could weigh on bond sentiment. Focus on how 3-year bonds will
perform, following their volatile swings of late amid lingering concerns over supply shortage issues for
that tenor. Tips 3-year yield in 3.00%-3.15% range vs 3.08% yesterday. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)

2357 GMT [Dow Jones] HK short-selling volume was +18.2% at HK$4.442 billion Wednesday, 5.7% of
the market total, vs 5.2% Tuesday, as bears became more active with HSI's 1.4% decline yesterday. A50
(2823.HK) leads with HK$264.09 million, ICBC (1398.HK) with HK$235.29 million, China Mobile
(0941.HK) with HK$206.17 million, China Life (2628.HK) with HK$148.46 million and Hutchison
Whampoa (0013.HK) with HK$141.44 million. (susanna.tai@dowjones.com)

2356 GMT [Dow Jones] Kospi may open lower, weighed by limited liquidity in the market and an absence of fresh momentum as the index is near its 52-week high at 1,976.46. "The market is likely to experience choppy sessions throughout this month," says Dongbu Securities analyst Yu Kyung-ha. Kospi is tipped in the 1930-1975 range for the rest of this week. The focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT after its 25bp hike last month. All 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50%. LG Display (034220.SE) may fall after the European Commission Wednesday fines 6 Asian makers of  LCD panels a total of EUR649 million for price fixing  in the 2001-2006 period;
LG Display hit by EUR215 million  fine, while Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) was granted immunity from the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel. Kospi ends down 0.4% at 1,955.72 yesterday. (jieun.shin@dowjones.com)

2353 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate for now after settling down 41 cents yesterday at $88.28/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the MACD indicator is bullish, but the slow stochastic measure is bearish at the overbought level; a spinning-top candlestick pattern reflecting the indecision of traders was completed yesterday. Immediate resistance at $88.99 (yesterday's high); a breach would expose upside to $90.76 (26-month high hit Tuesday). A rise above the $90.76 resistance would reinstate the near-term bullish outlook, targeting the
psychological $91 level, and then $91.92 (projected top of ascending channel formed with Sept. 21 low of
$72.81 and Oct. 7 high of $84.43). Support at $87.33 (yesterday's low); a breach would extend the
corrective decline to $87.14 (Friday's low); below which would open the way down to $86.27 (Dec. 2 low),
then to $85.90 (previous cap set Nov. 30) and $83.55 (Nov. 30 low). January crude is last up 35 cents at
$88.63/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@dowjones.com)

output data due 0401 GMT today which is likely +2.0% on year vs +5.6% in September, according to a Dow Jones poll. The dealer tips yields to move in 2-3 bps range before the data, after that they will take cues from the latest figures. Yesterday, yields on MGSs closed higher, with May 2013 MGS +7 bps at
3.19% and November 2019 MGS yield +4 bps at 3.91%. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com)

2347 GMT [Dow Jones] NZX-50 last +0.1% at 3297.59 and is likely to continue to drift sideways as market volumes remain light on a lack of corporate news, says Craigs Investment Partners broker Nigel Scott. Adds the RBNZ's decision to hold the official cash rate at 3.0% and its dovish outlook has "slightly moved currencies and interest rates," but hasn't reflected any change in turnover in the equities markets. But says the weaker NZD/USD should help exporters like Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (FPH.NZ); stock is currently +0.3% at NZ$3.14. Adds Mainfreight (MFT.NZ) +1.3% at NZ$7.70 as markets are comfortable that the company can continue to grow in the next 3 months. (lucy.craymer@dowjones.com)
2346 GMT [Dow Jones] U.S. Treasurys may fall in Tokyo, with investors tracking overnight moves in New
York, but trading will likely be slow due to the cautious mood ahead of the FOMC next week, analysts
say. "There seems to be a gap between the views of the (Federal Reserve) and the market on inflation
risks," keeping the Treasurys market 'unstable' until the Fed clarifies its easy policy stance," says
Citigroup strategist Eiji Dohke. 10-year Treasury yield last at 3.28%.
(kazuhiro.shimamura@dowjones.com)

2336 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/JPY tipped higher on the view U.S. Treasury yields will continue rising in the short-term, with the pair targeting 84.40 vs 84.09 last, says Osao Iizuka, senior FX dealer at Sumitomo Trust & Banking; benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 10.1 bps to 3.242% overnight. Says if USD/JPY rises to an 11-week high above 84.41, (recent high marked on Nov. 29), that will add to bullish sentiment on the pair. But says during Tokyo hours, Japanese exporters, other "real money" players are likely to prevent any sharper rises. Says EUR/USD will be biased down, with any fall below the 1.3180 recent low opening the way to around 1.3100; "despite some respite on Ireland, the euro remains weighed by continued concerns over the possible sovereign debt problems of other European countries such as Portugal." EUR/USD last at 1.3258.(andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

2335 GMT [Dow Jones] AUD/USD has come under heavy selling pressure and the recent retracement higher has ended, with the downward trend resuming, says BNP in a strategy statement. Says AUD/USD is being hit by fears of tightening in China as well as a broad rally in the USD as markets reassess the U.S. monetary/fiscal policy mix. Notes China has announced it will bring forward monthly data releases to Saturday from Monday. Says this adds to conspiracy theories put in place earlier this week that the
PBOC may hike rates this weekend to coincide with the weekend Central Economic Work Conference. These events have increased the perception of a tightening in Chinese monetary policy weighing on the AUD. Adds USD seems to be in the process of developing a more significant rally. Says a stronger University of Michigan survey Friday will put the AUD/USD under further pressure. AUD/USD is now at
0.9781. (james.glynn@dowjones.com)

2334 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/KRW may fall vs 1,146.0 late Wednesday in a moderate downward correction following its sharp gains yesterday. Focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT; all
14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50% after its
25-bp hike last month. KRW should brush off an on-hold decision, though it will likely get a boost should
the BOK surprise markets by hiking, traders say. "A surprise rate hike could push the dollar down by at
least 10-won," says a local bank trader; but "I think it's going to be a quiet day, with no big issues to move
the market." Tips pair in a 1,132-1,145 range. Says euro-zone woes as well as North Korea concerns will
likely linger, providing some support for the USD. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)

2319 GMT [Dow Jones] JGBs are likely to open lower as the continued rise in U.S. Treasury yields heightens fears of more near-term JGB-selling before the supply-demand balance improves later this month, analysts say; trading will likely be subdued ahead of the 5-year bond auction (results due 0345
GMT). Japan's easy monetary policy should limit yield rises in short-term bonds, while hopes for a pickup in JGB demand later this month could provide support for super-long JGBs, says RBS Securities strategist Ruixue Xu. But adds, "selling pressure may comparatively become higher on 10-year bonds." Support for lead December futures is tipped in the 139.60-139.90 band vs 140.10 at last close. (kazuhiro.shimamura@dowjones.com)

2315 GMT [Dow Jones] CME's classic Tsy bond futures price settled lower, but rejected test of contract low as market saw improved economic growth from Obama-GOP tax deal. Mar classic Tsy futures dropped to 5 1/2-month low of 120-27, barely above June 21 contract low of 120-26. Settled at 121-26, down 22/32. Mar ultra Tsy bond futures settled down 12/32 at 124-31. Classic Tsy futures permit delivery of bonds with maturities 15 to 25 years. Ultras allow for delivery of bonds with maturities 25 years and up.

0011 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan's government revises upward the nation's July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized 4.5% from a preliminary 3.9%, saying consumption and capex turned out to be stronger than initially thought; the on-quarter growth rate rises to 1.1% from a prior estimate of 0.9%. The results were better than the expectations of economists polled by Dow Jones, Nikkei that centered on GDP being revised to a 4.1% annualized increase and 1.0% on-quarter growth. But the data are not likely to dispel pessimism over Japan's economic outlook, because the 3Q figures are too old and many expect a contraction in 4Q due to slowing exports.

0008 GMT [Dow Jones] Wall Street's modest gains overnight may help underpin Singapore shares and keep the STI above the 3200 level; the index closed +0.3% at 3202.80 yesterday, above 3200 for the first time since Nov. 18. Resistance is likely at 3230 (Nov. 19 high), while this week's current 3164 low is expected to provide support on any downside. "The STI may still be able to head higher for the rest of December, but the climb is likely to be slow and gradual as there's really not much going on, especially at this time of the year, to cause any excitement in the market," says a local house trader. Pacific Andes Resources Development (P11.SG) may be in focus as the frozen fish supplier expands its seafood business by acquiring a 19.76% stake in ASX-listed Tassal Group (TGR.AU) for S$67 million; the stock ended flat at S$0.34 yesterday. (frankie.ho@dowjones.com)

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea treasury bonds, bond futures may fall in early trade, tracking weaker U.S. Treasurys overnight, though any steep falls unlikely ahead of the BOK's rate decision due around 0100
GMT; all 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect the BOK to stand pat at
2.50% after its 25-bp hike last month. "The market may find some comfort, if the central bank actually
keep the rates on hold," amid hopes that the BOK governor will make dovish comments following the rate
decision, says a local bank trader. Adds, "but I think the BOK will likely touch on how it will have to
resume hiking rates next year," which could weigh on bond sentiment. Focus on how 3-year bonds will
perform, following their volatile swings of late amid lingering concerns over supply shortage issues for
that tenor. Tips 3-year yield in 3.00%-3.15% range vs 3.08% yesterday. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)
2357 GMT [Dow Jones] HK short-selling volume was +18.2% at HK$4.442 billion Wednesday, 5.7% of
the market total, vs 5.2% Tuesday, as bears became more active with HSI's 1.4% decline yesterday. A50
(2823.HK) leads with HK$264.09 million, ICBC (1398.HK) with HK$235.29 million, China Mobile
(0941.HK) with HK$206.17 million, China Life (2628.HK) with HK$148.46 million and Hutchison
Whampoa (0013.HK) with HK$141.44 million. (susanna.tai@dowjones.com)

2356 GMT [Dow Jones] Kospi may open lower, weighed by limited liquidity in the market and an absence of fresh momentum as the index is near its 52-week high at 1,976.46. "The market is likely to experience choppy sessions throughout this month," says Dongbu Securities analyst Yu Kyung-ha. Kospi is tipped in the 1930-1975 range for the rest of this week. The focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT after its 25bp hike last month. All 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50%. LG Display (034220.SE) may fall after the European Commission Wednesday fines 6 Asian makers of  LCD panels a total of EUR649 million for price fixing  in the 2001-2006 period;

2353 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate for now after settling down 41 cents yesterday at $88.28/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the MACD indicator is bullish, but the slow stochastic measure is bearish at the overbought level; a spinning-top candlestick pattern reflecting the indecision of traders was completed yesterday. Immediate resistance at $88.99 (yesterday's high); a breach would expose upside to $90.76 (26-month high hit Tuesday). A rise above the $90.76 resistance would reinstate the near-term bullish outlook, targeting the
psychological $91 level, and then $91.92 (projected top of ascending channel formed with Sept. 21 low of
$72.81 and Oct. 7 high of $84.43). Support at $87.33 (yesterday's low); a breach would extend the
corrective decline to $87.14 (Friday's low); below which would open the way down to $86.27 (Dec. 2 low),
then to $85.90 (previous cap set Nov. 30) and $83.55 (Nov. 30 low). January crude is last up 35 cents at
$88.63/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@dowjones.com)

2351 GMT [Dow Jones] Malaysia government bonds likely to fall a tad in subdued trade, taking cues from overnight declines in U.S. Treasurys. Local dealer says investors are watching for October industrial output data due 0401 GMT today which is likely +2.0% on year vs +5.6% in September, according to a Dow Jones poll. The dealer tips yields to move in 2-3 bps range before the data, after that they will take cues from the latest figures. Yesterday, yields on MGSs closed higher, with May 2013 MGS +7 bps at
3.19% and November 2019 MGS yield +4 bps at 3.91%. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com)

2347 GMT [Dow Jones] NZX-50 last +0.1% at 3297.59 and is likely to continue to drift sideways as market volumes remain light on a lack of corporate news, says Craigs Investment Partners broker Nigel Scott. Adds the RBNZ's decision to hold the official cash rate at 3.0% and its dovish outlook has "slightly moved currencies and interest rates," but hasn't reflected any change in turnover in the equities markets. But says the weaker NZD/USD should help exporters like Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (FPH.NZ); stock is currently +0.3% at NZ$3.14. Adds Mainfreight (MFT.NZ) +1.3% at NZ$7.70 as markets are comfortable that the company can continue to grow in the next 3 months. (lucy.craymer@dowjones.com)
2346 GMT [Dow Jones] U.S. Treasurys may fall in Tokyo, with investors tracking overnight moves in New
York, but trading will likely be slow due to the cautious mood ahead of the FOMC next week, analysts
say. "There seems to be a gap between the views of the (Federal Reserve) and the market on inflation
risks," keeping the Treasurys market 'unstable' until the Fed clarifies its easy policy stance, says Citigroup
strategist Eiji Dohke. 10-year Treasury yield last at 3.28%. (kazuhiro.shimamura@dowjones.com)

2336 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/JPY tipped higher on the view U.S. Treasury yields will continue rising in the short-term, with the pair targeting 84.40 vs 84.09 last, says Osao Iizuka, senior FX dealer at Sumitomo Trust & Banking; benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 10.1 bps to 3.242% overnight. Says if USD/JPY rises to an 11-week high above 84.41, (recent high marked on Nov. 29), that will add to bullish sentiment on the pair. But says during Tokyo hours, Japanese exporters, other "real money" players are likely to prevent any sharper rises. Says EUR/USD will be biased down, with any fall below the 1.3180 recent low opening the way to around 1.3100; "despite some respite on Ireland, the euro remains weighed by continued concerns over the possible sovereign debt problems of other European countries such as Portugal." EUR/USD last at 1.3258.(andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

2335 GMT [Dow Jones] AUD/USD has come under heavy selling pressure and the recent retracement higher has ended, with the downward trend resuming, says BNP in a strategy statement. Says AUD/USD is being hit by fears of tightening in China as well as a broad rally in the USD as markets reassess the U.S. monetary/fiscal policy mix. Notes China has announced it will bring forward monthly data releases to Saturday from Monday. Says this adds to conspiracy theories put in place earlier this week that the
PBOC may hike rates this weekend to coincide with the weekend Central Economic Work Conference. These events have increased the perception of a tightening in Chinese monetary policy weighing on the AUD. Adds USD seems to be in the process of developing a more significant rally. Says a stronger University of Michigan survey Friday will put the AUD/USD under further pressure. AUD/USD is now at
0.9781. (james.glynn@dowjones.com)

2334 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/KRW may fall vs 1,146.0 late Wednesday in a moderate downward correction following its sharp gains yesterday. Focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT; all
14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50% after its
25-bp hike last month. KRW should brush off an on-hold decision, though it will likely get a boost should
the BOK surprise markets by hiking, traders say. "A surprise rate hike could push the dollar down by at
least 10-won," says a local bank trader; but "I think it's going to be a quiet day, with no big issues to move
the market." Tips pair in a 1,132-1,145 range. Says euro-zone woes as well as North Korea concerns will
likely linger, providing some support for the USD. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com) [ 12-08-10 1911ET ]

0042 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/KRW is lower at 1,140.0, vs 1,146.0 late yesterday in Seoul, amid Kospi's
0.6% rise; the pair is testing support at the current level. But not many in the market expect steep falls
ahead of BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT, with the central bank widely expected to stand pat,
traders say. "The dollar's surge yesterday to levels above KRW1,140, shows that the market still remains
sensitive to geopolical risks," which is another factor that will keep the pair from falling sharply, says a
local bank trader. Support is pegged at 1,135.0. But another trader cautions over the chance of a rate
hike; "currently, a possible rate hike isn't priced into the won at all. So, a surprise hike could lead to a
really sharp fall in the dollar/won." (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)

0040 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.5% at 10,287.17 after hitting a fresh seven-month intraday high of 10,298.25, as exporters extended gains on a weaker yen (USD/JPY at
84.10 and EUR/JPY at 111.39) and an overnight rise in U.S. stocks. Market reaction has been limited after the Japanese government revised upward its July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized
4.5% versus a preliminary 3.9%. "It is difficult to react positively since we can anticipate a slowdown in the October to December quarter," says Cosmo Securities equity strategist Toshikazu Horiuchi. He puts today's index range at 10,200-10,400, noting there may be some volatility before options and futures settlement tomorrow. 22/33 Topix subindexes higher; Kyocera (6971.TO) up 1.5% at Y8,820, Honda Motor (7267.TO) up 1.1% at Y3,170. Banks outperform following overnight gains in U.S. financial stocks; Mitsubishi UFJ FG (8306.TO) up 2.0% at Y410 and Sumitomo Mitsui FG (8316.TO) up 1.9% at Y2,669. TDK (6762.TO) up 2.3% at Y5,770 on a Nikkei report that the company will aim for a double-digit operating profit margin in FY 2011. (kana.inagaki@dowjones.com)

0022 GMT [Dow Jones] KLCI may rise after the overnight gains on Wall Street, with financial stocks likely in focus after bank stocks in the U.S. surge. A local dealer says "the news from outside, especially from the U.S., has been good this week, so it is likely that the positive sentiment may be sustained over the near term." But adds with uncertainty over Europe still persisting, and North-South Korea tensions showing no signs of subsiding, some investors might still look to book profits at current levels. KLCI ends
0.6% higher at 1510.06 yesterday. The dealer tips next resistance at 1524 (January 2008 high) while support is pegged at 1500. Maybank (1155.KU), CIMB Group 1023.KU) are likely to be among the financial stocks that will be in focus. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com)

0018 GMT [Dow Jones] S&P/ASX 200 is up 0.3% at 4714.4 after hitting 4721.6, as financials recover on the back of U.S. peer gains. Major banks are up 0.4%-1.4%, although Bank of Queensland (BOQ.AU) is down 7.6% on a profit warning and fellow Queensland lender Suncorp (SUN.AU) is down 3.1%. Materials are mixed, with BHP (BHP.AU) up 0.4% amid gains in LME copper and Newcrest (NCM.AU) down 1.8% on gold price weakness. The Reject Shop (TRS.AU) is down 21% on a profit warning, which is also affecting Harvey Norman (HVN.AU), David Jones (DJS.AU) and JB Hi-Fi (JBH.AU). Traders were
relieved by overnight gains in U.S., although major U.S. indexes remain below their November peaks. Focus is turning to China, where the Securities Times reports China's November CPI likely rose less than analysts forecasts but that full-year CPI likely exceeded the 3.0% target. "A rate hike in China is on the

0044 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's economy continued to create jobs at a stellar pace in November, signaling that the underlying strength of economic growth is much stronger than suggested by some recent data, and will likely keep the RBA on watch for inflationary pressures in early 2011. November employment grew 54,600 vs consensus rise of 19,100 over the month and unemployment fell to an
as-expected 5.2% vs 5.4% in October; more people entered the workforce -- a solid indicator of rising confidence in the economy. AUD/USD rises by close to half a U.S. cent; now 0.9835 vs 0.09790 before the data. (james.glynn@dowjones.com)

traders say. "The dollar's surge yesterday to levels above KRW1,140, shows that the market still remains
sensitive to geopolical risks," which is another factor that will keep the pair from falling sharply, says a
local bank trader. Support is pegged at 1,135.0. But another trader cautions over the chance of a rate
hike; "currently, a possible rate hike isn't priced into the won at all. So, a surprise hike could lead to a
really sharp fall in the dollar/won." (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)

0040 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.5% at 10,287.17 after hitting a fresh seven-month intraday high of 10,298.25, as exporters extended gains on a weaker yen (USD/JPY at
84.10 and EUR/JPY at 111.39) and an overnight rise in U.S. stocks. Market reaction has been limited after the Japanese government revised upward its July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized
4.5% versus a preliminary 3.9%. "It is difficult to react positively since we can anticipate a slowdown in the October to December quarter," says Cosmo Securities equity strategist Toshikazu Horiuchi. He puts today's index range at 10,200-10,400, noting there may be some volatility before options and futures settlement tomorrow. 22/33 Topix subindexes higher; Kyocera (6971.TO) up 1.5% at Y8,820, Honda Motor (7267.TO) up 1.1% at Y3,170. Banks outperform following overnight gains in U.S. financial stocks; Mitsubishi UFJ FG (8306.TO) up 2.0% at Y410 and Sumitomo Mitsui FG (8316.TO) up 1.9% at Y2,669. TDK (6762.TO) up 2.3% at Y5,770 on a Nikkei report that the company will aim for a double-digit operating profit margin in FY 2011. (kana.inagaki@dowjones.com)

0022 GMT [Dow Jones] KLCI may rise after the overnight gains on Wall Street, with financial stocks likely in focus after bank stocks in the U.S. surge. A local dealer says "the news from outside, especially from the U.S., has been good this week, so it is likely that the positive sentiment may be sustained over the near term." But adds with uncertainty over Europe still persisting, and North-South Korea tensions showing no signs of subsiding, some investors might still look to book profits at current levels. KLCI ends
0.6% higher at 1510.06 yesterday. The dealer tips next resistance at 1524 (January 2008 high) while support is pegged at 1500. Maybank (1155.KU), CIMB Group 1023.KU) are likely to be among the financial stocks that will be in focus. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com)

0018 GMT [Dow Jones] S&P/ASX 200 is up 0.3% at 4714.4 after hitting 4721.6, as financials recover on the back of U.S. peer gains. Major banks are up 0.4%-1.4%, although Bank of Queensland (BOQ.AU) is

down 7.6% on a profit warning and fellow Queensland lender Suncorp (SUN.AU) is down 3.1%. Materials are mixed, with BHP (BHP.AU) up 0.4% amid gains in LME copper and Newcrest (NCM.AU) down 1.8% on gold price weakness. The Reject Shop (TRS.AU) is down 21% on a profit warning, which is also affecting Harvey Norman (HVN.AU), David Jones (DJS.AU) and JB Hi-Fi (JBH.AU). Traders were
relieved by overnight gains in U.S., although major U.S. indexes remain below their November peaks. Focus is turning to China, where the Securities Times reports China's November CPI likely rose less than analysts forecasts but that full-year CPI likely exceeded the 3.0% target. "A rate hike in China is on the cards," says Macquarie Private Wealth Associate Director Marcus Droga.

0011 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan's government revises upward the nation's July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized 4.5% from a preliminary 3.9%, saying consumption and capex turned out to be stronger than initially thought; the on-quarter growth rate rises to 1.1% from a prior estimate of 0.9%. The results were better than the expectations of economists polled by Dow Jones, Nikkei that centered on GDP being revised to a 4.1% annualized increase and 1.0% on-quarter growth. But the data are not likely to dispel pessimism over Japan's economic outlook, because the 3Q figures are too old and many expect a contraction in 4Q due to slowing exports.

0008 GMT [Dow Jones] Wall Street's modest gains overnight may help underpin Singapore shares and keep the STI above the 3200 level; the index closed +0.3% at 3202.80 yesterday, above 3200 for the first time since Nov. 18. Resistance is likely at 3230 (Nov. 19 high), while this week's current 3164 low is expected to provide support on any downside. "The STI may still be able to head higher for the rest of December, but the climb is likely to be slow and gradual as there's really not much going on, especially at this time of the year, to cause any excitement in the market," says a local house trader. Pacific Andes Resources Development (P11.SG) may be in focus as the frozen fish supplier expands its seafood business by acquiring a 19.76% stake in ASX-listed Tassal Group (TGR.AU) for S$67 million; the stock ended flat at S$0.34 yesterday.

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea treasury bonds, bond futures may fall in early trade, tracking weaker U.S. Treasurys overnight, though any steep falls unlikely ahead of the BOK's rate decision due around 0100
GMT; all 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect the BOK to stand pat at
2.50% after its 25-bp hike last month. "The market may find some comfort, if the central bank actually
keep the rates on hold," amid hopes that the BOK governor will make dovish comments following the rate
decision, says a local bank trader. Adds, "but I think the BOK will likely touch on how it will have to
resume hiking rates next year," which could weigh on bond sentiment. Focus on how 3-year bonds will
perform, following their volatile swings of late amid lingering concerns over supply shortage issues for
that tenor. Tips 3-year yield in 3.00%-3.15% range vs 3.08% yesterday. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)
2357 GMT [Dow Jones] HK short-selling volume was +18.2% at HK$4.442 billion Wednesday, 5.7% of
the market total, vs 5.2% Tuesday, as bears became more active with HSI's 1.4% decline yesterday. A50
(2823.HK) leads with HK$264.09 million, ICBC (1398.HK) with HK$235.29 million, China Mobile
(0941.HK) with HK$206.17 million, China Life (2628.HK) with HK$148.46 million and Hutchison
Whampoa (0013.HK) with HK$141.44 million. (susanna.tai@dowjones.com)

2356 GMT [Dow Jones] Kospi may open lower, weighed by limited liquidity in the market and an absence of fresh momentum as the index is near its 52-week high at 1,976.46. "The market is likely to experience choppy sessions throughout this month," says Dongbu Securities analyst Yu Kyung-ha. Kospi is tipped in the 1930-1975 range for the rest of this week. The focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT after its 25bp hike last month. All 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50%. LG Display (034220.SE) may fall after the European Commission Wednesday fines 6 Asian makers of  LCD panels a total of EUR649 million for price fixing  in the 2001-2006 period;
LG Display hit by EUR215 million  fine, while Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) was granted immunity from the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel. Kospi ends down 0.4% at 1,955.72 yesterday. (jieun.shin@dowjones.com)

2353 GMT [Dow Jones] Nymex crude is likely to consolidate for now after settling down 41 cents yesterday at $88.28/bbl, Dow Jones technical analysis shows. The daily continuation chart is mixed as the MACD indicator is bullish, but the slow stochastic measure is bearish at the overbought level; a spinning-top candlestick pattern reflecting the indecision of traders was completed yesterday. Immediate resistance at $88.99 (yesterday's high); a breach would expose upside to $90.76 (26-month high hit Tuesday). A rise above the $90.76 resistance would reinstate the near-term bullish outlook, targeting the
psychological $91 level, and then $91.92 (projected top of ascending channel formed with Sept. 21 low of
$72.81 and Oct. 7 high of $84.43). Support at $87.33 (yesterday's low); a breach would extend the
corrective decline to $87.14 (Friday's low); below which would open the way down to $86.27 (Dec. 2 low),
then to $85.90 (previous cap set Nov. 30) and $83.55 (Nov. 30 low). January crude is last up 35 cents at
$88.63/bbl on Globex. (jerry.tan@dowjones.com)

2351 GMT [Dow Jones] Malaysia government bonds likely to fall a tad in subdued trade, taking cues from overnight declines in U.S. Treasurys. Local dealer says investors are watching for October industrial output data due 0401 GMT today which is likely +2.0% on year vs +5.6% in September, according to a Dow Jones poll. The dealer tips yields to move in 2-3 bps range before the data, after that they will take cues from the latest figures. Yesterday, yields on MGSs closed higher, with May 2013 MGS +7 bps at
3.19% and November 2019 MGS yield +4 bps at 3.91%. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com) [ 12-08-10 1944ET

0048 GMT [Dow Jones] Lead 10-year JGB futures open slightly lower, hovering around Wednesday's closing level in cautious trade; now up 0.10 at 140.20. The contract briefly slips below 140.00 for the first time since May 20, while cash 10-year bond yield climbs to 1.250% for the first time since June 4 vs
1.240% on Wednesday. With U.S. Treasurys extending their fall and cash JGB yields rising to fresh
6-month highs, investors are become nervous about the possibility of continued moves by major
institutional players to shift money away from the safe-haven investment into riskier assets, analysts say.
"While there is no significant change in fundamentals, moves to adjust positions and reduce the risk
exposure (due to market volatility) will continue" ahead of the holiday season, says Mitsubishi UFJ

0044 GMT [Dow Jones] Australia's economy continued to create jobs at a stellar pace in November, signaling that the underlying strength of economic growth is much stronger than suggested by some recent data, and will likely keep the RBA on watch for inflationary pressures in early 2011. November employment grew 54,600 vs consensus rise of 19,100 over the month and unemployment fell to an
as-expected 5.2% vs 5.4% in October; more people entered the workforce -- a solid indicator of rising confidence in the economy. AUD/USD rises by close to half a U.S. cent; now 0.9835 vs 0.09790 before the data. (james.glynn@dowjones.com)
0042 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/KRW is lower at 1,140.0, vs 1,146.0 late yesterday in Seoul, amid Kospi's

0050 GMT [Dow Jones] SGD is a tad higher in early Asia trade after falling yesterday as investors buy the USD looking at the potential short-term kick the U.S. economy could get from an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and on the back of increasing geopolitical tensions after reports of shelling by North Korea, which was likely a military exercise. USD/SGD at 1.3151, vs 1.3183 in late Asian trade yesterday and the 1.3191 intraday high yesterday. "The greenback is likely to be stable today after rising yesterday because of the Korean situation, and news about (the extension of the Bush-era) tax cuts," a trader at a local bank says.

local bank trader. Support is pegged at 1,135.0. But another trader cautions over the chance of a rate
hike; "currently, a possible rate hike isn't priced into the won at all. So, a surprise hike could lead to a
really sharp fall in the dollar/won." (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)

0040 GMT [Dow Jones] The Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.5% at 10,287.17 after hitting a fresh seven-month intraday high of 10,298.25, as exporters extended gains on a weaker yen (USD/JPY at
84.10 and EUR/JPY at 111.39) and an overnight rise in U.S. stocks. Market reaction has been limited after the Japanese government revised upward its July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized
4.5% versus a preliminary 3.9%. "It is difficult to react positively since we can anticipate a slowdown in

the October to December quarter," says Cosmo Securities equity strategist Toshikazu Horiuchi. He puts today's index range at 10,200-10,400, noting there may be some volatility before options and futures settlement tomorrow. 22/33 Topix subindexes higher; Kyocera (6971.TO) up 1.5% at Y8,820, Honda Motor (7267.TO) up 1.1% at Y3,170. Banks outperform following overnight gains in U.S. financial stocks; Mitsubishi UFJ FG (8306.TO) up 2.0% at Y410 and Sumitomo Mitsui FG (8316.TO) up 1.9% at Y2,669. TDK (6762.TO) up 2.3% at Y5,770 on a Nikkei report that the company will aim for a double-digit operating profit margin in FY 2011. (kana.inagaki@dowjones.com)

0022 GMT [Dow Jones] KLCI may rise after the overnight gains on Wall Street, with financial stocks likely in focus after bank stocks in the U.S. surge. A local dealer says "the news from outside, especially from the U.S., has been good this week, so it is likely that the positive sentiment may be sustained over the near term." But adds with uncertainty over Europe still persisting, and North-South Korea tensions showing no signs of subsiding, some investors might still look to book profits at current levels. KLCI ends
0.6% higher at 1510.06 yesterday. The dealer tips next resistance at 1524 (January 2008 high) while support is pegged at 1500. Maybank (1155.KU), CIMB Group 1023.KU) are likely to be among the financial stocks that will be in focus. (ankur.relia@dowjones.com)

0018 GMT [Dow Jones] S&P/ASX 200 is up 0.3% at 4714.4 after hitting 4721.6, as financials recover on the back of U.S. peer gains. Major banks are up 0.4%-1.4%, although Bank of Queensland (BOQ.AU) is down 7.6% on a profit warning and fellow Queensland lender Suncorp (SUN.AU) is down 3.1%. Materials are mixed, with BHP (BHP.AU) up 0.4% amid gains in LME copper and Newcrest (NCM.AU) down 1.8% on gold price weakness. The Reject Shop (TRS.AU) is down 21% on a profit warning, which is also affecting Harvey Norman (HVN.AU), David Jones (DJS.AU) and JB Hi-Fi (JBH.AU). Traders were
relieved by overnight gains in U.S., although major U.S. indexes remain below their November peaks. Focus is turning to China, where the Securities Times reports China's November CPI likely rose less than analysts forecasts but that full-year CPI likely exceeded the 3.0% target. "A rate hike in China is on the cards," says Macquarie Private Wealth Associate Director Marcus Droga.

0011 GMT [Dow Jones] Japan's government revises upward the nation's July-September GDP growth rate to an annualized 4.5% from a preliminary 3.9%, saying consumption and capex turned out to be stronger than initially thought; the on-quarter growth rate rises to 1.1% from a prior estimate of 0.9%. The results were better than the expectations of economists polled by Dow Jones, Nikkei that centered on GDP being revised to a 4.1% annualized increase and 1.0% on-quarter growth. But the data are not likely to dispel pessimism over Japan's economic outlook, because the 3Q figures are too old and many expect a contraction in 4Q due to slowing exports.

0008 GMT [Dow Jones] Wall Street's modest gains overnight may help underpin Singapore shares and keep the STI above the 3200 level; the index closed +0.3% at 3202.80 yesterday, above 3200 for the first time since Nov. 18. Resistance is likely at 3230 (Nov. 19 high), while this week's current 3164 low is expected to provide support on any downside. "The STI may still be able to head higher for the rest of December, but the climb is likely to be slow and gradual as there's really not much going on, especially at this time of the year, to cause any excitement in the market," says a local house trader. Pacific Andes Resources Development (P11.SG) may be in focus as the frozen fish supplier expands its seafood business by acquiring a 19.76% stake in ASX-listed Tassal Group (TGR.AU) for S$67 million; the stock ended flat at S$0.34 yesterday. (frankie.ho@dowjones.com)

0000 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea treasury bonds, bond futures may fall in early trade, tracking weaker U.S. Treasurys overnight, though any steep falls unlikely ahead of the BOK's rate decision due around 0100
GMT; all 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect the BOK to stand pat at
2.50% after its 25-bp hike last month. "The market may find some comfort, if the central bank actually
keep the rates on hold," amid hopes that the BOK governor will make dovish comments following the rate
decision, says a local bank trader. Adds, "but I think the BOK will likely touch on how it will have to
resume hiking rates next year," which could weigh on bond sentiment. Focus on how 3-year bonds will
perform, following their volatile swings of late amid lingering concerns over supply shortage issues for
that tenor. Tips 3-year yield in 3.00%-3.15% range vs 3.08% yesterday. (min-jeong.lee@dowjones.com)
2357 GMT [Dow Jones] HK short-selling volume was +18.2% at HK$4.442 billion Wednesday, 5.7% of
the market total, vs 5.2% Tuesday, as bears became more active with HSI's 1.4% decline yesterday. A50
(2823.HK) leads with HK$264.09 million, ICBC (1398.HK) with HK$235.29 million, China Mobile
(0941.HK) with HK$206.17 million, China Life (2628.HK) with HK$148.46 million and Hutchison
Whampoa (0013.HK) with HK$141.44 million. (susanna.tai@dowjones.com)

2356 GMT [Dow Jones] Kospi may open lower, weighed by limited liquidity in the market and an absence of fresh momentum as the index is near its 52-week high at 1,976.46. "The market is likely to experience choppy sessions throughout this month," says Dongbu Securities analyst Yu Kyung-ha. Kospi is tipped in the 1930-1975 range for the rest of this week. The focus is on BOK's rate decision due around 0100 GMT

after its 25bp hike last month. All 14 economists, fixed-income analysts polled by Dow Jones expect BOK to stand pat at 2.50%. LG Display (034220.SE) may fall after the European Commission Wednesday fines 6 Asian makers of  LCD panels a total of EUR649 million for price fixing  in the 2001-2006 period; LG Display hit by EUR215 million  fine, while Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) was granted immunity from the fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel. Kospi ends down 0.4% at 1,955.72 yesterday. (jieun.shin@dowjones.com) [ 12-08-10 1950ET ]

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] The upward revision to Japan's 3Q real GDP doesn't change expectations for contraction in 4Q due in part to a fall-off in demand after the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars, but the recently brisk demand for flat-panel TVs and other electronics may limit the pain, says Hirokata Kusaba, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. The government will cut incentives by half in December for environmentally friendly electric appliances, which should lead to another burst of rush-buying. "This last-minute demand, in particular the strong demand for flat-panel TVs, should help make up for some of the drop in consumption in the October-December quarter expected due to the earlier end of the 'eco-car' subsidies."

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South
Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty. All companies say the fine will not have a significant impact on their operations. (aries.poon@dowjones.com)

0202 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD gets a bump from stronger-than-expected Australia jobs data, as the positive surprise helps risk-sensitive assets such as the common currency, says Yuichiro Harada, senior FX dealer at Mizuho Corporate Bank. "The strong Australian jobs data was a trigger to buy the euro." Adds that many investors may not find U.S. Treasury yield rises to be a compelling reason to sell the pair as "the trend of higher yields is rather now a global phenomenon, not just a local U.S. issue, and that diminishes the dollar-positive impact." Says EUR/USD may target 1.3400 later in the global day, with
further help coming from "a sense that Ireland is no longer as much in the spotlight and that the European sovereign debt concerns are receding a little for now." Pair last at 1.3305, up from its earlier low at
1.3244.(andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

0201 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are lower as investors are concerned the PBOC could hike the reserve requirement ratio or the benchmark interest rate (in the coming days) to curb inflation after suspending the 3-year bill sale. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.3% at 2841.35 and it's tipped to hover around current level for the rest of the session. "The Shanghai index could rebound next week if the central bank doesn't launch any (additional tightening) measures after the November data," says Li Lei at Gold State Securities. Among most active stocks, China Vanke (000002.SZ) down 1.3% at CNY8.38, Poly Real Estate Group (600048,SH) down 1.7% at CNY12.49, China Everbright Bank (601818.SH) down 1.6% at CNY3.73. Shenzhen index is down 0.7% at 1296.49. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0200 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares are +0.9% at 8779.54, after consolidating for the past 2 days, on strength in semiconductors and financials; resistance is tipped at 8800. "The recent upside is faster than we expected ... retail margins have been the highest since the debt crisis, so December's been a strong month. But typically when you have a good December you see a pull back in January," says Yuanta head of research John Brebeck. Adds may be premature for the market to sustain the 8800-8900 level. Fubon (2881.TW) is off 2.7% at NT$37.20 after ING announces the sale of NT$15.90 billion of Fubon shares, Cathay Financial (2882.TW) is +0.7% at NT$47.55, TSMC (2330.TW) is +2.8% at NT$69.90, UMC (2303.TW) is +2.5% at NT$16.50 and Acer (2353.TW) is +0.6% at NT$98.70.

0157 GMT [Dow Jones] Thai shares may rise after yesterday's sharp fall with firmer regional bourses expected to lift sentiment. But the upside may be limited as eyes are on the Constitution Court, which is expected to decide whether it will accept the case in which the Democrat Party has been accused of accepting an undisclosed donation amount. "If the index can stay above 1020, there could be a chance
for a further rebound," says KT Zmico Securities' First VP Charoen Iamphattanatham. Adds, expects PTT Chemical (PTTCH.TH), Siam Cement (SCC.TH) to rebound; Siam Cement Wednesday announced it would sell a 15.6% stake in PTT Chemical at THB140/share. Charoen says fundamentals for both stocks are unchanged with the outlook of both companies remaining strong. Resistance at 1030 and then 1038. The SET Index closed down 1.5% at 1025.08 yesterday.

0157 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/HKD extends Wednesday's gains after the USD rose overnight vs major currencies on expectations President Obama's tax accord should lift growth in the U.S., says a China
bank trader. "I see strong dollar demand ahead of year-end. Some foreign funds tend to repatriate money for window dressing purposes." Also, newly listed China-based companies in Hong Kong were spotted repatriating funds. Tips the pair to test 7.7700 resistance in the near term. Pair last at 7.7697 vs 7.7681 late Wednesday. (fiona.law@dowjones.com)
0153 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/IDR is steady at 9,020 in a quiet session as the pair tracks the broad USD
strength vs major currencies and most regional units. Still, the pair is unlikely to rise sharply as
Indonesia's sound economic fundamentals and high yields offered by rupiah assets will continue to attract
capital inflows, say dealers. "I think the dollar will be rangebound today as the market looks indecisive," a
dealer says; 9,005-9,025 range is tipped. (i-made.sentana@dowjones.com)

0151 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore shares are slightly higher, with the STI +0.2% at 3208.02, tracking modest gains in other Asian markets after U.S. stocks end higher. Gainers outnumber decliners 2 to 1, although buying conviction is as low as volumes are light. The STI is likely to face resistance at 3230 (November 19 high). "The probabilities still favor weaker prices ahead," says CIMB; adds "a good indication that prices are headed lower is when prices close below (their) 50-day simple moving average", which for the STI is now at 3185. The benchmark ends above 3200 yesterday for the first time since November 18. The most active stocks in the market are led by small caps, including UMS Holdings (558.SG) +3.2% at S$0.49, Spice i2i (M09.SG) +4.0% at S$0.13, DMX Technologies (5CH.SG) +3.8% at S$0.41 and Transcu Group (E15.SG), off 26.1% at S$0.085.

0149 GMT [Dow Jones] December HSI futures are up 0.6% at 23,218, suggesting the cash market may rebound. The contract ended Wednesday at a 17-point discount-to-cash, but investors perhaps should not be looking too hard into the futures' bias given the fickle but rangebound trading pattern recently; looking at the closing levels, the HSI has actually been trapped in a very narrow 23,000-23,500 range for
8 consecutive sessions now. December open interest increases 574 lots to 94,073. (robert.li@dowjones.com)

0146 GMT [Dow Jones] Southeast Australian wheat crops were hit by another deluge overnight, causing widespread flooding, likely further damaging milling wheat and resulting in quality downgrades and so increasing feed grade supplies. Bureau of Meteorology shows northeast Victoria and southwest slopes and Riverina districts of New South Wales were worst hit by overnight falls, with West Wyalong receiving
62 mm in 24 hours to 9 a.m., while Wagga Wagga, Yarrawonga and Lake Cargelligo all received 58 mm, and Coolamon 55 mm. ASX milling wheat futures deliverable in New South Wales have soared since late November, with this latest rainfall on ripe crops likely to further support these contracts. January is quoted A$349/A$355 a metric ton, compared with yesterday's close at A$351, while March is quoted at A$322/A$359, compared with yesterday's close at A$335. (ray.brindal@dowjones.com)

0145 GMT [Dow Jones] The auction later today of the new 5-year JGBs is likely to attract enough demand, thanks to a high yield, analysts say. Add the rise yesterday in the 5-year cash JGB yield above
0.500% also suggests that room for a further increase is limited amid the BOJ's super-easy policy, providing a potential opportunity to benefit from a price rebound near term. A high yield "should offset other negative factors," says Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley strategist Katsutoshi Inadome. Coupon on the new issue is set at 0.5% vs 0.3% in the last auction; the 5-year yield is now at 0.525%. But some analysts are still calling for caution, considering the fact that the amount of the issue is large at Y2.4

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] Statistics NZ data shows total retail spending on electronic cards in November was +1.4% on-month, +6.1% on-year, but a subdued consumer backdrop is still likely for majority of
2011, says Goldman Sachs Economist Philip Borkin; "The value of electronic card transaction was reasonable in November, however, we suspect price rises for fuel and other necessities is partly to blame." Borkin says while the risk is that households slow their pace of deleveraging given the progress made to date and hence more consumption growth results, he reckons this is unlikely due to the forecast fall in house prices; "If house prices were to stabilise and begin to rise, we would become more optimistic on the prospects for household consumption and hence the economy itself."

0157 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/HKD extends Wednesday's gains after the USD rose overnight vs major currencies on expectations President Obama's tax accord should lift growth in the U.S., says a China
bank trader. "I see strong dollar demand ahead of year-end. Some foreign funds tend to repatriate money for window dressing purposes." Also, newly listed China-based companies in Hong Kong were spotted repatriating funds. Tips the pair to test 7.7700 resistance in the near term. Pair last at 7.7697 vs 7.7681 late Wednesday. (fiona.law@dowjones.com)
0153 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/IDR is steady at 9,020 in a quiet session as the pair tracks the broad USD
strength vs major currencies and most regional units. Still, the pair is unlikely to rise sharply as
Indonesia's sound economic fundamentals and high yields offered by rupiah assets will continue to attract
capital inflows, say dealers. "I think the dollar will be rangebound today as the market looks indecisive," a
dealer says; 9,005-9,025 range is tipped. (i-made.sentana@dowjones.com)

0151 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore shares are slightly higher, with the STI +0.2% at 3208.02, tracking modest gains in other Asian markets after U.S. stocks end higher. Gainers outnumber decliners 2 to 1, although buying conviction is as low as volumes are light. The STI is likely to face resistance at 3230 (November 19 high). "The probabilities still favor weaker prices ahead," says CIMB; adds "a good indication that prices are headed lower is when prices close below (their) 50-day simple moving average", which for the STI is now at 3185. The benchmark ends above 3200 yesterday for the first time since November 18. The most active stocks in the market are led by small caps, including UMS Holdings (558.SG) +3.2% at S$0.49, Spice i2i (M09.SG) +4.0% at S$0.13, DMX Technologies (5CH.SG) +3.8% at S$0.41 and Transcu Group (E15.SG), off 26.1% at S$0.085.

0149 GMT [Dow Jones] December HSI futures are up 0.6% at 23,218, suggesting the cash market may rebound. The contract ended Wednesday at a 17-point discount-to-cash, but investors perhaps should not be looking too hard into the futures' bias given the fickle but rangebound trading pattern recently; looking at the closing levels, the HSI has actually been trapped in a very narrow 23,000-23,500 range for
8 consecutive sessions now. December open interest increases 574 lots to 94,073. (robert.li@dowjones.com)

0146 GMT [Dow Jones] Southeast Australian wheat crops were hit by another deluge overnight, causing widespread flooding, likely further damaging milling wheat and resulting in quality downgrades and so increasing feed grade supplies. Bureau of Meteorology shows northeast Victoria and southwest slopes and Riverina districts of New South Wales were worst hit by overnight falls, with West Wyalong receiving
62 mm in 24 hours to 9 a.m., while Wagga Wagga, Yarrawonga and Lake Cargelligo all received 58 mm, and Coolamon 55 mm. ASX milling wheat futures deliverable in New South Wales have soared since late November, with this latest rainfall on ripe crops likely to further support these contracts. January is quoted

0215 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's 4Q GDP is likely to rebound 10.5% on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted, annualized vs 18.7% contraction in 3Q; 2010 GDP likely +15.2% on-year, above government expectations, Credit Suisse says in a report. Adds, "government revenues are likely to come in much higher than expected, thanks in part to the surge in betting revenues from the two new casinos, stamp duties from property transactions, and higher goods and services tax revenues from the rebound in retail sales." House expects a fiscal surplus at 0.8% of GDP in FY 2010 vs a 1.0% deficit budgeted. With stronger economic growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is likely to remain on a "tightening bias," report says. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@dowjones.com)

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] Statistics NZ data shows total retail spending on electronic cards in November was +1.4% on-month, +6.1% on-year, but a subdued consumer backdrop is still likely for majority of
2011, says Goldman Sachs Economist Philip Borkin; "The value of electronic card transaction was reasonable in November, however, we suspect price rises for fuel and other necessities is partly to blame." Borkin says while the risk is that households slow their pace of deleveraging given the progress made to date and hence more consumption growth results, he reckons this is unlikely due to the forecast fall in house prices; "If house prices were to stabilise and begin to rise, we would become more optimistic on the prospects for household consumption and hence the economy itself." (lucy.craymer@dowjones.com)

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] The upward revision to Japan's 3Q real GDP doesn't change expectations for contraction in 4Q due in part to a fall-off in demand after the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars, but the recently brisk demand for flat-panel TVs and other electronics may limit the pain, says Hirokata Kusaba, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. The government will cut incentives by half in December for environmentally friendly electric appliances, which should lead to another burst of rush-buying. "This last-minute demand, in particular the strong demand for flat-panel TVs, should help make up for some of the drop in consumption in the October-December quarter expected due to the earlier end of the 'eco-car' subsidies." (andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South
Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty. All companies say the fine will not have a significant impact on their operations. (aries.poon@dowjones.com)

0202 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD gets a bump from stronger-than-expected Australia jobs data, as the positive surprise helps risk-sensitive assets such as the common currency, says Yuichiro Harada, senior FX dealer at Mizuho Corporate Bank. "The strong Australian jobs data was a trigger to buy the euro." Adds that many investors may not find U.S. Treasury yield rises to be a compelling reason to sell the pair as "the trend of higher yields is rather now a global phenomenon, not just a local U.S. issue, and that diminishes the dollar-positive impact." Says EUR/USD may target 1.3400 later in the global day, with
further help coming from "a sense that Ireland is no longer as much in the spotlight and that the European sovereign debt concerns are receding a little for now." Pair last at 1.3305, up from its earlier low at

0201 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are lower as investors are concerned the PBOC could hike the reserve requirement ratio or the benchmark interest rate (in the coming days) to curb inflation after suspending the 3-year bill sale. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.3% at 2841.35 and it's tipped to hover around current level for the rest of the session. "The Shanghai index could rebound next week if the central bank doesn't launch any (additional tightening) measures after the November data," says Li Lei at Gold State Securities. Among most active stocks, China Vanke (000002.SZ) down 1.3% at CNY8.38, Poly Real Estate Group (600048,SH) down 1.7% at CNY12.49, China Everbright Bank (601818.SH) down 1.6% at CNY3.73. Shenzhen index is down 0.7% at 1296.49. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0200 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares are +0.9% at 8779.54, after consolidating for the past 2 days, on strength in semiconductors and financials; resistance is tipped at 8800. "The recent upside is faster than we expected ... retail margins have been the highest since the debt crisis, so December's been a strong month. But typically when you have a good December you see a pull back in January," says Yuanta head of research John Brebeck. Adds may be premature for the market to sustain the 8800-8900 level. Fubon (2881.TW) is off 2.7% at NT$37.20 after ING announces the sale of NT$15.90 billion of Fubon shares, Cathay Financial (2882.TW) is +0.7% at NT$47.55, TSMC (2330.TW) is +2.8% at NT$69.90, UMC (2303.TW) is +2.5% at NT$16.50 and Acer (2353.TW) is +0.6% at NT$98.70.

0157 GMT [Dow Jones] Thai shares may rise after yesterday's sharp fall with firmer regional bourses expected to lift sentiment. But the upside may be limited as eyes are on the Constitution Court, which is expected to decide whether it will accept the case in which the Democrat Party has been accused of accepting an undisclosed donation amount. "If the index can stay above 1020, there could be a chance
for a further rebound," says KT Zmico Securities' First VP Charoen Iamphattanatham. Adds, expects PTT Chemical (PTTCH.TH), Siam Cement (SCC.TH) to rebound; Siam Cement Wednesday announced it would sell a 15.6% stake in PTT Chemical at THB140/share. Charoen says fundamentals for both stocks are unchanged with the outlook of both companies remaining strong. Resistance at 1030 and then 1038. The SET Index closed down 1.5% at 1025.08 yesterday.

0221 GMT [Dow Jones] China government bonds are flat after the PBOC leaves the yield on the 3-month bills unchanged at 1.8131% in its regular open market operation; the move cools expectations of an imminent interest rate hike. A Shenzhen-based trader with a local fund says the unchanged rate on the
bill sale comes after the PBOC scraps a regular auction of 3-year bonds in today's OMO, and suggests "the central bank wants to ensure money market liquidity won't be too tight after two consecutive reserve requirement ratio increases last month." Shanghai Stock Exchange government bond index is at 126.19, unchanged from its last close, and is tipped to consolidate in a narrow 126.15-126.25 range for the rest of the session.

0217 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia shares are likely to open higher, helped by steady IDR and gains in many Asian markets, traders say. Expect index to top psychological 3800 level after shares ended +1.2% at record high of 3769.993 yesterday; "it looks like the main index is on the right track to test the 3800 level amid hopes for healthy inflows," says trader at First Asia Capital. Foreigners were net buyers of IDR193 billion worth of shares yesterday.

0225 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan government bonds are mixed with long-term notes falling on weaker U.S. Treasurys, says local brokerage trader. 30-year government bond starts when-issued trade today; yield last at 2.0550% vs 2.0200% at open. 10-year yield is steady at 1.4535% in when-issued trade as traders stay on the sidelines ahead of reopened 10-year bond auction (to start midday). Expects the 10-year
bond yield in 1.4400%-1.4800% band at the auction. Still, another local bank trader tips the 10-year bond yield in 1.4200%-1.4500% band; "Chunghwa Post and insurers are likely to buy 10-year bonds below
1.4500%," he says. Adds, Chunghwa Post, the island's largest bond player, bought the 10-year bond aggressively around 1.4500% yesterday. 5-year yield is tad lower at 1.0000% vs 1.0050% yesterday. (mason.wu@dowjones.com)

0224 GMT [Dow Jones] Vietnam shares are down 0.4% at 451.18 as investors sell after some banks
today raise their interest rates to above 15% from 14%, amid a lack of fresh news on how the government
will act to stabilize prices of goods and commodities in the local market. "Investor sentiment is weak
because concerns over high inflation remain and banks also continue to increase rates which will hurt
companies' profitability this month," says ACB Securities analyst. Among decliners, Ocean Group
(OGC.VH) down 1.7% at VND23,300, Vietcombank (VCB.VH) down 1.6% at VND31,300 and Itaco
(ITA.VH) down 2.8% at VND14,100. Tips immediate support at 450. (phammuoi.nguyen@dowjones.com)

0221 GMT [Dow Jones] China government bonds are flat after the PBOC leaves the yield on the 3-month bills unchanged at 1.8131% in its regular open market operation; the move cools expectations of an imminent interest rate hike. A Shenzhen-based trader with a local fund says the unchanged rate on the
bill sale comes after the PBOC scraps a regular auction of 3-year bonds in today's OMO, and suggests "the central bank wants to ensure money market liquidity won't be too tight after two consecutive reserve requirement ratio increases last month." Shanghai Stock Exchange government bond index is at 126.19, unchanged from its last close, and is tipped to consolidate in a narrow 126.15-126.25 range for the rest of the session.

0217 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia shares are likely to open higher, helped by steady IDR and gains in many Asian markets, traders say. Expect index to top psychological 3800 level after shares ended +1.2% at record high of 3769.993 yesterday; "it looks like the main index is on the right track to test the 3800 level amid hopes for healthy inflows," says trader at First Asia Capital. Foreigners were net buyers of IDR193 billion worth of shares yesterday. Nickel producer Inco (INCO.JK) may rise on higher commodity prices and coal producer Bumi (BUMI.JK) may gain as its unit Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS.JK)
starts its maiden trade today; the new IPO is likely to rise over 10% on debut.(edhi.pranasidhi@dowjones.com)

0215 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's 4Q GDP is likely to rebound 10.5% on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted, annualized vs 18.7% contraction in 3Q; 2010 GDP likely +15.2% on-year, above government expectations, Credit Suisse says in a report. Adds, "government revenues are likely to come in much higher than expected, thanks in part to the surge in betting revenues from the two new casinos, stamp duties from property transactions, and higher goods and services tax revenues from the rebound in retail

sales." House expects a fiscal surplus at 0.8% of GDP in FY 2010 vs a 1.0% deficit budgeted. With stronger economic growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is likely to remain on a "tightening bias," report says. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@dowjones.com)

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] Statistics NZ data shows total retail spending on electronic cards in November was +1.4% on-month, +6.1% on-year, but a subdued consumer backdrop is still likely for majority of
2011, says Goldman Sachs Economist Philip Borkin; "The value of electronic card transaction was reasonable in November, however, we suspect price rises for fuel and other necessities is partly to blame." Borkin says while the risk is that households slow their pace of deleveraging given the progress made to date and hence more consumption growth results, he reckons this is unlikely due to the forecast fall in house prices; "If house prices were to stabilise and begin to rise, we would become more optimistic on the prospects for household consumption and hence the economy itself." (lucy.craymer@dowjones.com)

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] The upward revision to Japan's 3Q real GDP doesn't change expectations for contraction in 4Q due in part to a fall-off in demand after the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars, but the recently brisk demand for flat-panel TVs and other electronics may limit the pain, says Hirokata Kusaba, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. The government will cut incentives by half in December for environmentally friendly electric appliances, which should lead to another burst of rush-buying. "This last-minute demand, in particular the strong demand for flat-panel TVs, should help make up for some of the drop in consumption in the October-December quarter expected due to the earlier end of the 'eco-car' subsidies." (andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South
Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty. All companies say the fine will not have a significant impact on their operations. (aries.poon@dowjones.com)

0202 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD gets a bump from stronger-than-expected Australia jobs data, as the positive surprise helps risk-sensitive assets such as the common currency, says Yuichiro Harada, senior FX dealer at Mizuho Corporate Bank. "The strong Australian jobs data was a trigger to buy the euro." Adds that many investors may not find U.S. Treasury yield rises to be a compelling reason to sell the pair as "the trend of higher yields is rather now a global phenomenon, not just a local U.S. issue, and that diminishes the dollar-positive impact." Says EUR/USD may target 1.3400 later in the global day, with
further help coming from "a sense that Ireland is no longer as much in the spotlight and that the European sovereign debt concerns are receding a little for now." Pair last at 1.3305, up from its earlier low at

0201 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are lower as investors are concerned the PBOC could hike the reserve requirement ratio or the benchmark interest rate (in the coming days) to curb inflation after suspending the 3-year bill sale. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.3% at 2841.35 and it's tipped to hover around current level for the rest of the session. "The Shanghai index could rebound next week if the central bank doesn't launch any (additional tightening) measures after the November data," says Li Lei at Gold State Securities. Among most active stocks, China Vanke (000002.SZ) down 1.3% at CNY8.38, Poly Real Estate Group (600048,SH) down 1.7% at CNY12.49, China Everbright Bank (601818.SH) down 1.6% at CNY3.73. Shenzhen index is down 0.7% at 1296.49. (wynne.wang@dowjones.com)

0200 GMT [Dow Jones] Taiwan shares are +0.9% at 8779.54, after consolidating for the past 2 days, on strength in semiconductors and financials; resistance is tipped at 8800. "The recent upside is faster than we expected ... retail margins have been the highest since the debt crisis, so December's been a strong month. But typically when you have a good December you see a pull back in January," says Yuanta head of research John Brebeck. Adds may be premature for the market to sustain the 8800-8900 level. Fubon (2881.TW) is off 2.7% at NT$37.20 after ING announces the sale of NT$15.90 billion of Fubon shares, Cathay Financial (2882.TW) is +0.7% at NT$47.55, TSMC (2330.TW) is +2.8% at NT$69.90, UMC (2303.TW) is +2.5% at NT$16.50 and Acer (2353.TW) is +0.6% at NT$98.70. (paul.mozur@dowjones.com)

0157 GMT [Dow Jones] Thai shares may rise after yesterday's sharp fall with firmer regional bourses expected to lift sentiment. But the upside may be limited as eyes are on the Constitution Court, which is

expected to decide whether it will accept the case in which the Democrat Party has been accused of accepting an undisclosed donation amount. "If the index can stay above 1020, there could be a chance
for a further rebound," says KT Zmico Securities' First VP Charoen Iamphattanatham. Adds, expects PTT Chemical (PTTCH.TH), Siam Cement (SCC.TH) to rebound; Siam Cement Wednesday announced it would sell a 15.6% stake in PTT Chemical at THB140/share. Charoen says fundamentals for both stocks are unchanged with the outlook of both companies remaining strong. Resistance at 1030 and then 1038. The SET Index closed down 1.5% at 1025.08 yesterday.

0233 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/CNY falls amid an increase in selling interest in the USD; the pair is at
6.6578 vs 6.6617 late yesterday, and is set to keep consolidating in the 6.6500-6.6600 band, says
Shanghai-based trader at foreign bank. Expects selling demand stems from a higher-than-expected
central parity; "the reference rate is not bad, so customers are in a rush to sell the U.S. unit in case the
dollar drops again in coming days." PBOC sets the USD/CNY central parity at 6.6654 vs 6.6616

0240 GMT [Dow Jones] Crude oil climbs in early Asia trading as USD weakens while optimistic views over fundamentals persist. The ICE Dollar Index is down 0.258 at 79.750 with robust Australia jobs data triggering EUR-buying as investors turn to riskier assets; also, product inventories' gains in the latest EIA report are being interpreted as seasonal, "a sort of obligatory round of moves by refineries as the year ends," advisory firm Cameron Hanover says in a research note. Market players are still expecting Friday's monthly IEA and OPEC reports to show sizable upward demand revisions, says Ritterbusch and Associates. January Nymex crude was last up 79 cents at 89.07/bbl.(max.lin@dowjones.com)

because concerns over high inflation remain and banks also continue to increase rates which will hurt
companies' profitability this month," says ACB Securities analyst. Among decliners, Ocean Group
(OGC.VH) down 1.7% at VND23,300, Vietcombank (VCB.VH) down 1.6% at VND31,300 and Itaco
(ITA.VH) down 2.8% at VND14,100. Tips immediate support at 450. (phammuoi.nguyen@dowjones.com)

0221 GMT [Dow Jones] China government bonds are flat after the PBOC leaves the yield on the 3-month bills unchanged at 1.8131% in its regular open market operation; the move cools expectations of an imminent interest rate hike. A Shenzhen-based trader with a local fund says the unchanged rate on the
bill sale comes after the PBOC scraps a regular auction of 3-year bonds in today's OMO, and suggests "the central bank wants to ensure money market liquidity won't be too tight after two consecutive reserve requirement ratio increases last month." Shanghai Stock Exchange government bond index is at 126.19, unchanged from its last close, and is tipped to consolidate in a narrow 126.15-126.25 range for the rest of the session.

0217 GMT [Dow Jones] Indonesia shares are likely to open higher, helped by steady IDR and gains in many Asian markets, traders say. Expect index to top psychological 3800 level after shares ended +1.2% at record high of 3769.993 yesterday; "it looks like the main index is on the right track to test the 3800 level amid hopes for healthy inflows," says trader at First Asia Capital.

0215 GMT [Dow Jones] Singapore's 4Q GDP is likely to rebound 10.5% on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted, annualized vs 18.7% contraction in 3Q; 2010 GDP likely +15.2% on-year, above government expectations, Credit Suisse says in a report. Adds, "government revenues are likely to come in much higher than expected, thanks in part to the surge in betting revenues from the two new casinos, stamp duties from property transactions, and higher goods and services tax revenues from the rebound in retail sales." House expects a fiscal surplus at 0.8% of GDP in FY 2010 vs a 1.0% deficit budgeted. With stronger economic growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is likely to remain on a "tightening bias," report says. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@dowjones.com)

0209 GMT [Dow Jones] Statistics NZ data shows total retail spending on electronic cards in November was +1.4% on-month, +6.1% on-year, but a subdued consumer backdrop is still likely for majority of
2011, says Goldman Sachs Economist Philip Borkin; "The value of electronic card transaction was reasonable in November, however, we suspect price rises for fuel and other necessities is partly to blame." Borkin says while the risk is that households slow their pace of deleveraging given the progress made to date and hence more consumption growth results, he reckons this is unlikely due to the forecast fall in house prices; "If house prices were to stabilise and begin to rise, we would become more optimistic on the prospects for household consumption and hence the economy itself."

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] The upward revision to Japan's 3Q real GDP doesn't change expectations for contraction in 4Q due in part to a fall-off in demand after the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars, but the recently brisk demand for flat-panel TVs and other electronics may limit the pain, says Hirokata Kusaba, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. The government will cut incentives by half in December for environmentally friendly electric appliances, which should lead to another burst of rush-buying. "This last-minute demand, in particular the strong demand for flat-panel TVs, should help make up for some of the drop in consumption in the October-December quarter expected due to the earlier end of the 'eco-car' subsidies."

0208 GMT [Dow Jones] Asian  LCD panel makers fined by the European Commission on price-fixing are mostly lower; Morgan Stanley analyst Frank Wang says charges are substantial particularly to Taiwan firms. Chimei Innolux (3481.TW), which faces the heaviest fine at EUR300 million, is down 3.0% at NT$39.25. AU Optronics (2409.TW) with a EUR117 million fine is down 1.1% at NT$30.45. South
Korea's LG Display (034220.SE) is up 0.5% at KRW40450 despite its EUR215 million  fine. "It's a negative surprise that Chimei is  fined more than LG...Chi Mei will need to take an earnings bath in 4Q
10," says Wang. But adds, AUO's settlement should instead be viewed as a positive as the overhang is now removed, as the company had already booked the  fines as expenses in its 2009 account. Chunghwa Picture (2475.TW) which faces a much smaller EUR9 million penalty, is up 0.2% at NT$4.27 while HannStar Display (6116.TW) is down 0.5% at NT$5.61 on its EUR8 million penalty. All companies say the fine will not have a significant impact on their operations. (aries.poon@dowjones.com)

0202 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD gets a bump from stronger-than-expected Australia jobs data, as the positive surprise helps risk-sensitive assets such as the common currency, says Yuichiro Harada, senior FX dealer at Mizuho Corporate Bank. "The strong Australian jobs data was a trigger to buy the euro." Adds that many investors may not find U.S. Treasury yield rises to be a compelling reason to sell the pair as "the trend of higher yields is rather now a global phenomenon, not just a local U.S. issue, and that diminishes the dollar-positive impact." Says EUR/USD may target 1.3400 later in the global day, with
further help coming from "a sense that Ireland is no longer as much in the spotlight and that the European sovereign debt concerns are receding a little for now." Pair last at 1.3305, up from its earlier low at
1.3244.(andrew.monahan@dowjones.com)

0201 GMT [Dow Jones] China shares are lower as investors are concerned the PBOC could hike the reserve requirement ratio or the benchmark interest rate (in the coming days) to curb inflation after suspending the 3-year bill sale. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.3% at 2841.35 and it's tipped to hover around current level for the rest of the session. "The Shanghai index could rebound next week if the central bank doesn't launch any (additional tightening) measures after the November data," says Li Lei at Gold State Securities. Among most active stocks, China Vanke (000002.SZ) down 1.3% at CNY8.38, Poly Real Estate Group (600048,SH) down 1.7% at CNY12.49, China Everbright Bank

0244 GMT [Dow Jones] Korea bonds are mixed, with BOK's comments in statement earlier that geopolitical risks in Korea are a downside risk for the economy helping some tenors and bond futures rise, participants say. Note, 3-year bonds are weak on expectations the government may act to resolve a recent supply shortage for those bonds; the 3-year yield is quoted +6 bps at 3.14%, the 5-year yield is down 2 bps at 3.93%, the 10-year yield is down 1 bp at 4.36% while the 20-year yield is flat at 4.55%. December futures are up 14 ticks as foreigners net buy more than 5,000 contracts so far. "We'll have to
see what the BOK governor has to say about geopolitical concerns," says Taurus Investment & Securities analyst Kong Dong-rak. But adds "I don't think the risks relating to North Korea are big enough to dent the BOK's current stance of normalizing the key policy rate" at a measured and moderate pace.

0241 GMT [Dow Jones] HSI +0.6% at 23,228.97, supported by modest rise on Wall Street, but gains are likely capped amid continued concerns over possible further tightening in China, especially given that China bourses are mixed today with Shanghai Composite last down 0.02% at 2847.89. Resistance is tipped at early high of 23,269.36. "The rate hike overhang may continue to drag China stocks until a move is confirmed by the PBOC," says Haitong. Adds, measures to filter capital inflow should prove
overdone in view of the poor performance of the mainland bourses so far this year, while sentiment in the local market has also been cautious. House expects better buying momentum in HK retailing operators and HK property investors as investors stay away from China stocks that are more vulnerable to policy changes. HSBC (0005.HK) +1.1% at HK$80.95 after rally in U.S. financial stocks, while China Resources Land (1109.HK) is down 0.3% at HK$13.82 on rate hike concerns in China. Volume is modest at HK$12.83 billion. (susanna.tai@dowjones.com)

0240 GMT [Dow Jones] Crude oil climbs in early Asia trading as USD weakens while optimistic views over fundamentals persist. The ICE Dollar Index is down 0.258 at 79.750 with robust Australia jobs data triggering EUR-buying as investors turn to riskier assets; also, product inventories' gains in the latest EIA report are being interpreted as seasonal, "a sort of obligatory round of moves by refineries as the year ends," advisory firm Cameron Hanover says in a research note. Market players are still expecting Friday's monthly IEA and OPEC reports to show sizable upward demand revisions, says Ritterbusch and Associates.

0233 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/CNY falls amid an increase in selling interest in the USD; the pair is at

Shanghai-based trader at foreign bank. Expects selling demand stems from a higher-than-expected
central parity; "the reference rate is not bad, so customers are in a rush to sell the U.S. unit in case the
dollar drops again in coming days." PBOC sets the USD/CNY central parity at 6.6654 vs 6.6616

bond yield in 1.4400%-1.4800% band at the auction. Still, another local bank trader tips the 10-year bond
yield in 1.4200%-1.4500% band; "Chunghwa Post and insurers are likely to buy 10-year bonds below
1.4500%," he says. Adds, Chunghwa Post, the island's largest bond player, bought the 10-year bond
aggressively around 1.4500% yesterday. 5-year yield is tad lower at 1.0000% vs 1.0050% yesterday.

HD       Government concerned over EU flat panel fines

LP
Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA) The government expressed concern Thursday over heavy fines the European     Commission has slapped on four Taiwanese flat panel makers for alleged price-fixing.

Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said the government will provide any assistance necessary if the fined companies ask for help.

TD
Shih said, however, that the government should have confidence in the companies' ability to deal with international lawsuits, as all of them have multinational operations and have their own legal teams.

In July last year, the  European Commission -- the European Union's top decision-maker -- brought charges against Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp., along with LG Display of South Korea, accusing them of price-fixing.

Samsung Electronics, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged, since it blew the whistle to the European Commission on the price-fixing.

The EU antitrust regulator accused the firms of violating EU law through a conspiracy to engage in unfair price-fixing  practices to hurt flat panel buyers in the production of products such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital watches and MP3 players.

The European Commission issued its decision Wednesday against the five manufacturers, which could face combined total fines to the tune of 649 million euros (US$862 million).

Of the five, Chi Mei -- which merged with Innolux Display Corp. to form Chimei Innolux Corp. in March -- received the heaviest penalty, with a  fine of 300 million euros.

Meanwhile, Sun Li-chun, a commissioner with the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission, said the agency is willing to extend a helping hand if the government is allowed to intervene.

Sun noted that based on past experience, the amounts of that  fines are negotiable if the accused companies appeal and explain their situations.
AUO, which was  fined 116.8 million euros, has already said it will appeal.

An AUO spokesman said it has cooperated with the EU authorities over the past four years in their investigation into industry practices regarding the production and marketing of TFT-LCD products.

Meanwhile, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Christina Liu also said the government will try its best to help if the four companies ask.

Liu attributed the EU move -- a repetition of a similar antitrust case in the United States -- in part to the economic downturn in Europe and the U.S.

"These two areas tend to take more aggressive approaches when their economies are not in good shape," she said.

Chi Mei and Chunghwa said they will examine the EU decision more closely before taking their next steps. A Chi Mei executive said the 300 million-euro  fine is "really too harsh."
Chunghua was fined 9 million euros, while HannStar got a  fine of 8.1 million euros.

LP
The European Commission has fined six LCD panel producers a total of EUR 648.83 million for operating a cartel which harmed European buyers of television sets, computers and other products that use LCD components. The six are Samsung Electronics and LG Display of Korea and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display. Samsung Electronics received full immunity from fines under the commission's leniency programme, as it was the first to provide information about the cartel. The cartel operated between October 2001 and February 2006. During the four years, the companies agreed prices, including price ranges and minimum prices, exchanged information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions. The  cartel members held monthly multilateral meetings and further bilateral meetings. In total they met around 60 times mainly in hotels in Taiwan for what they called "the Crystal meetings".

TD
The investigation by the commission shows that the companies were aware they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal the venue and results of the meetings.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could rise to 19,760, according to charts.

TD
But Sensex has to move past major resistance at 19,850 to impart momentum to the short-term uptrend.

Until the index moves past 19,850, it would be vulnerable to a test of minor support 19,590. A fall below major support at 19,300 would indicate a reversal of the short-term bullish trend.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty may test resistance at 5,930.

A rise above major resistance at 5,945 would lend momentum to the short-term bullish trend. While minor is at 5,885, a drop below major support at 5,850 would lend momentum to the downtrend.




US STOCKS
U.S. shares ended higher Wednesday, as surging financial stocks more than offset a broad decline across the market.

The U.S. dollar continued its recent run higher, pushing down prices of some commodities and hitting the stocks of materials, energy and industrial companies.

Consumer-discretionary stocks also finished lower, weighed by a 2% decline in McDonald's. The fast-food chain led declines among Dow components after reporting same-store sales rose 4.8% in November, but fell short of analysts' estimates.

Pulling on the other side were financial stocks, fueled by gains at smaller regional banks. Lincoln National jumped 7.5%, Fifth Third Bancorp surged 6.5%, and Zions Bancorp added 5.5%. Regions Financial, Keycorp and PNC Financial Services all gained between 2.9% and 5.3%.

Morgan Stanley rose 3.2%, after the consortium of investors buying the investment bank's 34.3% stake in China International Capital all won their necessary approvals. Bank of America surged 3.7% to lead the Dow, while J.P. Morgan Chase added 2.6%.

But American International Group tumbled 3.9%, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. government is looking to sell at least $15 billion of its shares in the insurer in the first of several stock offerings to investors starting in early 2011.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Thursday, with shares in Sydney powering to a four-week high after a strong employment report while the Tokyo market continued to benefit from a lower yen.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi Composite were all
up while New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 52 points higher in
screen trade.

A positive finish for U.S. stocks Wednesday aided regional sentiment, with fianancial stocks rising on the back of gains in their peers on Wall Street.

Mitsubishi UFJ FG rose 2.0% and Sumitomo Mitsui FG advanced 1.9% in Tokyo, while in Sydney ANZ Bank added 1.0% and Westpac Bank climbed 1.7%, and KB Financial Group added 0.3% and Shinhan Financial Group tacked on 0.4% in Seoul.

In Sydney, the market received a boost from a strong employment report with the benchmark S&P/ASX Index tapping a four-week high of 4747.1
Apart from banking stocks, resources were also higher. BHP Billiton rose 0.9% and Fortescue was 1.2%
higher.
In Japan, Kyocera rose 1.5%, Sony added 1.0% and Honda Motor advanced 1.1%.

In Seoul, financial and tech plays underpinned early gains. LG Display added 0.3%, reversing earlier losses that were driven by news the  European Commission had imposed a EUR215 million  fine for price fixing  between 2001-2006.
Samsung Electronics rose 0.5% and Hynix Semiconductor added 0.6%.

The Bank of Korea's decision to hold rates steady at 2.50%, as expected, didn't have any notable impact on the market.


FOREX
The euro was fetching $1.3299, from $1.3261 late Wednesday in New York, and at Y111.37 against the yen, from Y111.44. The dollar was at Y83.80, from Y84.03.


METALS
Gold futures fell Wednesday, with investors cashing in on record prices as they mulled the longer-term inflation and interest rate implications of extended U.S. tax cuts.
Spot gold was at $1,385.20 per troy ounce, up $3.90 from its New York close Wednesday.

Base metals closed mostly higher on the London Metal Exchange Wednesday after improving demand prospects stemmed the impact of a firmer U.S. dollar.


OIL SUMMARY

Page 165 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Crude prices settled lower in U.S. trading Wednesday after the government reported U.S. stockpiles of fuel inventories rose by a larger-than-expected amount last week.
January Nymex crude oil futures, which tapped a fresh 26-month high Tuesday, were up 22 cents at
$88.92 per barrel on Globex.

HD      ANTI-TRUST POLICY : LCD PANEL CARTEL FINED 648 MN EURO WC     372 words

The European Commission fined six manufacturers of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels a total of
€648,925,000, on 8 December, for operating a  cartel. The decision brings to a close an investigation
launched last July following a number of complaints.
The world's second and third largest  LCD panel manufacturers were  fined nearly two-thirds of the total.

TD
LCD panels are the main component of flat screens used in televisions, computer monitors and electronic notebooks.

The firms concerned are Korean - Samsung Electronics and LG Display (numbers one and two worldwide, respectively) - and Taiwanese - AU Optronics (number three worldwide), Chimei Innolux Corporation (second largest national manufacturer), Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation. However, since they trade in the European Economic Area (EEA), "they must play fair," said Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. "The fact that they are foreign companies is no excuse. The companies in question knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour," he added.

They met around 60 times between October 2001 and February 2006, mostly in hotels in Taiwan, for what they called the Crystal meetings', explained the EU executive. They agreed price ranges and minimum prices and exchanged information on future production planning, capacity utilisation and other commercial conditions. The impact on consumers in the EEA was direct because the great majority of televisions, computer screens and notebooks using  LCD panels and sold in the EEA are made in Asia.

The amount of the  fines takes account of sales of the products concerned in the EEA, the very serious nature of the infringement, its geographical scope (EEA) and its duration. Samsung Electronics was given full immunity under the Commission's 2002 leniency programme because it blew the whistle and provided valuable information to the Commission to prove the infringement. None of the companies met the conditions for a reduction of the  fine because of inability to pay.
The fines (in euro):
Samsung: 0 (100% reduction)
LG Display: 215million (50% reduction and partial immunity for 2006) AU Optronics: 116.8 million
Chimei Innolux Corporation: 300 million (20% reduction) Chunghwa Picture Tubes: 9.025 million (5% reduction)
HannStar Display Corporation: 8.1 million

Five Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies in a  cartel with Samsung have been  fined a total of €648.9m ($858m) by Europe's antitrust watchdog. The companies ran their operation in the market for display panels that are used in consumer gadgets.

TD
The five companies are SamsungLG Display of South Korea and Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei
Innolux, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display.
Samsung blew the whistle on the  cartel and so escaped penalty.

EU officials said on Wednesday that the companies met more than 60 times over about four years to agree prices, production schedules and other commercial conditions.

The assignations, called "the crystal meetings", took place mainly in Taiwanese hotels, but had a big knock-on effect in Europe, where large volumes of televisions, computer monitors and notebooks using the panels were sold.

The biggest single penalty will be paid by Chimei, at €300m. LG Display faces a €215m  fine, but this came after significant reductions because the company co-operated and was the first to produce evidence that the  cartel continued beyond 2005. It received partial immunity.

Of the other three companies, AU Optronics is  fined €116.8m, after getting a 20 per cent reduction for co-operation; Chunghwa pays €9.025m after a 5 per cent reduction for co-operation; and HannStar is fined €8.1m.

Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said the case showed that "foreign companies, like European ones, need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair". "The companies concerned knew that they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour."

He added that two of the companies, who remain unidentified, had asked for reductions in  fines on grounds of financial hardship and "inability to pay," but that these arguments did not succeed.
In similar probes into the  LCD market in the US and Japan, Japanese companies were also penalised. Mr Almunia said that there had been no proof that their products were involved in the particular markets
that were examined by the  European Commission, which included thin-film  LCD panels used in
computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital watches, pocket calculators and MP3 players.

This is the seventh  cartel case dealt with by Brussels this year, and takes the total amount of  fines to in excess of €3bn. The record annual total was in 2007 when  fines topped €3.3bn on aggregate. Between
2006 and 2010 fines have exceeded €1.5bn a year.

Sour BlackBerrys?

Research In Motion shares slid for a second day in a row on North American stock markets, as the stock gave back the gains they achieved earlier this month.

TD
RIM shares closed at $62 in Toronto, down 72 cents for the day and down from $63.85 at Monday's close. In New York, the shares slipped 75 cents to close at $61.37 US. That's down three per cent from
$63.33 on Monday.

RIM co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis said Tuesday that some of the PlayBook's advanced features will be included in future BlackBerry smartphones. But Lazaridis said he disagreed with a perception that
the BlackBerry smartphones are out-of-date, saying they're aimed at a global market where many carriers have second-generation wireless networks.

Fines for LCD price-fixing

The European Commission imposed fines Wednesday on five South Korean and Taiwanese companies for fixing  the prices of liquid-crystal display panels in popular devices such as flat-screen televisions, computers and notebook devices. The  fines, totalling 649 million euro or $859.6 million US, were related to violations dating to 2001, when the companies started meeting to fix prices of  LCD screens.
Pro-oilsands ad campaign

A U.S. energy industry lobby group is planning a media blitz to counter negative publicity over plans for a controversial pipeline to transport Alberta oilsands crude to the Gulf coast.
The American Petroleum Institute plans to unveil its ad campaign in January.

Cindy Schild, the API's manager of downstream and industry operations, says the ads will promote the economic benefits and jobs that oilsands crude will bring to the U.S.

The move comes just a day after an environmental coalition said it planned a half-million-dollar ad campaign against TransCanada Corporation's proposed Keystone XL project.
AIG to pay off massive loan

Bailed-out insurance conglomerate American International Group Inc. is taking a key step toward paying off a bailout that was at one point worth $182 billion US - the largest of the financial crisis.

The company says in a public filing Wednesday that it will pay off a loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIG says that will clear the way for the United States Treasury to sell off the government's stake.

Home Depot ups estimate

ATLANTA Home Depot Inc. is raising its fiscal 2010 earnings-per-share guidance for the second time in two months as North Americans begin to take on more home-improvement projects.
The retail giant now expects net income from continuing operations to be $1.97 per share. That's up
from prior guidance of $1.94 per share. The company now expects revenue to rise 2.3 per cent, up from
the 2.2 per cent rise expected previously, implying revenue of $67.7 billion.
Dollarama on growth spree

MONTREAL Dollarama will accelerate store expansion next year, particularly in Western Canada as the retailer continues to build the leading Canadian discount chain.
The company plans to add 50 stores in 2011 with one-third to 40 per cent of the growth being focused in
Western Canada.
That follows some 45 stores added in the past year, mostly in Ontario. Costco income jumps in Q1
PORTLAND, Ore. Costco Wholesale Corp. said its first-quarter net income rose 17 per cent - even faster than revenue - with help from higher gas prices and rising sales of high-profit items.

Costco said Wednesday that its net income jumped to $312 million US, or 71 cents per share, for the period ended Nov. 21. Revenue rose 11 per cent to $19.24 billion.

HD         E.U. levies fines on screen makers; Korean companies cited for operating a cartel in flat-panel display  market

The European Commission slapped fines totaling €649 million on five South Korean and Taiwan companies on Wednesday for  fixing  the prices of liquid crystal display panels in popular devices like flat-screen televisions, computers and notebook devices.

Although most of the price-fixing  meetings took place in Taiwan, the Brussels regulator said the  fines, equivalent to $858 million, were necessary because the activities of the companies raised prices on goods with a value of more than €7 billion sold to European consumers.

TD
‘‘Foreign companies, like European ones, have an obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe,’’ Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, said at a news conference.
‘‘The fact that the  cartel meetings took place outside the E.U. is no excuse,’’ he said.

Chimei Innolux, a Taiwan company, must pay €300 million, the largest amount. The other Taiwan companies that received  fines were AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display.

Samsung Electronics of Korea escaped without a  fine because it reported the  cartel to the authorities in the first place.
A second Korean company, LG Display, was  fined €215 million, the second-largest amount.
Mr. Almunia said the six manufacturers met about 60 times between 2001 and 2006 to agree on prices
— including price ranges and minimum prices — and to exchange information on future production
planning, capacity utilization and trading conditions.

‘‘This was a very well organized  cartel with monthly meetings, called ‘the crystal meetings,’ held mostly in hotels in Taiwan,’’ he said.

The group fixed the prices of  LCD panels that were sold either alone or already as part of televisions, computers and notebook devices.

The commission has imposed  fines totaling €3.1 billion this year in  cartel cases, the second highest year on record. The record was set in 2007, when the commission imposed  fines totaling €3.3 billion.

Money paid by offenders in E.U.  cartel cases helps to offset contributions by governments to the central E.U. budget, which pays for things like the Common Agricultural Policy and development aid to poorer regions.

Mr. Almunia also announced on Wednesday that he had dropped antitrust charges against Visa Europe, a card payments company, after accepting its pledge to cut fees passed on to retailers for cross-border transactions.

Visa Europe said it was in talks on ‘‘reaching an agreed outcome’’ on a separate investigation into fees for credit-card and deferred-debit transactions, where customers must settle their bills at the end of the month.

The European Commission imposed fines Wednesday on five South Korean and Taiwanese companies for fixing  the prices of liquid crystal display panels in popular devices like flat-screen televisions, computers and notebook devices.

The fines, totaling €649 million, or $857 million, were related to violations dating back to 2001, when the companies started meeting to fix prices of  LCD screens.

Although most of the illegal activity took place in Taiwan, the Brussels regulator said European action was necessary because the activities of the companies raised prices on goods sold to European consumers. The value of the goods was more than €7 billion, the commission said.

HD            Corporate  News: LCD Makers Fined Over Alleged  Cartel

LP
BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission on Wednesday fined six makers of liquid-crystal display screens a total of 649 million euros ($861 million) for allegedly operating a  cartel over five years.

The commission, the European Union's executive arm, said Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Display Co. of South Korea and Taiwanese producers AU Optronics Corp., Chimei InnoLux Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp. met monthly in Taiwanese hotels from 2001 to 2006 to agree on prices and share commercially sensitive information.

TD
The commission said LG Display was  fined 215 million euros, AU Optronics 117 million euros, Chimei InnoLux 300 million euros, Chungwa 9 million euros and HannStar 8 million euros. Samsung Electronics got full immunity from the  fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

The fines took into account each company's share of the more than 7 billion euros in  LCD sales in Europe over the  cartel period, the commission said. But it reduced the  fines of some of the companies to reward their cooperation with the investigation.

The EU has the power to  fine companies as much as 10% of their global revenue for breaking its antitrust rules.

The EU's action comes two years after LG Display paid a $400 million  fine and pleaded guilty to criminal price-fixing  charges in the U.S. Chunghwa Picture Tubes pleaded guilty in the same U.S. investigation.
Representatives of the companies weren't available to comment Wednesday.

The LCD makers fined by the EU knew their actions were illegal and took steps to conceal their gatherings, which they called "the crystal meetings," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. There were around 60 such meetings in all, the commissioner said.

He added that a  cartel document asked all the participants "to take care of confidentiality matters and to limit written communication."

"Foreign companies, like European ones, have the obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe," Mr. Almunia said.
Liquid crystal display screens are used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops.

LG Display is considering filing an appeal on the European Commission’s decision to slap huge  fines on the South Korean company for having participated in a price-fixing  scheme for liquid crystal display (LCD) panels.
LG was fined more than 323 billion won by the  European Commission on Wednesday for violating
European Union laws on fair competition.

TD
The company promised to take responsibility for past inappropriate acts and to pursue more transparent and fairer business practices in the future.

However, LG said that after a careful review, if it appears that there were problems in the commission’s investigation process, LG may lodge an appeal.

LG’s compatriot company Samsung Electronics was also targeted by the  European Commission for price-fixing.  But Samsung has been exempted from  fines, since it voluntarily admitted to its fault and reported it to the  European Commission.

By Kim Yoo-chul
LG Display, the world's second-biggest  LCD maker, is considering appealing against a fine of
215 million euros ($285 million), levied by the  European Commission (EC) for a price-fixing
scheme.

TD
``We may take the  fine imposition to the General Court in the commission upon review of the situation,’’ said an LG Display spokesman Sohn Young-june, Thursday.
LG’s rival, Samsung was also involved in the  cartel but volunteered to report the scheme to the
European authorities and received no penalty in return.
The official remarks come after European Union (EU) regulators charged LG with breaching EU
laws on restrictive business practices in July, last year.

The EC told LG to pay some $285 million for  fixing  prices of LCD panels with five other firms between 2001 and 2006.

The European regulators claimed the  cartel members held monthly multilateral meetings and further bilateral meetings.

In total, they met around 60 times mainly in hotels in Taiwan for what they called ``the crystal meetings.’’

Samsung Electronics and LG Display are the industry’s two biggest vendors of  LCD panels, shipping parts to almost all technology companies including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard (HP).

LG’s Sohn said he expects the amount of the  fine to be cut as the company is planning to fully cooperate with the EC and added it will strengthen transparency in management by implementing some needed reform measures.

``The decision will not hurt the relationships with our bigger clients. We will keep up our work to supply value-added products to them,’’ the spokesman said.
Despite the levies, LG Display rose by 1.99 percent to end at 41,050 won per share on the
KOSPI, Korea Exchange (KRX), the bourse operator, said.

Market analysts say the  fine will just be a ``one-time event’’ as it was widely anticipated and expects operating profit to rise from the first quarter of next year.

``The EC’s decision will cause a shortcoming. LG Display will fall to rock bottom from the fourth quarter and its share corrections are giving good chances for investors to buy,’’ said Park Hyun, an analyst at Hanwha Securities, in a note to clients.

``LG will suffer from a 544.4 billion won operating loss in the fourth quarter hit by the industry’s bearish mood, however, the amount will decrease to 55.8 billion won in the first quarter of 2011,’’ added Park.

Page 183 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Samsung Electronics was also part of the ``price-cartel’’ group.

But Samsung received full immunity from the  fines under the commission’s leniency program as it was the first to provide valuable information on the  cartel to prove the infringements.
Article 101 of the EU Treaty prohibits price-fixing  and other practices restrictive of competition.

``I don’t understand Samsung’s moves against business virtues. Samsung is lacking full prudency. It’s too bad,’’ said a top-ranking industry executive, asking not to be identified.
``Samsung was absolved of any  fines as it blew the whistle on the  cartel,’’ added the executive. Taiwanese LCD makers also blamed Samsung over its willing action to be freed from any
wrongdoings.

Taiwan-based Chi Mei Optoelectronics and three other Taiwanese firms were also  fined. Taiwanese LCD makers have been previously known to take action against Samsung, industry sources said.
Song Cheol-gyu, a Samsung spokesman, declined to comment. Officials at Taiwanese makers weren’t available for comment.
In the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation, eight companies, including LG Display, Chi Mei, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Sharp and Hitachi Displays, have pleaded guilty and paid more than $890 million in criminal  fines for price-fixing,  in a separate case.

TAIPEI, Dec. 9 -- Four Taiwanese liquid crystal display panel manufacturers are preparing to appeal or considering their options Thursday after the European Commission handed out 648.9 million euros in fines to the companies and two Korean rivals for running a cartel between 2001 and 2006.

Taiwan's AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux Corp, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp and South Korea's LG Display and Samsung Electronics ''knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behavior,'' commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia said in a statement Wednesday.

TD
The cartel representatives organized ''around 60'' monthly strategy sessions in Taiwanese hotels known as the ''Crystal meetings'' where they set prices and price ranges and conferred over other commercial conditions.
The regulator said the  cartel members ''took steps to conceal the venue and results of the meetings.'' Chimei InnoLux, which underwent a merger in March well after the offenses took place, had the
heaviest hit of 300 million euros, while AU Optronics was  fined 116.8 million euros, including a 20
percent fine reduction for cooperating with the commission.

Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display received smaller  fines of 9 million euros and 8.1 million euros.

The commission cut LG Display's  fine in half to 215 million euros for cooperating with the probe and awarded it immunity for the 2006 portion of the  cartel's operations for providing evidence of the last months of its operations.

Samsung was technically  fined but given full immunity ''as it brought the  cartel to the Commission's attention and provided valuable information to prove the infringement,'' the statement said.

Of the Taiwanese companies, AU Optronics has already indicated it will appeal the  fine, local media reported.

AU Optronics is also facing difficulties in California, where the U.S. District Court in San Francisco has ordered several executives to remain in that state and confiscated their passports ahead of proceedings this week over possible antitrust violations.

TAIPEI - Four Taiwanese liquid crystal display panel manufacturers are preparing to appeal or considering their options Thursday after the European Commission handed out 648.9 million euros in fines to the companies and two Korean rivals for running a cartel between 2001 and 2006.

Exports to help Japan's recovery without slumping: BOJ's Morimoto

SAITAMA, Japan - Bank of Japan Policy Board member Yoshihisa Morimoto said Thursday that exports would continue to back the country's economic recovery without sharply falling but that he cannot tell when consumer spending will fully recover following the ending of a government subsidy program for car purchases.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could rise to 19,760, according to charts.

TD
But Sensex has to move past major resistance at 19,850 to impart momentum to the short-term uptrend.

Until the index moves past 19,850, it would be vulnerable to a test of minor support 19,590. A fall below major support at 19,300 would indicate a reversal of the short-term bullish trend.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty may test resistance at 5,930.

A rise above major resistance at 5,945 would lend momentum to the short-term bullish trend. While minor is at 5,885, a drop below major support at 5,850 would lend momentum to the downtrend.




US STOCKS
U.S. shares ended higher Wednesday, as surging financial stocks more than offset a broad decline across the market.

The U.S. dollar continued its recent run higher, pushing down prices of some commodities and hitting the stocks of materials, energy and industrial companies.


Page 191 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Consumer-discretionary stocks also finished lower, weighed by a 2% decline in McDonald's. The fast-food chain led declines among Dow components after reporting same-store sales rose 4.8% in November, but fell short of analysts' estimates.

Pulling on the other side were financial stocks, fueled by gains at smaller regional banks. Lincoln National jumped 7.5%, Fifth Third Bancorp surged 6.5%, and Zions Bancorp added 5.5%. Regions Financial, Keycorp and PNC Financial Services all gained between 2.9% and 5.3%.

Morgan Stanley rose 3.2%, after the consortium of investors buying the investment bank's 34.3% stake in China International Capital all won their necessary approvals. Bank of America surged 3.7% to lead the Dow, while J.P. Morgan Chase added 2.6%.

But American International Group tumbled 3.9%, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. government is looking to sell at least $15 billion of its shares in the insurer in the first of several stock offerings to investors starting in early 2011.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Thursday, with shares in Sydney powering to a four-week high after a strong employment report while the Tokyo market continued to benefit from a lower yen.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi Composite were all
up while New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 52 points higher in
screen trade.

A positive finish for U.S. stocks Wednesday aided regional sentiment, with fianancial stocks rising on the back of gains in their peers on Wall Street.

Mitsubishi UFJ FG rose 2.0% and Sumitomo Mitsui FG advanced 1.9% in Tokyo, while in Sydney ANZ Bank added 1.0% and Westpac Bank climbed 1.7%, and KB Financial Group added 0.3% and Shinhan Financial Group tacked on 0.4% in Seoul.

In Sydney, the market received a boost from a strong employment report with the benchmark S&P/ASX Index tapping a four-week high of 4747.1
Apart from banking stocks, resources were also higher. BHP Billiton rose 0.9% and Fortescue was 1.2%
higher.
In Japan, Kyocera rose 1.5%, Sony added 1.0% and Honda Motor advanced 1.1%.

In Seoul, financial and tech plays underpinned early gains. LG Display added 0.3%, reversing earlier losses that were driven by news the  European Commission had imposed a EUR215 million  fine for price fixing  between 2001-2006.
Samsung Electronics rose 0.5% and Hynix Semiconductor added 0.6%.

The Bank of Korea's decision to hold rates steady at 2.50%, as expected, didn't have any notable impact on the market.


FOREX
The euro was fetching $1.3299, from $1.3261 late Wednesday in New York, and at Y111.37 against the yen, from Y111.44. The dollar was at Y83.80, from Y84.03.


METALS
Gold futures fell Wednesday, with investors cashing in on record prices as they mulled the longer-term inflation and interest rate implications of extended U.S. tax cuts.
Spot gold was at $1,385.20 per troy ounce, up $3.90 from its New York close Wednesday.

Base metals closed mostly higher on the London Metal Exchange Wednesday after improving demand prospects stemmed the impact of a firmer U.S. dollar.


OIL SUMMARY

Page 192 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Crude prices settled lower in U.S. trading Wednesday after the government reported U.S. stockpiles of fuel inventories rose by a larger-than-expected amount last week.
January Nymex crude oil futures, which tapped a fresh 26-month high Tuesday, were up 22 cents at
$88.92 per barrel on Globex.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission imposed fines Wednesday on five South Korean and Taiwanese companies for fixing  the prices of liquid-crystal display panels in popular devices like flat-screen televisions, computers and notebook devices.

The fines, totaling 649 million euros ($859.6 million), were related to violations dating to 2001, when the companies started meeting to fix prices of  LCD screens. Although most of the illegal activity took place in Taiwan, the Brussels regulator said European action was necessary because the activities of the companies raised prices on goods sold to European consumers. The value of the goods was more than 7 billion euros, the commission said.

TD
''Foreign companies, like European ones, have an obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe,'' the European competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, told a news conference. ''The fact that the  cartel meetings took place outside the E.U. is no excuse.''

Chimei Innolux, a Taiwanese company, was ordered to pay almost $400 million, the largest  fine. The other Taiwanese companies ordered to pay  fines were AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display.

Samsung of South Korea, the largest maker of  LCD screens in the world, was not  fined because it had reported the  cartel to the authorities.
A second South Korean company, LG Display, was  fined $286 million, the second-largest amount. Mr. Almunia said the six manufacturers met about 60 times from 2001 to 2006 to agree on prices --
including price ranges and minimum prices -- and to exchange information on future production
planning, capacity utilization and trading conditions.

The cartel fixed the prices of  LCD panels that were sold either alone or in televisions, computers and notebook devices.
The commission, the executive agency of the European Union, has imposed  fines totaling more than
$4 billion this year in cartel cases, the second-highest year on record. The record is 2007, when the
commission imposed fines totaling nearly $4.4 billion.

Mr. Almunia also announced Wednesday that he had dropped antitrust charges against Visa Europe, a card payments company, after accepting its pledge to cut fees passed on to retailers for
cross-border transactions.

Visa Europe said it was still in talks on settling a separate inquiry into fees for credit card and deferred debit transactions.

The European Commission has fined six LCD panel producers a total of EUR 648.83 million for operating a cartel which harmed European buyers of television sets, computers and other products that use LCD components. The six are Samsung Electronics and LG Display of Korea and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics, Chimei InnoLux, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display. Samsung Electronics received full immunity from fines under the commission's leniency programme, as it was the first to provide information about the cartel. The cartel operated between October 2001 and February 2006. During the four years, the companies agreed prices, including price ranges and minimum prices, exchanged information on future production planning, capacity utilisation, pricing and other commercial conditions. The  cartel members held monthly multilateral meetings and further bilateral meetings. In total they met around 60 times mainly in hotels in Taiwan for what they called "the Crystal meetings".

The investigation by the commission shows that the companies were aware they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal the venue and results of the meetings.

(CIA, Dec 8) The European Commission has fined six LCD panel producers a total of EUR 649 mln for operating a cartel which harmed European buyers of television sets, computers and other products that use the key Liquid Crystal Display component, Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said in a press conference on Wednesday, December 8. According to his words, the cartel applied to six Asian companies, which agreed on prices, according to server ct24.cz. The  cartel agreement was reported by South Korean Samsung Electronics, which thus avoided the  fine. It will be the eighth highest  fine from the fines imposed by the European Commission on groups of firms due to the violation of business competition rules.

HD          Gov't willing to help fined panel makers

The China Post news staff -- The government yesterday expressed its concerns over  fines imposed by the European Union on Taiwan's flat panel makers and said it will do its best to help the firms weather the crisis.
Shih Yen-shiang, Minister of Economic Affairs, yesterday said he has already asked the Industrial
Development Bureau under the ministry to see what help flat panel makers may need at this time.

TD
“The firms have told us that at this point they haven't received the official ruling,” Shih said. “Once they get the ruling we'll find out how the government may help.”

The European Commission Wednesday imposed a total of 433.92 million euros in  fines on four Taiwanese flat panel makers for allegedly engaging in price-fixing.  The four firms were Chimei Innolux, AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corp.
The EU accused the four, as well as Korea's Samsung and LG, of colluding to fix prices.

In a news release issued by the EU's fair trade unit, the European Union accused the six of holding over 60 so-called “crystal meetings” from October 2001 to February 2006, discussing how they could work together to keep prices at an advantageous level.

The name “crystal meeting” was taken from the major component of any  LCD panels, namely liquid crystal. The meetings were later exposed to the EU by Samsung, which was not  fined in this case.
Chimei Innolux got the heaviest  fine of 300 million euros among the four companies, while AU was
fined 116.8 million euros, Chunghwa 9.02 million euros, and HannStar. 8.1 million euros.

The fines were issued after the United States imposed similar penalties for the flat panel makers, which form Taiwan's state-of-the-art TFT-LCD industry that churns out products worth well over NT$1 trillion annually.

“This is a learning experience for them. The firms learn fast, and we should have confidence in them,” Shih said, when asked how the flat panel makers should respond to these actions.

He further pointed out powerful, prestigious companies like AU and Chi Mei have their own legal affairs departments that can handle cases like this. “Yet every lawsuit is different, and we will provide all necessary help and assistance,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has also expressed its willingness to help. “We haven't received any requests from the companies asking for help,” said Sun Li-chun, an FTC
member. “Yet FTC will provide all the necessary help within the boundaries of what the government
can do in these situations.”

Currently, only AU Optronics has expressed its resolve to appeal the ruling. “Based on former experiences, the EU is likely to 'reconsider' the penalty if a ruling was appealed,” Sun said.
Separately, shares of Chimei Innolux Corp. closed lower yesterday in the wake of the EU ruling.

Under-performing the broader market, Chimei Innolux fell 5.32 percent to NT$38.3, while the benchmark weighted index rose 50.05 to 8,753.84.
AUO shares fell 2.44 percent to close at NT$30.05.

LG Display on Thursday said it was considering appealing against a  fine imposed by the European
Commission for price-fixing.
The Seoul-based company hopes to reduce the amount of  fines through the action.

TD
“LG Display acknowledges the wrongful acts of the past and respects the  European Commission’s regulatory authority in this regard,” the company said in a statement.
“However, LG Display may, after careful review and consideration, appeal (the) decision.”

The appeal will have to be submitted within 60 days of the commission’s ruling, company officials said.
The European Commission on Wednesday fined LG Display 215 million euros ($285 million) for
fixing  the prices of liquid-crystal display panels.
LG was a part of a  cartel with five other firms between 2001-2006, the commission said.

Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest  LCD maker, also took part but escaped  fines because it provided information to the commission about the  cartel.
Rival companies often present such evidence of wrongdoing to authorities to avoid  fines.

“Foreign companies, like European ones, have an obligation to respect competition rules when they do business in Europe, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels regarding the ruling, according to Bloomberg.

LCD panels are a central component of the thin, flat monitors used in televisions, computer monitors and laptops.

The five firms sold panels in Europe worth about 7 billion euros during the  cartel, the commission said.
Some of the others in the  cartel have said they would appeal.

Chi Mei, which merged with Innolux Display Corp. in March to form Chimei Innolux Corp., was slapped with the heftiest penalty of 300 million euros. Taiwan’s AU Optronics Corp. must pay a penalty of 116.8 million euros, while Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. ― also of Taiwan ― was  fined 9 million euros. Another Taiwanese firm, HannStar Display Corp., was  fined 8.1 million euros.
LG Display said it had taken comprehensive measures to avoid repetition of such mistakes.

Taiwan's government said Saturday that huge price-fixing fines imposed by the European Commission
will hurt its flat panel industry and vowed to help local firms affected by the measures.

"The huge  fines will negatively impact our industry," the ministry of economic affairs said in a statement, adding it will meet the firms next week to discuss the  fines.

TD
The European Commission this week slapped fines totalling 649 million euros (860 million dollars) on five Taiwanese flat panel makers and on one South Korean firm.

The leader in the  LCD business, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, was also accused of being part of the cartel but escaped cash sanctions for coming forward first with information on the alleged scheme.
Terry Gou, chairman of Taiwan's IT giant Hon Hai Precision, has vowed to fight back for its affiliate
Chimei Innolux Corporation, which faces the largest  fine of 300 million euros.
Gou also blasted Samsung for turning on other firms in order to escape punishment.

"Is it fair that a repeat offender is found not guilty?... We won't easily pay the money that we should not be paying. We will fight all the way," he told reporters on Friday.

Taiwan's AU Optronics has said it will challenge the  fine while the other Taiwanese firms have said they are considering whether to appeal.

The Commission accused the firms of running a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006 that fixed prices, harming European buyers of televisions and computers equipped with liquid crystal displays.

HD     Taiwanese tycoon: EU should  have fined Samsung for price fixing  along with rest of cartel

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - The head of Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn Technology Group questioned the European Union decision to exempt Samsung Electronics Co. from price-fixing fines for makers of LCD panels, accusing his South Korean rival of being the  cartel's main culprit.

Terry Gou's comments came after the EU competition watchdog  fined South Korea's LG Display and four Taiwanese manufacturers euro649 million ($863 million) Wednesday for  fixing  prices on the flat-screen panels between 2001 and 2006.

TD
Samsung, the world's biggest LCD maker, also participated in the price fixing  but escaped a fine
because it blew the whistle on the cartel, according to the European Commission.

Foxconn does not make  LCD panels, but Gou is a major shareholder of Taiwan's Chimei Innolux Corp., which was fined euro300 million in the case.

Three other Taiwanese makers -- AU Optronics, Chunghwa and HannStar -- were  fined euro116.8 million, euro9 million and euro8.1 million, respectively.
The world's second-biggest  LCD maker, South Korea's LG Display, was  fined euro215 million.
The fines targeted price-fixing  for LCD panels used in flat screens for televisions and computer monitors. Speaking to reporters late Friday, Gou said Samsung and LG Display were leading in the price  fixing,
and Taiwanese makers were only collaborating with them.

"If the No. 1 and No. 2 makers did not lead in  fixing  prices, would Taiwan's No. 3 and No. 4 carry any weight?" he asked.
Gou suggested that Samsung only informed authorities of the improprieties as part of a scheme to beat its
Taiwanese rivals.
South Korean firms "are resorting to all means possible in order to crush us," he said.

Samsung spokesman Jason Kim had no response to Gou's statements when contacted Saturday, saying only "Samsung Electronics respects the EU's decision."

The European Commission said the LCD makers met about 60 times between October 2001 and February 2006, mostly in Taiwanese hotels, for what they called "the Crystal meetings," the commission said. In addition to  fixing  prices, they also exchanged information on their future production plans and other business plans, it said.

The cartel affected  LCD panel sales worth about euro7 billion in the European market, the commission said.

Gou said the EU  fine was levied without giving Chimei a chance to defend itself, noting that the firm will hold its action pending the EU's clarification.
Au Optronics has said it will appeal, while Chunghwa and HannStar have yet to decide what to do.

HD          AU Optronics China plant approved

Premier Wu Den-yih yesterday disclosed that AU Optronics (AUO) has received the greenlight to build an LCD panel plant in China, dismissing complaints that his administration has been dragging its feet screening such investment projects.

Wu said the government's decision-makers have already approved the project, which is now only awaiting the completion of basic paper work at the economics ministry's investment commission.

TD
The premier's revelation was a direct response to a tirade by an angry Terry Gou, chairman of the Hon
Hai Group, over the lack of progress in allowing Taiwan's makers to set up panel factories in China

Gou's anger was triggered by hefty antitrust  fines the European Commission recently imposed on Taiwan's panel makers, including AUO and Chimei Innolux (CMI), in which Hon Hai owns a major stake.

“Why is (the government) tying up Taiwan panel makers,” asked Gou on Friday as he met with economics officials to seek advice over the EU  fines.
Gou, accompanied by Vice Economics Minister Huang Jung-chiou, also went to the EU's trade office in
Taipei to demand an explanation of the  fines.

AUO submitted an application to build an advanced plant in China earlier this year after the Wu administration lifted a ban on Taiwan makers running panel production on the other side of the strait.
But the government later rejected the application, citing a lack of proper papers.
AUO then renewed its application, but the government has yet to give it final approval.

“Chairman Gou must have been away from Taiwan for too long, and he isn't aware of the present progress (of the AUO case),” said Premier Wu.

Wu noted that Taiwan panel makers are only allowed to build fabrication plants in China if the end products are one generation lower than their production in Taiwan in terms of technology. The makers must also promise to keep investing in Taiwan.

AUO has already met both requirements and received the approval without any delay by the government, Wu said, adding CMI has not submitted an application for building panel plants in China.

Commenting on the EU  fines, Wu said he does not know enough to go into detail about the competition between CMI and its competitors.

Business competition between Taiwanese and foreign companies is not something that the government can meddle in, but it will not back off from protecting local companies' rights abroad, the premier said.

The economics ministry said the EU's huge  fines will hurt its  LCD panel industry, but promised help for local firms affected by the antitrust measures.

“The huge fines will negatively impact our industry,” the ministry said in a statement.
Page 209 of 217 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It said it will meet with the firms involved this week to discuss the  fines.

The ministry said it has asked its trade officials in Europe to try to seek an explanation of the case from the European authorities.
Five Taiwanese panel makers and South Korea's LG Display received  fines totaling 649 million euros. But the world's leading  LCD maker, South Korea's Samsung Electronics, escaped punishment,
although it was also charged with playing a part in the price  fixing.
Gou has blasted Samsung for turning on other firms in order to escape punishment.

AUO has vowed to challenge the  fine while the other Taiwanese firms have said they are considering whether to appeal.

The six are Samsung Electronics and LG Display of Korea and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics Chimei InnoLux Corporation Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation. Samsung Electronics received full immunity from fines under the Commissions leniency programme as it was the first to provide information about the cartel. Article 101 of the EU Treaty prohibits price-fixing  and other practices restrictive of competition.

Foreign companies like European ones need to understand that if they want to do business in Europe they must play fair. The companies concerned knew they were breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal their illegal behaviour. The only understanding we will show is for those that come forward to denounce a cartel and help prove its existence said Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia.
Last Wednesday the Commission  fined six producers of liquid crystal display LCD panels a total of €648
925 000 for operating a  cartel between October 2001 and February 2006. LCD panels are the main
component of thin flat screens used in televisions computer monitors and electronic notebooks. The
companies are Samsung Electronics and LG Display of Korea and Taiwanese firms AU Optronics
Chimei InnoLux Corporation Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display Corporation.

During the four years the companies agreed prices including price ranges and minimum prices exchanged information on future production planning capacity utilisation pricing and other commercial conditions. The  cartel members held monthly multilateral meetings and further bilateral meetings. In total they met around 60 times mainly in hotels in Taiwan for what they called the Crystal meetings.

These agreements had a direct impact on customers in the European Economic Area because the vast majority of televisions computer monitors and notebooks incorporating those  LCD panels and sold in the EEA comes from Asia.
The investigation gathered by the Commission shows that the companies were aware they were
breaking competition rules and took steps to conceal the venue and results of the meetings. A document
requested everybody to take care of security/confidentiality matters and to limit written communication
reminding of the DRAM investigation started in 2002 and concluded in May 2010 see IP/10/586 .

The Commission faced the companies with a Statement of Objections on May 2009 on which they had the opportunity to comment and be heard and after which the Commission reduced the proven duration of the infringement by four months.
The fines

In setting the level of the  fines the Commission took into account the companies sales of the products concerned in the EEA the very serious nature of the infringement its EEA-wide scope and its duration. Samsung Electronics received full immunity under the Commissions 2002 Leniency Notice as it brought the cartel to the Commissions attention and provided valuable information to prove the infringement. The fines of the following undertakings were also reduced for their cooperation with the Commission: LG Display 50% AU Optronics 20% and Chunghwa Picture Tubes 5% . Besides this reduction LG Display also received a full reduction of  fine for its participation in the  cartel in 2006 as it was the first company

to bring forward evidence showing that the  cartel continued after 2005 so-called partial immunity . None of the companies met the conditions for a reduction of the  fine under paragraph 35 of the Commissions
2006 Guidelines on  Fines inability-to-pay claims . Two had applied.

HD                 AUO nears approval  on investment in Chinese LCD plant; IN A FIX:Officials said they would meet with panel makers next week to discuss how best to respond  to price-fixing allegations in Europe

Premier Wu Den-yih said yesterday that a steering committee of the Investment Commission
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) had agreed to approve AU Optronics Corps (AUO, )
application to invest in a new  LCD panel plant in China.

The review procedure for the case is now focusing on the completion of the regular paperwork, Wu told reporters after Hon Hai Group chairman Terry Gou complained on Friday that the government stands in the way of local flat panel makers plans to invest in China.

TD
It could be that chairman Gou had been out of the country for a long time so that he did not understand the progress of the case, Wu said.

However, the ministrys Investment Commission Executive Secretary Fan Liang-tung said by telephone yesterday that the commission had yet to finalize the review of AU Optronics planned US$3 billion investment in a 7.5-generation  LCD panel plant in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province.

I have no comment on the premiers remark, Fan told the Taipei Times. But what is clear now is that the commission will have to organize an inter--ministerial meeting to formally decide on the case.

The commission usually holds such inter-ministerial meetings once a month and its most recent meeting was held on Nov. 30.

Fan said it was difficult to say when the next such meeting would be held because it involves several government agencies.

AU Optronics, the nations second-largest  LCD panel maker after Chimei Innolux Corp by revenue, submitted its China investment proposal to the commission for approval in March, but had to resubmit the proposal later to meet government requirements.

Wu said the companys revised plan had met the two conditions for the government to decide whether to allow  LCD panel makers to invest in China.

The government only allows Taiwanese companies to set up production lines in China when their locally based panel production has more advanced technologies and when they promise not to scale down investments in Taiwan, he said.
The government did not delay the review of the application, Wu said.

The premier also dismissed Gous criticism that the government did not care about Taiwanese companies being ordered to pay a huge  fine by the European Commission.

The fact that Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou accompanied Guo and Chimei Innolux chairman Frank Liao to the European Economic and Trade Office on Friday demonstrated the government was concerned about the matter, Wu said.

The ministry yesterday said it planned to invite local panel makers and government agencies for a meeting next week to study how best to assist companies in response to the European Commissions price-fixing  allegations.

Five LCD manufacturers were weighing their options at week's end after the European Commission     
fined them $858.8 million for price-fixing.  The Commission issued the  fines late last week, capping a
four-year probe into price-fixing  for LCD panels in Europe. AU Optronics, which was  fined $154.8 million,
and LG Display ($284.5 million) were considering filing an appeal with the general court in Luxembourg.
Chimei Innolux, which plans to recognize a $396.3 million  fine on its Q4 balance sheet, said Friday it was
awaiting a copy of the ruling before deciding on an appeal. The  fine isn't covered by the $235.9 million
Chimei set aside for the case. Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar were  fined $11.9 million and $10.7
million. Nothing was levied against Samsung, which cooperated in the investigation.

HD     Latham & Watkins Picks Up Prominent DOJ Prosecutor

SAN FRANCISCO — Latham & Watkins has bagged prominent antitrust prosecutor Niall Lynch.

Lynch, who's been assistant chief of the Department of Justice's antitrust division in San Francisco for the past five years, will join Latham's San Francisco office as partner on Jan. 10.

TD
Observers say it's a big catch for the firm. Lynch joined the Department of Justice in 1995 from McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen where he was an associate. During his tenure, he has led or supervised the DOJ's merger, criminal and international  cartel cases.

"Niall is widely viewed as a star in the division, especially in the DRAM and LCD cases," Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton antitrust lawyer James McGinnis said. Those price-fixing  cases , he said, count
among the biggest and most successful in the antitrust division's history. "I think everyone would regard this as a coup for Latham." McGinnis said Sheppard didn't interview Lynch, citing probable conflicts: McGinnis represents a defendant in an ongoing probe of  LCD flat-panel suppliers. Lynch, speaking from Brussels where he spent the week meeting Latham's European competition lawyers, said he interviewed with at least 10 firms. He said after 15 years with the DOJ he was looking for a change. "I had a real breadth of experience at the Department of Justice," Lynch said. "Now I'm looking for new challenges."

He said his focus at Latham would be global, particularly on price-fixing  cases. Lynch said that last year, the DOJ brought in more than $1 billion in criminal  fines from international  cartel cases, which he expects will continue to be among top priorities.

Lynch said he chose Latham for its global reach, closely woven antitrust team and strong corporate group. "Latham has offices all over the world, which is really essential now in order to deal with cases being defended in five or six countries."

Michael Egge, a co-chairman of Latham's antitrust and competition practice group and a partner in the firm's Washington, D.C., office, said a seamless international antitrust team of lawyers is more important than ever. When the DOJ or the  European Commission open an investigation, it spreads like wildfire, he said. "In a world where a company could get raided in five different countries at once on the very same day, which is what's happening, you want to be able to represent your client by putting people and resources on the ground in all five places at once," he said. "Niall is a huge complement to this."

Conflict rules will prevent Lynch from working on any of his old cases, he said. Latham has represented defendants in DOJ investigations of the global air cargo industry and DRAM memory suppliers. Latham
has about 150 global antitrust and competition lawyers, with about 50 of them in California. San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Brussels are its biggest antitrust centers.

Lynch said there are six multidistrict litigation cases based in the Northern District of California that originated in the San Francisco office, including SRAM, Flash and optical disc drive-related matters, which he led or supervised. He said those will continue to be handled by the team he oversaw, which includes attorney Michael Scott and Peter Huston, a former Latham partner.

Lynch said the now-closed DRAM investigation led to more than $700 million in criminal  fines and 18 executives charged criminally around the world.

With a strong team that includes experienced lawyers like Houston, the DOJ should have no problem moving on after the loss of Lynch, said Sheppard's McGinnis. "I don't think there will even be a hiccup in the ongoing work," McGinnis said. "I think they will transition seamlessly."

And businesses can expect a solid new defender on their side. Berkeley white-collar defense lawyer Cristina Arguedas said there aren't that many people in the region who know the intricacies of antitrust law at Lynch's level of experience who move from the government office into private practice. "He will no
doubt be a tremendous asset to any company that's under investigation," she said. "He has had a lot of power in the position he's held in the government and he used it very effectively and very judiciously."
