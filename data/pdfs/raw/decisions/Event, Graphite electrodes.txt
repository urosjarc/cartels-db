The European Commission on Wednesday fined eight graphic electrode manufacturers for operating a secret cartel during the 1990's. SGL Carbon, the German manufacturer, and UCAR International of the US were hit by E218.8m ($188m) in  fines alongside six other companies.
The fines followed an EC investigation into allegations of  price fixing  and sharing the market for
graphite  electrodes.

TD
The electrodes are ceramic-moulded columns used in steel production. Eight electrode suppliers accounted for almost all global production.

The Commission said that the  cartel resulted in "considerably higher prices than if the companies had competed against each other". In addition to SGL Carbon and UCAR, the  European Commission said it had established that Tokai Carbon, Showa Denko, SEC Corporation and Nippon Carbon of Japan; Germany's VAW Aluminium AG; and Carbide  Graphite of the US had each participated in the  cartel between 1992 and 1998.

According to the  Commission, the companies held regular meetings - including at chief executive level - to agree concerted price increases.

The Commission said: "The companies were well aware that they were infringing antitrust law as they took great pains to conceal meetings, hotel and travel expenses were paid in cash with no explicit reference to those meetings in expense claims, to avoid keeping any written evidence of the meetings and agreements."

BRUSSELS, July 18 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday fined companies in
Japan, the United States and Germany a total of 219 million euros ($189 million) for conspiring to fix the
price of a critical component used to make more than one third of Europe's steel.

The overall fine against firms which make  graphite electrodes - ceramic moulded columns of  graphite mostly used to recycle scrap metal into new steel in electric arc furnaces - was the second largest ever imposed by the Commission in a cartel case.

TD
The Commission detailed the companies and  fines as follows: SGL Carbon of Germany 80.2 million
euros, UCAR International 50.4 million  euros, Japan's Tokai Carbon 24.5 million  euros, Showa Denko
17.4 million euros, VAW Aluminium 11.6 million euros, SEC Corp and Nippon Carbon each 12.2 million
euros, Carbide Graphite Group 10.3 million euros.
SGL Carbon was not immediately available for comment.
The largest  fine ever imposed by the EU was 273 million  euros in the Taca case in 1998, a  price-fixing
case involving shipping companies.

The leaders of the  cartel were SGL and UCAR, which started it in 1992. It ran to 1998, even after antitrust authorities began investigations, the  Commission said.

SGL and UCAR alone supply more than two-thirds of the European demand for graphite  electrodes. The electrodes are used in the production of 35 percent of Europe's steel, the Commission said.

The Commission said in a statement that chief executives agreed on prices at meetings, some of which were held in Switzerland.

"The companies were well aware that they were infringing antitrust law as they took great pains to conceal meetings," the  Commission said in a statement.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said that Showa Denko and had a very substantial reduction in its fine and others had significant reductions because they co-operated in the investigation.

The companies were convicted on similar charges in the United States, where  price-fixing is a criminal offense.

The United States levied more than $390 million in  fines, including a $134 million  fine against Mitsubishi Corp, which had a 50 percent interest in UCAR from 1991 to 1995. Mitsubishi was convicted at a trial.

In the United States, two executives were sentenced to prison in 2000. UCAR's former president was sentenced to 17 months and its former chief operating officer to nine months. They also paid  fines of
$1.25 million and $1 million respectively.

SGL Carbon said in a statement from Wiesbaden, Germany, that it would appeal against its  fine, calling it unjustified.

"The company strongly believes that there are procedural defects in this case and there (has) been double jeopardy which is not permitted by law," it said. "In 1999, the U.S. authorities already imposed a fine of $145 million against the company for the same conduct."

SGL's share price was down 12.68 percent at 31.000  euros at a new year low and well off its 72.80 year high set on February 6, compared with a 1.39 percent fall by the mid-cap MDAX index.

The EU noted that these  fines together were the second largest it has imposed against a group of companies for cartelisation. The largest fine ever imposed by the EU for the offence was 273 million euros in the Taca case in 1998, a price-fixing case involving shipping companies.

The companies were convicted on similar charges in the United States, where  price-fixing is a criminal offence.

MOSCOW - President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said Japan and Russia have made "substantial" progress in their territorial dispute but stopped short of saying how the issue would be resolved.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday hinted at further rate cuts, saying downside risks remain in the economy.

---------- Chirac cancels trip to Japan amid funding probe: Le Monde

PARIS - French President Jacques Chirac has canceled a one-week trip to Japan owing to pressure generated by an official inquiry into his alleged use of slush funds for private travel, the newspaper Le Monde said Wednesday.

University and to meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi before vacationing in Japan.
---------- Minke whales as fertile as 'cockroaches': Japanese official

TOKYO - A senior Japanese fishery official compared minke whales to "cockroaches" and the Fisheries Agency rose to his defense on Wednesday, saying the comparison was intended to illustrate that minke whales are highly fertile.

"The intent of the remarks is that minke whales have strong fertility and are not facing any danger of extinction," Shiro Yuge, councilor at the Fisheries agency, told a hastily arranged news conference Wednesday night. Masayuki Komatsu, a counsellor at the Fisheries Agency, reportedly called minke whales "cockroaches of the sea" in an interview with an Australian television station.
---------- Bureaucrats named amounts on padded invoices in limo fraud

TOKYO - The limousine company in a 22-million-yen fraud case involving the Foreign Ministry sent the ministry padded taxi invoices bearing amounts specified by two logistics bureaucrats, who were arrested Monday, police sources said Wednesday.

The sources quoted Hinomaru Limousine Co. executive Seiji Kobayashi, 60, also arrested, as telling interrogators that the company wrote the amounts on the invoices that the ministry officials, Hiromu Kobayashi, 45, and Tsutomu Okuma, 38, had specified.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001--UCAR International Inc. (NYSE: UCR) today announced that the  European Commission has issued its decision regarding its graphite  electrode antitrust investigation. Under the decision, the  Commission has assessed a fine of Euro 50.4 million (approximately USD 43 million) against UCAR resulting from the role of our former management in a graphite  electrode price fixing  cartel. Seven other  graphite  electrode producers were also  fined under the decision with fines ranging up to Euro 80.2 million (approximately USD 69 million). In mid-1998, we brought in a new management team in response to the antitrust investigations. The new team immediately implemented strict antitrust compliance policies and procedures. Since 1998, the new team also has acted expeditiously in settling antitrust liabilities and offered its full cooperation to the Commission in its investigations.

TD
As a result of the  fine, we will record a charge of USD 10 million in the 2001 second quarter. We are very pleased that this decision brings to a conclusion our last major pending antitrust liability.

From the initiation of its investigation, we have cooperated fully and continuously with the  Commission. As a result of our significant and early cooperation, our fine reflects a 40 percent reduction from the amount that otherwise would have been assessed. The Commission's policy is to negotiate appropriate terms of payment of antitrust  fines, including extended payment terms. Based on that policy and our recent discussions regarding payment terms with the  Commission, we believe that payment of the  fine will not interfere with the implementation of our business strategies or compliance with financial covenants in our credit agreement.

NASHVILLE -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission fined eight companies in the graphite  electrode market EUR218.8 million following an investigation of alleged illegal  cartel activity.

In a press release Wednesday, Ucar International Inc. (UCR) said it was fined $43 million for the role of its former management in the  graphite  electrode price fixing  cartel.

TD
Ucar received a 40% fine reduction for cooperating with the investigation, the company said, and will record a $10 million second quarter charge on the  fine.

The company said payment of the  fine won't hurt implementation of its business strategies or compliance with financial covenants in its credit agreement.
In mid-1998, Ucar brought in a new management in response to the antitrust investigations.

France Taps Merrill

TD
As Adviser on Sale
Of Lyonnais Stake

France's Finance Ministry has appointed investment bank Merrill Lynch as an adviser on the possible sale of the government's 10% stake in Credit Lyonnais, France's third-largest listed bank. A ministry official said the move is "to guide us in the strategic options" but doesn't "mean we are going to sell the stake by the end of the year." A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman, confirming the appointment, said the ministry hadn't given a date for a possible sale of the stake, valued at about 1.52 billion  euros ($1.31 billion). The government has made it clear it wants to eventually sell its stake in Credit Lyonnais, a formerly state-owned bank that came close to bankruptcy in the early 1990s. That has raised speculation that a sale will take place only after French presidential and parliamentary elections next spring.

French bank Societe Generale's chairman this year urged the government to auction off its Credit Lyonnais shares, saying a direct deal with rival Credit Agricole, a favorite to eventually take control of Credit Lyonnais, would be unfair.
U.K. Unemployment Continues to Fall

Britain's unemployment rate continued to decline in June, falling to a 25-year low of 3.2%, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment, as measured by International Labor Organization standards, also fell. The ILO measure, which includes people who aren't eligible for jobless benefits, declined by
82,000 people to 1.45 million in the three months ended May 31, leaving the jobless rate at 4.9%, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1984. But the number of manufacturing jobs fell by 105,000 to 3.8 million.
EU Fines 8 Companies for Cartel Activity

The European Commission fined eight companies in the  graphite  electrode market a total of 218.8 million euros ($188 million) following an investigation of alleged illegal  cartel activity by the companies. Graphite electrodes are ceramic-molded columns of  graphite  used primarily in the production of steel in electric furnaces. The  commission said the companies "operated a secret  cartel during most of the
'90s resulting in considerably higher prices than if the companies had competed against each other." The
commission's fines on the companies include: SGL Carbon, 80.2 million  euros; UCAR International,
50.4 million euros; Tokai Carbon, 24.5 million  euros; Showa Denko, 17.4 million euros; VAW
Aluminium, 11.6 million euros; SEC Corp. and Nippon Carbon, 12.2 million euros each; and Carbide
Graphite Group, 10.3 million euros. The U.S. Justice Department in the past two years brought similar
cases against the companies resulting in more than $300 million in  fines.

Exxon Mobil Aims at Indonesia Restart

Exxon Mobil was expected to restart the flow of natural gas from part of its Arun facilities in Indonesia's rebellion-torn Aceh province, four months after the company halted operations because of security concerns, an official of state-owned oil company Pertamina said. An Exxon spokeswoman declined to confirm Pertamina's statement, saying Exxon's "official word is we are still in preparations" for start-up. She said repair work and testing of equipment and pipelines are "ongoing" and "considerable amounts of repair work are needed" after a four-month shutdown.
Wahid Seeks Compromise to Avert Crisis

Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid predicted that he would reach a compromise with his opponents and avoid impeachment hearings. And his aides said Mr. Wahid was unlikely to go ahead with his threat to declare emergency rule tomorrow. But Indonesian lawmakers involved in talks this week with the embattled president said a deal to save Mr. Wahid from being ousted is far from certain.
"We are talking but there has been no commitment," said Akbar Tandjung, the Parliament's speaker and head of the Golkar party, the second largest bloc. Mr. Wahid said he had met with three of his main rivals in an effort to strike a deal so that lawmakers would drop efforts to oust him through impeachment hearings scheduled to begin Aug. 1. "There will be a compromise," Mr. Wahid was quoted as saying in Bali by state news agency Antara. Mr. Wahid last week said he would declare emergency rule at 6 p.m. tomorrow in Jakarta unless his rivals agreed to drop their impeachment drive. Police and military chiefs and key cabinet members have said they wouldn't support an emergency declaration that would enable Mr. Wahid to shut down the assembly and call early elections.
Renong, UEM Share Trading Suspended

Shares of Malaysia's Renong and its associate concern, United Engineers Malaysia, or UEM, were suspended from Malaysian trading, pending an announcement that people familiar with the situation said could involve a possible takeover bid for Renong by the government Monday. UEM, the country's largest construction group and owner of a 32.6% stake in Renong, requested that its shares be suspended for four days, pending the announcement of a major transaction. Renong controls a 37.1% interest in UEM.

Canada Capital Outlays Expected to Rise

Capital spending by Canadian businesses, governments and institutions is expected to increase 6.7% this year to a record 146.7 billion Canadian dollars (US$95.3 billion), Statistics Canada said. The increased investment in plant and equipment is being driven largely by proposed outlays in the oil and natural-gas extraction industries, which are expected to increase 26% this year to C$25.4 billion. If proposed investment in housing is included, total Canadian investment this year is expected to rise 6.3% to C$189.6 billion, a much stronger gain than the 1.7% rise in investment predicted in February. Investment in the information, communication and technology sectors is expected to increase 12.7%. But investment in the manufacturing sector is projected to fall 8.6% this year to C$19.4 billion.
Telmex's Earnings Nearly Double

Healthy domestic long-distance sales helped Mexican telephone giant Telefonos de Mexico shrug off the U.S. slowdown during the second quarter, but company officials said slowing international long-distance revenue could take a bigger bite out of third-quarter sales. Telmex on Tuesday reported a 93% increase in second-quarter profit from a year earlier to 6.48 billion pesos ($710 million), largely due to gains from lower inflation and savings from the peso's appreciation against the dollar. Sales rose 7.1% to 27.26 billion pesos. But pretax profit margins declined to 51.5% from 58%.

-- Dutch telecom company KPNQwest said it is unlikely to receive full payment, or even very much, for a
160 million euro ($137 million) fiber-optic network it built for Canada's 360Networks. The Canadian firm,
which this month filed for bankruptcy-court protection in Canada and the U.S., couldn't be reached for
comment.

-- Filanbanco, one of Ecuador's largest banks that was closed by the government on Tuesday, will pay back small depositors and employees partly by selling off credit-card assets, the government said.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION -  Commission slaps substantial  fines on eight companies for illicit agreement in the graphite  electrode sector.

Brussels, 18/07/2001 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the EuropeanCommission imposed fines representing a total of 218.8 million euro on eight companies which, between 1992 and 1998, participated in a cartel in which they fixed prices and shared out the  graphite  electrode market.

TD
The companies concerned are (in parenthesis the amount of the  fine in euro): SGL Carbon AG (Germany
80.2 million), UCAR International Inc. (United States: 50.4 million), Tokai Carbon Co, Ltd (Japan: 24.5
million), Showa Denko K.K. (Japan: 17.4 million); VAW Aluminium A.G. (Germany; 11.6 million), SEC
Corporation (Japan: 12.2 million), Nippon Carbon co. ltd (Japan 12.2 million) and The Carbide  Graphite
Group Inc. (United States: 10.3 million). The  Commission established that the cartel had begun in 1992
on the instigation of SGL and UCAR, which together cover two-thirds of European demand, and that it
continued until 1998, despite investigations undertaken by the anti-trust authorities in the United States,
Canada and the EU. During the time of the cartel, prices for graphite electrodes increased by 50%.
Commenting on the decision, Mario Monti, European Commissioner responsible for competition,
considered that: "the substantial  fines imposed in this case are warranted in the light of the particular
gravity of the infringement (...) and intended to dissuade companies from engaging in similar illegal
practices in future". "At the same time, by granting a very substantial reduction in the fine imposed on
Showa Denko and significant reductions to several other companies, the Commission shows that it takes
proper account of companies' cooperation in uncovering cartels", he added.
Graphic electrodes are mainly used in the production of steel for steel in electric furnaces.

PITTSBURGH -- Eight companies in Japan, the United States and Germany were hit Wendesday with fines totaling 219 million  euros ($188 million) for conspiring to fix the price, of  graphite electrodes, a key consumable used to produce more than, one-third of  Europe's steel.

The penalty imposed by the European Commission is the second-largest overall  fine for price-fixing against firms producing graphiteelectrodes, which are used primarily to recycle scrap metal into molten steel in electricarc furnaces.

TD
The fines imposed by the European Commission included: SGL Carbon, Wiesbaden, Germany, 80.2 million euros ($68.9 million); Ucar International Inc., Nashville, Tenn., 50.4 million  euros ($43.3 million); Tokai Carbon Co., Showa Denko KK's U.S. unit, 24.5 million  euros ($21 million); Showa Denko, 17.4 million euros ($14.9-million); VAW Aluminum AG, Bonn, Germany, $11.6 million  euros ($10 million); SEC Corp. and Nippon Carbon Co., Ltd., 12.2 million  euros ($ 10.5 million) apiece; and Carbide Graphite Group, Pittsburgh, 10.3 million  euros ($8.8 million).

Earlier this year, a U.S. investigation into graphite  electrodes resulted in the conviction of six companies and more than $300 million in criminal fines for price-fixing beginning in 1998. Mitsubishi Corp. was found guilty in February of aiding the price-fixing cartel for graphite  electrodes as a result
of the U.S. investigation. Nearly half of the steel in the United States is made using graphite  electrodes.

The largest fine ever imposed by the European Commission was 273 million euros ($234.5 million) in a price-fixing case involving ocean carriers.

LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday it had upgraded its rating on German graphite  maker SGL Carbon AG to "accumulate" from "neutral" and gave a price target of 45  euros for the stock.
Merrill's upgrade followed the European Commission's decision to  fine SGL 80.2 million  euros
($70.10 million) for price-fixing, which the company said on Wednesday it would appeal.

"In our view, the share price has fallen excessively on this news. Although there are some near term risks (mainly in the U.S.),  European trading appears stable (with price increases)."
"On the basis of today's news, we have not changed our forecasts," they added. Shares in SGL were up one percent at 31.12  euros by 1056 GMT.

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined companies in Japan, the U.S. and Germany a total of 219 million euros for conspiring to fix the price of a critical component used to make more than one third of Europe's steel.

The overall fine against firms that make  graphite electrodes -- ceramic molded columns of  graphite mostly used to recycle scrap metal into new steel in electric arc furnaces -- was the second largest ever imposed by the commission in a cartel case.

TD
Germany's SGL Carbon AG was  fined 80.2 million euros, while U.S.-based UCAR International Inc. has to pay 50.4 million euros. Japan's Tokai Carbon Co. and Showa Denko KK were fined 24.5 million euros and 17.4 million euros, respectively. VAW Aluminium AG of Germany was fined 11.6 million euros, while Japan-based SEC Corp. and Nippon Carbon Co. each were told to pay 12.2 million  euros. Carbide Graphite Group Inc. of the U.S. was  fined 10.3 million euros.

"This decision is a further signal that the  commission will apply the full force of the law on hardcore cartels,"  European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said. "The substantial  fines imposed in this case are not only warranted in light of the particular gravity of the infringement, but also intend to dissuade companies from engaging in similar illegal practices in the future."
The largest fine ever imposed by the EU was 273 million  euros in the Taca case in 1998, a
price-fixing case involving shipping companies.

Showa Denko cooperated with the commission's investigation, which began in June 1997. Showa benefited from a 70% reduction in its fine under the commission's leniency rules since it was the first company to cooperate and provide "decisive evidence of the cartel."
UCAR, which also cooperated with the investigation, was granted a 40% reduction in its  fine.

The leaders of the  cartel were SGL and UCAR, which started it in 1992. It ran to 1998, even after antitrust authorities began investigations, the  commission said.

SGL and UCAR alone supply more than two-thirds of the European demand for graphite electrodes. The electrodes are used in the production of 35% of Europe's steel.

The commission said chief executives agreed on prices at meetings, some of which were held in Switzerland. "The companies were well aware that they were infringing antitrust law as they took great pains to conceal meetings," the  commission said.
The companies were convicted on similar charges in the U.S., where  price-fixing is a criminal offense. The U.S. levied more than $390 million (454 million  euros) in fines, including a $134 million  fine
against Mitsubishi Corp., which had a 50% interest in UCAR from 1991 to 1995. Mitsubishi was
convicted at a trial.

In the U.S., two executives were sentenced to prison in 2000. UCAR's former president was sentenced to 17 months and its former chief operating officer to nine months. They also paid  fines of $1.25 million and $1 million respectively.

HD         Commission gives whistleblowers a cash reason to talk. BY         By Andrew Osborn in Brussels.

A new front in Europe's increasingly bitter war against  price-fixing cartels was opened yesterday after the European Commission announced radical proposals to grant corporate whistleblowers immunity from its often crippling punitive  fines.

The move is highly significant as Brussels has the power to  fine corporate wrong-doers up to 10% of their annual turnover. If firms needed a reminder of this they got one yesterday when the  commission handed down fines totalling a cool #164m. `The challenge in attacking hard-core cartels is to penetrate their cloak of secrecy, which is all the greater when the profits and risk of stiff penalties are significant,' said Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner.

TD
`This fight can produce better results if companies are given a greater incentive to de nounce this kind of collusion.'

To qualify for immunity companies must be the first to alert Brussels to undetected cartels, and will also need to provide commission investigators with enough evidence to warrant a series of dawn raids.

Companies which cooperate once an investigation is underway, providing extra `value-added' evidence of wrongdoing, will be rewarded by reductions in their  fines of up to 50%.

Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Maersk Air felt the full weight of the  commission's price-fixing wrath yesterday when they were hit with  fines of #24m and #8m apiece for illegally carving up the lucrative Copenhagen to Stockholm route for the last two years.

Brussels said they had made a secret pact not to compete on the route which had operated since 1998, to the detriment of 1m passengers a year. Denmark's Maersk Air had, it claimed, agreed to withdraw from the Copenhagen-Stockholm route in exchange for SAS pulling the plug on its Copenhagen-Venice and Frankfurt-Billund runs.
`This is a clear case of two airlines sharing markets illegally to the detriment of passengers,' said Mr
Monti. `I trust that the  fines imposed...will serve as a deterrent.'
Separately eight German, Japanese and US makers of  graphite electrodes were yesterday fined
#132m for oper ating an illegal  cartel during the 1990s, which resulted in higher prices for the product.

In the last five years firms have chosen to cooperate with the  commission in over 20 cartel cases, and since 1998 Brussels has handed down  fines totalling over #600m for various price-fixing offences.

Officials said yesterday they hoped the new rules on whistleblowers will come into force by the end of this year, after a statutory consultation period.

Tokyo, July 19 (Jiji Press) - Japan's Showa Denko K.K. said Thursday it has been ordered by the European Commission to pay a fine of 17.4 million  euros for allegedly operating a  graphite electrode cartel.

The commission, the executive body of the European Union, suspects that the Showa Denko group had a price cartel for artificial graphite  electrodes between May 1992 and April 1997, the Tokyo-based major chemical maker said.

TD
Showa Denko said it will decide how to respond to the  commission's order after examining the allegation.
Two other Japanese firms also said the  commission ordered them to pay  fines over the graphite
electrode cartel.
Tokai Carbon Co. was ordered to pay 24.5 million  euros, and SEC Corp. 12.2 million  euros.[4]

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2001--UCAR International Inc. (NYSE:UCR) today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2001. Income before special charges was $6 million, or
$0.13 per diluted share, for the 2001 second quarter as compared to $3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share for the 2001 first quarter and $11 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the 2000 second quarter. Net sales were $171 million in the 2001 second quarter, the same as in the 2001 first quarter and down 14 percent as compared to the 2000 second quarter. Gross margin was 29.9 percent for the 2001 second quarter as compared to 28.5 percent for the 2001 first quarter and 28.1 percent for the 2000 second quarter.

TD
We are very pleased with our 2001 second quarter results. We continued to reduce our production costs, improving our gross margin to 29.9 percent, despite difficult economic conditions. Our  Graphite Power Systems (GPS) Division increased its gross margin to 29.8 percent for the 2001 second quarter from 27.4 percent in the 2001 first quarter primarily due to plant cost reductions and productivity improvements, while our Advanced Energy Technology Division had gross margin of 31.2 percent for the 2001 second quarter. We also achieved continued reductions in both overhead and interest expense primarily due to our efforts to streamline global work processes and maintain tight working capital management to reduce net debt.

We achieved a major milestone in the 2001 second quarter with the signing of a new exclusive development and collaboration agreement and a new exclusive long-term supply agreement with Ballard Power Systems for natural  graphite-based  materials and manufactured components for use in Ballard(R) fuel cells and fuel cell systems, announced in June 2001.

GRAPHITE POWER SYSTEMS DIVISION

Our Graphite Power Systems Division had net sales of $137 million in the 2001 second quarter as compared to $170 million in the 2000 second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume of graphite  electrodes sold. Graphite electrode volume for the 2001 second quarter was 46 thousand metric tons. Although graphite  electrode volume increased seven percent as compared to the 2001 first quarter, it was lower than typical historical second quarter volumes. The decrease in volume in the 2001 second quarter as compared to the 2000 second quarter was primarily a result of continued lower North American steel production and our selectivity in selling in the U.S. market to minimize bad debt exposure. Our
average sales revenue per metric ton of graphiteelectrodes in the 2001 second quarter was $2,367, essentially the same as the 2000 second quarter average of $2,374, while the average was down $52 from the 2001 first quarter due to the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Our announced increases in local currency selling prices have been sustained in the 2001 second quarter. Net sales of cathodes in the 2001 second quarter were lower than in the 2000 second quarter primarily due to the timing of shipments to customers. Our cathode business order book remains sold out for 2001.

Gross margin in our GPS Division increased to 29.8 percent in the 2001 second quarter from 28.7 percent in the 2000 second quarter despite significantly lower net sales and higher energy costs. The increase was due to improvements in both our  graphite  electrode and cathode businesses. Our  graphite  electrode business benefited from improved productivity, head-count reductions, lower major maintenance spending and lower costs due to the weakening of local currencies in the countries in which we have foreign manufacturing facilities as compared to the U.S. dollar in the 2001 second quarter as compared to the 2000 second quarter. Our cathode business benefited from efficiencies as a result of our global realignment of cathode capacity and from cost improvements. Gross margin in our GPS Division increased to 29.8 percent

Page 33 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in the 2001 second quarter from 27.4 percent in the 2001 first quarter primarily due to plant cost reductions, improvements in energy costs and lower costs due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

In addition, in the 2001 second quarter we announced our intention to shut down our  graphite  electrode manufacturing operations in Clarksville and Columbia, TN, our highest cost  graphite  electrode manufacturing operations. The shutdown is part of our strategy of reducing costs and optimizing global production capacity. We expect that the shutdown will result in annual cost savings of $18 million beginning in 2002 and will enable us to avoid $9 million in otherwise necessary capital expenditures. The shutdown is on schedule for completion by the end of the 2001 third quarter.
ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGY DIVISION

Net sales for our Advanced Energy Technology Division were $34 million in the 2001 second quarter, 17 percent higher than net sales of $29 million in the 2000 second quarter. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of products to customers in the aerospace and fuel cell industries and new sales of technology, partially offset by cyclical declines in sealing products sold to the automotive industry. Gross margin was 31.2 percent in the 2001 second quarter, up 7.4 percentage points from 23.8 percent in the 2000 second quarter as a result of the increase in net sales and continued improvement in cost of sales due to the restructuring of our  graphite  specialties business.
Our accomplishments in the 2001 second quarter include the following:
-- We entered into a new exclusive development and collaboration agreement and a new exclusive long-term supply agreement with Ballard Power Systems. The new agreements extend the scope and term of our prior agreements. The scope of the new exclusive development and collaboration agreement includes natural

graphite-based  materials and components, including flow field
plates and gas diffusion layers, for use in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and fuel cell systems for transportation, stationary and portable applications. The
development and collaboration agreement was extended from 2002 to 2011. Under the new supply agreement, we will be the
exclusive manufacturer and supplier of natural  graphite-based materials for Ballard(R)fuel cells and fuel cell systems. We
will also be the exclusive manufacturer of natural

graphite-based  components for Ballard fuel cells and fuel cell
systems, other than those components Ballard manufactures for itself. The supply agreement was extended from 2008 to 2016. We have the right to manufacture and sell, after agreed upon release dates, natural  graphite-based  materials and components for use in PEM fuel cells to other parties in the fuel cell
industry.
-- Ballard Power Systems became a strategic investor in Graftech, investing $5 million in shares of Ballard common stock for a
2.5% equity ownership interest, to support the development and
commercialization of natural  graphite-based  materials and
Page 34 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
components for PEM fuel cells.
-- The rate of patent application filings continued to accelerate. We filed 29 patent applications and were issued seven patents in the 2001 second quarter. This compares to 16 patent applications and six issued patents in the 2000 second quarter. The new patent applications and issued patents primarily relate to the electronic thermal management and fuel cell industries. The 2001 second quarter activity increased
total patent applications and patent application priority rights to more than 270 and total issued patents to 142.
-- Our advanced flexible  graphite  line for fuel cell component manufacturing is in the final stages of commissioning and is expected to begin production in early August 2001. CORPORATE
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $19 million in the 2001 second quarter as compared to
$23 million in the 2000 second quarter. Intensive management of these expenses since 1998 has reduced
the quarterly run rate from approximately $28 million at the end of 1997 to an expected quarterly run rate of
under $20 million in the second half of 2001.

Interest expense declined $2 million in the 2001 second quarter as compared to the 2000 second quarter. The decrease was due to both lower average debt outstanding during the period and lower interest rates.

Our effective tax rate, excluding special charges, was 45 percent for the first half of 2001 as compared to our average effective tax rate, excluding special charges, of 30 percent for the full year 2000, primarily due to a higher percent of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.
We had $6 million in income before special charges and a loss of $39 million after special charges for the
2001 second quarter as compared to $11 million of income before and after special charges for the 2000
second quarter. In the 2001 second quarter, a $68 million, pre-tax, special charge was recorded. $58
million ($35 million after-tax) of the special charge was recorded for restructuring and asset impairment
related to the shut down of our  graphite  electrode manufacturing operations in Clarksville and Columbia,
TN. $10 million (before and after tax) of the special charge was recorded to increase our reserve for
potential liabilities and expenses for antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims. After the
special charges, we had a loss of $0.87 per basic share for the 2001 second quarter as compared with
earnings per share of $0.24 in the 2000 second quarter.

Net cash used in operations (before antitrust  fines and net settlements and related expenses and restructuring payments) was $9 million in the 2001 second quarter as compared to net cash generated by operations of $25 million (before antitrust  fines and net settlements and related expenses and restructuring payments) in the 2000 second quarter. The use of cash resulted primarily from increased working capital levels necessary for the GPS Division.  Graphite electrode inventory levels increased primarily due to transitioning activities in connection with the shutdown of  graphite  electrode manufacturing operations and raw material inventory levels increased due to additional petroleum coke purchases in connection with the explosion at Conoco's Humberside facility in mid-April 2001. Conoco is one of our major petroleum coke suppliers. We continue to place a very high priority on managing our worldwide free cash flow. Our net debt (total debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments) was $660 million at the end of the 2001 second quarter as compared to $659 million at the end of the 2001 first quarter.

As previously announced, the  European Commission has issued its decision regarding its graphite electrode antitrust investigation. Under the decision, the  Commission has assessed a fine of Euro 50.4 million (approximately $43 million) against UCAR resulting from the role of our former management in a graphite  electrode price fixing  cartel. As a result of our significant and early cooperation with the Commission, our fine reflects a 40 percent reduction from the amount that otherwise would have been assessed. Seven other  graphite  electrode producers were also  fined under the decision, with  fines
ranging up to Euro 80.2 million (approximately $69 million). As a result of the  fine, we recorded a charge of

$10 million in the 2001 second quarter. The  Commission's policy is to negotiate appropriate terms of payment of antitrust  fines, including extended payment terms. Based on that policy and our recent discussions regarding payment terms with the  Commission, we believe that payment of the  fine will not interfere with the implementation of our business strategies or compliance with financial covenants in our credit agreement.

HD   SCRAP INDUSTRY - COMMISSION SETS EURO 219 MILLION FINE ON ELECTRODE CARTEL. WC   417 words

Eight graphite  electrode companies have been fined a total of  Euro 218.8 million by the  European           Commission for operating as a  cartel. The Commission claims that German company SGL Carbon AG and the US business UCAR International along with Tokai Carbon Co Ltd, Showa Denko KK, SEC Corporation, Nippon Carbon Co Ltd (which are all based in Japan), VAW Aluminium AG of Germany and The Carbide Graphite Group Inc of the US fixed the price for graphite  electrodes. The companies were found to have also shared out the market for these products in a cartel that operated from 1992, when
SGL and UCAR created it, until 1998. The fine, which is the second highest in the  Commission's history, was imposed on the same day as the Commission announced new rules for companies whistle-blowing about cartels, July 18 (see article in same Section).

TD
Graphite electrodes are used, in the main, to recycle scrap steel into new steel in electric arc furnaces, which are also called "mini mills". This process creates around 35% of steel production in the  European Union. The market, including Norway, was valued at  Euro 420 million in 1998. The  cartel's culpability was highlighted, the  Commission claims, by the habit of the companies meeting in secret, using code names in their dealings with each other and paying for expenses incurred by their meetings with cash only."This decision is a further signal that the  Commission will apply the full force of the law on hardcore cartels,"
said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "The substantial  fines imposed in this case are not only warranted in light of the particular gravity of the infringement, but also intend to dissuade companies from engaging in similar illegal practices in the future. At the same time, by granting a very substantial reduction in the fine imposed on Showa Denko and significant reductions to several other companies the Commission shows that it takes proper account of companies' co-operation in uncovering cartels, which are the worst kind of violation of competition rules."The total  fine breaks down as follows with SGL and UCAR receiving penalties that are substantially higher than the other  cartel members at Euro 80.2 million and Euro 50.4 million respectively. Tokai Carbon was fined Euro 25.4 million, Showa Euro 17.4 million, SEC and Nippon Carbon both  Euro 12. 2 million, VAW Euro 11.6 million and Carbide Euro 10.3 million.

Tokyo, July 21 (Jiji Press) - Nippon Carbon Co. was Thursday ordered by the European Commission to pay 12.2 million  euros in penalty for forming a price  cartel on artificial graphite electrodes, the company said late Friday night.

Nippon Carbon said it is examining how to respond to the order, and added that it may make an appeal to the  European Court of Justice for withdrawal of the order.

TD
Nippon Carbon is among the eight companies that face fines by the EuropeanCommission for allegedly engaging in a worldwide  cartel on artificial graphite  electrodes, which are used primarily in the recycling of steel scraps into new steel in electric furnaces.


The eight includes three other Japanese companies, namely Show Denko K.K. , Tokai Carbon Co.  and SEC Corp.       .[4]

In the same week that it announced one of the heftiest  fines ever imposed on an illegal cartel, the
European Commission proposed the adoption of an American trust-busting practice.

The commission proposed guaranteeing total immunity to the first company in an illegal combination to come forward with evidence. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, said the intent of the measure was to enable his investigators to "penetrate the cloak of secrecy" around such cartels.

TD
A cartel is an agreement between two or more companies to rig prices or assign markets, often using highly sophisticated means to conceal their traces.

In the United States, the Justice Department's antitrust division has a carrot-and-stick policy. It can send executives of companies involved in cartels to jail, a power that the multinational  commission does not have. And it guarantees immunity to the first company in a  cartel to inform on its partners.

Since 1996, the commission also has had a leniency program, providing for the reduction or elimination of fines against cooperating companies, but it does not offer the absolute guarantees available to firms in the United States.

At a recent meeting of competition lawyers in Brussels, Mr. Monti was told that the U.S. leniency policy had been instrumental in enabling the antitrust division to impose more than $1.7 billion in criminal fines since 1997.

This week, the  commission announced total  fines of nearly 219 million ($191 million) against eight companies involved in an effort to fix the price and control the market for  graphite electrodes used in the steel industry.

Under its existing leniency program, the  commission granted a 70 percent reduction of the fine imposed on a Japanese company, Showa Denko KK, for having been the first member of the cartel to cooperate and provide decisive evidence to the  commission.

The eight companies, headed by SGL Carbon AG of Germany and UCAR International Inc. of the United States, were  fined almost $300 million in the United States for the same offenses, and two former executives of UCAR were jailed.

Mr. Monti said the EU's existing leniency rules have been instrumental in uncovering and punishing secret cartels, with  fines running up to more than 270 million. He said it now appears "that this fight can produce better results if companies are given a greater incentive to denounce this kind of collusion."

Mr. Monti this week proposed to grant complete immunity from  fines to the first company to inform the commission of an undetected  cartel and provide sufficient information to instigate one of the commission's "dawn raids," such as the search for evidence at the offices of nine  European
mobile-phone operators last week.

The commissioner, who this month thwarted General Electric Co.'s attempt to acquire Honeywell International Inc., said he also was prepared to modify the policy on reduction of fines to give bigger rewards to companies that hand over "added value" evidence to the commission.

He said his proposal does not in any way entail a more lenient approach to the fight against anti-competitive practices.

"On the contrary," he said, "the increased likelihood of cartels being detected and the  commission's determination to impose  fines that hurt should deter companies from entering into collusive behavior in the first place."

PITTSBURGH -- Eight companies in Japan, the United States and Germany were hit Wednesday with fines totaling 219 million  euros ($188 million) for conspiring to fix the price of  graphite electrodes, a key consumable used to produce more than one-third of Europe's steel. The penalty imposed by the European Commission is the second-largest overall fine for price-fixing against firms producing graphite  electrodes, which are used primarily to recycle scrap metal into molten steel in electric-arc furnaces.

Brussels fines electrode cartel e219m

The European Commission has levied fines totalling e219m against eight  graphite  electrode companies for anti-competitive behaviour. The companies are charged with operating a  cartel in the EU and Norway between 1992 and 1998.

TD
The companies fined as part of the  cartel are SGL Carbon and VAW Aluminium of Germany; Ucar International and Carbide/Graphite Group of the USA; Tokai Carbon, Showa Denko, SEC Corp and Nippon Carbon all of Japan.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "The substantial  fines imposed in this case are not only warranted in light of the particular gravity of the infringement, but also intend to dissuade companies from engaging in similar illegal practices in the future."

The latest ruling follows similar action in the USA where a 1998/9 investigation resulted in the conviction of Ucar, SGL and the four Japanese companies and more than $300m in criminal  fines for price-fixing, while in February Mitsubishi Corp was found guilty in the USA of aiding the  cartel.

A spokeswoman at the  European Independent Steel Association, which represents the majority of European mini-mills, told MB that this is a very important step. She said that it is likely that European mini-mills will follow their US counterparts in suing for damages, particularly in light of the Commission finding that prices of  graphite electrodes increased by 50% while the cartel was in operation. In April
1998 Nucor settled out of court, having filed against its suppliers of graphite  electrode seeking $85m in damages (MB Apr 14 1998).

SGL, which has received the lion's share of the European fine (e80.2m), has already announced its intention to appeal the ruling to the  European Court. Carbide/Graphite has also indicated it intends to appeal the ruling. The other US company involved, Ucar, is taking the opposite stance. In a statement Ucar said: "We are very pleased that this decision brings to a conclusion our last major pending anti-trust liability."

Jul 23, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - By Mai Iida

Tokyo, July 23 (BridgeNews) - The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 2.5% on Monday, setting a new closing low since the Japanese "bubble economy" burst. The index was weighed down by increased concerns over the prospects for the high-tech sector following a disappointing earnings outlook from Microsoft, together with persistent wariness about the weak Japanese economy. The benchmark index fell 298.76 points to close at 11,609.63, below its mid-March closing low of 11,819.70.

The Nikkei 225 Sep futures contract closed down 350 points or 2.9% at 11,570 on the Osaka Securities
Exchange (OSE).

The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) fell 2.6%, or 31.49 points to 1,163.76, with decliners overwhelming advancers 1107 to 262 and 91 issues unchanged on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Volume on the First Section totaled an estimated 637.5 million shares, compared to a 10-day average of
614.0 million shares.

"Given the string of disappointing profit outlooks from the U.S. technology sector, investors are worried whether we're over the worst of it and remain cautious about the outlook for July-September," said Harushige Kobayashi, strategist at Meiko National Securities Co.

High-tech shares came under pressure ahead of earnings reports from major U.S. names like Lucent Technologies Inc. and JDS Uniphase following a disappointing outlook for the current quarter from Microsoft.

Investors are also cautiously awaiting the release of quarterly results by Japanese firms, including Sony and NEC this week.

Despite low expectations, traders were also disappointed that there were absolutely no market-moving leads from the G8 summit in Genoa over the weekend.

In the technology sector, Sony Corp. fell 2.0% to 7020 yen, Fujitsu Ltd. declined 3.7% to 1115 yen, Hitachi Ltd. lost 3.0% to 1019 yen, Toshiba Corp. shed 2.9% to 574 yen and NEC Corp. was down 1.6% to 1526 yen.
Large cap telecom shares also lost ground, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone NTT, down 6.1% to
617,000 yen and NTT DoCoMo Inc. slumping 5.5% to 1,710,000 yen.

Banks bore the brunt of the selling as investors worried that falling stock prices would increase the unrealized losses in the sector. Mizuho Holdings Inc. slumped 7.3% to 421,000 yen, UFJ Holdings dropped 7.9% to 528,000 yen and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group plummeted 8.1% to 889,000 yen.

Mycal Corp. a struggling supermarket chain operator fell 2.8% to 103 yen, declining for the fourth consecutive session.
Food, electrical power and gas, pharmaceutical issues were also among the decliners.

"Domestic demand related issues, which have been bucking against the recent downward pressure, were also weighed down today on concerns about the outlook for the economy," Ryuichi Endo, managing director at Japan Investment Trust Management Co. said.

Traders and strategists are now focused on whether the benchmark can remain above the Mar 15 intraday low of 11,433.88, after closing at its lowest level since Jan 7, 1985 on Monday.

MAJOR MOVERS ON THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE

Bridgestone Corp. hit limit down at 1073 yen-a 15.7% decline-on news that U.S. federal safety officials are pushing the company's U.S. subsidiary Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to recall millions more potentially unsafe Firestone tires.

Bridgestone president Shigeo Watanabe said Monday that the U.S. authorities' order for a further recall is not acceptable and the company is resolved to challenge in court any compulsory recall of its Firestone tires in the U.S.

Bridgestone/Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires last August after determining they had a high rate of failure. Since then, federal safety officials have been reviewing the safety of millions of other Firestone tires.

Audio equipment maker Aiwa Co. also declined sharply after a report that the company's shareholders have abandoned their right to purchase new shares because of the low offer price. Aiwa tumbled 12.3% or 66 yen to 470 yen, below its planned issue price of 530 yen.

Aiwa Co. announced during afternoon trade that the company will raise 7.5 billion yen via a private placement of 14.2 million new shares with its parent Sony Corp.

Nippon Carbon Co., one of Japan's major graphite  electrodes manufacturers, tumbled 10.8% or 13 yen to 107 yen after the EuropeanCommission decided last week to fine the company 12.2 million  euros
for price-fixing and carving up the market for graphite  electrodes used in steel production.

Similarly, Showa Denko K.K., Tokai Carbon Co. and SEC Corp. were also punished by the  European    Commission.

Investors are growing exceedingly cautious about upcoming quarterly earnings reports for Japanese firms as U.S. shares have gotten a beating ta following earnings announcements from that nation's major firms, said Yutaka Miura, general manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities Co.

In New York, shares declined Friday as a parade of disappointing profit outlooks from the technology sector lent a negative tone to trading. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 33.35, or 0.31%, to 10,576.65 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 17.22, or 0.84%, to 2029.37. The S&P 500 was down 4.17, or 0.34%, to 1210.85.

Mitsuo Shimizu, equity division deputy general manger at Cosmo Securities Co. said, "it is really hard to be optimistic about the future course of the high tech sector considering the high inventory levels."

The absence of fresh political measures such as economy boosting measures also limited investors buying interests, Shimizu said. "Investors are skeptical any substantial steps for the economy will emerge after the Upper House election," he said.

Among high tech bellwethers, Sony Corp. fell 2.0% to 7020 yen, Fujitsu Ltd. declined 3.0% to 1123 yen, Hitachi Ltd. lost 3.6% to 1012 yen, Toshiba Corp. slumped 3.9% to 568 yen and NEC Corp. shed 2.3% to 1515 yen.

Banks drew heavy selling after Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reiterated his aim to solve the problem of non-performing loans within the next 2-3 years at the close of the G8 summit in Genoa, Italy.
Mizuho Holdings Inc. plunged 9.5% to 411,000 yen, UFJ Holdings slumped 8.9% to 522,000 yen and
Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group declined 7.3% to 897,000 yen.

Bridgestone Corp. ended the session ask-only due to flood of sell orders triggered by news that U.S. federal safety officials are pushing the company's U.S. subsidiary Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to recall millions more potentially unsafe Firestone tires.
Shigeo Watanabe, president of Bridgestone Corp. was due to hold a press conference at 1100 JT in
Tokyo, spokesman said.

Bridgestone/Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires last August after determining they had a high rate of failure. Since then, federal safety officials have been reviewing the safety of millions of other Firestone tires.

The EU Commission has fined eight companies a total of  Euro 219m for operating a worldwide price cartel for electrodes used in EAF's for most of the 1990s. The principal companies  fined include Germany's SGL Carbon, and the USA's UCAR International. They supplied some two thirds of  European demand, says the  Commission.

The other six companies  fined were Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd. (Japan), Showa Denko K.K. (Japan), VAW Aluminium AG(Germany), SEC Corporation (Japan), Nippon Carbon Co. Ltd. (Japan) and The Carbide Graphite Group Inc. (USA).

"Top guy" meetings of chief executives, often in Switzerland, agreed concerted price increases. These wereusually triggered by the "home producer" or market leader, and then followed in other parts of the world, says the  Commission.

Few documents from the  cartel exist. Those that do used code names to refer to the  cartel participants, suchas "BMW" for SGL, "Pinot" for UCAR and "Cold" for the group of Japanese companies, says the Commission.

Cytec to Acquire BP's Carbon Fiber Unit

Cytec Industries has signed a definitive agreement to acquire BP's carbon fiber business; terms were not disclosed. The deal includes manufacturing sites in Greenville and Rock Hill, SC. The business had
first-half sales of $17 million, of which 50% were sales to Cytec's Fiberite subsidiary. Fiberite uses carbon fiber to produce aerospace composites. The deal "ensures that Cytec has a high-quality, low-cost, uninterrupted supply of carbon fiber," says David Lilley, chairman, president, and CEO of Cytec. Completion of the deal is expected in about 40 days, and should be "slightly dilutive" to the company's
2001 earnings and modestly accretive in 2002, says Lilley. Fiberite was the only one of Cytec's businesses to report an earnings gain in the second quarter (CW, July 25, p. 12).

Former Advisor Panel Takes Parting Shot at ACC

Former members of the Responsible Care public advisory panel, which ACC recently disbanded, have issued a "valedictory message" expressing doubts about ACC's plan to create a new panel to advise ACC president and CEO Fred Webber (CW July 4/11, p. 26). "We wonder if the proposed new structure of
public advice-- and the broader changes represented by the Good Chemistry campaign-are any more than a reorganization under an old way of thinking," says the group. "We see the need to move to a new way of thinking, informed by the concept of sustainability. Our experience indicates that, after 12 years, ACC has still not recognized the need for the panel, and the public in general, to become an integral and important part of ACC functioning, necessary for the industry's ability to gain and maintain public confidence."
ISK, Ibiden Executives lndicted for  Price Fixing

A federal grand jury in Philadelphia has indicted Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha (ISK) and three of its executives on price-fixing charges, says the Department of Justice (DOJ). It alleges that ISK and the executives conspired to fix the price of magnetic iron oxide particles, used to make video and audio tape, from
1991-1998. The indictment names Takashi Akizawa, ISK's former president; Atuso Kinoshita, managing director of ISK and chairman of ISK Magnetics; and Yoshiaki Tsujimura, ISK's deputy general manager. William L. Girvin, former president of ISK Magnetics, pleaded guilty to participation in the conspiracy in May 1999. Meanwhile, three executives from Ibiden (Ogaki, Japan) were separately indicted for participating in a  cartel to fix the price of isotactic  graphite,  used to make  electrodes. Ibiden pleaded guilty to its role in the conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution of the individual defendants. Carbone of America Industries and Toyo Tanso were previously  fined for fixing the price of isotactic  graphite.
CSB Probes Explosion at Motiva's Delaware Refinery

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) says it has dispatched a six-member team to investigate the July 17 blast at a spent sulfuric acid storage tank at Motiva's Delaware City, DE site. Eight people were injured and one contract employee is still missing (CW July 25, p. 16). Motiva said in a letter to government agencies last week that the collapsed tank was overdue for inspection, had open work orders to repair a hole, had been recommended for removal from service, and had previous vapor and liquid releases. "Obviously CSB is extremely interested in the conditions that existed prior to this catastrophic failure," says board member Andrea Kidd Taylor. About 660,000 gals of acid have been released so far, according to an estimate from Motiva, says CSB.

Astaris Drops PWA Project as Agrifos Files for Chapter 11
CW has learned that Astaris has dropped plans to build a 100,000-m.t./year purified wet phosphoric acid
(PWA) plant at Pasadena, TX, adjacent to Agrifos (New York) phosphate fertilizer plant (CW, April 11, p.
9). Agrifos has filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
ofTexas; a hearing was scheduled for July 30. Astaris has an 80,000-m.t./year PWA plant at Soda
Springs, ID and has been looking to build additional PWA capacity to replace high-cost elemental
phosphorus technology (CW, May 9, p. 9). The company says it is "exploring a number of options" as
alternatives to the Pasadena project.
* E&C Firms Post Mixed Results
Halliburton's E&C group Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) reported second-quarter operating profits down
16.6%, to $25 million, on revenues down 15.4%, to $1.1 billion. The company says operating margins
remained "relatively consistent," however, and it is "encouraged" by increasing bid and proposal activity.
Jacobs Engineering posted earnings for its fiscal third quarter, ended June 30, up 17.8%, to $22.5 million,
on sales up 11 %, to $1 billion. The Shaw Group's process industries unit, which includes Stone &
Webster, posted thirdquarter sales ended May 31 down 9.2%, to $86.4 million. It does not break out
earnings for the unit.
* Senate Approves Mexican Truck Rubs

The Senate last week passed strict safety standards for Mexican trucks operating on U.S. roads. Many Mexican carriers also will not be able to immediately comply with the standards, adding further delays to trade between the U.S. and Mexico, says one businessman. The White House and Mexican diplomats had tried to kill the measure, saying it would lead to strained relations between the two countries.
* ACC Inks Research Funding Partnership

ACC and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS; Research Triangle Park, NC), a division of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), have finalized a jointly funded, $4-million research program formed in June (CW July 4/11, p. 36). The program, which is linked to ACC's long-range research initiative, will provide grant money for general research on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of chemicals.
* Senate Clears Graham for OMB Post

The Senate has voted 61-37 to approve President Bushs nomination of John Graham as director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The position oversees the development of EPA and other regulations involving health and environmental issues. Graham, who heads the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis (Boston), was opposed by many Democrats and environmental groups.
* East Rocks Ciba Plant

An explosion and fire ripped through a multipurpose production plant at Ciba Specialty Chemicals' Schweizerhalle, Switzerland site on July 26. Ciba reports no injuries to employees, but it says that damage to the plant, which will likely be offstream for several months, amounts to "millions of Swiss francs." An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way. The plant makes photo-initiators and light stabilizers for coatings and plastics.
* Oxon Italia Buys Degussa's Cyanics

Fine chemicals and agchem intermediates producer Oxon Italia (Pero, Italy) has acquired Degussa's cyanics business. The operation consists of plants that produce cyanotic chloride and sodium dicyanamide at Munchmunster, Germany, and has sales of about (euro)23 million($20 million)/year. Degussa will continue to operate the plants on behalf of Oxon, which has formed a new company, Skyanide Chemicals, to market the plants' output. Selling the cyanics business was a condition of the  European Commissions approval of last year's merger between Veba and Viag that created E.On (CW, June 28, 2000, p. 6. Degussa was created from the fusion of Degussa-Huls and SKW the respective chemical businesses of Veba and Viag. The cyanics business was a subsidiary of SKW
* Brussels Slaps Dumping Duties on Urea

The European Commission has imposed provisional antidumping duties on imports of urea from Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania, and the Ukraine. Duties range from 3.8%-21%. The commission began an investigation last October into urea imports from those countries, as well as from Egypt and Poland, following a complaint by the  European Fertiliser Manufacturers Association.

* Ercros, Tessenderlo Form Sales JV

Ercros (Barcelona) and Tessenderlo Group (Brussels) plan to form a 50-50 joint venture to market potassium sulfate and other fertilizers in Spain and Portugal. The as yet unnamed company will be based in Madrid.
* Air Liquide, Linda Win Services Contract

The European Nuclear Research Center (CERN; Geneva) has awarded a consortium of Air Liquide, Linda, and Servo (Bonn, Germany) a four-year contract to maintain all of CERNs helium cryogenic units and provide cryogenic magnet test support. The contract is valued at (euro)13 million ($11 million).
Brussels Proposes Strict Rules for GMOs

The European Commission has proposed strict rules for authorizing genetically modified organisms (GMO) and labelling food that contains GM ingredients. The proposals include a centralized  European Union (EU) approval process for GMOs, a system that would monitor GMOs at each stage of the food production chain, and the labelling of all foods containing, or derived from, GMOs. They require approval from EU member governments and the  European Parliament and should come into force by 2003, the commission says. The proposals are designed to end an EU moratorium on new approvals of GM crops that began in 1998. The announcement threatens to spark a trade dispute between the EU and the U.S., which says that the proposals are unscientific and unjustified. The  commission made one concession to U.S. biotech companies, however: EU imports of food that by accident contain GM ingredients, including GMOs not approved in the EU, would be exempt from the labelling laws if GM content is less than 1 %. Provisional EU rules currently require labeling of all food containing more than 1% GM ingredients.
Montedison Accepts Italenergia's Increased Bid

Montedison accepted a takeover bid from Italenergia last week, after Italenergia raised its offer a second time, to (euro)3.16($2.75)/share. It had previously increased its bid from (euro)2.82/share to (euro)3.07/share (CW, July 25, p. 18). The latest offer, which is subject to European Commission approval, values the 47% that Italenergia does not own in Montedison at about (euro)5.5 billion. Italenergia is a consortium in which Fiat owns 39% and Electricite de France has 18%. Italenergia is mainly interested in Edison, the electricity subsidiary of Montedison, and, sources say, it would break up the rest of the company, including Montedison's Ausimont chemicals subsidiary; its Antibioticos drugs business; and its Tecnimont engineering subsidiary Montedison opened negotiations to sell Ausimont, which produces fluorochemicals and peroxides, to Solvay, before Montedison accepted Italenergia's bid. Montedison also reportedly contacted DuPont and Daikin about the sale of Ausimont.
Second-Quarter Profits Gloomy for  European Companies

Several leading  European companies reported lower second-quarter and first-half earnings, citing the economic slowdown and high raw materials prices. DSM posted a 37% decrease in second-quarter operating profits, to (euro)150 million ($130 million), on sales up 5%, to (euro)2.1 billion. Rhodia posted a
28% decrease in first-half operating profits, to (euro)190 million, on sales up 12%, to (euro)3.9 billion. Rhodia says it will cut capital spending by 20% in 2002, compared with 2000, and cut corporate expenses by 30% in 2003, compared with 2001, to help improve profitability. Merck KGaA reported a 34% rise in second-quarter operating profits, to (euro)249 million, on sales up 16%, to (euro)1.9 billion. EVC International reported a first-half operating loss of (euro)16 million, compared with a (euro)5-million profit
a year earlier, on sales down 6%, to (euro)569 million. UCB posted a 21% increase in first-half net profits, to (euro)170 million, on sales up 19%, at (euro)1.3 billion.
Henkel's Cognis Divestment Hits Trouble

Henkel's negotiations to sell its Cognis chemical business to private equity capital company Schroder Ventures have hit a last-minute hitch, says a report in The Financial Times Deutschland. Schroders is concerned that unspecified budgetary targets set by Cognis are unrealistic, and may demand that Henkel lower the sale price, the report says. Schroders had been expected to pay (euro)2.3 billion-(euro)2.5 billion ($1.9 billion-$2.1 billion) for Cognis-- well below the $3 billion Henkel initially hoped for (CW July
4/11, p. 10). Henkel could resume negotiations to sell Cognis to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (New York), if talks with Schroders fall through, the report adds. Henkel says negotiations with Schroders "are proceeding as planned."
ICI Cuts Jobs at National Starch

ICI plans to shed 200 jobs in its National Starch and Chemical adhesives and sealants subsidiary, 2% of the business's workforce, by year-end. ICI cut 1,000 jobs in the first half of this year, 400 of which were in National Starch. ICI posted a 7% decrease in secondquarter pretax profits, to 125 million ($175 million), on

sales up 4%, to 1.7 billion. ICI has delayed the sale of its 30% stake in Huntsman International to its partner, Huntsman. Huntsman is working to raise funds for the deal (p. 7).
